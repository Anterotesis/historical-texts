            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The knowledge therof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, in the right vnderſtanding of theſe two thinges, namely of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell.</hi> Wheras the Law therefore ſetteth foorth vnto vs the Iuſtice of God, and is ſet before vs, that wee may playnely ſée therein, as it were in a glaſſe, both what God requireth of vs, and alſo how weake, and vnable wée bée to fulfill the ſame, that wee ſeeinge our owne, both deformitie, and imbecillity, ſhould ſeeke for a cleanſer, and a ſtronger, that may hath cleanſe vs, and fulfill it for vs: and by this meanes to bée ledde to the Goſpell, which ſetteth foorth the ſame vnto vs: here, the firſt ſorte, hauinge beene trayned vp, and noozeled in another manner of doctrine, concerning the Lawe and the Goſpell, and hauinge not learned, the true endes, and right vſes of them, for the which they were geuen: are ſo obſtinately bente agaynſt this true knowledge of the right way, which is in them conteined: that they will ſuffer themſelues by no meanes, to bee brought, once to enter their foote into it. The ſeconde ſorte of people, are méere <hi>Athaeiſtes,</hi> and ſuch as hauinge beene alwayes full fed like <hi>Epicures,</hi> and thorowly pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered vp, with all kindes of worldly volupteouſnes, and pleaſures of the fleſh: are ſo lulled a ſleape in them, by

the ſubtilty of the Deuill, who holdeth them faſt ſnarled: that they haue no leaſure, once to bethinke themſelues, nor to regarde, eyther what <hi>GOD</hi> is, or his <hi>Lawe,</hi> and <hi>Goſpell,</hi> neyther yet, what nor where they themſelues bée, nor how they came, or for what cauſe they are placed in the worlde, nor how they ſhall departe foorth of it, nor what ſhall become of them after this lyfe, and ſo neyther paſſe for Heauen, or Hell, <hi>GOD,</hi> or the Deuill: and therefore, no woonder, though they care not, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiringe, and much leſſe for walkinge in this way: bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as they ſuppoſe themſelues, (in ſuch a way, as there neyther is, nor can bée any better. The thirde ſorte, which doo finde it, and doo enter, and walke into it, and yet are oftentimes ſtayed, and hyndered in their courſe: are euen the moſt holyeſt in this lyfe, and the very electe of God: who hauing entred into it, and purpoſing with a good Conſcience to walke forwarde in the ſame: are notwithſtandinge oftentimes, through the malice of the Deuill, (continually warring againſt them, and ſéeking to plucke them foorth of that way, into the bypathe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction with him, and through the frailty of their own fleſh, and the continuall allurementes, and baytes of the world, are oftentimes ſo drawne aſide, and hindered, yea ſo bewitched, and dazeled: that it oftentimes ſéemeth vnto them themſelues: that they néede not ſo earneſtly, and ſo dilligently regard, to continue ſtill their walking in the ſame. Hereof it commeth to paſſe, that, (by the permiſſion of God) they béeing eyther drawne backe, or ſtayed from going forward, or pluckt for a ſeaſon beſide the way: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heynous, and horrible offences, are by them commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: which aduauntage (as long as they héedefully kept themſelues, within the limittes of the right way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation) the Deuil could not haue of them.

him was this: <hi>By rulinge himſelfe according to the worde of GOD,</hi> was then no doubt, both mindefull of this way, and diligently troade, and walked in the ſame: but, beeing a litle ſtayed therin, hée was drawne aſide, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the moſt horrible offence of Murther, and Adultrie: but God hauing compaſſion vpon him, and not ſuffering him, vtterly to looſe the right way of his Saluation: ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice</hi> togeather, and ſending them vnto him, by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> did both mercifully ſet him in the right way agayne (after hée had repentauntly acknowledged his declining from the ſame) and alſo ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal, iuſtly ſcourged him for his wandring &amp; digreſſion. The lyke may bée found of <hi>Ezechias, Manaſſes, Peter,</hi> and diuerſe others: which (in reading of the holy Scriptures) are almoſt euery where to bee found, and here, for expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of tediouſneſſe, are omitted. So that albeit, the godly man, or woman, bée ſometimes hindred in the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this courſe, from goinge forward, or be plucked backewarde, or ſéemeth (as it were) ſet quite beſide the way, wherby (as the examples aboue recited do declare) many horrible offences, and wicked actes, pleaſant to the Deuill, are by them committed: yet, this hope they haue lefte them: that God will not ſuffer them (with the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate wicked, &amp; careleſſe vngodly,) to periſh vtterly from the right way, but that hée will reatch forth his mercifull hand of direction vnto them: which (they hartily repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, and taking holde of) will ſet them in the ſtreyght, and right way agayne: wherin if they ſhall perſeauere, and continue vnto the ende: they ſhalbe ſure (as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe hath promiſed) to bée vndoubtedly ſaued.

of <hi>IESVS CHRISTE,</hi> how, and in what manner they bée affected, to the knowledge of this way of eternall lyfe, and Saluation. Whereof, ſome, (by meanes of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer falſe receiued opinion déepely rooted in them) bée ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, and wilfully will not learne it: ſome, are negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gente and careleſſe, that they paſſe not for it: the thirde ſorte yet imbracing it, and reioyſing to walke in it: are notwithſtanding (through diuerſe, and infinite impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and hinderaunces) either ſtayed, or plucked back, or aſide from it: and yet notwithſtanding, by the mercy of God, are called backe againe by earneſt repentaunce, and are agayne ſet therin: wherein they walke here vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, and continue their courſe in the ſame vnto the ende, depart this life in walkinge in the ſame, and at the ende of this way, enter into the Citie of eternal reſt, and ſaluation. The true doctrine wherof, béeing in this litle Treatiſe both learnedly, and alſo clearely, &amp; plainly ſet foorth, by this godly learned man, béeing ſuch a one, as by the iudgement, and opinion of diuerſe of the beſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of this our time, hath deſerued, not the leaſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacion, of the Church of Chriſt: when I had peruſed, and conferred with my fréend, I thought very méete, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, to conuert into our vulgare ſpéeche, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, &amp; comfortable inſtruction of all thoſe, to whom it ſhall pleaſe God, to geue eyes to ſée, eares to heare, hearts to conceiue, and féete to walke aright, in the ready way to lyfe, therin ſet downe, and deliuered: as in the diligente reading, and meditating of the ſame, ſhall (I hope) to the comfort &amp; ſound inſtruction of the Chriſtian Conſcience, more playnely appeare. For, as the Doctrine therein conteyned, is, both neceſſary (and as touchinge the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce therof) is ſuch, that the true Chriſtian man, or woman, may not bée without the knowledge, and practiſe therof, in this life, if they deſire to attayne to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and vnderſtanding of their ſaluation in the lyfe to
<pb facs="tcp:4151:7"/>
come: ſo is it (aſmuch as is requiſite therunto) both pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, very playnely, and alſo familyarly, aſwell in plain ſpéech as eaſy Methode, ſet downe, and deliuered: &amp; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with good aduiſement, and deliberation handled, and diuulged. Touching the Author himſelfe, it is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne amongeſt the learned, what hée is: as béeinge ſuch a one, which hath not the loweſt roome, amongſt the beſt, and moſte approoued Chriſtian writers of this our age: brought vp from his infancy, in the ſtudies, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of learning, and godlyneſſe, notably qualified, and furniſhed aſwell with liberall artes, and languages: as principally in the ſtudy, &amp; profeſſion of Diuinitie: which profeſſion hée hath woorthely and diligently executed (as by his owne teſtimony ſet downe in his Epiſtle before this booke, is to bée ſéene) by the ſpace, and continuance of thyrtie yeares: béeinge therunto called, by the Kinge of <hi>Denmarcke,</hi> to ſupply the place of his publique reader, and profeſſour of <hi>Diuinitic,</hi> in his vniuerſitie of <hi>Hafnia,</hi> where with great fame (as I heare) hee at this day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth. Touching the perticuler matters, conteyned, and handled in the booke, ther are ſuch (as I haue already ſayd, and in the diligente peruſinge therof ſhalbe better perceiued) that the knowledge of them in a Chriſtian, may not bée wanting. And I doubt not but the Chriſtian reader (if hée haue any deſire to aſpire to the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt) hauing a while buſied himſelfe therin: ſhall freely in his owne conſcience confeſſe, as much as I haue héere ſpoken. For, if hée deſire (in ſhort ſumme, and bréefely, and yet ſufficiently) the perfecte, and right vnderſtanding of the Law of God, what it is, how many, and what the true vſes therof bée, to what end it is geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto men: alſo, what the Goſpell is, and to what ende it is geuen, what wée muſt neceſſarily beléeue of Chriſt, (as it is conſonant to our common fayth:) How hée is our <hi>Mediatour, Redeemer,</hi> and Sanctifier: by what meanes
<pb facs="tcp:4151:7"/>
hée declareth and ſetteth foorth his benefites vnto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, what his benefits be toward vs: what is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered &amp; learned of the Sacraments, aſwel of Baptiſme, as of the Supper of the Lorde: beſides diuerſe other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary doctrines, of the right woorſhippinge, and ſeruice of God, of prayer, and diuerſe other places which (as I haue ſayd) in the diligent peruſing of the ſame, ſhall more euidently appeare, to the Chriſtian reader. If hee deſire (I ſay) to bee inſtructed, exhorted, or comforted, in theſe thinges, hee may here finde them, both ſoundly, &amp; plainly expounded. All which poinctes, being by other moſt god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; learned paſtoures of the Church of Chriſte, notably, and pithily in theſe latter times ſet abroade vnto the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of the worlde, to no ſmall benefit of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Chriſt: yet by reaſon of their buckling with the aduerſaries of the trueth, in refelling their corruptions, and cauilling obiections, they were forced, to write with greater ſtile of woordes, and more Schoolelyke, whereby their woorkes became more conuenient (in ſome poincts) for ſtudentes in Diuinitie, then for the common peoples perceauerance, and Capacitie. Which things I ſpeake, not that I would dehorte any from the reading, and dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent exerciſinge of them: yea I doo rather moſt hartely exhorte them therunto: but this I ſay, to the ende, to take away the offence, which (as I my ſelfe haue heard (ſome haue taken (though vndeſeruedly) when they perceyue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſome places (for the cauſes afore recyted) to write eyther ſomewhat longer then they thinke méete, or ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more artificially then they doo conceyue. Which offence, (not geuen, but vniuſtly taken,) they ſhould eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let fall, if they woulde conſider the cauſes aforeſayde, which violently drew thoſe learned men, and by an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitable neceſſity, enforced them ſo to doo. From which tediouſneſſe, (if they will needes ſo accompte it) they
<pb facs="tcp:4151:8"/>
are in this ſmall treatiſe delyuered: where ſo ſundry great occaſions were not geuen to the Author: For as hée aunſwereth here but to few obiections, ſo, writinge his booke for the common ſort, hée frameth his anſweres and ſolutions, bothe ſhorte, and eaſie. Which woorke (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſundry other learned, and fruictfull laboures written of Diuinitie, by him, which are extant, and ſet abroade in the Latin tongue:) the ſayde Author wrote, and deliuered abroad, at the firſt, in the <hi>Danish language,</hi> for the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſolation of the people of that nation, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for ſuch of them, as could not gather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of godlyneſſe, foorth of other languages, wherein it was written: which béeing ſo written, and ſet abroad, it was, by diuerſe learned men of the ſame Region concluded vpon, for the woorthyneſſe thereof, to bée turned into the Latin ſpéeche, to the ende, that other faithfull heades, and teachers of the Church of Chriſt, ſéeing theſame, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing it to bée, both ſound, and comfortable, might the ſooner conuerte, or cauſe the ſame to bée conuerted, into their owne ſeuerall languages: and commend the ſame, to thoſe porcions of the Church, and flock of Chriſt which are to their ſeuerall charges committed.</p>
            <p>Which Treatiſe béeing now at the laſt, conuerted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our common language, by mée, for the cauſes aboue rehearſed: I here dedicate, and preſent (Right worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) vnto you both: beſéeching you to accept the ſame, as an argument, and teſtimony of that well willing affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which (by ſundry your gentleneſſes exhibited, and ſhewed) you haue, deſeruedly, rayſed vp in mee. And albeit, I can not iuſtly auouche it, to bée any recompence for any parte of the ſame: neither yet doo proffer it to that ende: yet rather then I would incurre the compaſſe of that ſentence of the <hi>Philoſopher, Perit quod facis ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: <hi>That is loſte which is doone to an vnthankefull perſon:</hi>

For, as this whole world is momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie, and ſhall paſſe away: ſo in like manner the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof, with how ſoeuer beautiful and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent titles they be named: Yet (to be all fleeting &amp; falling away) dayly experience may ſhew and teache vs: vnleſſe we would ſuffer our ſelues to be blinded, or (as it were) to be bewitched of the ſame. But, to knowe God <hi>(Aright)</hi> and (hauing gotten the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him) to worſhip him aright, according to his will, reuealed in his word: that continueth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and leadeth man (from the vnſtedfaſtnes of this vnconſtant world) the right way to eternall life and ſaluation. Therefore in Iohn, Chriſt ſaith:<note place="margin">Iohn. 17, verſe. 3,</note> 
               <hi>This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb facs="tcp:4151:10"/>
life, to knowe thee to be the onely true God: and Ieſus Chriſt whome thou haſte ſent.</hi> And in another place: <hi>What doth it profit a man to gaine the whole worlde, and looſe his owne ſoule?</hi> Therefore Dauid iudgeth aright, in Pſal. 84.<note place="margin">Pſal. 84.</note> where he ſaithe <hi>One day in thy courts, is better than a thouſand: I had rather bee <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> doore keeper in the houſe of my God, than to dwel in the tents of vngodlyneſse. For the Lord God is a light and defence, the Lord wil giue grace and glorie: and no good thing will he withholde from them, which walke in innocencie.</hi> In theſe wordes, Dauid putteth a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwene thoſe, which are without the church, and thoſe (whiche beeing within the Church of CHRISTE) haue the true vnderſtanding of the BEEING and VVILL of God.</p>
            <p>This difference, he placeth in fiue thinges, moſte ſpecially to bee remembred: by the contraries of which, both doe appeare the more euident: namely, bothe how great, the honour, and high bleſſed eſtate of the children of GOD is: and contrarywiſe, how great the miſerie and calamitie is, euen of the moſte mightie of this world, which be not citizens of the Church of God.</p>
            <p>The firſt good thing, and commoditie of the children of God, or of the Church is, <hi>That God himſelfe is in her as a moſte lightſome Sun.</hi> For, euen as from this viſible Sunne, there commeth vnto the worlde, <hi>Light, Heate,</hi> and <hi>Shining beames,</hi> wherby al things are quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and cheriſhed: ſo, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, (which is the Sun in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible) there cometh vnto the Church, <hi>Light,</hi> (that is to ſay) cleere knowledge of GOD: there commeth <hi>Heate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1, Cor. 13.</note> that is, affections burning with Faith, Hope, and Loue: and ſhining beames, which are the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde
<pb facs="tcp:4151:10"/>
conſolations, whereby the faithfull ſoule is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, cheriſhed, and comforted. This Sunne, as it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to ſuch as feare God: ſo it ſetteth to the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, the wicked lyuer, and the careleſſe. It is therfore (with great diligence) to be taken heede of: that the godlie (through a certaine ſluggiſhnes of their owne, in hearing, or reading the word of God, wherin this Sunne brightly ſhineth) doe not ſuffer this Sunne to be, either darkened, or hidden from them. For, as this viſible Sunne, if it ſhall ſeeme to a ſicke body in his dreame, to be hid, or darkened, there is daunger (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> affirmeth) of moſte certaine death, to the ſicke body, to be at hand; ſo, if our <hi>Sunne Chriſte</hi> be darkened vnto vs (his doctrine beeing either abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, or obſcured) not onely darcknes hangeth ouer vs, but alſo the death of the ſoule, and moſte aſſured eternall condemnation.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we may heereby perceiue, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of them, as many as are deſtitute of this <hi>Sunne the worde of</hi> GOD. For, they beeing blinde, doe, bothe grope in the darkneſſe of ignorance: and beeing ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt of God, are ſtricken with dreadfull amaſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of minde, when ſinne ſheweth foorth it ſelfe in their conſciences. And albeit, that Conſcience ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in many, to be (as it were with an hot yron) feared, as though it were voyd of all feeling of ſinne: yet notwithſtanding it will at ſometime be wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp, at the leaſt in the extreame agonie of death, and will driue the miſerable ſoule into deſperation: than the whiche thing, nothing may happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to manne, either more heauy, or more bytter: as hauing leather, that hee had neuer beene created
<pb facs="tcp:4151:11"/>
and brought vnto light.</p>
            <p>The ſecond good thing, or commoditie of them which knowe the <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of GOD, and yeelde themſelues obedient to the ſame, is: that God is a defence, or ſheeld vnto them, wherwith they are compaſſed, defended, and ſheelded, againſt the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darckneſſe. Of this ſheeld ſpeaketh Dauid in Pſal. 5.<note place="margin">Pſal. 5.</note> when he ſaith: <hi>All they which hope in thee shall reioyce, they shall euer be giuing thanks, and thou shalt dwell in them: all they which loue thy name, shall reioyce in thee. For thou Lord shalt bleſse the righteous, and with thy fauourable kindeneſse, shalt thou compaſse vs as with a sheelde.</hi> Item Pſal. 18.<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.</note> 
               <hi>And thou haſte giuen me the defence or sheelde of thy ſaluation, and thy right hand doth vpholde me.</hi> In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is the good pleaſure of God, that he wil not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (with the crowne of his fauourable kindeneſſe) compaſſe his about: but alſo, will haue them to bee happie, with perpetuall bleſſedneſſe. Paule, when he writeth to the Epheſians, thus: <hi>(Take vnto you the sheeld of Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1, Tim. 1.</note> 
               <hi>wherewith ye may quench all the fiery dartes of the wicked:)</hi> Signifying, that we are the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> compaſſed about with the ſheeld of faith, when we fight a good fight, holdeing a ſtedfaſt beleefe of the doctrine, with a ſure confidence of mercy, &amp; a good conſcience. This <hi>sheelde,</hi> foraſmuch as the enemies of God doe want: what (I pray ye) can be more miſerable then they? For in aſmuch as they be naked and vnarmed, they are not able to reſiſt the diuel the prince of darkenes: but he obteineth ful dominion in them, &amp; throweth them headlong out of one wickednes into an other, vntill he haue brought them to vtter deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The third good thing or commoditie, which the
<pb facs="tcp:4151:11"/>
godly haue by the healthfull knowledge, and feare of the true God: is called of Dauid <hi>Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Grace,</hi> is the fauour of God, forgiuing ſinne to the beleeuers, for the death of his ſonne,<note place="margin">What this grace is.</note> and garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing them with a moſt pure garment, which is, <hi>The obedience or righteouſneſſe of Chriſte:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Roma. 5.</note> VVhereby they are in ſuch wiſe reputed righteous in the ſight of God, as if they them ſelues had fulfilled the lawe. But they which are out of the congregation, are voide of this grace of ſaluation: and doe remaine vnder ſinne, the wrath of God, and eternall damnation, for their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</p>
            <p>The fourth commoditie which they (that know and feare God) doe inioy: is called of Dauid, <hi>Glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What this glory is, and wherein it conſiſteth.</note> This <hi>Glory</hi> is, <hi>The adoption</hi> of the adopted ſonnes of GOD: <hi>The inhabiting</hi> of the holy ghoſte, and the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary <hi>Poſſeſsion</hi> of eternall bleſſedneſſe, by Ieſus Chriſte. But contrarywiſe, they whiche doe not knowe God, are the bondſlaues, and dwelling places of the diuell, are mooued by his ſpirit, and to eternall ignominie, are they reſerued.</p>
            <p>The fifth good thing or commoditie, which God (by the <hi>Pſalmiſt)</hi> promiſeth vnto the godly, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in theſe wordes: <hi>He will withholde no good thing from them which walke in innocencie.</hi> O, how great is this promiſe? It is all one as if he ſhould ſay: They which walke in innocencie, (that is to ſay) they which by faith doe yeelde obedience vnto God, ſhall be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly indewed with all good thinges: ſo, that they may perpetually inioy them, and ſhall neuer ſtand in feare of any euill to come vnto them. And albeit, that all the Children of God, ſhal in this world ſuffer
<pb facs="tcp:4151:12"/>
perſecution: yet notwithſtanding they are certaine of the good things promiſed, which heere they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by hope, and in the life to come, ſhall (without all impediment) for euer poſſeſſe. But contrarywiſe, they (which haue neither learned to knowe God by his worde, neither yet to feare him according to his will: vnto them ignominies, ſorowes, and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhall neuer be wanting: but vnto the Diuell, (whome they haue ſerued) they ſhall be thrall and ſubiect for euer.</p>
            <p>Heereby now euery one may eaſely vnderſtand that to be moſte true which I propounded in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, namely: <hi>That of all things which are in the world there is nothing either more better or more precious, neither yet more profitable, than rightly to know the</hi> ESSENCE <hi>and</hi> WIL <hi>of God: and that this knowledge is drawne forth of the word of God, in the which word, he hath opened bothe him ſelf and his wil.</hi> But leaſt any man ſhould ſuffer himſelfe to be ſeduced by the deuill &amp; his members: it is to bee knowne, that the worde of GOD is not any other where to be ſought, than in the writinges of <hi>Moſes</hi> the <hi>Prophetes,</hi> the <hi>Euangeliſtes</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> whiche are beautified with the teſtimonie of the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent God, which is the eternall veritie, and can not lye,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> as Paule ſpeaketh. But ſome may obiect, or, at the leaſt thinke with himſelfe in his heart, (as many doe, although they expreſſe it not by their mouth) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner: If wee were certaine, that that worde were in very deede, the worde of God him ſelf, doutleſſe, it were of all things farre the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſeſt: but, the world, for a great parte therof, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame, and fewe there be which imbrace it,
<pb facs="tcp:4151:12"/>
&amp; feweſt of thoſe which liue according to the ſame: yea, there be alſo very many, which verely with their mouth confeſſe the ſame to be the word of God, but yet by their liues and manners (contrary to the ſame worde, whereof they doe ſo commonly boaſt) they deny the ſame. This (without all dout) is that temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which the Diuell breathed into our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, whereby he alſo ſeduced them, neither doth he at this day ceaſſe with vnwearied ſtudy, by this his olde deceitfull ſubtiltie, to circumuent and deſtroy very many. It is therefore cheefely neceſſary for all Chriſtians, to haue in a readineſſe; (touching the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the word of God) firme arguments &amp; ſure demonſtrations, which (in the olde and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) are euery where to be found.</p>
            <p>There be in generall two kindes of teſtimonies, by which it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced, that the doctrine of the church in the bookes of the Prophets and Apoſtles deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: is verely proceeded and inſpired of GOD him ſelfe. Of theſe, the firſt is, <hi>An outwarde teſtimonie:</hi> but the other is <hi>Inwarde</hi> in the heartes of eche of the godly.</p>
            <p>I call that the <hi>Outwarde Teſtimonie, which runneth into the ſences of men, that it may ſend to the minde,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What the out warde teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie is.</note> 
               <hi>the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Heauenly veritie.</hi> Of this, there be ſix partes, of which partes, albeit euery one by it ſelfe, might ſuffice, to euince the infallible certitude of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Church: yet not withſtanding it pleaſed the moſte mercifull God, by ſo many meanes to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our infirmitie.</p>
            <p>The firſte parte therefore, of the <hi>Outwarde teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie is, The Diuine manifeſtation,</hi> by the whiche God him ſelfe, (proceeding from his ſecret ſeat) hath,

(with his owne voyce) reuealed his wil, touching the doctrine of the Lawe and the Goſpell. And, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that God hath often, and at diuerſe times mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted himſelf, repeating with other, &amp; other words, the ſelfe ſame doctrine: we notwithſtanding, wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite certaine of the more ſelected appearings of God.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all therefore, hee appeared to <hi>Adam</hi> after the fall, and deliuered firſt with his owne voyce, the doctrine of the <hi>Lawe</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell.</hi> For in that that he layd puniſhments vpon our firſt parentes, for their rebellion (in perpetuall teſtimonie of his anger againſt ſinners) it perteineth to the lawe: and in that that he promiſed:<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> 
               <hi>The ſeede of the woman, to crush the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head,</hi> it is the voyce of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, God appeared vnto <hi>Noah,</hi> and by a wounderful deede confirmed bothe the doctrine of the law &amp; the Goſpel. For, when with the flood, he deſtroyed the vnrepentant: he executed the ſentence of his lawe: but when he deliuered <hi>Noah</hi> beleeuing his word, &amp; (by faith) beeing obedient vnto him, he eſtabliſhed a teſtimonie of the promiſe of his grace reſerued, which is of the <hi>Goſpell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the flood, GOD appeered vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> ten times, to <hi>Iſaach</hi> his ſonne twiſe: and to his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſeuen times. In which app<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ritions, was propounded not diuers, but one, and the ſame doctrine alwayes, of the <hi>Seede</hi> of the woman, (that is to ſay) of <hi>Chriſte Ieſus our Sauiour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After theſe thinges, God appeered to <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> repeating bothe the doctrine of the lawe and the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and with wonderfull doings confirming the ſame. For the iuſt plague &amp; calamitie of <hi>Pharao,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:4151:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and his miniſters, is to be referred to the Lawe: but, that glorious deliuerance of the people, with <hi>Moſes,</hi> foorth of that <hi>Aegypticall</hi> houſe of ſeruitude: is to bee referred to the Goſpell. All which things are, figures of the laſt Iudgement, wherein God will condemne the Diuell, with all his traine: and receiue to himſelf, into euerlaſting Tabernacles, as many, as with a true, and liuely faith, ſhall conſtantly cleaue vnto Chriſte.</p>
            <p>In the new Teſtament alſo, the ſame GOD hath ſounded his word from Heauen, and hath commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto vs Chriſte the teacher, with his owne mouth, ſaying; <hi>This is my beloued ſonne, in whom I am well pleaſed: heare him.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay: <hi>In time paſte,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> I promiſed the <hi>Seede</hi> of the woman to cruſh the head of the ſerpent, &amp; to repaire againe my image in man, (the curſſe of the Lawe beeing taken away) beholde, he is heere preſent, heare ye him, which hartely loue life, and ſaluation: for in him am I wel pleaſed (that is to ſay) by this my ſonne, am I reconciled to the world, that is, to all them, which (by faith) ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him. Let vs oppoſe all theſe apparitions, with many others (in which one, and the ſame doctrine is alwayes repeated) againſt the Deuill, and all wicked Sophiſters, <hi>Mahometiſtes,</hi> vnbeleeuing Iewes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane nations: and to conclude, againſt our owne prudence, and carnall wiſdome, aſcrybing vnto God alone, the praiſe of the veritie.</p>
            <p>The ſecond parte of the <hi>Outwarde teſtimonie</hi> is, <hi>The varitie of miracles,</hi> (that is to ſay) of the peculiare, and extraordinarie workes of God, which can not bee doone, by any creature. All theſe thinges hath God
<pb facs="tcp:4151:14"/>
done, that he might help our imbecillitie: that when theſe outwarde miracles ſhould preſent themſelues to our eyes, we ſhould decree in our minde, that to be the doctrine of God, which (with ſuch manner of woorkes,) as with ſeales is confirmed.</p>
            <p>And, albeit that theſe miracles (from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the worlde, foorth vntill the times of the <hi>Apoſtles)</hi> be innumerable: yet notwithſtanding the ſcope, and end of them all, is one: namely, that they might confirme the trueth of God, (that is to ſay) the doctrine of the Lawe, and the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>In the olde Teſtament are found miracles done be fore the flood, in the flood, and after the flood. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and after the gooing out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in the wilderneſſe, by the ſpace of 40. yeeres. In like manner, in the time of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> of the <hi>Kings,</hi> of the Captiuitie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and of the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the comming of Chriſte: all which, did ſeale the ſame doctrine, beeing oftentimes repeated.</p>
            <p>The miracles alſo, of the new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wrought by Chriſte, are no leſſe wounderfull: concerning which, he ſaith to the Iewes: <hi>If ye beleeue not mee, beleeue my woorkes.</hi> Cheefly this is woorthy to be conſidered, that Chriſte the third day roſe again from death, and afterwarde, in the beholding of fiue hundred bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, did aſcend viſibly into heauen: and ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed the firſt promiſe made vnto <hi>Adam.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> All theſe, yea or one of theſe miracles might be ſufficient for vs, that we ſhould beleeue the word of God: but it ſo ſeemed good vnto God, by the varietie of theſe, to ſuſtaine our infirmitie.</p>
            <p>The third parte of the Outwarde teſtimonie, is
<pb facs="tcp:4151:14"/>
               <hi>The moſte certaine fulfilling,</hi> (or accompliſhment) <hi>of the Prophets:</hi> which witneſſeth, that God himſelfe ſpake, by the mouth of his miniſters. For, we haue an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable foundation of our faith, when (to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayings concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or <hi>Chriſte,</hi> prophecied by <hi>Moſes, Dauid, Daniell,</hi> and other <hi>Prophets)</hi> we ſee the Hiſtory <hi>Euangelicall,</hi> to aunſwere. <hi>The ſtedfaſtneſse of faith</hi> (ſaith Auguſtine) <hi>conſiſteth in this: that all thinges which came to paſse in Chriſte, were tolde of before.</hi> Heereof our faith concludeth on this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He alone, without all doubt, is the true, and onely Meſſias and Sauiour of the worlde, in whome alone doe meete together whatſoeuer hath beene foretolde, touching the Meſſias, by Moſes, and all others the Prophets of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Ieſus, the ſonne of Mary alone, mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth together, whatſoeuer hath beene (touching the Meſſias) foretolde by Moſes, and all the rest of the Prophets of God:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore: Ieſus alone, the ſonne of the virgin Mary, is, (without al doubt) the Sole, true, and only Meſſias, and Sauiour of the worlde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon this foundation, the Apoſtles of Chriſte, <hi>Peeter</hi> and <hi>Paule, builded the faith of the Gentiles: whiche would neuer haue beleeued</hi> in Chriſte, vnleſſe they had ſhewed them, this agreemente of the foreſayinges, and their fulfillinges in Chriſte. Touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb facs="tcp:4151:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
let the 17. <hi>Act:</hi> and 2. <hi>Peter.</hi> 1. bee reade.</p>
            <p>In like manner alſo, the foretellings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets (touching the moſte greeuous perſecutions of the Church, which at this day, we finde that Romiſh <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to fulfil) are extant. Heere, let vs comforte and lifte vpp our ſelues againſt the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Pope, &amp; the raging of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> when we confer the euent, with the Prophecies ſhewed long time before. Of the tyrannie of the Roomiſh Biſhop, and <hi>Mahomet: Ieremie,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> foreſhewed: when we therefore doe ſee theſe things to haue come to paſſe, what letteth, that we ſhould not thorowly perſwade our ſelues, that thoſe thinges ſhall come to paſſe, which are foretolde of the <hi>Aduent,</hi> or comming of the kingdome of IESVS CHRISTE, wherein, namely in the laſt day, he will appeere, and will raiſe vp all people from death, thoſe whiche haue doone good, to the Reſurrection of life: but thoſe which haue done euil, vnto the Reſurrection of damnation, as the whole ſacred Scripture, touching this matter, doth euery where moſte plentifully teach vs.</p>
            <p>The fourth parte of the Outwarde teſtimonie, is, the conſent of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Prophetes Chriſte,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and of the whole vniuerſall Church, in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and worſhipping of God. For, all theſe, with one vniforme agreement, haue holden the ſame doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>The Lawe,</hi> and <hi>The Goſpell,</hi> and the ſame manner of worſhipping God. Neither hath the diuerſitie of ceremonies (which for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of times, haue beene changed) troubled this agreement, one, &amp; the ſame foundation of the true and althfehull doctrine, euery where remaining. But if this doctrine had not
<pb facs="tcp:4151:15"/>
beene inſpired by God, ſo greate an agreement had neuer beene in theſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> of God: whome, (both in teaching, and propounding the ſame matters, it is conuenient, that their ſucceſſours ſhould imitate.</p>
            <p>VVhere that thing is accompliſhed, there muſt needs be the true Church of Chriſte, and without this not elſe where.</p>
            <p>The fifth parte of the Outwarde teſtimoninie, is, <hi>The Induraunce,</hi> and conſeruation of the Churche, from the beginning of the world, vnto this time, and ſo farther, vnto the laſt day of Iudgement. Heerunto appertaineth that, which is in <hi>Acts.</hi> 5. <hi>when the Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſes</hi> roſe vp and went together to counſaile, to ſuppreſſe the Apoſtles of Chriſte: that auncient <hi>Gamaliell,</hi> a Doctor of the Lawe roſe vp, and ſaid:<note place="margin">Acts. 5.</note> 
               <hi>If this counſell, or this woork, be of men, it shall be diſsolued: but, if it be of</hi> GOD, <hi>ye cannot diſsolue it.</hi> This is it which Chriſt him ſelfe affirmeth, that againſt his Church,<note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> 
               <hi>The gates of Hel shall not preuaile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſixth parte of the Outwarde teſtimonie, is, <hi>The bloody confeſſion of many Martyres, from</hi> Abell <hi>vnto this preſent day.</hi> For, they are called <hi>Martyers,</hi> becauſe they beare witneſſe to the trueth of the Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doctrine, not onely with their mouth, but alſo with their blood. A matter worthy to bee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, is reported of <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Scholer of Saint <hi>Iohn:</hi> that, when at a certaine time, the Tyrant would by threatnings haue conſtrayned him to deny Chriſte, hee anſwered: <hi>How can</hi> I <hi>deny him, whoſe name</hi> I <hi>doe beare written in my heart?</hi> VVhich thing beeing heard, the Tirant commanded the body of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> to be cut in ſunder, and the heart beeing taken out, to be deuided
<pb facs="tcp:4151:16"/>
into ſmall peeces: which thing when it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, in euery peece ſo cut of the heart, the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> was found manifeſtly diſcrybed.</p>
            <p>The other kinde of teſtimonies, wherby the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of the doctrine of the Church is confirmed, is: <hi>The inwarde certification</hi> (or aſſurance made) by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſte, ſealing the heartes of faithfull people, touching the veritie of the <hi>Goſpell.</hi> Of this thing, <hi>Paule</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. ſpeaketh: <hi>It is God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which hath annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs, and ſealed vs in Chriſte, and hath giuen the earneſt of the ſpirit in our heartes.</hi> This <hi>Certification,</hi> the godly doe feele, cheefely, in feruent &amp; earneſt prayer vnto God. For, when Prayers doe proceede from a true faith: we feele in our heartes the anſwere of God, whereby we are made the more aſſured of the diuine promiſes.</p>
            <p>Hetherto, I haue numbred breefely, the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes whereupon, as vpon foundations, the vnmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable certaintie of the Chriſtian doctrine, is ſtayed. God graunt, that theſe things may be effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the mindes of <note n="*" place="margin">He vſeth this phraſe of ſpeeche as S. Paule doth when hee ſaith, Many became ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Rom. 5.</note> many, that they wauer not any more, but that they may dayly, more, and more abound, in all ſence, and knowledge. This word of God, beeing by ſo ſure teſtimonyes approued: God hath commaunded to be ſpread abroade, through the whole compaſſe of the world, and by the Miniſterie of the ſame, gathereth out of all mankinde, a Church vnto himſelfe: which (through Chriſte) he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to eternall life and ſaluation.<note place="margin">Ephe. 1. &amp; 5.</note> It, therefore becommeth godly Magiſtrates, to promote this ſelfe ſame worde, that it may be purely, and ſincerely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in Schooles, and Churches, and ſet ouer to the poſteritie. The charge whereof, when the moſte
<pb facs="tcp:4151:16"/>
godly, and wiſe Princes, and Kings of <hi>Denmark,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to appertain vnto them: they founded this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vniuerſitie of <hi>Hafnia,</hi> and moreouer enriched the ſame, with moſte bountifull ſtipendes: that in the ſame, they (which in deliuering the pure doctrine of the Goſpel, might in time to come, with fruite, ſerue their countrie) might be inſtructed and learned.</p>
            <p>I, beeing called vnto this Vniuerſitie, that with my laboures, I might aſſiſt the ſtudyes of Learners: foraſmuche as I had hethervnto, bothe with liuely voyce taught, and alſo committed to open monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of letters, many things of the moſte ſacred di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, in Lattin: it ſeemed good to me now, by this writing, ſet foorth in the common language, to ſet forwarde the ſtudyes of godlineſſe in them, whiche are ignorant of the Lattine ſpeech.

And I will, this ſame little booke to remaine in place of my confeſſion of euery article of the Chriſtian Religion, which hetherto, about the ſpace of 30. yeeres, I haue, in the Church &amp;, Schoole of <hi>Hafnia,</hi> openly propounded.</p>
            <p>That it hath ſemed beſt to me, to eſtabliſh the ſame <hi>(moſte woorthy Gentleman)</hi> vnder your name: that thing is doone, that I might declare my ſelf to be mindeful of very many benefits, which haue beene by you, to mewards perfourmed, theſe 21. yeeres now together, from that time, wherin, that magnificent, and gentle Gentleman your brother <hi>Nicolas Kaaes,</hi> was firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my fidelitie, and diſcipline.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4151:17"/>I beſeeche God, that for his only begotten ſonne our Lorde IESVS CHRISTE, he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the puritie of his worde, in this Kingdome of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> to the glory of his name, and the ſaluation of many: and that, with his holy ſpirit, he would go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the indeuours of thoſe which, either in the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, or politicall eſtate, which ſhall go about to ſet forewarde his Goſpell: that the kingdome of the Deuill beeing deſtroyed, the Temple of Chriſte, may in our hearts be builded, Amen.

               <hi>CHRIST,</hi> on the other ſide, hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion on the great blindenes of the Phariſes, aſketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what they thought of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; whoſe ſonne he is? and that thing he doth, with this intent, that an occaſion might bee giuen him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might inſtruct, and teach them forth of the Scripture, what they ſhould eſteeme of Chriſt, (that is to ſay) of him, whom God promiſed to <hi>Adam, Abraham,</hi> and the reſt of the holy fathers, to be the Sauiour of the worlde.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, that theſe queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the <hi>Law,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſte,</hi> may the more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouſly ſerue vs to the furtheraunce, &amp; inſtruction of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I wil chuſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence three doctrines, which (the grace of GOD aſſiſting) I will declare in order.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THE IEVVES,</hi> and cheefly the <hi>Phariſes,</hi> went about this thing with great indeuor,<note place="margin">Matth. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>That they might tangle Chriſt in his wordes,</hi> &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caught, they might quarell with him, and, at the length deliuer him to death. Behold ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how great the diuerſitie of minde is of the one towards the other, in <hi>Chriſte</hi> &amp; in the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. IESVS</hi> ſought this only thing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliuered from ſin, he might ſaue them: but the Phariſes craftely catch his words, wherby they might accuſe, and oppreſſe him. This way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes of mindes is at this daye (alas for ſorowe) found in many, which perſecute thoſe, which wiſh well vnto them, and ſhew them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues very carefull of their ſaluation. But wherof commeth this ſo fyery and inſatiable hatred of the Phariſes towarde Chriſte?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>CHRIST</hi> reprehended their great &amp; mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde ſinnes, namely, <hi>Arrogancie, Hypocriſie, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes, &amp; erronious Doctrine,</hi> wherby they led awry both them ſelues &amp; others. Arrogant, and proude people, are of ſuch malice of minde, that they take it greeuouſly, that they ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, &amp; do with great contention perſecute thoſe, which dare be ſo bold as once to miniſh or hinder their falſe conceiued opinion of the great eſtimation of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. Wherfore it is the leſſe to be meruailed, that theſe ſo proude &amp; arrogant Phariſies doe with hatred perſecute Chriſte: which euery where, and continually, tolde them to their teeth, and condempning them, obiected
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4151:20"/>
vnto them, this their filthy pride: eſpecially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they in the meane time, conſidered not, that this was doone of Chriſte, for their profit, and ſaluation. But, foraſmuch as theſe are Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, which repute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be righteous before God, and man, albeit they bee inwardly filled with all filthyneſſe and malice, yea altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like vnto dead mennes graues, whiche al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſhewe outwardly whited, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, yet inwardly they abounde with poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and abhominable filthyneſſe: therfore, they doe not gladly ſuffer thoſe, whiche reprehende, and condemne them of ſinne. And, for this cauſe theſe Hypocrites, will not graunt vnto Ieſus Chriſt this glory, <hi>(That he alone is righteous, and that whoſoeuer wil be made righteous, doe obtaine the ſame, by this our onely Lorde Ieſus Chriſte.</hi> Therefore, in the 21. of <hi>S. Matthew,</hi> Chriſte ſaith vnto them: <hi>Publicanes, and ſinners, ſhall enter into the kingdome of God, before you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, if you inquire, why theſe things be ſo? the cauſe is in a redyneſſe: for Hypocrites doe preſume, that they are without all ſinne, and truſt to their owne righteouſneſſe whiche they haue not: but Publicanes, and ſinners doe knowe and confeſſe them ſelues to haue ſinned, and to haue no righteouſneſſe of their owne, wherby beeing vpholden, they may make their boaſt. When they therefore doe heare ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued, they doe foorthwith very eaſily (in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the Hypocrites) acknowledge their ſinnes, and imbracing with ioy the preaching of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4151:20"/>
grace, doe repent, forſake the conuerſation of their former life, conuert them ſelues vnto God, by faith in Ieſus Chriſte, &amp; bring foorth fruites of faith. An example of this thing is to be ſeene in <hi>Luke Chap.</hi> 18. in the Publicane, &amp; the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie, of the which two, the Publicane ſtanding in the Churche afarre of prayed: the Phariſie with great pride boaſted of his owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Likewiſe <hi>Luke</hi> 7. In <hi>Simeon</hi> that hooſte of Chriſte, and in that ſinfull woman, whiche, there hauing waſhed the feete of Chriſte with her teares, wiped them with the heary lockes of her head.</p>
               <p>This waywardneſſe is moreouer very like vnto couetouſneſſe, for that it ſuffereth it ſelfe to be reprehended of no body, but indeuoureth to couer it ſelfe, with the cloke of wiſdome, ſeduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſparefulneſſe: when as notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it is in very deed, (as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth) meere Idolatrie: for, the couetous man repoſeth more hope, in theſe momentanie goods of the world, than in the liuing God. Therefore, it is not to be meruailed, that the Phariſies hated Chriſte, and with all their power perſecuted him, which iuſtly reproued their wicked couetouſneſſe, and execrable Idolatrie. That Chriſte alſo did in like manner reprehende their errours about the heauenly doctrine, neither did they take y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with quiet mindes: For they dreamed that the keyes of wiſdome, were in their powers alone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, euery of them ſuppoſed, that he might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and ſhut vp heauen at his pleaſure: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4151:21"/>
they notwithſtandinge were, in the meane time, voyde, both of the true vnderſtandinge of the Lawe, and of the true knowledge of the <hi>Meſsias:</hi> this their blindeneſſe, they could at no hand ſuffer, to bee reprooued of <hi>Chriſte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>LASTLY.</hi> The Phariſes toke this thinge alſo greeuouſly in Chriſt: that hee not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued them of their owne wandringe out of the way: but that they alſo, (through their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious Doctrine) did leade other awrye, from the true ſhepheard, and way of Saluation.</p>
               <p>Of theſe ſo great offences, Chriſt accuſed the Phariſes, that either (amending themſelues) they might bee ſaued: or els (continuing in their ſinnes,) they ſhould looke for, both here in this worlde, the iuſte puniſhmentes of God: as alſo after this life, euerlaſtinge dampnation. But, howe did the Phariſes take theſe thinges of Chriſte? Euen altogeather after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as a madde man is affected agaynſt him: which goeth about to delyuer him from his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and madneſſe. For, euen as a man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraught of minde, doth with feete, nayles, and byting, enemylike aſſayle him, which laboureth to laye medicinable handes vpon him: ſo the Phariſes with handes, and feete applye to this thinge: that they maye ſclaunder Chriſte, and take him out of the waye: and therfore they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lempnely ſent their meſſengers thriſe vnto him, the tueſday next beefore they crucifyed him. In the firſt Embaſſage were the Phariſes, with the <hi>Herodians,</hi> which demaunded whether it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4151:21"/>
were lawfull to giue tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or not? And that thing they doe with this intent, that if Chriſte did affirme the queſtion propounded, the common people might forſake him, and ſo it might be eaſily lawful, to deliuer him to death: but if he did deny it, he might fal into the hands of <hi>Herodes</hi> ſeruaunts, who hauing taken him, might kill him as a ſeditious man: But in vaine doth the craftineſſe of man wery it ſelfe, againſt the wiſdome of God. Chriſte anſwereth neither affirmatiuely, nor negatiuely, but the coyne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhewed by them, he ſaith, whoſe Image, and inſcription is this? They anſwered him <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars:</hi> And hee ſaid vnto them: Giue vnto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the things which are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and vnto <hi>GOD,</hi> thoſe things whiche are Gods: ſo, that of this anſwere of Chriſte, neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Herodians,</hi> nor the common people found, why they might iuſtly be offended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE SECOND</hi> Embaſſage was of the <hi>Saduces,</hi> which deny the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the dead. Theſe men thought that (out of the doctrine of Chriſte, teaching that all people ſhould riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the laſt day) they might inferre ſome abſurditie, in this maner: There were (ſay they) with vs ſeuen bretheren, and the firſte hauing maryed a wife, deceaſed: and hauing no ſeede, left his wife vnto his brother: likewiſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the thirde, vnto the ſeuenth: laſte of all the woman alſo dyed: In the reſurrection therefore, whoſe wife ſhall ſhe be of the ſeuen?</p>
               <p>They ſuppoſed now that Chriſte would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4151:22"/>
her either to one of them, or to al of them together, whiche if hee had doone, they would haue cryed out, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coulde not be conuenient, for the coutentions, hatreds, and abhominable filthyneſſes, that would followe therof. By this way, they hoped, that they ſhould confute the doctrine of Chriſte, &amp; to deliuer Chriſt to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Matth. 22.</note> as gilty of vntruth, to be puniſhed. Let vs heare what Chriſt anſwereth vnto them: <hi>Ye erre (ſaith he) not knowing the Scriptures, nor the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God</hi> and are ignorant what is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to come, betweene the condition of this life, and of the life euerlaſting. In theſe words Chriſte ſheweth three cauſes of the erronious Doctrine of the <hi>Saduces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE FIRST IS,</hi> that they knew not the Scriptures, which alone teacheth vs to try the trueth, from falſhod, in all thoſe matters, which concerne the buſineſſe of ſaluation. Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> faith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> 
                  <hi>Thy word is a lanterne vnto my feete.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE SECOND CAVSE,</hi> that they knewe not the vertue and power of God, by the which, he was able as eaſily to raiſe vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead, in the laſt day, as it was not hard to him, to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate all things, of nothing, in the firſt day. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when we thinke vpon the reſurrection of the dead, reaſon is not to be admitted into coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail, which is onely occupyed about theſe corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things: but we muſt looke back to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and knowe that nothing is impoſſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, the omnipotent creator of all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE THIRD CAVSE</hi> of the error of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4151:22"/>
the <hi>Saduces,</hi> Chriſte aſſigneth to bee this, that they did not conſider the difference of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man in this worlde, and in the life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. In this life there is neede of wedlock: but in the life eternall they ſhal neither mary nor be maryed: for they ſhalbe as the Angels of God, in heauen. And the loue of the other life, doth by a thouſand degrees excel the loue of this world, yea, that will darken this: euen as the ſunne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the morning, taketh away the light from all the other ſtarres, and alone with his owne brightneſſe lightneth the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE THIRD EMBASSAGE</hi> was of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> beeing made vnto Chriſte the very ſame day: this is the ſame, whereof the preſent text of the Goſpell maketh mention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhen the Phariſes had heard that Ieſus had in this wiſe ſtopped the mouthes of the Saduces,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>they came vnto him, and asked him which was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt comaundement in the Lawe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That was doone of them, not becauſe they would learne, but that they might haue ſome occation to deſtroy him. For they thought thus with them ſelues: becauſe this fellowe bringeth in Baptiſme, and accuſeth vs, which liuing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Lawe, doe boaſt our ſelues to be righteous by the woorks of the Lawe: ſurely, and without al doubt he contemneth the Law, and doth far leſſe eſteeme it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Baptiſme which if he doe, there wil lye a iuſt action for vs againſt him, as againſt one blaſphemouſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God himſelf, as one which hath the law
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4151:23"/>
of God, in no eſtimation, which the Lorde him ſelfe gaue vnto vs by his ſeruaunt <hi>Moſes.</hi> To theſe things Chriſt anſwereth, ſaying: the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and the firſt commaundement is:
<q>Thou ſhalt loue the Lorde thy God, with all thy heart, with al thy ſoule, and with all thy mynde.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And the ſeconde is like vnto this.</p>
               <q>Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe: In theſe two Commaundements hang all the Lawe and the Prophets.</q>
               <p>Doubtleſſe the Phariſes looked not for ſuch an anſwere to be giuen them, therefore none of them could ſay any thing againſt him. And ſo we ſee, that neither wiſdome nor prudence can preuaile againſt the Lorde, which bringeth to naught the wiſdome of the wiſe, and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the vnderſtanding of the prudent, as it is in <hi>Eſay.

And in what manner God is to be loued, it expoundeth ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God, <hi>with all thy heart, with all thy ſoule, and with al thy minde:</hi> In what manner alſo thy <hi>Neighbour</hi> is to bee loued, it by and by addeth: Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour <hi>(As thy ſelfe.)</hi>

               <p>But what is it to loue God, with all thy hart, with all thy ſoule, and with all thy minde? This word of <hi>(LOVE)</hi> comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth three things.<note place="margin">Ignoti nulla cupido.</note> Firſte, it comprehendeth a knowledge of the thing that is to be loued: for of a thing vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en there is no deſire. Moreouer it comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all the affections and motions of the hart, which do accompany pure loue. Thirdly, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all workes whiche are required to this loue. Therefore the lawe of God ioyneth theſe three together, when it ſaith: Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoule, and with all thy minde: ſo that there be in the heart, that is to ſay, in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of man, a cleere light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of GOD.

               <p>And ſo we ſee here, in what manner the three cheefe naturall powers, or abilities, ingrafted into the ſoule of man, namely, <hi>REASON, APPETITE,</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">or Zeale.</note>

heere thou muſt conſider that God doth require a loue, <hi>PVRE,</hi> and <hi>PERFECT, ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NALL,</hi> and <hi>SPIRITVALL,</hi> ſo, that thy loue ſhould bee, pure, without ſpotte: perfecte, with out all faulte: eternall, without all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: and ſpirituall, without all affection, and leuen of fleſhly concupiſcence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE OTHER</hi> great Commaundement is this. <hi>(Thou ſhalt loue thy Neighbour, as thy ſelfe.)</hi> Heere God appointeth the rule of the loue of our neighbour, to bee, the loue of our owne ſelfe.

Furthermore, wee muſt diſcerne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, betweene the perſon of man, and that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption whiche ſticketh in man. Man is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time affected towardes him ſelfe, with a blinde, vnwiſe, and hurtfull loue, ſpringing from the corrupte and depraued nature, (that is to ſay) from the fountaine of ſinne, which by our ſinne of heritage dwelleth in vs. This loue ſhall not be the rule of the loue of thy neighbour: for, to loue him after this maner, were plainly before God to hate thy neighbour.</p>
               <p>There is beſides this, a nother manner of louing him ſelfe, and the ſame is lawfull, and graunted, whiche ſpringeth from the holie Ghoſte, and faith in <hi>IESVS CHRISTE:</hi>

               <p>Furthermore, where they ſay:
<q>Chriſtians are made free:</q>
Therfore, <hi>They are not vnder the Lawe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that, I anſwere thus: True it is, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are made free, from the <hi>Condemnation of the Lawe,</hi> from ſinne, and hell: but not ſo, that in the meane ſeaſon, it may be lawfull for them to doe what they liſt: they are for this cauſe made free, that they ſhould ſerue God alone, loue him, and their neighbour aſmuche as lyeth in their whole powers, as the Lawe exhorteth, and teacheth.</p>
               <p>If moreouer they go forwarde to ſay: <hi>Chriſte gaue commaundement touching the preaching of the Goſpel to euery creature: but, touching the Law
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4151:27"/>
he commaunded nothing at all:</hi> I anſwere, Chriſt commaunded forgiueneſſe of ſinnes to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, but what is ſinne, but tranſgreſſion of the lawe? Now then, If Chriſtians haue no lawe, then it muſt needs be, that they neither haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinne. Beſide this, Chriſte himſelfe, and the Apoſtles doe exhorte all Chriſtians, to bringe foorth frutes of repentance, (that is to ſay) good works, according to the lawe of God.</p>
               <p>The laſte argument of the <hi>Antinomians</hi> is ſuch: <hi>The holie Ghoſt (ſay they) teacheth Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> Therfore, <hi>They neede not the lawe:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O, how fooliſhe, and friuolous an argument is this?

               <p>We ſee then, how, not onely foliſhly, but wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly they doe, whiche dare ſnatch away from vs the lawe of <hi>GOD,</hi> and throwe it out of the Chriſtian congregations, and affirme, that the ſame is not to be taught. Leauing therefore, the contagions miſcheefe of this errour, let vs giue thanks vnto God, for communicating vnto vs his <hi>Holie Lawe,</hi> and let vs further beſeech him, that he would giue vnto vs his holie ſpirite, by the which, many thinges acceptable, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto him, may be doone of vs. For if the

               <p>The Condition of humane nature in all men yeeldeth vnto vs, the firſt argument of this our aſſeueration.

                  <p>Therfore, No mortall man can fulfill the lawe of GOD.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The ſecond argument wherby it is conuinced, that no man can fulfill the lawe of <hi>GOD,</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the vniuerſall experience of man. For, there is no man found in the vniuerſall worlde, who (aſkinge his owne heart, and examining his owne conſcience,) ſhall not ſtraighte waye finde himſelfe to bee farre of from that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Lawe requireth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:4151:29"/>Who perceiueth not him ſelfe, to haue doone of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes things not to be doone, and againe, to haue left vndoone, things to be doone? And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſome dare boaſte much of fulfilling the law, doone by themſelues, or by others: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the iudgement of their owne heartes, is againſt them ſelues, whiche although it lye hid from the ſight of men, yet it is euident, and lyeth open vnto God, which ſeeth, weyeth, and tryeth, all the cogitations, and affections of the heart of man.</p>
               <p>The third argument, whereby it is proued, that no mortall man can fulfill the lawe of God, is required, <hi>Of the iuſte Iudgement of God,</hi> who condemneth onely the giltie, and the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of his diuine lawe, and commaundements. Foraſmuche then, as no man is free, from the iudgement of God, and puniſhmentes, namely, ſickneſſes, aduerſities, and at the laſte death it ſelfe: which do all fal in, by reaſon of ſinne: (that is to ſay) for tranſgreſſion of the law of God: who doth not heereby eaſily perceiue, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt concludeth, that al men are giltie, and tranſgreſſours of the law of God, ſo that by the workes of the Law they can attaine no righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe?</p>
               <p>The fourth argument is taken, <hi>Of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie of the Lawe, and the nature of man.</hi> For, the lawe is <hi>Spirituall,</hi> but the nature of man is <hi>Carnal,</hi> which thing <hi>Paul</hi> proueth <hi>Rom. 7.</hi> where he ſaith: <hi>VVe knowe that the lawe is ſpirituall, but I am carnall ſolde vnder ſinne:</hi> that is to ſay, I am
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4151:29"/>
ſo ſubiect vnto Sinne, that I am neuer ſo free from it, that I may fulfill the ſpirituall lawe of God: but I giue thankes vnto God, by <hi>IESVS CHRIST,</hi> which for my ſake hath aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntly perfourmed all that, which I my ſelfe coulde not perfourme. This argumente <hi>Paule</hi> handleth at large, in the Chapter euen now ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of vs.</p>
               <p>The firſt argument wherby it is prooued, that no mortall man can fulfill the lawe of God, <hi>The voyce of GOD himſelfe</hi> doth offer vs, in <hi>Moſes, the Pſalmes, and the Prophetes,</hi> and ſo foorth in the whole Euangelicall, and Apoſtolical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

Here, Parents, Magiſtrates, Mayſters, and Tutors, yea, and the Miniſters of the woorde of <hi>GOD</hi> alſo, muſt dillygently take heede, that ſuch as bee committed to their charge, doo liue, in outwarde honeſtye of life, ſoundly, and ſhamefaſtly. For, the law of <hi>GOD</hi> is therfore called, <hi>MORAL,</hi> bycauſe it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine common rule, according vnto which euery manne ſhould direct, and frame his manners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST OF AL,</hi> this externall diſcipline of the Law, is commaunded vnto parents, that with the ſame they may inſtruct their children, and keepe them, vnder outwarde honeſtye of manners. And, that they may the more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bringe that thinge to paſſe, let them vſe, doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, examples, quyet, and alſo ſeuere admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, yea, and moreouer (if the matter ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) the rodde: which thinge whoſoeuer ſhall not doo, let them looke for the iuſte plagues of God, as deſpiſers of the moſt ſeuere commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes of GOD, which hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Parentes, that they ſhoulde, (accordinge vnto the leuell of the <hi>Decalogus,)</hi> godlily, and honeſtly bring vp, and inſtruct their Children.</p>
               <p>Firſt, let them vſe doctrine, that is ſo ſay, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accuſtome their children (ſo ſone as they can
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4151:33"/>
ſpeake, and vſe reaſon) to learne thorowly, and with a memorable minde to recite morning, and eueninge all the partes of the Chriſtian inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Moreouer they themſelues ſhould walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their children, with their owne example of an honeſt led lyfe, ſo that the life of the parents may bee aunſweareable to the doctrine which they taught, which life, the Children might afterwardes follow. For, they which laboure with woords onely in the education of children, doo ſeeme, (in my iudgement) to doo very foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhlye, and I can not tell, whether I may call this a teachinge, or rather a hindering of them. For that thinge which by teachinge, by their woord, they buylde vp: the ſame through euill lyuinge; by their deedes, they pull downe. And what a ſincke of myſchiefes doo followe hereof, as well in the eccleſiaſticall, as in the politicall eſtate, who is it, which ſeeth not, and hath dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye experience. Beſides this, parentes ſhould ſomtime, vſe gentiller woordes vnto their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that by them, as by entiſementes, their mindes might the more eaſely, bee allured, and ſtirred vp to the dueties of vertue.</p>
               <p>But if the children will not obey the fatherly admonitions, here the parentes muſt prouoke them with more ſeuere ſpeach, &amp; countenaunce, and with wiſedome, and grauitye forewarne them, what puniſhments for their diſobedience, they ſhall at the length ſuſteyne.</p>
               <p>Fiftlye, when as the parentes, can (neyther
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4151:33"/>
by gentle, or ſharpe admonitions) profitte any thing at all, and that no hope of amendment of manners is ſeene in the Children: here at the length as the laſt meane of the fatherly reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the rod is to bee added. With the ſame they ſhall correcte them, when they accuſtome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to ſwearing, lying, theeuing, filthy, or, by any wayes, vnhoneſt talkinge. For <hi>Syrach</hi> ſayth <hi>Chap. 30. Hee that loueth his Childe, doth often mooue the rodde toward him: that in the laſt dayes of his life hee may reioyce.</hi> And <hi>Salom. Pro. <hi>23.

               <p>They which doo ouermuch cocker their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and winckinge at euery of their faultes, do ſuffer them to liue as they liſt: are to bee eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the authors of their deſtruction. <hi>Pontanus</hi> ſheweth, that a certayne wanton beeing ſpilled, through to much licentiouſnes graunted by the Mother, at the length (beeing of ripe age) was, (for a heynous offence committed) adiudged to dye: when hee was brought by the tormentor to the place of puniſhmente, hee, with a lowde voyce, mournefully vttered theſe woordes: Thinke not (O ye beeholders) this tormentor to haue brought me to this ſo infamous a kinde of puniſhment, but rather mine owne Mother. It ſtandeth Parentes therfore greatly vpon, to accuſtome their Children, to direct the courſe of their life, according to the leuell of the <hi>Decalogus.</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:4151:34"/>
By this meanes they ſhall make a way of more eaſy inſtruction for thoſe, to whoſe fidelitye, and diſcipline, they ſhall afterward committe their children.</p>
               <p>This outwarde diſcipline of <hi>Moſes</hi> lawe, is likewiſe committed to the Magiſtrate: For <hi>Paule</hi> calleth the Magiſtrate, <hi>The Miniſter of GOD,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> to the promoting of goodneſſe, and to the puniſhing of euill.

The Magiſtrate is alſo called, a keeper of both lawes, bicauſe he ſhould with a diligent care, conteyn his ſubiects vnder an honeſt diſcipline of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners, according to the <hi>Decalogus:</hi> and alſo trade ouer the courſe of his owne life in ſuch ſorte: that hee may be a patterne, and a glaſſe, into which his ſubiects li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing godly may looke into. Hee muſt alſo haue a diligent care, that his poſitiue lawes, and al his decrees may agree with the <hi>Decalogus,</hi> and bee as walles, and fortreſſes of the ſame. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ſhould moreouer puniſhe, the manifeſt tranſgreſſions of the lawe diuine: as are, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemings of <hi>GOD,</hi> Idolatries, periuries, vſual ſwearings, contempt of the woord of God, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, murthers, Adulteries, lying, falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe bearing, theftes, and ſuch like vices, which fight directlye againſt the woord of <hi>GOD:</hi> ſo, that if the Magiſtrate neglect his office in theſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4151:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thinges, hee becommeth partaker, and giltye of all thoſe offences, the not puniſhment of which hee hath graunted vnto others. There is tolde an Hiſtorye, of a certaine murtherer, which had ſlayn ſeuen men, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee was perforce brought vnto the Law, and was ſet beefore the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeate, &amp; accuſed of manſlaughter, anſwere was made, that hee onely, had killed but one onely man, the other ſixe the Maieſtrate had killed, which did not puniſh that firſt murther in him. And verely the Magiſtrate is gilty before God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee puniſheth not ſuch as ſtubbornly breake the law of God, &amp; by his giuing of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hee oppeneth a window to others to offend. It is an vnmercifull pitty, to ſpare one, with the loſſe, and deſtruction of many.</p>
               <p>To the bringers vp of youth, this ſame care, doth alſo belong, that they ſhould inſtruct thoſe which are committed to their diſcipline, in ſuch ſorte, by doctrine, by example, by often admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and corrections, that in their outwarde manners, nothing might be ſeene, out of ſquare, or contrary to the law of <hi>GOD.</hi> Which thing if they neglect to do, they ſin againſt God, againſt the parents of the children, and the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, neither ſhall they (for euer) beare this puniſhed. For if (by right) hee bee hanged, which ſtealeth an Oxe, or a Cow from another: how much more is he worthy of a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hang<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ings, which committing this kinde of thefte, far more greeuous: doth vnfaythfully inſtruct the youth, vpon good truſt committed vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:4151:35"/>Tutors, or gouernours alſo, which are in the ſteede of parentes, ſhould wholy frame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, according to the rule, preſcribed beefore to parentes. Therfore, they ſhould not onely haue a regarde and ſtudious care to keepe the goods of their pupilles, which fall to them by way of heritage: but they ſhould haue a ſpecial care, that they might bee well, and honeſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, knowing, that they themſelues, are as ſtreightly bound, before the iudgement ſeate of <hi>GOD,</hi> by the promiſe which they made to the parentes of thoſe children, as if they had coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunted with God himſelfe, that they would bee faythfull tutors, and patrones of thoſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilles. For this cauſe, <hi>GOD</hi> calleth himſelfe, a father of the fatherleſſe, and a defender of the Widdowes. But what is doone at theſe dayes by the common ſorte of tutors, is euidente to all men, and the miſerable pupilles, and widdowes (alas for ſorow) to their great greefe haue expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all alſo, the Miniſters of the woorde of <hi>GOD,</hi> are bound, to exhort their hearers to outward honeſty of lyfe according to the law of God, by doctrine, examples, by admoniſhments togeather with chaſtiſements ſet beefore them, as Chriſte himſelfe did, and the holye <hi>Apoſtle Paule.</hi> But if they ſhall lay aſide this due care of their duety, and deceiptfully doo the buſineſſe of the Lorde, they ſhal not eſcape the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente and puniſhmente, in that laſte day of the Lorde.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4151:37"/>
lawe, to iuſtifie all that beeleeue in him. This <hi>Fayth in Chriſte,</hi> is the foundation of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> as all Chriſtians do confeſſe in the Creed, when they ſay: <hi>I beleeue the forgiuenes of ſinnes:</hi> that is to ſay, although my ſinnes bee innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and the greatneſſe of Gods anger is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and the puniſhmentes which fall in, by reaſon of ſinne, be horrible: yet notwithſtanding foraſmuch as I am vnder grace, and not vnder the Law, I doo aſſuredly beleeue the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes, through the merite of the death and paſſion of Ieſus Chriſte, who, not onely clenſeth mee from all Sinne, by his precious bloud, but alſo imputeth vnto mee his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: ſo, that the Lawe, with her ſentence of condemnation, hath no right ouer mee at all.</p>
               <p>This fayth ſpringeth out of the knowledge of the Goſpell, which offereth to all the faythfull, <hi>GRACE</hi> in Ieſu Chriſt: Wherfore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth: <hi>Chriſte hath made our ſinnes his: that hee might make his righteouſneſſe oures.</hi> Alſo, when <hi>Caine</hi> ſayde:<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>My iniquitie is greater, then that I may bee forgiuen: Auguſtine</hi> anſwereth: <hi>Thou lyeſt Caine, for the mercy of GOD is greater,</hi> than the wretchedneſſe of all Sinners. This is that which <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth: <hi>Beholde the Lambe of GOD, which taketh away the ſinnes of the world:</hi>

                  <hi>Item: CHRIST is the propitiation, not only for our ſinnes but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole worlde.</hi> This fayth reſteth in the obedience of <hi>GOD</hi> alone, and truſteth to no creature beſide, eyther in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or in earth.

               <p>Furthermore, whoſoeuer doe boaſte of fayth, and yet doe in the meane ſeaſon liue wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly: doe moſte impudently, reprooue, and conuince themſelues of vntrueth.

               <p>The errour of theſe people is confirmed by this, that they thinke, that <hi>GOD</hi> doeth not more inwardely ſearche, and looke into the

               <p>Therfore it is, that <hi>Iames</hi> requireth an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the woorde, and thought, ſo that the outwarde works of the life, ſhould bee aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the faith, which is ſaide to be in the heart: euen as it is to bee ſeene in the example of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is certaine, that the hearte, and the woorkes doe agree, and are aunſwerable one to the other: ſo, that whereſoeuer there is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill heart, the woorkes of the ſame muſt in like caſe, of neceſſitie followe euill, according to the rule of Chriſte: <hi>A good tree bringeth foorth good fruites.</hi>

               <p>Wee ſee therefore manifeſtly, how impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they reproue them ſelues of vntrueth, which boaſtinge of faythe, in the meane time neither haue, nor paſſe for good woorkes: dooing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as if a man had a Crowne ſet vpon his head, hee would therefore ſtraightway bee eſteemed, and called a King.

               <p>Thou feeſt therefore, howe great the heuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this ſinne is, whereby, a man is author, not onely of his owne deſtruction: and alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth occaſion to many, (with the hurte of their

Heere, if the Iewes had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to counſaile the holye Scripture decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Chriſt, and had a little while conſidered
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4151:43"/>
with them ſelues, what the office of Chriſte ſhould be in the worlde: they had eaſily founde this anſwere: Chriſte in reſpect of the humane nature which he tooke vnto him, is, the ſonne of <hi>Dauid:</hi> but, in reſpect of the deuine nature, he is the ſonne of <hi>GOD.</hi> As farre foorth therefore, as appertaineth to the humane nature, he is in appearance baſe, and poore: but as farre foorth as appertaineth to the deuine nature, hee is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, to whome <hi>Dauid</hi> muſt giue place, and humbly bowe his knees: yea, of him only, and by this onely one, receiue forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, righteouſneſſe, and life euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>Of this <hi>CHRISTE</hi> his Lord, <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the <hi>Pſalme.</hi> 51. where he ſaith: <hi>Thou ſhalt purge me with Hiſope, and I ſhall be cleane, Thou ſhalt waſh me, and I ſhalbe whiter then ſnowe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. <hi>If thou Lord, wilt marke what is done amiſſe. O Lord who ſhal abide it? But there is mercy with thee, therefore ſhalt thou be feared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this <hi>MERCYE (or peopitiation)</hi> hee vnderſtandeth Chriſte, which after the humane nature ſhould be borne of him: but after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature, very <hi>GOD,</hi> from euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>After this manner, Chriſte, (by the queſtion propounded by him) would reduce the Iewes, to the true knowledge of Chriſte, wherein (as I haue ſaide) conſiſteth eternall life, and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſaluation: as <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth, 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 1. where he ſaith: <hi>For aſmuch as the worlde, knewe not GOD, through wiſdome:</hi> (that is to ſaye
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4151:43"/>
through vnderſtanding and reaſon, naturally ingraffed in man, by God): <hi>In the wiſedome of God,</hi> (that is, in the meruelous woorks of God, which are wrought by him): <hi>It pleaſed God, by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching, to ſaue thoſe whiche beeleeue. For the Iewes require ſignes, and the Greekes ſeeke wiſdome, but wee preache Chriſte crucifyed, vnto the Iewes an offence, and vnto the Greekes, fooliſhneſſe: but vnto bothe Iewes, and Greekes which are called, we preache Chriſt, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of GOD and the wiſdome of GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paule</hi> in this place diſſeuereth the wiſdome of the worlde, or mans wiſdome, from the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>GOD.</hi> For in that, that <hi>GOD</hi> ſent his ſonne, borne of a woman, made bonde vnto the Lawe, and ſubiecte to moſte bitter paſſion, and death: it ſeemed vnto men, not wiſdome, but fooliſhneſſe: foraſmuch as <hi>GOD,</hi> by his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie, could eaſily finde another way to ſaue mankinde. But it ſeemeth farre otherwiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, yea, that which men eſteemed fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that <hi>GOD</hi> eſteemeth and accompteth for wiſdome.</p>
               <p>But, that wee may more fully vnderſtande theſe things, let vs ſeek <note n="*" place="margin">As farre as the holie ſcriptures ſet foorth the ſame vnto vs.</note> the foundation of this the ſo wounderfull counſaile of <hi>GOD,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon we may builde ſafely.</p>
               <p>Although, <hi>GOD,</hi> if we conſider the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his power, coulde doe whatſoeuer hee would: yet notwithſtanding, it ſeemed good to him, to attempte nothing in this matter, but that whiche was agreeable to the iuſtice, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4151:44"/>
glorye of his maieſtie diuine, (that is to ſaye) that, whiche all Angels, aſwell good as euill, and all people, yea, and all creatures ſhoulde acknowledge to bee in very deede, iuſte, and praiſe worthy:<note place="margin">Luke. 2.</note> ſaying: <hi>Glory bee to GOD on hyghe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, euen as any Kinge, or Tyrant, when he graunteth vnto one, that which hee hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from another, may be ſaid to play, the part, partely of an vniuſte, and partely of a lybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man: Euen ſo, <hi>GOD,</hi> if vſing his power on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he had reſtored man, it had beene, on the one parte derogation to his Iuſtice: and on the other parte too muche had beene graunted to mercy: therefore it was needefull to finde ſuche a way to ſaue man, that theſe foure properties in <hi>GOD,</hi> (without the whiche <hi>GOD</hi> coulde not <hi>(BEE),</hi> or be called <hi>GOD</hi>), might ſtande together, and conſent in the hyeſt degrees, namely, <hi>MOSTE HIGH,</hi> or <hi>PERFECT POVVER, PERFECTE RIGHTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OVSNESSE: PERFECT MERCIE,</hi> and <hi>PERFECT VVISDOME.</hi> Suche a ſecret purpoſe, pleaſeth God therefore, That his onely begotten ſonne ſhould take vnto him mans nature, and dye: to the ende, that who ſo beleeueth in him may obtaine ſaluation, and life euerlaſting. So, that if GOD had vſed his omnipotencie, and Iuſtice, hee had for euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned all men, who through their rebellion, had offended the eternall maieſtie of God, and were therefore ſubiect, &amp; giltie of eternall death,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4151:44"/>
and Hel. But what had then beene the praiſe of his mercy? Where then ſhoulde the glory of his wiſedome haue had place? Man, without all fauour condempned, had periſhed: and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>GOD,</hi> of the ende of his counſaile, (whereby, hee had appoynted manne, beeing made according to his owne Image, to eternall ſaluation) had beene voyde, and fruſtrate.</p>
               <p>That nothing at all therefore might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated, from the <hi>PERFECT IVSTICE</hi> of God. It pleaſed him, that euen as by the diſobedience of one man, wee are all made gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: ſo by the obedience of one, many ſhould be made righteous: God him ſelfe ſhould bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfyed: and, wee beeing deliuered from guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyneſſe, ſhoulde bee indowed with life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtynge.</p>
               <p>Heere alſo ſhineth foorth the <hi>PERFECT</hi> and great <hi>MERCIE</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> whiche ſo loued the worlde, that he would giue his owne onely begotten Sonne, that <hi>All which beleeue in him,</hi> ſhould not periſhe,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> but haue life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.

               <p>
                  <hi>THE GREATNES OF THE EVIL,</hi> wherwith the nature of man was oppreſſed, is perceiued in foure things cheefely: namely, In <hi>the VVEIGHT OF SINNE,</hi> In <hi>the IVSTICE OF THE ANGER OF GOD:</hi> In <hi>the POVVER OF DEATH:</hi> and in <hi>the MOSTE CRVEL TYRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIE OF THE DEVILL.</hi>

                  <hi>THE VVEIGHT OF SINNE</hi> was greater, then that any finite, or bounded pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, (ſuch as is the power of Angels, and men) might beare the burthen thereof.

               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST,</hi> therefore, the Mediatour muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore <hi>VVISDOME,</hi> not ſuch as that of the worlde is, whiche is ſhut vp within certaine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites: but ſuch as is hid from the Princes of this world: which wiſdome, is, of <hi>Zachary</hi> defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be:<note place="margin">Luke. 1.77.78.</note> 
                  <hi>The knowledge of ſaluation, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, by the bowels of the mercy of our God.</hi> Of this wiſdome ſpeaketh the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt <hi>Iohn</hi> in his firſt Chapter, when he ſayth: <hi>No man hath ſeene God at any time: but the ſonne which is in the boſome of the father, he hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him vnto vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome man may ſaye: Coulde not God haue reuealed this wiſdome vnto men, by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Prophets? I aunſwere, It is one thing, to giue, and to teach wiſdome as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: and another thing to bee the wiſedome, (that is to ſay) effectually to bring to paſſe, that the harts of men may receiue,<note n="*" place="margin">Or the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> ſauing wiſdome.</p>
               <p>The voice of man ſtriketh the eares of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: but the Sonne of God, which is the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it ſelfe, of God, repleniſheth the minde of man, with the wiſdome of ſaluation. For, the worde of the Prophets, and of other Miniſters of the woorde of God, doth then at the length, bring fruite: when as God, by the worde, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the hearte, and inſtilleth the ſeedes of true wiſdome, whiche thing doubtleſſe is not in the

power of any creature, but of the Creatour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: whereof it followeth, that the <hi>Mediatoure muſt be GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SECONDLY, The Mediatour muſt reſtore againe RIGHTEOVSNESSE.</hi> For, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſſe, no man may come foorth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſight of <hi>GOD.</hi> But no man is able to giue, <hi>Perfect Righteouſneſſe,</hi> which ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for all people, except <hi>GOD.</hi> For, that man might be perfectly righteouſe before God, two things are required: Of which, the firſt is, <hi>To be ſet free from vnrighteouſneſſe, and ſinne,</hi> which euils men bring with them into the world. The other: <hi>To bee indowed and garniſhed, with a full obedience of the lawe of GOD,</hi> which is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of righteouſneſſe, whiche is before God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylable.</p>
               <p>Of the former we haue ſpoken before, where we ſhewed, the enormitie of ſinne, and the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the angre of <hi>GOD.</hi> Touching the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is: <hi>To be indowed, and garniſhed with righteouſneſſe, whereby the lawe of GOD is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed:</hi> It is euident, that the righteouſneſſe of no creature, foraſmuch as it is <hi>(finite):</hi> can bee ſufficient to ſaluation, for infinite numbers of people, which thing doubtleſſe in the <hi>Mediatour</hi> is required. For, as hee muſt with a ſufficient ſacrifice of clenſing, make ſatiſfaction for ſinnes, and ſo take away all guiltineſſe: So muſt hee, by his owne obedience towarde the lawe, ſet all thoſe righteous in the ſight of God, whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him.

                  <hi>Chriſte is THE ENDE OF THE LAVVE,</hi> to ſaue all thoſe whiche beleeue in him. Heereby it may be ſeene, <hi>that the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour muſt of neceſſitie be VERY GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third place, followeth, <hi>SANCTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FICATION,</hi> which the <hi>Mediatour</hi> muſt bring.

               <p>Moreouer, foraſmuch as <hi>SANCTIFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATION,</hi> is ſet againſt <hi>SINNE,</hi> and in Sinne are two things, namely, the formalitie, as the guiltineſſe: and the materiall parte, as the corrupt qualities, and actions? the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification muſt be alſo double, one, whiche is ſet againſt guiltineſſe, whiche is, <hi>The cleanſing of ſinne, by the blood of Chriſte:</hi> the other, whiche is ſet againſt the corrupt <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ualities and actions, which is, aſwell the ſeparation of man from the prophanitie of the nations, by the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the fleſh, which is doone, by reſiſting
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4151:54"/>
corrupt cogitations, affections, and deſires of the fleſh, and, with the whole power, abſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from euill woorkes: as alſo, the ioyning together of man with <hi>GOD,</hi> by the quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſpirite, by obeying vnto God, and by following pureneſſe of the minde, of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and innocencie of the whole life: breefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that man, might renounce the Deuill, and and his woorkes, and cleaue with the whole heart vnto <hi>GOD</hi> alone.</p>
               <p>This Sanctification, is alſo called of <hi>Paule <hi>Phillip</hi> 3. (SPIRITVALL CIRCVM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CISION.) VVe</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>are Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, whiche ſerue GOD in the Spirite, and reioyce in Chriſte, and haue no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Spirituall Circumciſion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Spirituall circumciſion what it is.</note> 
                  <hi>is a cutting awaye of the truſte of the fleſh, after whiche ſucceedeth a reioycing in CHRIST, and a pure deſire to worſhip GOD.</hi> And this, true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is that <hi>SANCTIFICATION,</hi> which <hi>GOD,</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> our <hi>Mediatour,</hi> doth bring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE FOVRTH GOOD THING,</hi> which our <hi>Mediatour</hi> ſhould reſtore vnto vs, is <hi>PERFECTE REDEMPTION.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Redemption</hi> requireth, firſte, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall preſence of the <hi>Mediatoure,</hi> in the Churche, <hi>(or Congregation:)</hi> (that is to ſay) in all the godly euery where diſpearſed, through out the whole worlde.

               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:4151:55"/>Secondly, it requireth, a preſeruation of the congregation (that is to ſay) that the <hi>Mediatour</hi> ſhould be a keeper, or preſeruer, not onely, of the whole Church, but alſo, of euery member of the ſame, againſt infinite ſubtilties, and lyinges in waight, of the Deuil, and man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: it requireth that, the <hi>Mediatour</hi> ſhould looke into the heartes of men, leaſt hee ſhould be deceiued, by the outwarde diſguiſing of hypocrites. Now, foraſmuch as it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of <hi>GOD</hi> onely, to looke into the hearts of men, and to beholde the inwarde ſecretes of their affections: ſurely, the <hi>Mediatour</hi> muſt of neceſſitie be <hi>GOD.</hi> Furthermore, to the office of the <hi>Mediatour,</hi> this alſo appertaineth: that he doe euery where, heare the gronings of ſuch as doe call vpon him, whiche, doubtleſſe is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, of the diuine power alone.</p>
               <p>Fiftly: it requireth, that, the <hi>Mediatour,</hi> in the laſt day, ſhould rayſe vp, all the deade: whiche work, is aboue the powers of all creatures. Yea, all the creatures of God, by their owne power, are not able to rayſe vp, a deade Flye againe, muchleſſe all people, whoſe bodyes haue beene by diuerſe meanes, and in diuers places ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abrode: But, foraſmuch as the <hi>Mediatour</hi> muſt doe this, and that in the twinckling of an eye, he muſt of neceſſitie, be <hi>GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, it requireth, that, the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour</hi> doe giue to thoſe whiche are rayſed vp, (which in the true faith haue departed this life) eternall life, perpetuall glorie, and conformitie
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4151:55"/>
with <hi>GOD.</hi> But who can bring this to paſſe, but onely <hi>GOD?</hi> Wee haue therefore aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſhewed: <hi>That our Sauiour, and Mediatour is GOD: And, why it was needefull, that hee ſhould be very GOD.</hi>

               <p>But, why it was neceſſary, that the <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,</hi> ſhould be one perſon, and not two, as there be in him two diſtinct natures: there bee many weightie reaſons, certaine of the cheefe of which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4151:59"/>
it may ſuffiſe to note in this place.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Our <hi>Mediatour, GOD</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> muſt be one perſon, that he might make <hi>GOD,</hi> and <hi>Man (ONE):</hi> therfore, he is ioyned to the father, by his true <hi>God head,</hi> &amp; vnto <hi>Man,</hi> by true <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> that ſo he might couple bothe together.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde cauſe: The <hi>Mediatour</hi> ſhoulde bring nothing to paſſe, betweene the parties at variance, if he cleaue to the one, and differ from the other: Wherefore, it was needefull, that the <hi>Mediatour</hi> by a certaine neceſſitie, ſhould be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to bothe parties.</p>
               <p>To <hi>GOD</hi> therfore (who, by our ſinne was offended:) our <hi>Mediatour</hi> is ioyned by true diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: And vnto <hi>MAN</hi> he is aſſociated, by true humanitie: that through the ſocietie, which hee hath with bothe partes, hee might ioyne bothe partes together: according to that ſaying of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus lib. 3. Cap. 2.</hi> where he intreateth of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, why the <hi>worde of God became fleſhe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It muſt needs bee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Mediatour betweene GOD, and MAN, by reaſon of the nighe affinitie to bothe partes: muſte reduce bothe into freendſhip, and concorde: and bringe to paſſe, that God ſhould take man vnto him: and man ſhoulde yeelde ouer himſelfe vnto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Theodoretus</hi> ſaith: <hi>Euen as he,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dialog 1.</note> 
                  <hi>which would reconcile ſome two perſons, ioyning handes bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene themſelues, putting himſelfe in the middeſt betweene, and holding the one by the right hande, and the other by the lefte, bringeth, &amp; ioyneth them in freendſhip together: So he when hee had vnited
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4151:60"/>
the diuine nature to the humane: made a peace inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable, and which cannot bee broken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third cauſe: If the <hi>Mediatour were not one perſon:</hi> then the workes of the redemption, wrought in the humane nature, ſhould not be a ſufficient price for ſinne, through which the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſſe was offended. For, Death was due debt for ſinne, but pure <hi>GOD</hi> coulde not taſte death: neither, <hi>Man</hi> alone could ouercome death. Therfore <hi>GOD</hi> became man: that <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>MAN,</hi> bothe ſhould, and might make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for eternall death, whiche was due to mankinde. The eternall ſonne of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tooke mans nature vnto him, into the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of perſon: that the works done in the humane nature, might be of infinite power, and merite. For, through the indiuiſible vnion of the diuine, and humane nature in one perſon, the dignitie is infinite, the perfection moſte abſolute, and the price of the blood, death, and ſo of all the actions and ſufferings of Chriſte in his moſte holy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, ineſtimable. And thereof, is the might, and force of blottinge out ſinne, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of remitting offences, of iuſtifying, quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſauing the beleeuers.</p>
               <p>And albeit, Chriſte ſuffered in the fleſh onely, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith: yet notwithſtanding, the ſuffring is attributed to the perſon,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note> by reaſon of that moſte ſtricte vnion of the two natures in one perſon. That theſe things may ſomewhat more eaſily be vnderſtanded, I will ioyne heerevnto
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4151:60"/>
a ſimilitude, whiche the Catholique deuines in the olde Church haue vſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MAN</hi> conſiſteth of two ſubſtaunces, of a ſoule, and of a body: and doth many things by the power of the Soule, as, to vnderſtand, to reaſon, to number &amp;c. and againe doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges, by the ſtrength of the bodye, as to builde, to write, to walke, and ſuche other like deedes either well or euill. All theſe things whiche in this manner, hee doeth, either by the power of the ſoule by it ſelfe, or by the ſtrength of the body by it ſelfe, or by the woorke of bothe together: are attributed to the perſon of the man.</p>
               <p>Euen in like manner, Chriſte doth certaine woorkes according to his humane nature, and certaine according to his diuine nature, al which notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding are attributed to whole Chriſt, which is <hi>GOD,</hi> and <hi>MAN.</hi> So, the death of Chriſte which he ſuſtayned according to his humane nature, is aſcrybed to the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>MAN.</hi> Therefore <hi>Luke</hi> rightly affirmeth,<note place="margin">Acts. 20.28.</note> that <hi>GOD hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Congregation to him ſelfe, with his owne blood:</hi> And againe he ſayth rightly, that <hi>IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Mary</hi> hath created Heauen, and Earth: For, <hi>Ieſus, and the eternall ſonne of GOD, is ONE perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſame ſentence alſo, ſpeaketh <hi>Cyrell: Beecauſe</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>that bodye, which hee made his owne, did ſuffer: therefore it is ſayde, the worde it ſelfe ſuffered for vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:4151:61"/>And heereof it is, that all the workes, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites of redemption in Chriſte, are counted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, infinite, ſauing, and ſo ineſtimable: that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, nothing, neither in Heauen, or in earth may be compared, as wee haue ſomewhat tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before.</p>
               <p>From this fountaine, an infinite, and vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable conſolation, to the conſcience afflicted, tremblinge for the multitude of her ſinnes flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth foorth. For, if the death of Chriſte bee ſo precious, that there is no price of equall value, which may be compared to it, much leſſe prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before it: What ſhould let, that it ſhould not abound farre aboue the heape of my ſinnes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note n="*" place="margin">Or albeit they exceede in number, greatneſſe, &amp;c.

For as it admoniſhed the Iewes, that euen as the ſacrifice of the Lambe in <hi>Aegypte</hi> beeing fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, the people went out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and were deliuered from bondage: ſo it ſignifyed, that by the ſacrifice of Chriſt, mankinde ſhould be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vnto <hi>GOD,</hi> and brought vnto libertie.</p>
               <p>The name of the ſhadowe, (that is to ſay) of the <hi>Lambe,</hi> is therefore attributed vnto Chriſte, the <hi>Trueth:</hi> that it might be knowen that Ieſus Chriſt is he, whom the paſchall Lamb in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde Teſtament did ſhadowe. For, it is a thing cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable in the Scriptures, to giue one, and the ſame names, to the ſignes, and the things ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4151:63"/>
that by conference of the ſhadowe, and the trueth, we way the more fully be inſtructed.</p>
               <p>So, the Rocke, whiche was a ſhadowe of Chriſte, is attributed to Chriſte: becauſe in him, the trueth, which was ſhadowed by the Rocke in the wilderneſſe, is fulfilled.</p>
               <p>The Sacrifice, which was onely a figure of the cleanſing ſacrifice, then to come, was called, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (that is to ſay) <hi>Propitiation,</hi> which name, bothe by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> is attributed to Chriſt, who alone offered the true propitiatory ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, when <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth Chriſte <hi>a LAMB,</hi> he ſignifyeth, that he was to be killed for ſacrifice. And ſo <hi>Iohn,</hi> in one worde expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the end of all the ſacrifices of the law, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they ſhoulde ſhadowe the ſacrifice of Chriſte: and, which beeing finiſhed, all the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of <hi>Aaron, ſhould ceaſſe.</hi> Therfore, he ſaith: <hi>Beholde the Lambe of GOD.</hi> As though he ſhould ſay: ye Iewes haue hetherto many yeeres paſt offered the Paſchall Lambe, but, beholde this is, that true, immaculate, and pure Lamb, with out all faulte: whiche is woorthyly called, <hi>The Lambe of GOD:</hi> becauſe hee is a Sacrifice ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, for the ſinnes of the whole world. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, rightly ſayd <hi>Bernard: VVho could better take away ſinne, then hee, in whome ſinne falleth not? He without doubt, is able to waſh mee, who, as it is manifeſt, is not defyled: Let this hand wipe mine eye couered with dyrt: which hand alone, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out duſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We haue ſaid, why Chriſte is called a <hi>Lambe:</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:4151:64"/>
and cheefely, why hee is called the <hi>Lambe of GOD.</hi> Now it is to be opened in few wordes: <hi>VVhat this Lamb hath done. Beholde</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iohn) the Lambe of GOD,</hi>

               <p>There haue beene in time paſt, and are alſo at this day, two ſortes of men, whiche by teaching falſely in this place haue fowlely offended. Of theſe, the firſt are, which are of opinion, that the paſſion, and ſacrifice of Chriſte profiteth not all
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4151:65"/>
men, but a certaine fewe peculiar elected. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of them is: which ſuppoſe that there be certaine ſinnes, which, euen by the merite of the death, and paſſion of Chriſte, cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Theſe two falſe, and erronious opinions I will in this place breefely refute, and throwe downe by manifeſte teſtimonyes of the woorde of <hi>GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They, whom I named in the firſt place, are <hi>Stoickes,</hi> and ſuch, as going about to fain tables of deſteny out of teſtimonyes of the Scripture, not rightly vnderſtanded, doe teach, that <hi>GOD</hi> hath created men, appoynted partly, to eternall Saluation: partely, to eternall condempnation, howſoeuer, they either beleeue, or liue. This peruerſe opinion, is, not onely blaſphemous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>GOD:</hi> but alſo ſeduceth many: that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they deſpaire of the forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes, or nouriſh ſecuritie: thinking it to bee a matter of no force, how they liue, foraſmuch as they attaine ſaluation, becauſe, that they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. Againſt this opinion is to bee ſet, <hi>The mercifull will of GOD,</hi> which hath made man, after his owne Image, and hath promiſed to <hi>Adam,</hi> the reſtoring againe of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Of this will of <hi>GOD,</hi> the Prophet ſpeaketh in theſe woords: <hi>As ſurely as I liue ſaith the Lord GOD, I will not the death of the vngodly, but that the vngodly ſhould bee conuerted, from his way and liue.</hi> Therefore, if that theſe woords, that <hi>GOD will not the death of a ſinner,</hi> bee true, of which thing, there is vtterly no doubt: It muſt,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4151:66"/>
of neceſſitie, bee falſe, that they ſay, <hi>That GOD hath deſtinated certaine to ſaluation, certain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnation,</hi> and that, if we reſpect the counſaile of the creation, &amp; redemption of mankinde. For, as farre foorth as appertaineth to the rebellion of man: there it is ſaid, that <hi>GOD</hi> hath created many to condempnation, whome notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, hee would, ſhould haue beene conuerted, ſhould haue ſought and obtained ſaluation.</p>
               <p>For, euen as an earthly father, is in ſuch wiſe affected towarde his children, that he woulde haue euery one of them, to come to thriftines, &amp;, be honeſt, and woorthy ſucceſſors to him of his goods, and ſubſtance, and yet notwithſtanding, beeing made fruſtrate of his hope, findeth the ſtubbernneſſe, and diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of them, whereby they alſo at the length, do caſt them ſelues with great ignominie, into deſtruction, and ſome infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous kinde of puniſhmente: Of this father it may be ſaid, that hee hath brought vp children, kept to this ſo great miſcheef, (not, that the will of his purpoſe, was not farre other) but that the children through their owne rebellion, haue called this miſcheef vnto them ſelues.</p>
               <p>So, <hi>GOD</hi> verily, would haue all men (made after his owne image) to be ſaued: but, if any of theſe being rebellious wil not imbrace his word, and, by faith, be conuerted, but fauouring ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and madneſſe, doe dye in their owne wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: thoſe, God, ſuffereth to periſh, that they might ſuſtaine the iuſt puniſhmentes, aſwell of their owne offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of God, as alſo
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4151:66"/>
of their conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of attayning ſaluation through Chriſte. Here we may ſay, with the ſcripture: That God hath created ſuche rebellious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts, to eternall condemnation, not, that he is delighted, with their deſtruction: but, that, they through their owne malice haue drawen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame vnto themſelues, preferring the vanitie of this world, before the grace, &amp; mercy of God, in Ieſu Chriſte. Of this eternall &amp; vnmouable will of God: <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh on this wiſe: <hi>GOD would haue all men ſaued, &amp; come to the trueth, for there is one GOD, and one Mediatour between GOD, and MAN, euen the man Ieſus Chriſt, which hath giuen himſelfe a redemption for all men.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith: <hi>GOD is longe ſuffering, which would haue no man loſte, but will receyue all men to repentaunce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What can be more plainly ſpoken? And, what ſhall he be that dare ſet himſelf againſt this? If God therefore, would haue no man periſh, but wold haue all men, by the knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth to be ſaued, their vntruth is manifeſt, which ſay, God would not haue all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaued, but hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated many to euerlaſting damnation. But, that our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences may the more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouſly be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God, touching this father<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly will of him: I wil ſet downe, foure moſt firme argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which may aboundantly aſſure vs, of the fauour of God, which ſtretcheth it ſelfe to all men, in eueryplace of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, without al reſpect of perſons, regions, ſexes, &amp; outward conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</p>
               <p>The firſt Argument is, <hi>The vniuerſall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of GOD:</hi> vnto all men: <hi>GOD</hi> himſelfe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4151:67"/>
ſpeaketh with his owne voyce from Heauen, and ſayth:<note place="margin">Mattth. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>This is my beloued Sonne, Heare him.</hi> And Chriſt ſendeth foorth his Diſciples into all the world,<note place="margin">Mar. 16.</note> with this commaundement: <hi>Goe yee into all the world, and proclayme the Goſpell to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature,</hi> (that is) <hi>To all men.</hi> Who then is ſo impudent, that hee dare ſay, <hi>GOD</hi> in deede, hath commaunded all men, that they ſhoulde heare the Goſpell, but in the meane ſeaſon, hee would certaine to be ſaued by faith, but certaine to be hardened, and condempned? They which doe ſo think of God, doe make him worſe, then any Tyrant, whiche ſhoulde commaund thoſe thinges which he neither willeth nor thincketh: and this is to haue two heartes, which <hi>GOD</hi> him ſelfe, highly deteſteth, and hateth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument, is, <hi>The free, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall promiſe of GOD. Come vnto mee</hi> (ſayth Chriſte,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note>) <hi>all which labour and be heauily laden, and I will refreſh you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 16.</note> Likewiſe, <hi>Hee which ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and be baptiſed, ſhalbe ſaued: but he which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth not ſhall be condemned.</hi> And <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith: <hi>Euery one whiche beleeueth ſhall not be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> Heereunto is to bee referred the whole mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> which is therefore inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>GOD,</hi> to bee in this worlde, that by the ſame, men might be brought vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God. Chriſte him ſelfe confeſſeth, that he came into this worlde, to ſaue ſinners: <hi>The Sonne of man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is come to ſeeke, and ſaue that which was loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third argument is taken, <hi>Of the price of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4151:67"/>
the Paſſion and death of Chriſte,</hi> whiche ſufficeth for the ſinnes of all men: <hi>He hath giuen him ſelfe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>a redemption for all men. Iohn</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">Iohn 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Beholde the Lambe of GOD which taketh away the ſinnes of the worlde.</hi> And Chriſte himſelfe ſayth: <hi>I, when I ſhall be lifte vp from the Earth, will drawe all men vnto me.</hi> Therfore <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth:<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Grace aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth aboue ſinne:</hi> becauſe the precious ſacrifice of Chriſte, is eſteemed of ſo great force, that it wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth out all ſinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth:<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſte is the propitiation for our ſinnes, and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole worlde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth argument, whiche aſſureth vs of the will of <hi>GOD,</hi> is: <hi>The ſealing of Grace,</hi> which is done by the Sacrament of Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Goe ye</hi> (ſayth Chriſt) <hi>and teach all nations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them: In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holie Ghoſte.</hi> This ſealing hee hath confirmed with his power, and preſence in this worlde. Of the firſt he ſayth: <hi>All power is giuen vnto mee, in Heauen, &amp; in Earth.</hi> Of the laſt, when he ſayth: <hi>Beholde I am with you, vnto the ende of the worlde.</hi> If therfore, we looke back, to the power of Chriſte: hee is able to bringe to paſſe all thinges, what ſo euer hee will, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and in Earth: Againe, if we looke vpon the commaundement: Chriſte willeth, all nations to be baptiſed, that this might bee a teſtimonie, that God will remit ſinnes, to all thoſe whiche beleeue, and turne them ſelues vnto him.</p>
               <p>To conclude, if we faſten our eyes vppon his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4151:68"/>
preſence: Chriſte himſelfe will appeare heere, who, baptiſing with the holy Ghoſte, woorketh that inwardly, which, the water, outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, doth ſignifie.</p>
               <p>By foure vnmouable arguments, therfore, we haue proued, this to be the wil of God: <hi>That he would haue all men to be ſaued,</hi> as many as turne them ſelues vnto him, by faith in Ieſus Chriſt. Whoſoeuer, therefore inwardly regardeth his ſaluation: let him ſtedfaſtly reſt in this will of <hi>GOD,</hi> which God hath not onely manifeſted in his woorde: but alſo, by many meanes effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually proued and ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Let vs therfore conclude, that they teach falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which to the ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring of the death, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſte: doe ſay, that his ſacrifice made for the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, is not profitable for all men, but for a certaine few elected.</p>
               <p>The ſecond errour is, of thoſe, which defend that there be certaine ſinnes, which cannot bee remitted, for the mirite of the paſſion and death of Chriſte. To this opinion theſe wordes of <hi>Paule</hi> are contrary:<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>VVhere ſinne did abounde: there Grace in Ieſu Chriſte, did ſuperabound.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Iohn,</hi> when he affirmeth, <hi>Chriſte to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſinnes of the worlde:</hi> giueth to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, that the ſacrifice of Chriſte is of farre greater force to ſaue: then the ſinnes of the whole worlde are to deſtroy. Therefore let vs thinke, that there is no ſinne greater: then to thinke, that there is any ſinne greater then the grace of <hi>GOD</hi> in Ieſu Chriſte.</p>

               <p>Furthermore, <hi>Paule,</hi> to the <hi>Hebrues</hi> ſheweth,<note place="margin">Heb. 6, 10.</note> what goeth before this ſin, before it be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: namely, <hi>To haue bene illuminated by the holy Ghoſte: To haue had the true knowledge of the perſon, and office of Chriſte: To haue taſted the good worde of GOD: And to haue beene partaker of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> The Turke, &amp; the Pope, which otherwiſe are execrable ſinners: (foraſmuch as they neuer poſſeſſed the holie Ghoſte,) haue no ſuch ſinne, whereby the teſtimony of the holie Ghoſt, by whome the trueth of the Goſpel was ſealed: is caſte foorth of their hearts.</p>

               <p>To this, <hi>Paule <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.</hi> maketh aunſwere: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot be renewed againe by repentance.</hi> And that, for this cauſe: becauſe they haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denyed the true foundation of repentance, namely, <hi>The ſacrifice of Chriſte:</hi> without the which, neither any healthfull repentance, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion by faith, can be made vnto <hi>GOD:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any other ſacrifice, which (without this alone) is able to take away ſinne.</p>

               <p>Chriſte is the ende of the Lawe, not for his owne cauſe: but for theirs which could not fulfil the lawe: ſo that he imputeth his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, which he hath obtayned by the law, to all thoſe which beleeue in him: that the lawe can not by any right, either accuſe, or condemne them. Therfore <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith: <hi>Chriſte is the ende of the Lawe, to ſaue all which beleeue:</hi> (that is to ſay) whoſoeuer beleeueth, hath that whiche the Lawe requireth: namely <hi>Righteouſneſſe,</hi> which is the way of ſaluation.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth ſheweth, <hi>To whome theſe good things doe come:</hi> namely, to thoſe, which in a true fayth, turne them ſelues vnto <hi>GOD,</hi> as now ſhalbe further ſaid touching the ſame. Let theſe things ſuffice concerning the firſte inſtrument, namely, the <hi>GOSPELL,</hi> by the miniſterye whereof <hi>GOD</hi> offereth ſaluation to all men. It is at large ſaide before, How the lawe is to vs,<note place="margin">Galla. 3.</note> a Scholemaiſter vnto Chriſte, whiche deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth vs from the curſe of the lawe.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde meane whereby Chriſte apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his benefits vnto vs is <hi>FAITH.</hi> For, euen as on Chriſtes part, the <hi>Goſpell</hi> is in ſteade of a hand, by which he reacheth foorth his benefits
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4151:79"/>
vnto vs: ſo, on our parte, <hi>Faith</hi> is in place of a hand, whiche receiueth Chriſte, beeing offred, with all his benefits.</p>
               <p>But, that it may bee vnderſtoode, what the true nature of <hi>Faith</hi> is, I will firſt ſet downe ſo manifeſt a definition of the ſame, that doubte may be lefte vnto no man, what the true, and Chriſtian faith is.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, I will rehearce, the naturall properties of <hi>Faith,</hi> by whiche euery one may eaſely perceiue, whether he hath the true, and naturall fayth, or no. When <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth him which beleeueth in the Sonne,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> to haue eternall life, he giueth warning, that the ſame is not els where to be ſought. For hee which hath the ſonne, hath the way to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life. The ſonne is the <hi>VVay,</hi> as he himſelf ſaith: <hi>I am the way.</hi> Moreouer, He which hath the Sonne, hath the gate of life, according to that ſaying: <hi>I am the doore.</hi> Furthermore, hee which hath the ſonne, hath the merit of eternall life. For, the ſonne did not merit eternall life for himſelfe, to whom, by right, it was due: but for his, (that is to ſay) for thoſe whiche beleeue in him. Beſides this, he which hath the Sonne, hath, with the Sonne all things. For,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> he which ſpared not his owne ſonne, but gaue him for vs all: how ſhould hee not alſo giue vs all things with him? To conclude, hee whiche hath the ſonne, is one with him: therfore, it can not bee, but he is veryly, and with the Sonne heyre of eternall life. He which hath the ſonne, hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:4151:80"/>
life it ſelfe, as hee himſelfe ſayth, <hi>I am the lyfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, whether thou ſeekeſt the way of life, or, the Doore, or, the merite, or, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and Lord, or euerlaſting life it ſelfe: thou haſte euery one of theſe in the Sonne,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> when thou beleeueſt in him. And contrarywiſe: <hi>Hee which beleeueth not in the Sonne, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of GOD abydeth vpon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heereby we may eſteeme, what the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and vtilitie of <hi>Fayth</hi> is, whiche no man can obtayne, but hee, whiche beeing firſt admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed (by the Lawe) of his ſinne: doth feele the greatneſſe of the anger of <hi>GOD,</hi> and iuſte condempnation.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the Scripture teacheth vs to be ſory for our ſinne, ſo that we would, that we had neuer ſinned, or offended <hi>GOD:</hi> and that we ſhould feele, a true greefe, &amp; ſorrowe of heart for our ſinnes committed. Hee which is gone ſo farre forwarde, hee at the length rightly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, how ioyfull that meſſage of the Goſpell is, which offereth to the beleeuers, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, the fauour of <hi>GOD,</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and life euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>But, what is <hi>FAITH?</hi> Theſe two manners of ſpeaking, namely: <hi>To beeleeue in Chriſt:</hi> And, <hi>To beleeue in the name of Chriſte,</hi> will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare vnto vs, the ſubſtance of <hi>Fayth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former ſentence, namely, <hi>To beleeue in Chriſte,</hi> ſheweth, Chriſte onely to be the obiect of Fayth, or ſure confidence: ſo, that Saluation is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:4151:80"/>
not to be hoped for, but in him alone.</p>
               <p>The latter, namely, <hi>To beleeue in the name of Chriſte,</hi> ſheweth the qualitie of Fayth, (that is to ſay) that our confidence in Chriſte, ſhould be ſuch, as his name is in the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and as his doinges are, which teſtifie of him.</p>
               <p>When as Chriſte therefore, is, in the Goſpell named the Sauiour of all whiche beleeue in him, <hi>very GOD, very MAN,</hi> one true and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall perſon, and, the Lambe of <hi>GOD,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the ſinnes of the worlde: And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples doe teſtifye, that the dooinges of Chriſte, doe aunſwere vnto this honourable name, (as the example of the Theefe vpon the Croſſe, the example of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> of <hi>Paule, Peeter,</hi> and innumerable others) it appeareth: that, true Fayth in <hi>CHRISTE</hi> is, <hi>A liuely,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the liuely and iuſtifying Fayth.</note> 
                  <hi>and conſtant confidence of the heart, whereby it is ſurely decreede, that CHRISTE is the Sauiour of all thoſe whiche beleeue in him, as hee whiche is able to bring to paſſe all thinges whiche hee will, as GOD: whiche wylleth the beſte vnto vs, as MAN, by the ſocietie of nature ioyned vnto vs: whiche muſte, as the Mediatour betwene GOD, and vs, appointed of the Father: whiche hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen himſelfe a pryce of redemption for vs, that euery one whiche beleeueth, might bee cleanſed from Sinne by his bloode, might bee iuſtifyed by his obedyence, regenerated to euerlaſtinge lyfe, by his ſpirite, through the vnmeaſurable mercie of GOD the Father, which ſo loued the worlde,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>that hee woulde giue his onely begotten Sonne,

that ALL VVHICHE BELEEVE IN HIM, ſhould not periſh, but haue life euerlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This fuller deſcription of a conſtant faythe, may bee drawne more narowe, and that out of the words of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt: (Hee which beleeueth in the Sonne, hath eternall life):</hi> in this manner: <hi>Faith is a knowledge of Chriſte, and a ſure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence of obtayning eternall life through him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such was the faith of the Theefe vpon the croſſe,<note place="margin">Luke. 23.</note> which from a ſure truſt ſayde: <hi>Remember me Lorde, when thou commeſt into thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> To whom it was anſwered of the Lord: <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradice.</hi> Such was the faith of the ſinfull woman in the <hi>7.</hi> of <hi>Luke,</hi> which heard of the Lord: <hi>Thy faith hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thee.</hi> In like manner of the <hi>Publicane, Luke</hi> the <hi>18.</hi> praying on this wiſe: <hi>God bee mercifull vnto me a ſinner:</hi> And of <hi>Dauid, Pſal. 25.

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt propertie of Faith is this: <hi>That it liueth in the heart of man,</hi> ſo, that there may bee felte, an vnſpeakeable conſolation, againſt the malediction of the lawe, the power of death, and the tyranny of the Deuill: that there may bee felte, a ioy, vnable to be tolde, of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and a ſpirituall ſecuritie, of the fauour, and freendſhip of God: that the dwelling of the holy Ghoſte, and his preſence in the heart of the man, may be perceiued: that the force of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſte, ſtirring vp fayth to call vpon God, may be perceiued: that a burning deſire, to obey the will of God, and to reſiſt the Deuil may bee perceiued: that a ſpirituall ioy of the beginning of the life eternall may bee felte: that thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towarde God, may be perceiued: Breefely, whereſoeuer a Chriſtian faith is in man, there it muſt needes be, that ſhe muſt ſhew foorth her ſelfe, by true godlyneſſe, by a holy porpoſe of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing well, and by reioycing in the holy ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I affirme this to be the property of Faith: <hi>That in outwarde woorkes ſhee offereth her ſelfe, to be ſeene:</hi> For the outwarde woorkes doe beare witneſſe of the affections of the heart. Therefore Chriſte ſayth: <hi>By their frutes ye ſhall know them.</hi> It is therfore impoſſible, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer true faith floriſheth in the heart, by the holy Ghoſte dwelling in the heart of man, that there ſhould not therewithall bee preſent, good
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:4151:82"/>
woorks teſtifying of the hart. Theſe workes of faith, are in generall, to eſchue euil, and to doe good: ſo, that faith be the foundation, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the leader, and gouerneſſe, of all vertues, and good actions. For firſt of all, <hi>Fayth</hi> is the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or foundation wherupon is ſtayed, and vpon the whiche is builded all obedience, vertue, and euery good woorke. Furthermore, it is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, from which, as from a liuing fountain, the riuers of all honeſt workes, and doings, doe flowe out. Moreouer, It is the leader, whiche holdeth man in the right way, leaſt hee ſhoulde decline either to the right hand, (that is to ſay) to good intentions of men (as they call them) which wil worſhip God according to their owne wiſedome, and traditions: or, vnto the left, that is to ſay, to the workes of the Deuill, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this worlde, with the members of the Deuil, hath wholy giuen, and bound it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Yea, <hi>Eayth</hi> beeing the Captaine of all vertue, and Chriſtian works, neuer reſteth it ſelf, in any deede obiected, or ſet before it, before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it heare this worde: <hi>So the mouth of the Lorde ſpeaketh:</hi> Therfore <hi>Dauid</hi> through fayth prayeth in the <hi>25. Pſal. Shew me thy wayes (O Lord) and teach me thy pathes:</hi> And <hi>Pſal. 119.</hi> he ſayth: <hi>Bleſſed are the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled in the way:</hi> that is, they whiche through faith ſhew obedience vnto <hi>GOD,</hi> ſo that they goe forward in the right way, declining neither to the right hand nor to the left. Laſt of all, faith is alſo the <hi>Gouerneſſe,</hi> directing the whole life of man, and all his works, to this marke: namely,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:4151:82"/>
to the glory of God, the edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vtilitie of his neighbour. All theſe works of Faith, already remembred, may bee called backe, to theſe foure pointes following.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, a declaration of godlyneſſe in the outward workes of this life: namely, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; felowſhip of the Chriſtians, to heare the word of God, and to cal vpon him, openly to profeſſe thy faith, &amp; vſe the ſacraments: In like maner with thy counſail, ſubſtance, and dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to ſet forwarde the glory of <hi>GOD,</hi> in ſuch ſorte, that thou maiſt be knowne, to bee earneſtly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in the buſineſſe, &amp; cauſe of God. This is that, which <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith <hi>Pſal. 122. I was glad, when they ſaid vnto me, we will go into the houſe of the Lorde.</hi> Item: <hi>Becauſe of the houſe of the Lorde our GOD, I will ſeeke to doe thee good.</hi> In which wordes <hi>Dauid</hi> ſheweth, that hee bent himſelfe wholy vnto this thing, that his ſubiectes might vnderſtand, that he went about this thing, with greateſt indeuor: that he might ſhew himſelf to be a miniſter of God, in the publique congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the godly, Which example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth Kings, &amp; princes, magiſtrats, &amp; ſubiects, to imitate, that by this meanes, they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, their faith and pietie, towardes God.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde is: The innocencie of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate life, ſo, that euery one of vs, euen when he is alone, doe thinke himſelfe, to be conuerſaunte in the ſight of God, and therefore, to abſtayne from all wantonneſſe, and iniquitie. Hereof it is,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> that God ſayd to <hi>Abraham: VValke before mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:4151:83"/>For, God doth not onely ſee thoſe thinges, which are ſet foorth to the ſunne light: but, hee alſo looketh into the inwarde cogitations of the hearte.</p>
               <p>The third is, Iuſtice, and Loue, to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed indifferently, towardes all men: So that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man doe, with a good conſcience, the dutie of his vocation, that the inferiours to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and to others placed in authoritie, doe yeelde due reuerence, and obedience: againe, the ſuperiours and potentates, doe, with counſaile, and diligence, aſſiſt their equals, and with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly care, and diſcipline defend their ſubiects: and moreouer, as much as in them is, comforte the afflicted, and releeue, with their plentie, the poores neceſſitie: yea, doubtleſſe, they ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme al men, to be members with them in our Lord Ieſu Chriſte. And, therefore, let them be of this minde towardes others, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they would to be doone to them ſelues, the ſame they ſhould do to them: and neuer witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and willingly, by any meanes, through iniury and iniuſtice oppreſſe others: Breefely: that thou doe liue in ſuch wiſe among men, that thou maiſt haue among all men, an honeſt teſtimonie of the fayth, and life of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The fourth is: <hi>Diligence in eche mans voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> whether it bee in the Church, or in the houſeholde, or in the common wealth, or in what ſoeuer kinde of office, which beeing, with fedeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and honeſtie performed, doth ſerue to the commoditie of the weale publique, and common
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:4151:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſocietie. In this behalfe, the rule of <hi>Paule <hi>Rom.</hi> 12</hi> is to be followed, by whiche he commaundeth euery man, to ſhewe in his office, faithfulneſſe, and diligence. And, that no man ſhould forſake, his lawfull vocation, bothe <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> doe giue counſaile: the Commandement of <hi>Paule</hi> is this: <hi>Let euery man abide in that vocation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>to the which he is called. Iohn</hi> counſayleth: that euery one bee iuſt in his calling: When the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> ſouldiers flocked together vnto him, that they might be baptized of him, and demaunded, what they ſhould doe: he had them not forſake their offices of warfare, or withdrawe themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues into the wilderneſſe, or, to put a <hi>Coule</hi> vpon them, the common couering of ſlouthfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts: but he anſwered vnto them: <hi>Hurte not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>nor quarell with no man, and be content with your wages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beholde here, what fruites of faith among men, <hi>Iohn</hi> requireth of the Souldiers? Let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian ſet before himſelfe this example, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one in his kinde of life: neither let them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly oppreſſe any man, but rather beſtow their diligence, to doe iuſtly the works of their vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which may be accomplyſhed, with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie and, and vtilitie of others. I wil ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore collect fiue things, as it were poynts, to the whiche euery one ought to haue reſpect, in his vocation, that he wander not out of the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST:</hi> Let the vocation be grounded vpon the worde of <hi>GOD,</hi> according vnto this rule: <hi>Euery office promoting the glory of GOD, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:4151:84"/>
making to the vpholding &amp; beautifiyng of the ſtates ordayned by God,</hi> (as the politicall, <hi>oeconomicall</hi> and Eccleſiaſtical ſtates) is commaunded by the firſt and fourth Commaundements.</p>
               <p>Secondly: <hi>Fayth</hi> and <hi>Charitie,</hi> are the rules of all actions, in eche vocation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: If any aduerſitie chaunce: we muſt looke back to the word of God, where vpon the vocation is founded, and from thence conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be required.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: let the vocation, be alwayes refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the glorye of God, and the profit of the common wealth, wherein eche man liueth.</p>
               <p>Fiftly: God is to be continually called vpon, for, whether the vocation be more honorable, or more profitable: without the ayde of God, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be either hapily begun, or brought to perfection.<note place="margin">Some read Et victum quere ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſte.</note> All theſe things <hi>Dauid</hi> in the <hi>37. Pſal.</hi> comprehendeth, in theſe wordes: <hi>Hope thou in the Lorde, and be doing good, dwell in the land, and verely, thou ſhalt be fedde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The thirde inſtrument, or meane, whereby Chriſte applyeth his benefits vnto vs, are, the Sacraments, and ſeales of his grace, and will. But, before that I come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> handling of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the new Teſtament, I will weigh two things, moſte neceſſary to be knowne. The firſt is, What the cuſtome of God hath beene, in opening his will vnto men. The other: Why God hath giuen to the ſignes, and ſacraments inſtituted by him, their names.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therfore, it is to be knowne, that God,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:4151:84"/>
from the beginning of the worlde, hath accoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make open his wil, vnto men, by two meanes, namely, <hi>By manifeſt VVord,</hi> and <hi>By out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Signe:</hi> that by this meanes, he might aſſiſt the ſaluation of man.</p>
               <p>When God had created <hi>Adam,</hi> and placed him in Paradiſe, he opened his will vnto him, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe worde, to the which he added, a double ſigne, namely, the tree of life, &amp; the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good, and euil: ſo that if he did obay the worde, he ſhould not waxe olde, but ſhould eate of the tree of life, &amp; liue bleſſed for euer: but if he did tranſgreſſe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God, &amp; eate of the forbidden tre of knowledge, he ſhould die.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Abraham</hi> likewiſe he proponed his worde, wherunto he adioyned the externall ſigne of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he called his couenant. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, he promiſed vnto <hi>Moſes,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would bring his people out of the ſeruitude of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the land of promiſe: to this his promiſe, he added a ſigne: namely, the paſchall Lamb. Afterwarde God promiſed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would giue vnto his people the lande of <hi>Canaan</hi> to poſſeſſe, as long as they ſhuld obey him, &amp; kepe his teſtament, &amp; his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: to this his word, he alſo added an outward ſigne, namely, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blood of the red Cow, wherwith the Prieſt ſprinkled the people, and many other ſignes which he named by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of couenant. Altogether after the ſame manner, Chriſt in the new Teſtament, promiſeth to the beleuers, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes, and regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the holy ghoſt, &amp; addeth an outwarde ſigne, which in the ſcripture is called <hi>The Baptiſme of Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:4151:85"/>He promiſeth alſo that he would offer his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, vpon the Altar of the Croſſe, and ſhed his blood for the remiſſion of ſinnes: and heere hee alſo adioyneth an outwarde ſigne, which he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his body, and blood, and the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And ſo it is manifeſt, what cuſtome God hath kept, in opening his wil vnto men, namely, <hi>BY VVORDE,</hi> and <hi>BY SIGNE:</hi> bothe which he hath ſet foorth, to be perceiued with the minde, and ſences, that we might be the eaſilyer and fullier of his wil inſtructed.</p>
               <p>Secondly: It is to be conſidered, why God hath giuen to the Sacramentall Signes, the names of the thinges themſelues, for whoſe cauſe the Sacraments are inſtituted. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, for this cauſe: that when wee doe vſe the outwarde ſignes, wee ſhould lift vp the eyes of Faith, to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauenly things, of which the outwarde ſignes haue obtayned their names. When <hi>Abraham</hi> circumciſed his ſonne, the name ſet vpon Circumciſion, by God, (wherwith, he named the ſame, his couenaunt with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeedes,) came into his minde. And <hi>Moſes</hi> when he ſprinkled the people with the blood of the red Cowe, thought vpon the name of <hi>TESTAMENT:</hi> whiche God had giuen vnto this ſigne. So in like manner, our Baptiſme, is called, <hi>The Baptiſme of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi> that wee might lifte vp the eyes of our hart, from the element of water, to the promiſe, wherewith <hi>GOD</hi> ſealeth vnto the repentant, his <hi>MERCIE</hi> and <hi>GRACE.</hi> For whiche
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:4151:85"/>
cauſe, Baptiſme is called, the <hi>Fountaine of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration:</hi> that we might conſider,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> that thoſe which are baptized, are ſpiritually borne again, by the holy Ghoſte. After the ſame manner Bread is named, the body of Chriſte, and wine the blood of Chriſt, in the Lords his ſupper: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they doe note foorth, that ſecret meate, which Chriſte, reacheth foorth, vnder the bread, and wine. To be ſhort: God of his infintie wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath giuen to the Signes, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, the names of the ſpirituall things, and giftes which by the Sacraments are ſignifyed: that wee ſhould not ſtick in thoſe things, which are ſeene with the eyes only, but in thoſe things rather, whiche Fayth ſeeth, and beholdeth in the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>After that wee haue expounded theſe two things of the ſubſtance of the Sacramentes in generall: wee may now be the eaſilyer brought vnto the knowledge of the Sacraments of the new Teſtament, of which I will now ſpeake in order.</p>

               <p>The appearing of the holy Ghoſt, in the ſhape of a Doue, ſignifieth that ſpirituall Baptiſme, wherwith Chriſt doth inwardly baptize: When the miniſter of God worketh the outward Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of water, according to the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt.

               <p>Furthermore, that we may, with the more frute, be occupyed, in the meditation of this our Baptiſme: a threfolde ſignifycation of the ſame is to be obſerued.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>The firſt is: that Baptiſme is, <hi>A teſtimony of Grace.</hi>

                  <item>The ſecond is: that it is, <hi>A Symbole,</hi> (or token) of ſecret and ſpirituall things.</item>

               </list>
               <p>Firſte, that Baptiſme is <hi>A teſtimonie of Grace,</hi> wee haue proued before. For, it is an outwarde ſeale of the grace of God, teſtifying, that the partie which is baptized, is ſanctifyed, and (as a ſacrifice) conſecrated vnto <hi>GOD:</hi> who regenerateth vs, beeing cleanſed and ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, from the deuil, &amp; his ſocietie, that we may

be made new men, yea, the ſonnes of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whome he adopteth in his beloued ſonne, our Lorde Ieſu Chriſte.</p>
               <p>Secondly: <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is <hi>A Symbole,</hi> (or token) of things, which by his proportion, or compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon teacheth vs.<note place="margin">Auguſt.

               <p>Baptiſme is <hi>A Symbole</hi> or token of two thinges, cheefely: namely, Of the doinges of Chriſte: <hi>And of our dutie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the doinges of Chriſte, it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs foure things: namely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhat hee hath doone:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVhy hee hath doone:</hi>

                  <hi>And moreouer, what he wil doe vnto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How then, doth Baptiſme teache vs, <hi>VVhat Chriſt hath doone?</hi> It putteth vs in minde of the hiſtory of the three dayes,<note place="margin">Paraſceues.</note> namely, of the day of the preparation, in which Chriſte ſuffred: And of the Saboth, in whiche Chriſte reſted in the Sepulchre: And of the day of Eaſter, in the which, Chriſte, (hauing ouercome death) roſe from the dead.</p>
               <p>Therefore, Chriſte calleth, his death, buriall, and Reſurrection, <hi>BAPTISME, Marke. 10.</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:4151:87"/>
where the ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> required, that the one might ſit on the righte hand of Chriſte, the other on the left, in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: to whome Chriſte anſwereth: <hi>Are ye able to drinke of the Cup, which I ſhall drinke of, and to be baptized with the Baptiſme, wherewith I am bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed?</hi> As though the Lorde ſhoulde ſay: yee all aſpire to ioy, and glory, but ye muſt of neceſſitie ſuffer ſomewhat, before that it ſhalbe lawful to inioy this glory, and gladneſſe. Moſte bitter death falleth in, ouer whome we muſt triumph, before we come vnto this glory. Therfore, to be ſprinkled with the water in Baptiſme, noteth foorth the death of Chriſte: to tary vnder the water, ſhadoweth foorth his buriall. To bee drawne from the water: repreſenteth the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reſurrection of Chriſte. As often therfore, as we remember our baptiſme, or be preſent at the Baptiſme of others: let vs call to minde the hiſtory of the three dayes, <hi>Of the Death, Buriall,</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſte.</p>
               <p>But if you demaunde, <hi>VVhy Chriſte hath doone this? Paul</hi> aunſwereth, and in two words knitteth together the whole matter, in <hi>Rom. 4. Chriſte</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>dyed FOR OVR SINNES, and was raiſed againe, FOR OVR IVSTIFICATION.</hi> For, as Chriſte, by the merite of his death, wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth out our iniquities: and by his blood clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth our conſciences from all mortall, ſinne: So, in like manner, by his reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from death, he declareth himſelfe to be righteous, and in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes perfectly pure, according to the lawe of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:4151:88"/>
God. Therfore <hi>Dauid</hi> in the <hi>16. Pſal.</hi> ſayth: <hi>Thou ſhalt not leaue my ſoule in hel, neither ſhalt thou ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thine holy one, to ſee corruption.</hi> Chriſte alſo meaneth the ſame thing, when he ſaith in <hi>Ioh. 16 The holy Ghoſt ſhall reprehend the world of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, becauſe I go to the father:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Herode, Pilate, and the Iewes, deny me to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and without all ſinne: but when they ſhall ſee me, not to be ouercome of death: my reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from death, ſhalbe a teſtimony of my righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, before them. For that cauſe <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee was rayſed againe for our iuſtifycation:</hi> that is to ſay: that by his riſing againe he might declare his owne righteouſneſſe, which righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, he giueth, and imputeth vnto all thoſe which beleeue in him.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, <hi>VVhat Chriſte doth in Baptiſme Iohn</hi> ſheweth ſaying: <hi>He baptizeth with the holy Ghoſte,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and with fyer.</hi> And <hi>Paule,</hi> when he ſaith: <hi>He cleanſeth vs in the fountaine of water,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>through the worde.</hi> Whereas <hi>Iohn</hi> affirmeth, Chriſte, to baptiſe, <hi>VVith the HOLIE GHOST,</hi> and <hi>VVith FYER:</hi> he ſheweth that Chriſte giueth in Baptiſme, the holye Ghoſte: who, by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is effectuall, in the worde, and Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>What the holy Ghoſt woorketh in the partie which is baptized, according to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt: is ſhewed by the word, <hi>Fyer:</hi> For as the Fyer altereth things ſometimes by bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out, ſometimes by inflaming: So the holy Ghoſt, altereth man by regenerating, burneth out by mortifying the olde man: inflameth by
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:4151:88"/>
quickening, and rayſing vp the new man. And heereof it is, that <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth: <hi>Chriſte clenſeth vs in the fountaine of water, through the word of life.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In which words hee ioyneth together three things, namely, <hi>Outwarde Baptiſme,</hi> which hee calleth <hi>The fountaine of water.</hi> Then, Chriſte, who cleanſeth vs inwardly with his blood, and holy ſpirit: And laſtly, <hi>The VVorde,</hi> that is, <hi>The promiſe of Chriſte,</hi> whereupon the whole effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Baptiſme doth depend.</p>
               <p>For, Baptiſme is not effectuall, for the water which the Miniſter of God ſprinckleth, neither for the words, which are recited by him: but all the force of Baptiſme floweth from the moſte ample promiſe of Chriſt: who (with his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and with fier) baptizeth him, which, with the externall element of water, is ſprinkled.</p>
               <p>But although this be the inſtitution, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce of Chriſte: yet notwithſtanding, let vs not thinke, his hand to be ſhortened, to baptize ſpiritually without water, thoſe which are parta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kers of his promiſe, (that is to ſay) all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes of the Chriſtians: and thoſe cheefely, whiche departing in the mothers wombe, doe not touche the outwarde Baptiſme. Therefore godly Parents ſhould not deſpayre of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of ſuch Infantes, neither with vncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe, and contempt, bury them in a grounde (which the common people call) not conſecrated: but let them ſurely perſuade themſelues, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe are in the ſame couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, with the children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> as <hi>Paule</hi> in <hi>Gallath. 3.</hi> plainely teacheth.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:4151:89"/>
Therfore, as <note n="*" place="margin">Such as came of his fleſh.</note> the fleſhely children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which departed this life, before the eight day of Circumciſion: were not condemned: but by the vertue of the promiſe, and couenaunt of <hi>GOD,</hi> were ſaued: ſo, alſo after the ſame manner, the ſpirituall Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (that is to ſay) the infantes of all the Chriſtians, are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, if they deceaſe before baptiſme: but are ſaued by the efficatie of the promiſe of God, and by inuiſible baptiſme, wherewith Chriſte bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeth them, who, (by his death, and precious blood) hath redeemed them.</p>
               <p>With this conſolation, let chriſtian Parents lifte vp themſelues, whoſe Children, departe hence, either in the mothers wombe, or foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with after the birth, before they be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Baptiſme. Yet, I would not, that any ſhould heereof take occaſion to protract to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Infants: yea rather, I am an exhorter, that aſſoone as they be newe borne, they ſhould haue a regarde to haue them ſealed, with this outwarde <hi>Symbole</hi> (or token) of ſaluation, and therewithall to be aſſiſted, with the prayers of the godly, whiche ſhall bee preſent at the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
               <p>It remayneth now to be explycated, <hi>VVhat Chriſte wil doe to thoſe which are Baptized.</hi> This thing he himſelfe ſheweth in his laſt comaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, aſcending vnto heauen, he gaue to his Apoſtles in theſe wordes: <hi>Go, and Baptiſe all nations, whoſoeuer beleueth, and is Baptized, ſhalbe ſaued, but he that beleeueth not, ſhalbe condemned.</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:4151:89"/>
For, euen as they whiche were in the Arke of <hi>Noah,</hi> were preſerued from the floud: ſo, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer doth earneſtly ſtick to the couenant of this outwarde Baptiſme, are deliuered from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting floud, (that is to ſay) from the paines and torments of Hel, by <hi>IESVS CHRIST.</hi> Breefely, as he which is baptized is drawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the water, ſo Chriſte will take vs from all cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and bring vs into his kingdome, where, with him we ſhall reigne in all eternitie.</p>
               <p>After that we haue ſayd, <hi>How our Baptiſme, is a Symbole,</hi> (or token) of the actions of Chriſt: we will now ſee, <hi>Howe it alſo admoniſheth vs of our dutie</hi> (that is to ſay) <hi>what we ſhuld perfourme vnto GOD: what we owe vnto our ſelues, what we muſt ſuffer: And what we muſt looke for: How we muſt paſſe from miſeryes to ſaluation:</hi> For of euery of theſe partes of our duetie, our Baptiſme doth admoniſh vs.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>VVhat ſhall we performe vnto GOD?</hi> This Chriſte teacheth vs, when hee ſayth: <hi>Baptize them, In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſte.</hi> In which woordes, hee comprehendeth the principall end of Baptiſme: which, (it were conuenient) we ſhould alwayes, and continually haue in remembrance. For, this is the moſte ſimple, and plaine meaning of theſe wordes: <hi>I Baptize thee, in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt:</hi> that is to ſay: I Baptize thee to this ende cheefely: that thou ſhouldeſt acknowledge, confeſſe, inuocate, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and honour, this only true <hi>GOD,</hi> namely:

               <p>In the ſeconde place Baptiſme warneth vs, <hi>VVhat we ſhoulde doe to our ſelues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As we are dipped in the water of Baptiſme, and tary vnder the water, and are drawen from thence againe: ſo we ſhould mortifye ſinne, and choke the vitious affections, deſyres of ſinne and corrupt concupiſcences in vs, &amp; riſe againe in newneſſe of life. Of this thing <hi>Paule Rom. 6.</hi> doth admoniſh vs, where he inueigheth againſt thoſe, which ſuppoſed, that libertie to ſinne was graunted, becauſe that <hi>Paule</hi> had ſayd, <hi>VVhere ſinne did abounde, there Grace did more abounde:</hi> Whom hee confuteth with theſe words: <hi>VVhat ſhall we ſay then, ſhall wee abide in ſinne, that Grace may abounde? God forbidde.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Howe ſhall we which are deade to ſinne,</hi> (that is to ſay) (whoſe ſinne is deade) <hi>liue any longer therein? Knowe yee not, that wee whiche are Baptized into IESVS CHRISTE, are Baptized to dye with him?</hi> (that is to ſay, we which are baptized doe, in Baptiſme put on Chriſte, whoſe death doth effectually, kill, and keepe vnder ſinne in vs, that it ſhoulde not reigne in vs.) <hi>VVee are therefore buryed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him by Baptiſme, for to dye,</hi> (that is, that ſinne might bee deade in vs,) <hi>that euen as Chriſt was rayſed vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, by the glory of the father, ſo we alſo ſhoulde walke in newneſſe of life.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And ſo it appeareth, how <hi>Paule,</hi> by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our Baptiſme teacheth vs, to mortifye ſinne, to deſtroy the wicked concupiſcences, and to walke in a new life. Whereunto he alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth the ſcope of his whole diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he ſetteth downe in theſe wordes: <hi>And ſo doe ye alſo eſteeme your ſelues to be dead vnto ſinne: But, to liue vnto GOD, in Chriſte Ieſu our Lorde.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THIRDLY,</hi> Baptiſme teacheth vs, <hi>VVhat we muſt ſuffer.</hi> For, euen as Chriſte, (whome, in Baptiſme wee doe put on) was baptized with the croſſe: ſo we alſo, as long as we remaine in this worlde, let vs prepare our ſelues, to the Croſſe and aduerſities.</p>
               <p>Yea, <hi>GOD</hi> will by this meanes haue his adopted ſonnes, to be made like to his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſonne: that they may reign together with

               </p>
               <p>The hiſtory of the Paſſion of our Lord Ieſu Chriſt, ſetteth before vs, three kindes of croſſes, vnto which may be referred, the diuerſe ſortes of all calamities, which may happen vnto man in this life.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>The firſt Croſſe, is the croſſe of Chriſt, which is ſeene in the middle, betwene two others.</item>
                  <item>The ſecond, is, of the Theefe, hanging on the right hand.</item>
                  <item>The third, of the Theefe hanging on the left hand.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Chriſte, (aſmuch as concerneth his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) ſuffered, beeing innocent: but bothe theſe Theeues, ſuffred iuſtly, for their offences. But he which hanged at the right hand: repented vnder the Croſſe, and beeing conuerted vnto Chriſte, obtayned comforte, and ſaluation. The other at the left hand, continued ſtifly in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and dying without repentaunce was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned.</p>
               <p>After this ſame manner, it alſo goeth at
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:4151:92"/>
this day. The greateſt parte of the godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, doe ſuffer perſecution for righteouſneſſe ſake, which happeneth to many holie Martyrs, whome Chriſte pronounceth, bleſſed, in <hi>Matth. 5. Bleſſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are they, which ſuffer perſecution for righteouſneſſe ſake, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen: Bleſſed are ye when men reuile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall falſely ſay all manner of euill againſt you for my ſake: Reioyce, and bee glad, for great is your reward in heauen: for ſo did they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the prophets which haue beene before you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many doe alſo ſuffer, as the theefe, vpon the right hand. Theſe are they, which, for their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine offences are puniſhed of God, namely, by taking away their goodes, Children, powers, helth, body: or els doe fall into the hands of the Magiſtrate, and are drawen vnto puniſhment, as alſo vnto this Theefe, it happened.</p>
               <p>Theſe beeing oppreſſed with calamities, and puniſhments, do confeſſe, themſelues to be iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed for their ſinnes, and flying vnto Chriſt, doe (with a firme faith) deſire forgiuenes of their offences. And by this meanes they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pardon of God, whiche accepteth their croſſe as a ſacrifice pleaſant vnto him, through Ieſus Chriſte. The example of this Theefe, is, by the ſingular wiſdome of God, ſet downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all wretched ſinners, theeues, murtherers, and others whatſoeuer: whiche for their euill deedes are puniſhed: that the ſame might be an euident teſtimony of the fauour of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he receiueth al, with howſoeuer infamous
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:4151:92"/>
kinde of puniſhment, they bee puniſhed in the ſight of the worlde, ſo that they, with a conſtant fayth, doe flye vnto Ieſus Chriſte.</p>
               <p>But, that the wretched offenders, whiche are to be puniſhed for their offences, may know by what meane they may obtaine the fauoure of <hi>GOD:</hi> I will ſet downe certaine ſure Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles according vnto whiche, they may directe their cogitations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST</hi> of all, the wretched ſinner, which is to be puniſhed for his manifeſt offences, ſhall not hypocritically make ſclender his ſinne, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by conferring of his ſinne, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſinnes of other offenders, deceiue himſelfe: but rather, he ſhall examine himſelfe, and weigh (not in deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ballances) the heuineſſe of his iniquitie. Let him conſider who it is, whom he hath offended, namely, <hi>GOD,</hi> a righteous Iudge, from whom nothing can be hid: therefore, let him eſteeme himſelfe worthy, who deſeruedly, (for the inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and fylthyneſſe of his ſinne) is vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, the name of a man.</p>
               <p>Such manner of cogitations do breed in man, a knowledge of himſelfe, and ſtirre vp a feeling, and taſte, of the bitterneſſe of death, and hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SECONDLY:</hi> Leaſt (feeling the ſorrows of Hel,) he ſhould deſpayre of the grace of God, for the greatneſſe of his ſinne: as <hi>Cayne, Iudas, Saule,</hi> and many others haue doone: theſe fiue things are to be thought vpon.</p>
               <p>Firſt: The promiſe, and good will of God, ſaying: <hi>I will not the death of a ſinner, but that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:4151:93"/>
hee may bee conuerted, and liue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore: the commaundement of God, earneſtly commaunding repentance, vnder the rigour of obedience, whiche all creatures are bounde to performe vnto him. <hi>O yee Sonnes of men</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>turne ye vnto me.</hi> Item: <hi>Let euery one be turned from his wicked wayes.</hi> And Chriſt ſayth:<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Come vnto mee, all yee which labour, and be heauily loden, and I will refreſhe you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly: Let him ſet before him, the death and paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt, who, with his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient raunſome, hath made ſatiſfaction, for the ſinnes of all men. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth: <hi>The mercy of GOD is greater, than the miſerye of all ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly: Let him ſet before his eyes, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of thoſe, whiche beeing conuerted, haue beene receiued into grace: as <hi>Adam, Dauid, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes,</hi> the Theefe, and as many as euer haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired pardon: ſo, that God hath neuer reiected any, earneſtly repenting.</p>
               <p>Fifthly: Let him conſider, the teſtimonie of <hi>Grace,</hi> namely: <hi>Baptiſme:</hi> whereby God teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he will remit ſinne to all thoſe, whiche (by faith) turne themſelues vnto him. It is written <hi>Marck. 1.</hi> that <hi>Iohn</hi> preached the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Repentance, for the remiſſion of ſinnes: that is, he taught, Baptiſme to be a teſtimonye, and ſeale, by whiche <hi>GOD</hi> teſtifyeth, that hee (without all reſpect of perſons) remitteth ſinne, to all thoſe (whiche by faith) turne themſelues vnto Ieſus Chriſte.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THIRDLY:</hi> the wretched offender beeing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:4151:93"/>
exerciſed, with theſe fiue conſiderations, let him now giue place to the worde of God: by the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catie wherof, (the holy Ghoſt working) the ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle of Faith, is conceiued, in the heart of man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FOVRTHLY:</hi> Faith beeing conceiued: forgiueneſſe of ſinnes is to bee deſyred, for the precious blood of Chriſte, whiche he ſhed vppon the Altar of the Croſſe, for the ſinnes of the whole worlde. In this praying, faith (by little, and little) increaſeth, and together therewith, man feeleth in his heart the anſwere of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſte, which bringeth to paſſe that he moſt aſſuredly perſuadeth himſelfe that all his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are forgiuen him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIFTLY:</hi> Pardon of ſinne in the ſight of <hi>GOD,</hi> beeing obtayned: let him with a quiet minde ſubmit himſelfe, to the puniſhment deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and together therewith, let him deſire of God, fortitude of minde, that he may patiently ſuffer the paines, layde iuſtly vpon him, for his wicked deedes: yea, let him alſo giue thankes vnto God, whiche hath drawen him to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhments in this world: that he ſhuld flye from eternall condemnation: and that he ſhould heere in the body be puniſhed, that with the Theefe hee may commende his ſoule vnto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The thirde</hi> kinde of Croſſe, whereof the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the paſſion of Chriſte maketh mention is, <hi>The Croſſe of the Theefe hanging at the lefte hand.</hi> After this manner they doe ſuffer, which repent not, neither call vpon God: but contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:4151:94"/>
the grace, and ſacrifice of Chriſte, do dye in deſperation, and are for euer condemned. They which in ſuch ſorte doo ſuffer for their offences, and fly not, by a ſure fayth, vnto God: this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie Croſſe, is vnto them, as foreſhowinges of the paynes eternall, wherewith they ſhalbee plagued, without all mitigation, and comforte in Hell with the Deuilles, and all the company of the condemned. Hetherto, we haue intreated of the three ſortes of Croſſes, wherof the hiſtory of the Paſſion of Chriſte, maketh mention.</p>
               <p>Now, let vs moreouer ioyne heerevnto, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall admonition: whiche may profit all the godly, in what ſoeuer manner they ſhalbe afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this worlde.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer is oppreſſed with the croſſe or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie, let him reſpecte theſe foure thinges in order.</p>
               <p>
                  <list>
                     <item>In the Deuill, let him conſider, Lying and Murther.</item>
                     <item>In himſelfe let him weigh, Sinne, and VVret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſſe.</item>
                     <item>In GOD, let him reuerence, Iudgement and Mercie.</item>
                     <item>In the Goſpel let him ſeeke counſaile, &amp; helpe.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt: <hi>Let him conſider in the Deuill, Lying, and Tyranny,</hi> who as by lying he ſlewe our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: ſo now euery moment, with lying, and tyranny, hee lyeth in waite for all mankinde.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Peter.</note>For, (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth) <hi>Hee goeth aboute like a roring Lyon, ſeking whom he may deuoure.</hi> He ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely ſeketh all, but he deuoureth only thoſe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:4151:94"/>
he intangleth in his ſnares of Lying. For this vncleane ſpirite continually indeuoureth, to make all other vncleane with him. Hee infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the minde with lying, and erronious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: He ſhaketh the hearte, with the tempeſts of corrupt deſyres: He bewitcheth the will, with the ſhadowe of commodytie: to conclude, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoreth to defile, with wicked actes, the whole life of man, that he, that he at the length might haue man (beeing ſpiritually ſlaine) fellowe, and partaker of eternall damnation. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the ſtudy of this wicked ſpirite, the enemye of <hi>GOD,</hi> and mankinde: ſhoulde ſtirre vp an hatred of ſinne, and breede in the mindes of men, an abhorring of the filthyneſſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly: <hi>Let him weigh Sinne, and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſſe in himſelfe,</hi> in euen ballances, and let him thinke that the miſery whiche he ſuffereth, is a deſerued puniſhment, for his ſinne. And, by the greatneſſe of the miſery, let him eſteeme the enormitie, turpitude, &amp; multitude of his ſinnes. Let him conſider, that hee by his ſinne, hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the cheefeſt, and infinite goodneſſe: wher of let him conclude, the preſent calamitie, to bee away to euerlaſting miſery, vnleſſe he be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes holpen. In this cogitation the whole man treembleth, of whiche thing we may ſee many examples, in many Pſalmes, cheefely in thoſe, whiche they call, the Penitentiall Pſalmes, in whiche, <hi>Dauid</hi> plainely expreſſeth, the great dolors, and vexations, wherewith,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:4151:95"/>
as with tempeſtes, he is ouerwelmed for his ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let him reuerence in God, <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Mercy.</hi> It is the parte of the moſt iuſt iudgement of God, to puniſh ſinne in all men: but of his <hi>Mercy</hi> to puniſh, not to deſtroy, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might ſaue: ſo that we do not contempne the Medicine. Whereof <hi>Eſaie</hi> ſaith: <hi>Trouble giueth vnderſtanding.</hi> Item: <hi>The diſtreſſe wherein they cry, is a doctrine vnto them.</hi> Breefely, God puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth <hi>By IVDGEMENT,</hi> that hee might ſaue <hi>By MERCIE:</hi> as it may bee ſeene in <hi>Pſal. 51.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the word of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel, Let him ſeeke coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail and remedyes. The Goſpell ſendeth all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſinners to this onely Phyſition Ieſus Chriſte, which calleth vnto him, and ſaueth all offenders. This counſaile is moſte excellent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither in Heauen, nor in earth, any is founde, which is able to heale the wounds of ſin beſide this onely Ieſus Chriſte.</p>
               <p>Furthermore: this very worde which giueth vs counſaile, doth alſo miniſter helpe vnto vs, and healeth the woundes of ſinne, in ſuch wiſe, that we may be holpen by Chriſt, ſo that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, and with a conſtant Fayth, pray with <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Heale me Lorde, and I ſhall be whole.</hi> In this place againe, are to be called back into our mindes, the fiue Articles, of whome mention is made a little before.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Finall cauſes,</hi> wherefore <hi>GOD</hi> will haue his Church to bee ſubiecte to the Croſſe,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:4151:95"/>
are many, of which theſe are the cheefe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that wee may learne, that thoſe good things whiche God hath promiſed to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are not to be looked for in this worlde: but that we ſhould think of the true countrie, to the which we are called: ſo that wee might eaſe all the aduerſities of this life, by the meditation of the ioy to come, and life euerlaſting. For, if all things ſhould ſucceed vnto the godly, in this life, according vnto their deſires: they would not be affectioned with the deſire of the good thinges promiſed by Chriſte.</p>
               <p>Secondly: that, man, (by the Croſſe, as by a bridle) may be reſtrayned: who, through the corruption of nature, is otherwiſe prone to ſinne. Heereof the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſayth: <hi>Holde their chawes with bit, and bridle, which drawe not nigh vnto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly: that the Croſſe might be a ſenſible preaching of repentance. For, euen as the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence aſſenteth to the law, reprouing ſinne: ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the Croſſe, we are admoniſhed to repent, that we may be ſaued.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: That the croſſe may ouerthrowe al mans preſumption, and confidence of the fleſh, and teach vs to cleaue with a firme fayth vnto <hi>GOD</hi> alone, and to call vpon him,<note place="margin">Pſalm.</note> according to his Commaundement: <hi>Call vpon me</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>in the day of tribulation, and I will deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie mee.</hi> Let theſe things ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to be ſpoken touching the Croſſe or calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of which our Baptiſme doth admoniſh vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:4151:96"/>
                  <hi>IN THE FOVRTH PLACE</hi> Baptiſme teacheth vs what wee ſhould looke for. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the partie Baptiſed, (beeing ſprinkled with the water) is drawen from the water, and as Chriſte himſelfe (after his paſſion and death) entred into his glory: ſo wee alſo doe take our iourney from the ſtraunge wandring of this world, vnto ſaluation, &amp; life euerlaſting: a moſte euident teſtimonie wherof, Chriſte hath giuen, namely Baptiſme, to all the beleeuers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IN THE FIFT PLACE,</hi> Baptiſme tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, that our life in this worlde, is nothing els than a Pilgrimage of three dayes. Wee ſuffer, we are buryed, and we ſhall ryſe againe, at the ſound of the laſt Trumpet, when Chriſte ſhall ſay, <hi>Aryſe yee Deade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE third ſignifycation,</hi> of Baptiſme, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee haue made mention aboue, is, that it is a Souldierly marcke (or Cogniſance) whereby the Souldiours of Chriſte are knowen, whiche haue giuen their names vnto him, and taken an othe, that they will fight vnder his ſtanderde, agaynſt the Deuill, and his kingdome, namely, Sinne.</p>
               <p>The Souldiours of Chriſte, are diſcerned, by foure notes, cheefely, from thoſe whiche are in wages vnder their Captaine, the Deuill.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly: The Supper of the Lorde teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth, that they which vſe the ſame rightly, are vnited, and as it were incorporated into Chriſt, and that ſpiritually, according to the woords of <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>The Cup of bleſſing which we bleſſe, is it not the partaking of the blood of Chriſte?

               <p>Thirdly: the Supper of the Lord teacheth, a ſpirituall education in the body of Chriſte, which is accomplyſhed, whilſt we vſe his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:4151:97"/>
benefite of the body, and blood of Chriſt: rightly vſing the Supper of the Lord, according to his owne inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: the Supper of the Lord is, a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the new Teſtamente, (that is to ſay) of <hi>A NEVV COVENANT,</hi> betweene God, and man, touching remiſſion of ſinnes, wherby God teſtifyeth that hee will receiue into fauour, and forgiue ſinners, (for the merite of the death, &amp; paſſion of Chriſt) to <hi>All which beleeue in HIM.</hi> Therfore he himſelfe ſayth: <hi>This Cup is the new Teſtament in my blood:</hi> that is, This Cuppe is a firme, and vnmoueable ſeale of the moſte ample promiſe of god co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forgiuenes of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer therefore, (with a true, and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith) vſeth this Sacrament: receiueth the teſtimonie of God himſelfe: whereby he teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he hath deliuered his ſonne, ſhedding his blood vpon the Altar of the Croſſe, for the remiſſion of ſinnes, that through him, as many as beleeue in him, may obtaine ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Fiftly: The Supper of the Lord, admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs of the ſecret, and ſpirituall communion, whereby we, whiche doe partake this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together: are vnited, (as it were) into one body.

                  <hi>Becauſe wee beeing many, are one bread, and ONE BODY: inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we are all partakers of one breade.</hi> This knitting of the Chriſtians into one body, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth heereon: that we all, (as it is already ſaid) are vnited to the body of Chriſte, by the parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his body, and blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:4151:98"/>Sixtly: The Supper of the Lord requireth, mutuall loue betweene the Communicantes: whereby the miſticall members of the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, (as we haue ſaid) ſhoulde, with heart, word, and worke, performe duetyes one towardes the other. This Loue of Chriſtian people, which, (from the head <hi>CHRISTE)</hi> floweth into the reſt of the members (that is to ſay, the Citizens of his Church) doth not take away the degrees of perſons, but rather confirmeth the diuerſities of callings in the Congregation: of all whiche, there is one marke, namely, <hi>The Glory of God,</hi> and the commoditie of thy neighbour. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer feeleth, not in his heart, the ſparckle of this mutiall dilection, and, (without a purpoſe of well dooing to his member, (that is to ſay to his neighbour) commeth to the Supper of the Lorde: it were better for him, to abſtaine vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Sacrament. For who would not affirme that manne to bee mad, and out of his minde, whiche would ſet his owne members at ſtrife one with another amongeſt themſelues, ſo that the handes might plucke, out the eyes, or cut of the feete? I woulde to <hi>GOD,</hi> that Chriſtians could, after the ſame manner, marke their owne madneſſe, whiche they doe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly betray, and ſhowe forth, whilſte (through mutuall hatreds, and contentions of minde,) they ſet themſelues, one againſt another.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly: The Supper of the Lord is a pledge, and ſignification of our reſurrection, life, and eternall ſaluation, and that by the power of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:4151:98"/>
Chriſte riſen againe from the dead. For, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hath beene hetherto ſpoken, of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, are al to be referred to this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall end: that they may bee vnto vs in ſteade of a pledge, &amp; ſealing of life euerlaſting through Chriſte, whoſe members we are made. And ſo that is fulfilled which Chriſt ſaith:<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>He which ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth my fleſh, and drincketh my blood, hath eternall life, and I will rayſe him vp in the laſt day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe Articles, which we haue brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade out of the holy Scripture, to the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this doctrine of the ſupper of the Lorde: euery man may eaſily vnderſtand, how needeful it is (with a hygh godlyneſſe of minde, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) to approch to this ſupper, &amp; to proue him ſelfe, before he eate of this bread, or drinke of the Cup of the Lorde. For,<note place="margin">1.

                  <note place="margin">Mar. 16.</note> Chriſt affirmeth the ſame thing of the Goſpell: <hi>Hee which beleeueth not</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>ſhalbe condemned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth of <hi>Baptiſme: Euen as he whiche vnworthyly eateth the body of the Lorde, and drinketh his blood, eateth, and drincketh his omne damnation: ſo he which receiueth Baptiſme vnwoorthily (which thing many Iewes doe at this day) receiueth to himſelf damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not ſaluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, Leaſt any man ſhoulde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Supper of the Lord, vnworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let him followe, the counſayle of <hi>Paule</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. <hi>Let a man proue himſelfe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſo let
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:4151:99"/>
him eate of that Bread and drinke of that Cuppe, for he which eateth and drinketh vnworthyly, eateth, and drinketh damnation to himſelf, not deſcerning the Lords body:</hi> (that is to ſay) hee calleth vnto himſelfe the puniſhment, and Iudgement of <hi>GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What therefore is the true manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing himſelfe? The ſame <hi>Paule</hi> preſcrybeth, <hi>2. Cor. 13.</hi> when he ſaith: <hi>Try your ſelues whether ye be in faith or no, proue your owne ſelues. Knowe yee not your ſelues, that Ieſus Chriſte is in you?</hi> Heereby it appeareth that the true tryall of proouing conſiſteth in this, that a liuely faith bee truely felt, and the preſence of Chriſte in vs, by the vertue of his ſpirit, ſtirring vs vp to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of godlyneſſe. Breifely: he is truely prooued, which (reuerently in the feare of <hi>GOD,</hi> in true repentance, in true confidence, and with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purpoſe,) commeth to this Supper. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe, he which is without the true feare of God, and earneſt repentance, and wanteth liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fayth, and an holy purpoſe: the ſame eateth, and drinketh iudgement to himſelfe bothe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and eternall, vnleſſe he be againe (by faith in Ieſus Chriſte) conuerted. And I nothing doubt, but the greateſt parte of moſte heauy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, euery where reigning in many places, is therefore ſente: becauſe they bee ſo common which participate the ſupper of the Lord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true, and earneſt repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paule</hi> writeth, that the <hi>Corinthyans</hi> were plagued, becauſe they touched vnreuerently the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:4151:99"/>
holy Supper:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>For this cauſe</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>many are feeble and weake among you, and many are fallen a ſleep: For if wee had iudged our ſelues, wee ſhould not haue beene iudged: but when we are iudged of the Lorde, we are inſtructed, that we ſhould not bee damned, with the worlde.</hi> I would to God, that many at this day, would not builde vpon a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble foundation, and be much deceiued with their owne opinion: which then ſuppoſe themſelues to come woorthyly to the Supper of Chriſt, when they haue confeſſed their ſinnes before the preiſt and obtayned abſolution of him. He which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth, him God abſolueth for the death, and paſſion of Ieſus Chriſte. For, he which belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth (ſaith <hi>Iohn)</hi> hath eternall life.<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> If therefore the beleeuer hath eternall life, hee is alſo (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt) abſolued from all his ſinnes. For, <hi>Abſolution,</hi> is no other thing, than a deliuerance from ſin, which is in the power of <hi>GOD</hi> alone.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the Miniſters of the woord, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abſolue him, (which is without the feare of God, a liuely faith, and a purpoſe of good liuing) from the leaſt offence. And he which is ſuch a one, &amp; yet notwithſtanding, dare require abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Miniſter of the worde: to him (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as hee is before God a lyer, and before the Miniſter of God, and hypocrite) the abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on turneth vnto damnation. For, this outwarde abſolution anſwereth to the faith, and purpoſe of the innermoſte heart. The Prieſt is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God, therefore let him behaue himſelfe according to the commaundement of his Lord,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:4151:100"/>
neither let him arrogate greater power vnto himſelfe, then hee hath receiued of the Lorde. He hath power to ſhew foorth, aſwell, remiſſion of ſinnes to all the beleeuers, as alſo euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting condempnation to thoſe whiche turne not themſelues vnto God. Theſe are the keyes of the Church of Chriſte, ſo that if any Miniſter of the Goſpel, ſhould goe beyond theſe bounds, he ſhall not cary this raſhnes, vnpuniſhed of God.</p>
               <p>What is then to be thought, of priuate confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and outwarde abſolution? There be many, and weightie cauſes, why the holy fathers did inſtitute this talke, or Colloquie, whiche is had betweene the partie confeſſing, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the woorde.</p>
               <p>The firſt: that the rude, and ignoraunt, might be the more profitably inſtructed, beeing deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">Meaning aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe of the holye Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them.</note> of euery principle of the Chriſtian Religion. For, when as many, doe many yeeres, heare the holy preachings, &amp; yet doe very little or nothing at all profit: ſuch, verely ſhal with greater profit, talke together with the learned, and godlye miniſter of the woorde, whiche may inquire of what matters they ſtande in doubte, and may teache them thoſe thinges, whereof they bee ignoraunt.</p>
               <p>Secondly: That in this talking together, the profiting of the youth, and younge perſons might bee tryed. For it is the parte of a good Paſtour, not onely to teach openly: but alſo (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to the example of <hi>Paule,)</hi> to make a tryall at home, how farre euery one of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:4151:100"/>
haue gone forwarde in the courſe of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: that a reaſon of the fayth might be required of thoſe, of whoſe Fayth, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, iuſt doubte might be had: and that vnto ſuch as in any hereſie were ſtubbernely obſtinate, the Supper of the Lord ſhould be prohibited.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: that in this Colloquie, the doubtful conſciences, and ſuch as for the ſcruple of their ſinnes were vnquieted, might by doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, counſaile, and conſolation, be releeued.</p>
               <p>Fifthly: that in this priuate talke, they might heare the voyce of the Goſpell, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing forgiuenes of ſinnes to thoſe which beleeue in Chriſte. For in aſmuch as Chriſte ſayth: <hi>Hee that heareth you, heareth mee:</hi> it is much auayle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to heare the Miniſter of the worde, (in the name of Chriſt according to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement) ſhewing foorth the remiſſion of ſinnnes.</p>
               <p>¶ Priuate Abſolution may be made in this <hi>manner.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Item: <hi>In ſuch an hower as ye think not, will the Sonne of man come.</hi> And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith: <hi>God giueth thee a ſpace of amendement, but thou more loueſt delayment, than amendement: Thou draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the time a long, and of the mercy of GOD, thou promiſeſt vnto thy ſelfe many things: as though he whiche hath promiſed thee ſaluation through re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, had alſo promiſed thee long lyfe, How knoweſt thou what the morrowe day will bringe foorth?

               <p>The ſeconde is: <hi>A moſte pernitious heape of wicked offences, of the anger of God, and of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhmentes, is, (by delaying of repentaunce) ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together.</hi> Whereof <hi>Paule Rom. 2.</hi> ſayth: <hi>But thou after thy hardneſſe, and heart which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repent, heapeſt vnto thy ſelfe, wrath, againſt the day of vengeaunce.</hi> For, the ſinne, which is not ſuppreſſed by repentaunce, foorthwith, by the weight thereof, draweth into another, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine from that into another: vntill an infinite heape of ſinnes be layde together.</p>
               <p>And as a moſte naughtie roote, beeinge not plucked vp out of the grounde, doth continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly growe, and budde, more, and more: Euen ſo ſinne, when thou cheriſheſt it, dooth get dayly new ſtrength vnto it, vntill a monſtrous floud of ſinnes haue ouercome thee.</p>
               <p>For he whiche in this ſorte abuſeth the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of <hi>GOD:</hi> is wicked agaynſt <hi>GOD:</hi> as he which hath purpoſed to ſerue the Deuill a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger time, than <hi>GOD.</hi> By this his ſecuritie he alſo offendeth the Aungels of <hi>GOD.</hi> For as they doe reioyce at the repetaunce of the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: ſo with out doubte they are ſorowfull for their vnrepentaunce. It greeueth them that ſo noble a Creature of God ſhould periſh through her owne faulte.</p>
               <p>Hee is alſo cruell againſt himſelfe. For hee will rather bee euill than good, or rather bee ſicke than ſounde, or rather bee the bondſlaue
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:4151:103"/>
of Sathan, than the freeman of Chriſte, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a begger in heauenly good things, than rich: Briefly, he wil rather periſh, than be ſaued, than the which crueltie, doubtleſſe none can bee greater. I ceaſſe to ſpeake, that he is iniurious againſt the creatures of God:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> Whereof <hi>Paule</hi> affirmeth, that the creatures doe mourne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wicked doe abuſe them, and doe wait for the freedome of the glory of the Children of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oedipus</hi> perceiuing the inceſt committed with his owne mother, plucked out his owne eyes, that by this meanes he might at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt, auoyde the ſight of the Sunne, and all the creatures. For he ſawe that all the creatures of God, were beholders of his vnſpeakeable, and moſte filthy wicked acte: and that they all, with one conſent did condemne him. In like manner at this day whoſoeuer doe liue wickedly, do perceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bee accuſed of all the creatures before the tribunall ſeate of God.</p>
               <p>The third is: <hi>The enſtraunging of the minde from God, And finall Induration.</hi> For by howe much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> longerrepenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is differed: by ſo much is it become the harder. For euen as the matter goeth in the diſeaſes of the body: ſo is it alſo in the diſeaſe of the minde, which is ſinne. For, by how much the longer the medicine of the body is differed: by ſo much the diſeaſe is made the more daungerous, and is the hardlyar cured, yea ſometime, through continuance it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vncureable, as it appeereth in the diſeaſe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:4151:103"/>
of a Canker: where if the malady bee not forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in the beginning kepte vnder by fire, or iron: it is to bee feared, leaſt by little, and little, it will growe ſo ſtrong, that it will vtterly take the man away. This is the ſame thing whiche <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth: <hi>A young man walking after his owne wayes, when he is olde, ſhall not goe backe from the ſame.</hi> And <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſayth: <hi>If the man of India may chaunge his skinne, and the Cat of the Mountaine her ſpottes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conſuetudo diuturna, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera fit na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura.</note> 
                  <hi>ye alſo may doe well when yee haue doone euil.</hi> For dayly cuſtome is made another nature. This daunger of <hi>Induration</hi> ſhould woorthyly mooue vs to the ripening, (or haſtening) of repentance.</p>
               <p>The fourth is: <hi>An euill conſcience,</hi> than the which, there is nothing more greeuous, nothing more heauy, nothing more miſerable. They whiche are delighted in the myre of ſinne: are compelled, to beare about with them, this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their owne wickedneſſe. <hi>An euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> (ſayth <hi>Bernarde) is her ſelfe a witneſſe of our offences, ſhe is the Iudge, ſhe is the tormentour, ſhe accuſeth, ſhe Iudgeth, ſhe puniſheth, ſhe condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. Albeit the ſame be cut of for a time, and as it were, ſeared with an hot iron: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhe will ſometimes ſhew foorth her ſelfe, and (if not before) yet (at the leaſte) in the agonie of death, ſhe wil be preſent as a thouſand witneſſes: ſhe will accuſe, ſhe will condemne, ſhe will puniſh.</hi> For, an euill conſcience is a certaine diuine teſtimony, imprinted in the mindes of men, of the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment heereafter to come vppon the obſtinate,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:4151:104"/>
and of the puniſhments which they ſhall iuſtly ſuſtayne.</p>
               <p>The fifth is: <hi>Offence, and guiltineſſe of the ſinnes of others.</hi> For in an offence giuen, there is a double euill, namely, <hi>The deede, and the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> As through the fact by it ſelfe, the lawe of God is violated: ſo by the example thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure is hurt, for immitation, or following ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Heereof proceedeth that lamentable excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Chriſt: <hi>VVo be vnto the man, by whom the offence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth.</hi> And againe: <hi>He which offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth one of theſe little ones, which beleeue in me: it were better for him, that a milſtone were hanged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his neck, &amp; that he were drowned in the depth of the ſea. Paule</hi> pronounceth thoſe to ſin againſt Chriſte, &amp; to deſtroy the weake brethren, which vſe indifferent thinges with offence. But what is to be thought of him which (either through erronious doctrine, or wicked life) leadeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny into deſtruction? That ſo great wickedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes doe abounde in the worlde at this day, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it not hereof, that one thincketh that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him, which he ſeeth another doe? whom by and by another immitateth, and him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vntill (through the ſcabbedneſſe of one member) the whole body almoſte of the Church beeing infected is deformed.</p>
               <p>The ſixth is: <hi>The priuation of ſpirituall riches,</hi> of which, onely the holie in the Church of Chriſt are partakers. For, ſo longe as manne lyueth without repentance, hee is without the ioy of the holie Ghoſte, hee is deſtitute of the peace of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:4151:104"/>
conſcience, hee is depriued of ſpirituall conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in his miſery: neither is hee partaker of the prayers of the godly Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth is: <hi>The delicates (or daynties) of the Diuell.</hi> For, as the Aungels in heauen, doe reioyce ouer man when hee repenteth: ſo the Diuell is throughly imbrewed, with higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and (as it were) with moſte pleaſant pleaſures, when he ſeeth men, (ſpecially thoſe which haue giuen their names vnto Chriſte) to liue without repentaunce. For, the ſinnes of men are (as certayne of the fathers ſay) the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate diſhes of wicked Diuels.</p>
               <p>The eight is:<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>The conſideration of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall examples of many menne,</hi> whiche, for their contumacie haue beene caſte, of <hi>GOD</hi> into paines eternall. In the number of whome, are <hi>Cayne, Pharao, Saule, Achitophell, Iudas, Iulianus,</hi> and infinite others. We ſee alſo how many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which haue heard Chriſte, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles haue periſhed: beeing turned away to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious errours of the Deuill, the Turke, and the Romaine Antichriſte.</p>
               <p>Ninthly: Let this cogitation alſo enter into thy minde: <hi>That Repentaunce is not ſo the worke of man, as the the gifte of GOD:</hi> which if thou contemneſt, whiles it is, (day from day, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) offered vnto thee, of God: it is to be feared, that hee dooth oftentimes caſte his precious pearles before ſwine.</p>
               <p>The tenth is: <hi>The condition of late Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce:</hi> For it is oftentimes rightly ſayde:<note place="margin">Sera peeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia raro vera.</note> 
                  <hi>Late
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:4151:105"/>
Repentaunce is ſeldome true.</hi> Hee is not to bee iudged to repent, whiche after he is not able to ſinne, doth feigne repentaunce. And <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth: <hi>The repentaunce whiche is required of him, onely which is about to dye: I feare mee leaſte that ſame repentance doe alſo dye.</hi> I ſay this, (not that I doe denye the mercy of God to be giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe, which beeing about to departe forth of this life) doe repent: but that we may conſider how daungerous it is to protracte repentaunce vnto the laſte gaſpe of this lyfe.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth good vnto me to collect breefely, theſe reaſons: the conſideration of whiche, will keepe euery of vs in the feare of God, that wee abuſe not the greatneſſe of his mercie to our owne deſtruction.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Wiſe, and prudent Phyſitians, beeing cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the ſick patient: doe apply themſelues to doe two thinges.

But whereſoeuer any one of theſe three is wanting: there the worke of man deſerueth not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a ſeruice, or worſhip grateful, and acceptable vnto God. That <hi>Phariſie</hi> of whome the Goſpell maketh mention, &amp; that Courtior <hi>Cornelius,</hi> of whom it is written in the <hi>Actes of the Apoſtles,</hi> gaue almes: by the benefit wherof, many were releeued and comforted.

               <p>But <hi>Cornelius,</hi> albeit he was not fully inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the knowledge of Chriſte: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, foraſmuch as he beleeued, &amp; hoped for ſaluation, and beſtowed his almes through the commaundement of God, vnto God his glory,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:4151:108"/>
and the comforte of the poore): his almes were, a pure, holy, and acceptable worſhip, (or ſeruice) vnto God. Therefore the Angel ſayth, to <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Acts. 10. Thy prayers and thy almes are come vp into remembraunce in the ſight of GOD.

               <p>For <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing the Commaundemente of God, beleueth, and holdeth battayle, to the glory of God, and the defence of his people. But <hi>Scipio</hi> (inaſmuch as he wanted both the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and Faith, neither ſought the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God) his battails were only wicked, and cruell butcheryes of men, in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>After the like manner two Maydens (of the which two, one fearing God, the other indewed with no feare of God (albeit they two bee occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed about one, and the ſame woorke, as clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of garments, yea, or wyping of ſhooes, or doing any other commandement of their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe: yet notwithſtanding, onely the works of the maiden which feareth God, are the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or ſeruices of God, foraſmuch as they are doone of fayth, according to the precept of God, commaunding obedience of ſeruants towards their Mayſters: but the woorkes of the other, beeing the woorks of a wicked life, (albeit they doe outwardly appeere more excellent) are not the worſhippings (or ſeruices) of God, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they are defyled, with the vncleaneſſe of the heart, and inwarde filthyneſſe.</p>

               <p>The ſeconde rule is this: <hi>VVhen wee deſire of GOD thoſe good thinges, which wee can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:4151:113"/>
thoſe thinges are to bee required without all Condition.</hi> Of this ſorte of good thinges, are, <hi>The knowledge of God, the increaſe of fayth, true godlynes, patience vnder the Croſſe, &amp; other giftes like vnto theſe.</hi> The foundation of this rule, is, the knowledge of the will of God, who would haue al men to be ſaued, and come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth,<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>THE OTHER THINGE</hi> which I ſaid was to bee noted, in that moſt ſweet promiſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is, <hi>THE MANNER OF INVO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATION,</hi> which is expreſſed when he ſaith: <hi>(In my Name,)</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>VVhatſoeuer yee ſhall aske in the knowledge, and Confidence in mee: the ſame, the Father will geue you, for my ſake, which am your aduocate, interceſſour, and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure, with my Father, and your Father: yea, the Father loueth you, for my ſake, becauſe yee are my members, yea rather, my brethren, and his adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſonnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, of what ſorte the knowledge of Chriſte ſhould bee, and what manner of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in him ſhould bee, wee haue declared before: therfore, I will now, only giue admonition of this thinge, namely, <hi>How wee ſhould be affected, as often as we do heare this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſte: (VVhatſoeuer yee ſhall aske the Father in my name, hee will geue it you:)</hi> For it conteyneth, both, manifolde doctrine, holſome admonitions, and effectuall conſolations.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine is manifolde: For, firſt, it
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:4151:114"/>
teacheth, that all immagination of our owne woorthyneſſe, is to bee excluded from our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. For, when, wee praye in the name of Chriſte: wee acknowledge, Chriſte to bee only woorthy, for whoſe ſake wee are heard of God. Moreouer, wee learne a difference, betweene a Chriſtian Prayer: and the prayers of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſectes. <hi>For, Chriſtian Prayer</hi> is grounded vpon the Confidence in the <hi>Mediatour:</hi> whom, foraſmuch as prophane men doo not confeſſe, their praier is voyd, &amp; deſtitute of al foundation.</p>
               <p>The admonitions are theſe: that this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of prayinge, admoniſheth vs, of our blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For, when wee muſt aſke in the name of Chriſt: it is not to bee doubted, but, that thoſe thinges are very great, which muſt bee aſked. Wee muſt therefore open our eyes, and looke diligently about vs, what thinges publiquely, what priuately, are greeuous vnto vs: what inwarde, what outwarde, what Corporall, what ſpirituall thinges are lackinge: that in all theſe thinges, wee may lifte vp our heartes to our moſt mercifull Father, and aſke of him, in the name of our <hi>Mediatour IESV CHRISTE</hi> ſurely, and without doubt, truſting, that he wil giue vs thoſe things which are neceſſary for vs (ſo that wee praye in a firme fayth,) and that thoſe thinges which wee require, may be hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for vs, as it is already ſayd.</p>
               <p>The Conſolations are: that this manner of praying comforteth thoſe which praye, agaynſt two moſt great impedimentes of Inuocation:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:4151:114"/>
namely: <hi>Fleſhly Diſtruſt:</hi> and, <hi>Our owne vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſſe.</hi> For, vnleſſe when wee pray, we were ſtayed vpon the confidence of the <hi>Mediatour: our Fleſhly diſtruſt,</hi> (which the remembraunce of the manifolde ſinnes of our whole lyfe, dooth aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) would feare vs away from praying, and wee ſhould all the ſorte of vs, be eaſily ſubdued, beeinge throwne downe proſtrate with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our vnwoorthyneſſe, who of our ſelues are vnwoorthy to come into the preſence of GOD, but the confidence in the <hi>Mediatour, healeth theſe</hi> maladies. For, it both ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth fleſhly diſtruſt, and boaſteth not her own woorthyneſſe, but the woorthyneſſe of <hi>Chriſte.</hi> Hereunto apperteyneth that ſayinge of <hi>Paule Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>By fayth we haue peace with God, through our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, by whom alſo wee haue acceſſe, through fayth, vnto this grace, wherin wee ſtande. &amp;c</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With theſe thinges notably agreeth, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of our Lorde, geuen to the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> in <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. <hi>For,</hi> ſo hee ſayth: <hi>The hower commeth, and now it is, when the true woorſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, ſhall woorſhip the father, in Spirite, and in the truth, for ſuch the father ſeeketh to woorſhip him.</hi> The Woman of <hi>Somaria</hi> thought, that the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catie of Prayer, depended vpon the dignitye of the place: for, (ſayth ſhee) <hi>Our Fathers woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in this Mounteyne, and yee ſaye, that at Ieruſalem is the place, where menne ought to woorſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:4151:115"/>From this opinion, Chriſte calleth backe the Woman, and propoundeth vnto her, the true manner of woorſhippinge, namely: <hi>That ſhee muſt worſhip the Father, in Spirit, and in the truth.</hi> When hee ſayth, <hi>IN THE SPIRITE,</hi> hee maketh a difference, beetweene that prayer, which proceedeth, onely from the mouth, and that which proceedeth from the <hi>Spirite:</hi> which <hi>Spirite</hi> worketh fayth in the heart of man, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon dependeth and from which proceedeth, true adoration. When hee ſayth <hi>IN THE TRVETH:</hi> he interpreteth two old figures: the former of the mountayne, in which <hi>Iacob</hi> prayed: the latter, of the place, which was at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and was called <hi>THE PROPITI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATORIE.</hi> For, that Mountayne of <hi>Iacob</hi> did put vs in minde, that when wee praye, wee ſhould not reſpecte anye dignity of places in the worlde: but, that (from all the lowe valleyes of this world) wee ſhould lifte vp our heartes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hilles, that is to ſay, vnto Heauen. And Chriſte willeth the ſame thinge, when hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth thoſe that praye, to ſay: <hi>Our Father which art IN HEAVEN.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The latter figure <hi>Chriſte</hi> expoundeth, when hee ſayth: <hi>They ſhall woorſhip the Father IN THE TRVETH.</hi> This <hi>Trueth</hi> is ſet againſt this place at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which was called <hi>THE PROPITIATORIE.</hi> For this place was a figure of the true propitiatorie Ieſus <hi>Chriſte</hi> our onely <hi>Mediatoure,</hi> without whom, there is no entraunce open for anye to enter into the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:4151:115"/>
                  <hi>Holy of Holyes,</hi> that is to ſay, into Saluation, and lyfe euerlaſting. By this reaſon is alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from Chriſtian prayer all hypocriſie, and therewithall is neceſſarily required, true, and feruent <hi>Zeale</hi> of minde in the time of prayer: ſo that there muſt bee a conſonancie, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the heart, and mouth, that the one ſay or ſpeake not otherwiſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other thinketh.</p>
               <p>Thus it is ſhewed, that <hi>THE FEARE OF GOD,</hi> is the beſte keeper of fayth, and of a good Conſcience in vs: as beeing that thinge, which ſtudiouſly auoydeth Sinne, obeyeth the Commaundementes of God, dilygently bewa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the deceiptes of the fleſh, the worlde, and the Deuill: and, (beefore all thinges,) ſeeketh (in theſe manifolde daungers of the worlde,) helpe at the handes of GOD, by earneſt, and Chriſtian prayer: and, by this meanes, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth conſtaunt vnto the ende, (that is to ſay) endureth ſo longe vntill <hi>GOD</hi> calleth vs from this vale of miſery, and receyueth into Heauen to himſelf, the ſoules of the godly, which depart from hence, in the inuocation of <hi>Chriſte:</hi> their bodyes in the meane ſeaſon reſtinge in the duſte of the earth, ſubiect to corruption, in teſtimonye of the iuſte Iudgemente of God: which ſhall rayſe vp agayne our bodyes in the laſt day, and (beeinge agayne reſtored to their ſoules) ſhall quicken them, that we his Children may enioy eternall lyfe: and beeinge finally taken awaye from all chaunges, and daungers of this world, may remaine in perpetual ioyes, with the Lord,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:4151:116"/>
and our only Sauiour <hi>IESV CHRIST,</hi> to whom, with the Father and the holy ghoſt, bee prayſe, honour, and glory for euer, and euer, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe thinges I purpoſed to write, of the principal poinctes of our religion, for their ſakes which do vnderſtand, our common Language. Which I alſo will to remayne, in place of the Confeſſion of my fayth, and doctrine, which I haue taught, and profeſſed in this Schoole of <hi>Hafnia,</hi> about the ſpace of 30. yeares. I bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeche the Chriſtian Readers, that of this, and other my writinges, they would iudge, not by the quarellings of vnlearned, &amp; prowd ſpirites, but by the woord of GOD.</p>

                  <hi>GOD</hi> bee mercifull vnto his Church, and with clemency turne away the diſſentions, and corruptions of the pure Doctrine; and aſſiſt vs all with his holy ſpirite: by whoſe aſſiſtaunce, wee may in ſuch ſort daily increaſe in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God, in fayth and newneſſe of lyfe: that in the laſt day wee may bee founde in the number of the elect children of God, through <hi>IESVS CHRISTE our Lorde.
