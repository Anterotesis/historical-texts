            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HERE being an opportunity of ſending for <hi>London,</hi> by a Veſſel that loaded at <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and for want of a Wind put in here; and not knowing that there will be the like from this Country ſuddenly, I am willing to give you ſome brief Account of the moſt remarkable things that have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned here within this Fortnight laſt paſt; concluding that till about that time, you will have received <hi>per Carter,</hi> a full Account of the management of Affairs here. Upon the <hi>Eighteenth</hi> Inſtant, about Eight of the Clock in the Morning, in <hi>Boſton,</hi> it was reported at the <hi>South</hi> end of the Town, That at the <hi>North</hi> end they were all in Arms; and the like Report was at the <hi>North</hi> end, reſpecting the <hi>South</hi> end: Whereupon Captain <hi>John George</hi> was immediately ſeized, and about nine of the clock the Drums beat thorough the Town;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98186:3"/>
and an Enſign was ſet up upon the Beacon. Then Mr. <hi>Bradſtreet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dantforth,</hi> Major <hi>Richards,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cooke,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Addington &amp;c.</hi> were brought to the Council-houſe by a Company of Soldiers under the Command of Captain <hi>Hill.</hi> The mean while the People in Arms, did take up and put into Goal, Juſtice <hi>Bullivant,</hi> Juſtice <hi>Foxcroft,</hi> Mr. <hi>Randolf,</hi> Sheriff <hi>Sherlock,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Ravenſcroft,</hi> Captain <hi>White, Farewel, Broadbent, Crafford, Larkin, Smith,</hi> and many more, as alſo <hi>Mercey</hi> the then Goal-keeper, and put <hi>Scates</hi> the Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layer in his place. About Noon, in the Gallery at the Council-houſe, was read the Declaration here inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Then a Meſſage was ſent to the Fort to Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Androſs,</hi> By Mr. <hi>Oliver</hi> and Mr. <hi>Eyres,</hi> ſigned by the Gentlemen then in the Council-Chamber, (which is here alſo incloſed); to inform him how unſafe he was like to be if he did not deliver up himſelf, and Fort and Government forthwith, which he was loath to do. By this time, being about two of the Clock (the Lecture being put by) the Town was generally in Arms, and ſo many of the Countrey came in, that there was Twenty Companies in <hi>Boſton,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a great many that appeared at <hi>Charles Town</hi> that could not get over (ſome ſay Fifteen Hundred). There then came Information to the Soldiers, That a Boat was come from the Frigat that made towards the Fort, which made them haſte thither, and come to the Sconce ſoon after the Boat got thither; and 'tis ſaid that Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>Androſs,</hi> and about half a ſcore Gentlemen, were coming down out of the Fort; but the Boat being ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, wherein were ſmall Arms, Hand-Granadoes, and a quantity of Match, the Governour and the reſt went in again; whereupon Mr. <hi>John Nelſon,</hi> who was at the head of the Soldiers, did demand the Fort and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98186:3"/>
who was loath to ſubmit to them; but at length did come down, and was with the Gentlemen that were with him, conveyed to the Council-houſe, where Mr. <hi>Bradſtreet</hi> and the reſt of the Gentlemen waited to receive him; to whom M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stoughton</hi> firſt ſpake, telling him, He might thank himſelf for the preſent diſaſter that had befallen him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He was then confined for that night to Mr. <hi>John <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>'s houſe under ſtrong Guards, and the next day conveyed to the Fort, (where he yet remains, and with him Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Collonel <hi>Ledget</hi>) which is under the Command of Mr. <hi>John Nelſon</hi>; and at the Caſtle, which is under the Command of Mr. <hi>John Fairweather,</hi> is Mr. <hi>Weſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Graham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi> and Captain <hi>Tryfroye.</hi> At that time Mr. <hi>Dudley</hi> was out upon the Circuit, and was holding a Court at <hi>Southold</hi> on <hi>Long-Iſland.</hi> And on the 21<hi>ſt.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he arrived at <hi>Newport,</hi> where he heard the News. The next day Letters came to him, adviſing him not to come home; he thereupon went over privately to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Smith</hi>'s at <hi>Naraganzett,</hi> and advice is this day come hither, that yeſterday about a dozen young men, moſt of their own heads, went thither to demand him: and are gone with him down to <hi>Boſton.</hi> We have alſo advice, that on <hi>Fryday</hi> laſt towards evening, Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Androſs</hi> did attempt to make an eſcape in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Apparel, and paſs'd two Guards, and was ſtopped at the third, being diſcovered by his Shoes, not having changed them. We are here ready to blame you ſometimes, that we have not to this day received ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice concerning, the great Changes in <hi>England,</hi> and in particular how it is like to fair with us here; who do hope and believe that all theſe things will work for our Good; and that you will not be wanting to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Good of a Country that ſtands in ſuch need
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98186:4"/>
as <hi>New England</hi> does at this day. The firſt day of <hi>May,</hi> according to former Uſage, is the Election-day at <hi>Road Iſland</hi>; and many do ſay they intend their choice there then. I have not farther to trouble you with at preſent, but recommending you, and all our affairs with you, to the Direction and Bleſſing of our moſt Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God: I remain</p>

            <head>THE DECLARATION OF THE Gentlemen, Merchants, and Inhabitants of <hi>BOSTON,</hi> and the Country Adjacent. <hi>April</hi> 18. 1689.</head>
            <p n="1">ſect;. I. WE have ſeen more than a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cad of Years rolled away, ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> World had the Diſcovery of an horrid <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bloody <hi>Devotoes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had in their Deſign and Proſpect no leſs than the extinction of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi>: which mighty Work they called <hi>the utter ſubduing of a Peſtilent Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy</hi>; wherein (they ſaid) there never were ſuch hopes of Succeſs ſince the Death of Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> as now in our days. And we were of all men the moſt inſenſible, if we ſhould apprehend a Countrey ſo remarkable for the true Profeſſion and pure Exerciſe of the Proteſtant Religion as <hi>New-England</hi> is, wholly unconcerned in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98186:5"/>
Plot. To cruſh and break a Countrey ſo entirely and ſignally made up of <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> and at length to involve it in the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of an utter Extirpation, muſt needs carry even a Supererogation of merit with it among ſuch as were intoxicated with a Bigotry inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into them by the great <hi>Scarlet Whore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">§. II. To get us within the reach of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation deſired for us, it was no improper thing that we ſhould firſt have our <hi>Charter</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and the hedge which kept us from the wild Beaſts of the field, effectually broken down. The accompliſhment of this was haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the unwearied ſollicitations, and ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous accuſations of a man, for his <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Falſhood,</hi> well known unto us all. Our <hi>Charter</hi> was with a moſt injurious pretence (and ſcarce that) of Law, condemned before it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us to appear at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in the legal defence of it; and without a fair leave to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for our ſelves, concerning the Crimes falſly laid to our charge, we were put under a <hi>Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> without any liberty for an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, which the other <hi>American Plantations</hi> have, by a Commiſſion from His <hi>Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:98186:5"/>§. III. The Commiſſion was as <hi>Illegal</hi> for the form of it, as the way of obtaining it was <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable</hi>: yet we made no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance thereunto as we could eaſily have done; but choſe to give all <hi>Mankind</hi> a Demonſtration of our being a people ſufficiently dutiful and loyal to our King: and this with yet more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, becauſe we took pains to make our ſelves believe as much as ever we could of the Whedle then offer'd unto us; That his <hi>Mageſty's</hi> deſire was no other than the happy encreaſe and advance of theſe <hi>Provinces</hi> by their more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Dependance on the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And we were convinced of it by the courſes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately taken to damp and ſpoyl our <hi>Trade</hi>; whereof decayes and complaints preſently filled all the Country; while in the mean time nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Honour nor the Treaſure of the King was at all advanced by this new Model of our Affairs, but a conſiderable Charge added unto the Crown.</p>
            <p n="4">§. IV. In little more than half a Year we ſaw this Commiſſion ſuperſeded by another, yet more Abſolute and Arbitrary, with which Sir <hi>Edmond Androſs</hi> arrived as our Governour: who beſides his Power, with the Advice and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98186:6"/>
Conſent of his Council, to make Laws and raiſe Taxes as he pleaſed; had alſo Authority by himſelf to Muſter and Imploy all Perſons reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Territory as occaſion ſhall ſerve; and to transfer ſuch Forces to any Engliſh Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in <hi>America,</hi> as occaſion ſhall require. And ſeveral Companies of Souldiers were now brought from <hi>Europe,</hi> to ſupport what was to be impoſed upon us, not without repeated Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces that ſome hundreds more were intented for us.</p>
            <p n="5">§. V. The Government was no ſooner in theſe Hands, but care was taken to load Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments principally upon ſuch Men as were ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to, and haters of the People: and every ones Obſervation hath noted, what Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions recommended a Man to publick Offices and Employments, only here and there a <hi>good Man</hi> was uſed, where others could not eaſily be had; the Governour himſelf, with Aſſertions now and then falling from him, made us jealous that it would be thought for his Majeſties Intereſt, if this People were removed and another ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their room: And his far-fetch'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments that were growing rich among us, would gravely inform us, that it was not for his

Majeſties Intereſt that we ſhould thrive. But of all our Oppreſſors we were chiefly <hi>ſqueez'd</hi> by a crew of abject Perſons, fetched from <hi>New-York,</hi> to be the Tools of the Adverſary, ſtanding at our right hand; by theſe were extraordinary and intollerable Fees extorted from every one upon all occaſions, without any Rules but thoſe of their own inſatiable Avarice and Beggary; and even the probate of a Will muſt now coſt as many <hi>Pounds</hi> perhaps as it did <hi>Shillings</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; nor could a ſmall Volume contain the other illegalities done by theſe <hi>Horſe-leeehes</hi> in the two or three Years that they have been ſucking of us; and what Laws they made it was as impoſſible for us to know, as dangerous for us to break;<note place="margin">He would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer them to be printed, nor fairly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</note> but we ſhall leave the Men of <hi>Ipſwich</hi> and of <hi>Plimotuh</hi> (among others) to tell the ſtory of the kindneſs which has been ſhown them upon this account. Doubtleſs a Land ſo ruled as once <hi>New-England</hi> was, has not without many fears and ſighs beheld the wicked walking on every ſide, and the vileſt Men exalted.</p>
            <p n="6">§. VI. It was now plainly affirmed, both by ſome in open Council, and by the ſame in private converſe, that the people in <hi>New-England</hi> were all <hi>Slaves,</hi> and the only difference between them
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98186:7"/>
and <hi>Slaves</hi> is their not being bought and ſold; and it was a maxim delivered in open Court unto us by one of the Council, <hi>that we muſt not think the Priviledges of Engliſh-men would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us to the end of the World</hi>: Accordingly we have been treated with multiplied contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the rights of which we laid claim unto. Perſons who did but peaceably object againſt the raiſing of Taxes without an Aſſembly, have been for it fined, ſome twenty, ſome thirty, and others fifty Pounds. Packt and pickt Juries have been very common things among us, when, under a pretended form of Law, the trouble of ſome honeſt and worthy Men has been aimed at: but when ſome of this Gang have been brought upon the Stage, for the moſt deteſtable Enormities that ever the Sun beheld, all Men have with Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeen what methods have been taken that they might not be treated according to their Crimes. Without a Verdict, yea, without a Jury ſometimes have People been fined moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſly; and ſome not of the meaneſt Quality have been kept in long and cloſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment without any the leaſt Information appearing againſt them, or an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98186:7"/>
allowed unto them. In ſhort, when our Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors have been a little out of Mony, 'twas but pretending ſome Offence to be enquired into, and the moſt innocent of Men were continually put into no ſmall Expence to anſwer the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Officers, who muſt have Mony of them, or a Priſon for them, tho none could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them of any Miſdemeanour.</p>
            <p n="7">§. VII. To plunge the poor People every where into deeper Incapacities, there was one very comprehenſive Abuſe given to us; Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of pious and ſober Men through the Land, ſcrupled the Mode of Swearing on the Book, deſiring that they might Swear with an uplifted Hand, agreeable to the ancient Cuſtom of the Colony; and though we think we can prove that the Common Law amongſt us (as well as in ſome other places under the <hi>Engliſh Crown</hi>) not only indulges, but even commands and enjoins the Rite of lifting the Hand in <hi>Swearing</hi>; yet they that had this Doubt, were ſtill put by from ſerving upon any Juries; and many of them were moſt unaccountably Fined and Impriſoned. Thus one Grievance is a <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan Horſe,</hi> in the Belly of which it is not eaſy to recount how many inſufferable Vexations have been contained.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:98186:8"/>§. VIII. Becauſe theſe things could not make us miſerable faſt enough, there was a notable Diſcovery made of we know not what <hi>flaw</hi> in all our <hi>Titles to our Lands</hi>; and, tho <hi>beſides</hi> our purchaſe of them from the Natives; and, <hi>beſides</hi> our actual peaceable unqueſtioned poſſeſſion of them for near three ſcore Years, and beſides the Promiſe of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. in his Proclamation ſent over to us in the Year 1683. That <hi>no Man here ſhall receive any Prejudice or his Free-hold or Eſtate</hi>: We had the Grant of our Lands, under the Seal of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Plimouth</hi>: which Grant was Renewed and Confirmed unto us by King <hi>Charles</hi> I. under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi>; and the <hi>General Court</hi> which conſiſted of the Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees and their Aſſociates, had made particular Grants hereof to the ſeveral <hi>Towns</hi> (though 'twas now deny'd by the Governour, that there was any ſuch Thing as a <hi>Town</hi>) among us; to all which Grants the <hi>General Court</hi> annexed for the further ſecuring of them; <hi>A General Act,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed under the Seal of the Colony, in the Year 1684. Yet we were every day told, <hi>That no Man was owner of a Foot of Land in all the Colony.</hi> Accordingly, <hi>Writs of Intruſion</hi> began every where to be ſerved on People, that after all their Sweat
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98186:8"/>
and their Coſt upon their formerly purchaſed Lands, thought themſelves <hi>Free-holders</hi> of what they had. And the Governor cauſed the Lands pertaining to theſe and thoſe <hi>particular Men,</hi> to be meaſured out for his Creatures to take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of; and the <hi>Right Owners,</hi> for pulling up the Stakes, have paſſed through Moleſtations enough to tire all the patience in the World. They are more than a few, that were by Terrors driven to take <hi>Potents</hi> for their Lands at exceſſive rates, to ſave them from the next that might petition for them: and we fear that the forcing of the People at the <hi>Eaſtward</hi> hereunto, gave too much Riſe to the late unhappy Invaſion made by the <hi>Indians</hi> on them. <hi>Blanck Paients</hi> were got rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the reſt of us, to be ſold at a Price, that all the Mony and Moveables in the Territory could ſcarce have paid. And ſeveral <hi>Towns</hi> in the Country had their <hi>Commons</hi> begg'd by Perſons (even by ſome of the Council them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) who have been privately encouraged thereunto, by thoſe that ſought for Occaſions to impoveriſh a Land already <hi>Peeled, Meeted out and Trodden down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">§. IX. All the Council were not ingaged in theſe ill Actions, but thoſe of them which were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98186:9"/>
true Lovers <hi>of their Country,</hi> were ſeldom admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, and ſeldomer conſulted at the Debates which produced theſe unrighteous Things: Care was taken to keep them under Diſadvantages; and the Governor, with five or ſix more, did what they would. We bore all theſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more ſuch Things, without making any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for any Relief; only Mr. <hi>Mather,</hi> purely out of reſpect unto the Good of his Afflicted Country, undertook a Voyage into <hi>England</hi>; which when theſe Men ſuſpected him to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for, they uſed all manner of Craft and Rage, not only to interrupt his <hi>Voyage,</hi> but to ruin his <hi>Perſon</hi> too. God having through many Difficulties given him to arrive at <hi>White-hall,</hi> the King, more than once or twice, promiſed him a certain <hi>Magna Charta</hi> for a ſpeedy Redreſs of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which we were groaning under: and in the mean time ſaid, <hi>That our Governor ſhould be written unto, to forbear the Meaſures that he was upon.</hi> However, after this, we were injured in thoſe very Things which were complained of; and beſides what Wrong hath been done in our Civil Concerns, we ſuppoſe the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> every where have ſeen our Sacred Concerns apace going after them: How they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98186:9"/>
have been Diſcountenanced, has had a room in the reflections of every man, that is not a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>in our Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">§. X. And yet that our Calamity might not be terminated here, we are again Briar'd in the Perplexities of another <hi>Indian War</hi>; how, or why, is a myſtery too deep for us to unfold. And tho 'tis judged that our <hi>Indian</hi> Enemies are not above 100. in number, yet an Army of <hi>One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi> Engliſh hath been raiſed for the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; which Army of our poor Friends and Brethren now under <hi>Popiſh Commanders</hi> for in the Army as well as in the Council, Papiſts are in Commiſſion) has been under ſuch a conduct, that not one <hi>Indian</hi> hath been kill'd, but more Engliſh are ſuppoſed to have died through ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hardſhip, than we have adverſaries there alive; and the whole War hath been ſo managed, that we cannot but ſuſpect in it, a branch of the Plot <hi>to bring us low</hi>; which we leave to be further enquir'd into in due time.</p>
            <p n="11">§ XI. We did nothing againſt theſe Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but only cry to our God; they <hi>have cauſed the cry of the Poor to come unto him, and he hears
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98186:10"/>
the cry of the Afflicted.</hi> We have been quiet hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and ſo ſtill we ſhould have been, had not the Great God at this time laid us under a <hi>double engagement</hi> to do ſomething for our ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: beſides, what we have in the ſtrangely unanimous inclination, which our Countrymen by extreameſt neceſſities are driven unto. For firſt, we are informed that the reſt of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>America</hi> is Alarmed with juſt and great fears, that they may be attaqu'd by the <hi>French,</hi> who have lately ('tis ſaid) already treated many of the Engliſh with worſe then <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cruelties; and while we are in equal danger of being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by them, it is high time we ſhould be better guarded, than we are like to be while the Government remains in the hands by which it hath been held of late. Moreover, we have underſtood, (though the <hi>Governour</hi> has taken all imaginable care to keep us all ignorant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) that the Almighty God hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to proſper the noble undertaking of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to preſerve the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms from the horrible brinks of Popery and Slavery, and to bring to a Condign puniſhment thoſe <hi>worſt of men,</hi> by whom <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Liberties</hi> have been deſtroy'd; in compliance with which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98186:10"/>
Glorious Action, we ought ſurely to follow the Patterns which the Nobility, Gentry and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty in ſeveral parts of thoſe Kingdoms have ſet before us, though <hi>they</hi> therein chiefly propoſed to prevent what <hi>we</hi> already endure.</p>
            <p n="12">§ XII. We do therefore ſeize upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons of thoſe few <hi>Ill men</hi> which have been (next to our Sins) the grand Authors of our Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; reſolving to ſecure them, for what Juſtice, Orders from his Highneſs, with the <hi>Engliſh Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> ſhall direct, leſt, ere we are aware, we <hi>find</hi> (what we may <hi>fear,</hi> being on all ſides in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) our ſelves to be by them given away to a Forreign <hi>Power,</hi> before ſuch Orders can reach unto us; for which Orders we now humbly wait. In the mean time firmly believing, that we have endeavoured nothing but what meer Duty to God and our <hi>Country</hi> calls for at our Hands: We commit our <hi>Enterpriſe</hi> unto the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Him, <hi>who hears the cry of the Oppreſſed,</hi> and adviſe all our Neighbours, for whom we have thus ventured our ſelves, to joyn with us in Prayers and all juſt Actions, for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Land.</p>
