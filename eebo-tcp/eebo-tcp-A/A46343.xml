            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN one of the late Conferences you were pleaſed to have with me, you ſeemed to be ſomewhat diſatisfied upon the ſubject we were diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, which was, whither the <hi>King</hi> had by Law ſuch a <hi>Supream Power</hi> inher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in, and inſeparably annexed to his Crown, as to Diſpence with Penal Laws.</p>
            <p>I remember I then told you, we could not reſolve our ſelves of this Great Point, but by theſe two wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſee, how far the <hi>Judgment</hi> of our Church-men, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their <hi>Doctrines</hi> (which are for our Edification) doth Warrant this <hi>Prerogative</hi> to be in the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60488:3"/>
II. To ſee how far the <hi>Judges Reſolutions</hi> (in declaring their ſence of the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Land</hi> in this doubtful Queſtion,) do <hi>agree</hi> with ſuch their <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Doctrines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>Firſt,</hi> Sir, I doubt not but to make it clear, paſt all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that our <hi>Reverend Clergy</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have unanimouſly concurred in this Point of Doctrine, that it doth inſeparably belong to the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office</hi> to <hi>diſpence</hi> with <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> when ever ſuch a <hi>Supremacy</hi> of Power ſhall be thought neceſſary to be exerted for the ſafety of the King, and the Good and Eaſe of his People in general. And if I can prove this undeniably to You; I hope then that this nice Scruple of yours (which by the way, I ſuppoſe, you will allow me to call your <hi>tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)</hi> will eaſily be removed; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently then it may be preſumed, I ſhall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60488:3"/>
have leſs difficulty to Satisfie You in the other Point, that <hi>this ſence</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> of the Land in the point in Queſtion, is no other, than what is <hi>exactly Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> with the <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Clergy of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin then,</p>
            <p>The Reverend Dean of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> in his ſo deſervedly applauded Anſwer to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr Hick's Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian.</hi> chap. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> declares, <hi>that the Engliſh Realm is a perfect ſoveraignty, or Empire, and that the King of</hi> England <hi>by the Imperial Laws of it, is a Compleat, Imperial, and Independant Soveraign.</hi> And he quotes <hi>Coke</hi> in <hi>Cawdrye's</hi> Caſe, who ſaith, that by the antient Laws of this Realm, <hi>England</hi> is an abſolute Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and Monarchy; and that the King is furniſhed with plenary and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Power, Prerogative, and Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is ſupream Governour over all perſons within this Realm.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>it would be a contradiction to call</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60488:4"/>
               <hi>this an Imperial Crown; to acknowledge the King for ſupream over all Perſons,—and that he is furniſhed with Plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and entire Power, unleſs He have all Thoſe Rights, which are involved in the very Notion of his Imperial Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By the Rights of Soveraign,</hi> ſaith He, <hi>I underſtand Thoſe Prerogatives, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminences of Power and Greatneſs, which are involved in the Formal Conception of Soveraignty, and are inſeparably annexed to the Soveraign.—He hath no ſharers or Co-partners in the Soveraignty; None Co-ordinate with him in Government; no Equal, nor Superiour, but only God, to whom Alone He is ſubject,—</hi>
               <q>All Power and Juriſdiction Spiritual and Tempor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al is derived and deducted from Him, as ſupream Head of Theſe Churches, and Realms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There are ſome Eſſential Rights of the</hi>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60488:4"/>
               <hi>without deſtroying the eſſential and individual Rights of Monarchy. Theſe Rights, called the Flowers of the Crown,</hi> are <hi>Regalia Suprema,</hi> or <hi>Summa Jura Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perij, regno tuendo ſervientia, inherent to his Royal Function, and politick Capacity, and ſerve for the ſtrength and ſupport there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of—ſuch are the Rights of making War and Peace, of having the laſt Appeal unto him, or his Great Council and ſupream Court; and of making Leagues, and of</hi> Diſpenſing <hi>with</hi> Penal Laws, <hi>granting pardons, and ſuch like.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if the <hi>King hath a perfection and fulneſs of Imperial Power in him,</hi> as Dr <note place="margin">Dr. Hicks ut. Sup.</note>

whence I produce them. <hi>How much the Learned World ſtands obliged to Him for his Lectures</hi> de Conſcientia, <hi>I ſhall not attempt to declare, as being very ſenſible, that the Beſt Pens muſt needs fall ſhort in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of them: So that I ſhall only add, that they continue unto this day, and will do for ever, as a Compleat Standard for the Reſolution of the moſt material doubts in Caſuiſtical Divinity.</hi> And now Sir, pray obſerve what the Biſhop ſays.</p>

believe what he himſelf ſaith, and an Impoſter, if he doth not believe it. But if any man will ſeriouſly look into the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of this Aphoriſm, I do believe he will more eaſily grant, that it ought more preciſely to be underſtood of the Safety of the Prince, than of the Safety of the Subjects. This Saying, ſo toſſed up and down in the Mouthes of all Men, came to us from the <hi>Romans,</hi> and was then uſed by them when their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick did flouriſh moſt of all under a Popular State: And there is no great Reaſon that any man ſhould wonder, that the People's Safety was the Supream Law with them, with whom the People themſelves were the Supream Power; In the Judgment therefore of thoſe wiſe Antients, who were the firſt Authors of this Aphoriſm, the Safety of the <hi>Supream Power</hi> was the <hi>Supream Law,</hi> of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> indeed in a <hi>Democracy,</hi> but of a <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Monarchy.</hi>

underſtood of the <hi>Safety of the People,</hi> that is, of the Subjects, it is nevertheleſs perverſly <hi>wreſted</hi> to the <hi>Prejudice</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Dignity,</hi> which even ſo doth render its Power more Ample and Illuſtrious in this ſence.

               <q>The Firſt ſhall be the Reverend Dr <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Heylin.</hi> whoſe knowledge was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive as the Earth, and who had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect familiarity with the preſent State <note place="margin">In the Account of Dr <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Life.</note> of all the Countries in the World,</q> (as the Ingenious Author of his Life informs us) and <q>one who is honoured by all true Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with a due veneration for his Learned and Elabourate Works. And He ſpeaks thus.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He <hi>(viz.</hi> the King) hath Authority by his <hi>Prerogative</hi> Royal to <hi>diſpence</hi> with the <hi>Rigor</hi> of the <hi>Laws,</hi> and ſometimes to <hi>paſs</hi> by a <hi>Statute</hi> with a <hi>Non-obſtante.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Learned and Judicious Dr <hi>Iſaac Barrow,</hi> late Maſter of <hi>Trinity Colledge</hi> in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60488:12"/>
               <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in his Treatiſe concerning the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi> affirms thus—<q>It is indeed a proper Indowment of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Soveraignty, immediately and immutably conſtituted by God, with no Terms or Rules limitting it, that its will declared in way of Precept, Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the Sanction of Laws, the Abrogation of them, the Diſpenſation with them, ſhould be obſerved.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And ſays he a few Leaves futher, <q>The Power of enacting and diſpencing with Eccleſiaſtical Laws touching exteriour Diſcipline did of old belong to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. And it was reaſonable that it ſhould; becauſe old Lawss might not conveniently ſute with the Preſent State of things, and the publick welfare; becauſe new Laws might conduce to the good of Church and State, the care of which is incombent on him; becauſe the Prince is bound to uſe his Power and Authority to promote Gods Service, the beſt way of doing which may be by fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Orders conducible thereunto.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60488:13"/>And in another place he declares that <q>it is a Priviledge of Soveraigns to grant <hi>Priviledges, Exemptions, Diſpenſations.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ſayes the Reverend <hi>Dr Sherlock, Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> in a poſitive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <q>it does not become any man, who can think three Conſequences off, to <note place="margin">Dr <hi>Sherelock's</hi> Caſe of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, chap. 6.</note> talk of the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Laws,</hi> in <hi>deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to that <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Soveraign Power.</hi>
               </q> The <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> made the <hi>Laws,</hi> and can repeal them, and <hi>diſpence</hi> with them, and make new Laws: the <q>
                  <hi>only Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Laws</hi> is in the <hi>Power</hi> which can make and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute <hi>Laws. Soveraign Power</hi> is <hi>inſeper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> from the <hi>Perſon</hi> of a <hi>Soveraign Prince.</hi>

               <q>In the <hi>Kings Power</hi> it is to <hi>remit</hi> the <hi>Severities</hi> of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> whereby he may manifeſt his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency</hi> as well as his <hi>Greatneſs</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> by graciouſly <hi>pardoning</hi> the <hi>Smaller Breaches</hi> of his <hi>Laws,</hi> and the more <hi>Capital Offences</hi> which he might moſt juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punniſh.</q>

            <p>But I remember likewiſe you ſeemed to ſtartle at the thoughts of this <hi>Power;</hi> and were afraid, if at any time the <hi>King</hi> ſhould think it <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> to <hi>exert</hi> it, and to grant a <hi>general Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> would be extreamly <hi>ſhaken</hi> in her <hi>ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>

               <q>The Common Principles of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Juſtice and Equity, are engraven by the Finger of God upon the Minds of Kings, as well as upon other Mens; and they cannot do wrong upon any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſon, much leſs to great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their Subjects, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the ſame uneaſie remorſe that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men do, when they injure one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <hi>England</hi> hath the Prince's Conſcience, for her Security, ſo ſhe hath his honour too. For Princes (like other men) are tender of their Honour, and good Name, and are powerfully reſtrained by ſhame from doing Evil to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.—Though they may be deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for their honour to have the Times computed from their Conqueſts, yet the ſame Principle of Honour will ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily make them aſhamed to have them computed from their Maſſacres, and Perſecutions, which will but get them the Surname of <hi>the Bloudy,</hi> or <hi>the Tyrant,</hi> unto the end of the World.

            </p>
            <p>And as for our Prince, <q>who was ever ſo exceeding tender of his Honour as He?</q> ſo juſt to all, and hath He not <note place="margin">Biſhop. of <hi>Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Serm. ut ſup.</note> promiſed to uphold and maintain this Church, and her Legitimate Children?<q>—He knows, that <hi>ours is a Religion</hi> that hath alwayes aſſerted the <hi>Rights of the Crown,</hi> with life and fortune: and

how chearfully the Members of it have ſpent their Blood and Treaſure in <hi>his Own, his late Majeſtie's,</hi> and <hi>his Father's Service,</hi> and how they ſtand affected to <hi>his Prerogative.</hi>

            <p>What diſhonour can it be for the King to lay them aſleep for a while to ſtay thoſe paſſionate heats, and fierce oppoſitions of ſuch as ſeem adverſaries to his Grace, or for any Parliament to repeal them, for the ſame Reaſons, <hi>non coercet ſed provocat violentia,</hi> For too heavy a hand upon thoſe whom the Law caſts down, ſhews the will rather to oppreſs the Offender, then to cure the offence? 'Tis the greateſt honour to Kings, that their mercy, like that of the Almighty, is more eminent than their Juſtice, and that their Benches, and Courts, can witneſs more compaſſion than ſeverity; for He that ſets open the Priſon doors in ſo wiſe and gracious a manner, meaneth not to conquer the Hearts and Conſciences of his People by Torment, but to winn them by mercy and ſweetneſs. Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is a virtue ſometimes of as great poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as Piety, becauſe it begets Love, and

Love breeds Loyalty, commands the very Soul, and lays the Body at the Feet of the obliger: Mercy kindles Fire and Zeal in the Hearts of Subjects.</p>
            <p>Liberty of Conſcience is a Natural Right, and therefore our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled none to receive his Doctrine, but <hi>eſt Dominus non Cogens,</hi> he is not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining Lord, but committing his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Grotius.</note> to the will, ſaid publickly to all, <hi>if any man will come after me;</hi> and to his Apoſtles, <hi>Will ye alſo go away?</hi> and his Diſciples were not Commanders, but Inſtructors and Teachers, which was their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            <p>
               <q>Perſecution in matters of meer Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a Courſe againſt the Nature of <note place="margin">

It is the gift of God, freely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Hearts of Men, not by threats and Terrors, not by Tortures and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres, but by the quiet ſtill voice of the word preached, <hi>Suadenda, non cogenda.</hi> And therefore <hi>St. Paul,</hi> though a Lawful Governour in the Church, flatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims any domineering Power over the Conſcience. As for the outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion, neither is that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to force and violence: A man may confefs Chriſt, and his Faith in him, as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60488:23"/>
freely in bonds, as at Liberty; as glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly upon the Croſs, as upon the Throne. Fear indeed may incline a weak Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to diſſemble his Opinion, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſtrain him to alter it: Fire and Faggot are ſtrong Arguments of a weak Cauſe, undeniable Evidences of Cruelty in Thoſe that uſe them, but ſlender, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Credibility to beget faith in thoſe that ſuffer by them. Laſtly, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, free, and publick practiſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Duties, that I grant may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the outward violence of man, but when it is ſo, it is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God, who never expects to reap what he did not fow.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In another place, he ſays, <q>the moſt Antient Apologiſts for the Chriſtian Faith, uſe this as an Argument to prove the Religion of their Perſecutors to be falſe, and their own true, That ſtood in need of humane force to maintain it, but theirs ſtood by the ſole Power of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is againſt (ſayes he a little further)
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60488:23"/>
the Innate Principle of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris.</hi> Thoſe, who plead moſt for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of Hereticks, when it comes to be their own Turn to be under the Croſs, ſtand for Liberty of Conſcience, and declaim againſt Perſecution for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as a thing utterly unlawful; and ſurely if we will not ſuffer it from others, we may not uſe it our ſelves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, as <hi>Dr Puller</hi> rightly ſayes, <q>if ever the Practice of Moderation, as <note place="margin">
