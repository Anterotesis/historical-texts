         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

from Veſſel to Veſſel, to take away all the Carnal Taſte, did

wait with the deſpiſed Remnant called <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as one alone from the Tumult or outſide of a Wood
can eaſieſt hear the Clamours and Outcries within; ſo I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come forth of the Forms and Forreſt of the World, <hi>unto a

holy Silence,</hi> by the power of Jeſus Chriſt within me, could
the better diſcern to ſee and view <hi>the various Sects</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi>
in their Congregations, how unlike the moſt part were unto
the true Spouſe of Chriſt; which with a heavy burthen on
my ſpirit,<note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> I beheld their Parochial Aſſemblies to appear
ſomething like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's</hi> Image in the Golden head;
but upon a through obſervation in the Life, Fruits, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
as the Iron and Clay; Barren, Fruitleſs, and Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
having the Imitations and Forms of Godlineſs, but deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Power of Chriſt, in leading forth the Creature.</p>
            <p>When thus,<note place="margin">Lu. 15. 17</note> like the returning Prodigal, I came to look on
my ſelf within, I ſaw how I had fed on husks; but God (my
Father) had Bread enough: And although Arts, Sciences,
Teaching for Hire, getting of money, with ſuch Carnal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
quieted fleſh a while, as a Rattle or Pipe doth a Child,
for a time without the Breaſt: Yet now the Immortal part
ſeeing its Emptineſs, and coming to the true Hunger and
Thirſt after Righteouſneſs,<note place="margin">Iohn 6 51, 53.</note> nothing but an Eternal God
would Satisfie, to give that Bread, Fleſh, and Drink of Life,
whereby a poor Soul may grow in Grace, and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God; but thoſe that live and depend onely upon out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Forms, and viſible Things, the ſame deceive thouſands,
who thereby fall ſhort of what they imagine.</p>
            <p>I now ſee that he is <hi>no true Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but
who <hi>is led forth by his Spirit,</hi> and ſuch we rejoyce to hear
declaring the things of God: otherwiſe upon Meeting <hi>we ſit
ſilent in the Tongue,</hi> yet having a heart full of praiſes, where
we Worſhip God in Spirit and Truth, who makes our bodies
Temples for the ſame Spirit;<note place="margin">Iohn 4. 23. 2 cor. 6. 16,</note> not ſpeaking by hear-ſay, and
humane Arts, but lay all that down; when <hi>earthly thoughts,
earthly words,</hi> and <hi>earthly works</hi> are all laid aſide, and the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
within us</hi> is ready, the Light of Chriſt ſhining <hi>in it,</hi> and the
Lord with a further Manifeſtation of his Love, enters it by his
Eternal Power; whereupon we can truly ſay, that the Lord's
preſence is amongſt us, feeding of his Flock, and making us
feel the power of an endleſs life.</p>
            <p>As one muſt come forth of the houſe which intends to ſee
it round about; ſo we in obedience to God being ſeparate
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65205:3"/>
and come forth from the world, can the better ſee how the
major part of people come <hi>to their Worſhip,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> as to a <hi>Market,</hi>
dreſſed up <hi>in their Faſhions,</hi> with their Tongues in Carnal
Diſcourſe, both going thither, and returning back; the
Eye gazing upon Vanity and Filth; the Ear ready to receive
ſuch ſtuff as defiles, and the Heart as an Anvil to Forge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
whereby they come, not enquiring, like the Spouſe of
Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 7. or as a people to do the Work of God;
as a true Wife to rejoice in her Husband; but as an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,
that wantons and ſports her ſelfe; yea, if they ſtay a
while for their coming together, what Scoffing, Playing,
Quarrelling, Carnal Talk, Unſeemly Behaviour, and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Actions are taken up amongſt them! woful experience can
teſtifie.</p>
            <p>And among ſuch people I poor wretch did once ſpend ſome
time, ſelling them words which they paid for, but did not
keep them; uſing pleaſing expreſſions, and ſpeaking by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay
(<hi>as others did</hi>) and not upon experience from Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
me, but by imitation; as Players on a Stage, aſſume the
Names, and act the perſon of Princes, Nobles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but being
come off, and unmasked, they are no ſuch men; yea, I was
perſwaded then, that fleſh muſt ſin, and have its luſts fulfilled,
while I was in the body;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 1</note> not ſeeing that all filthineſs of fleſh
and ſpirit muſt be cleanſed, or elſe Holineſs cannot be perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the fear of God. And with comfort I write this Truth,
That I have found and felt more of the Lords preſence <hi>in one
Silent Meeting,</hi> then I have done <hi>in a hundred Sermons</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by me in times paſt; and though then I did deliver them
with much zeal: But this is</p>

            <p>Take heed therefore, both you that ſel Scripture-Letter for

the Sorcerer thought with his money to purchaſe the gift
of God; but his deceit deceived himſelf, and he went without
it, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 20. And do not think that ſpeaking, hearing, and
reading the Scriptures,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15.</note> ſufficeth to make you wiſe unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
but conſider, how it muſt be <hi>by faith in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi>
So except Chriſt in Spirit be within, to work Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the ſeeing, hearing or reading the Letter avails little
without us: for the Letter of former Scriptures, the Scribes,
Phariſees and perſecuting Prieſts had, who crucified Chriſt;
as many now have the Letter alſo, yet to little purpoſe whilſt
they ſeek to deſtroy: the works of the Spirit: Nor doth Chriſt
ſay, That there is Eternal Life in the Scriptures; but reproves
the Jews,<note place="margin">Ioh 5. 39.</note> who thought ſo, yet would not own him who was
the ſubſtance of all.</p>
            <p>Look therefore, by the Light of Chriſt within you, unto
whom ye yield your ſleves in your members to obey, as Eyes
to ſee, Ears to hear, and Tongues to ſpeak, Hearts to think,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> For therein you are ſervants, whether in Power for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 13, 16.</note> or under the Devils power by living in ſin; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you live after the fleſh in the Devils Power, or after the
ſpirit in Gods Power, may be eaſily known by the minde
within of each man and woman: for upon what the mind is
carryed with moſt eagerneſs, joy and delight, in Earthly
things, or upon Heavenly things, in that eſtate you are at
preſent, of Fleſh or Spirit, either for Heaven or Hell, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
5, 6, 7. Yet <hi>I</hi> adviſe you not to take up this or that outward
Form, but to ſeek for that Pearle, and fell (or part with) all
earthly affections to buy or obtain it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 45. even
that Kingdom of God to be within your ſelves, which is in
the Sanctified Ones:<note place="margin">Luk 17. 21</note> for God manifeſts himſelf in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that <hi>he leaves man without excuſe, Rom.</hi> 1. 20.
And for that Spirit which leads into theſe Truths, <hi>we ſilently
wait:</hi> And this was</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Practiſed by the Apoſtles,</hi> who had from Chriſt two diſtinct
Commiſſions for going forth to preach: The Firſt, <hi>From
Chriſt in the fleſh, before his death, Luke</hi> 9. 1. 10. which
laſted but a time; for although they could caſt forth Devils,
whileſt it held, yet being ended they could not do it, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.
40.<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 5</note> and in this they went onely to the Jews. Their Second
Commiſſion was <hi>to all Nations, Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>both to Jewes
and Gentiles; given them by a riſen Chriſt, and confirmed by
the Holy Ghoſt, or Chriſt in Spirit, about Fifty dayes after,
Acts</hi> 2. 1. during which time, although they Prayed, yet
they did not go forth to preach unto the people,<note place="margin">Act. 1. 14.</note> until they
had that Spirit which they were commanded to wait for,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 13.</note> as
the Seal of their Commiſſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4. So they were ſilent
as unto Preaching, wherein they waited for that which
ſhould lead them into all Truth, <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. Whence note,
<hi>It was not the Letter,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt in the Fleſh,</hi> that Jeſus ſaid
<hi>ſhould do it;</hi> but him in <hi>Spirit,</hi> who promiſed his Diſciples to
come again unto them, <hi>John</hi> 14. 28. <hi>John</hi> 16. 22. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he came again to them after he was riſen from the
dead; yet in the ſeveral Promiſes we may ſee, how it was the

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65205:5"/>
In conſideration of ſuch a ſpiritual Miniſtry, note Three
Things:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The Work of</hi> Moſes.</item>
                  <item>2. Of Chriſt in Fleſh.</item>
                  <item>3. Of Chriſt in Spirit.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Moſes believed and obeyed,</hi> ſeeing things afar off,
yet drank of the <hi>Spiritual Rock</hi> that followed: but his work
was not to hold unto the end in a Levitical Miniſtry, and
paying of Tithes, with material Temple-worſhip, &amp;c. For
he ſhews, how the Lord would raiſe him <hi>another Prophet</hi> to be
heard,<note place="margin">Deut. 18. 15, 19.</note> and who would not hearken to that Prophet (Chriſt
Jeſus) in all things, <hi>the Lord would puniſh;</hi> of whom <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>Stephen</hi> ſpake the ſame, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22. &amp; 7. 38.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Note, Chriſt's work in the Fleſh, who had a glory
with God before the world was, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 5. but now aſſumed
a body to ſatisfie for ſinners, and preached in that body <hi>to
be the Light,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 9.</note> 
               <hi>for enlightning the world,</hi> to make them Saints;
not as if they were ſuch, but that they might be ſo: ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how his true Diſciples and Followers ſhould forſake all
to embrace him; and they believed he was the Son of God:
Yet then, (he being with them in his Fleſh) they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of many things; as the <hi>Riſing from the Dead, Mark</hi> 9. 10.
and <hi>Underſtanding of the Scriptures,</hi> Luke 24. 45. and <hi>of
Chriſt's Kingdom,</hi> thinking it ſhould bee temporal, in <hi>Iſrael,
Acts</hi> 1. 6. and <hi>of his Sufferings,</hi> before he entred into his
glory, after his fleſhly manifeſtation, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 21, 26. Yea,
<hi>John Baptiſt</hi> teſtified of Chriſt, yet afterwards ſent to know
if it was he, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 3. Neither doth Chriſt ſay, that then
in fleſh he told his Diſciples all things, or lead them into all
things; but left that work unto his coming in Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13
<hi>John</hi> 14. 16, 26. <hi>John</hi> 15. 26. For, although in himſelf he had
the Spirits fulneſs, yet to Believers it ſhould not come untill
he was gone away in fleſh;<note place="margin">Ioh. 16 17.</note> the veſſel of his body being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and the Unction therefore, to fill many therewith: where
Note, As <hi>Moſes</hi> Miniſtry <hi>was now at an end,</hi> ſo alſo Chriſt in
Fleſh <hi>ſhould depart,</hi> and Chriſt in Spirit <hi>would come,</hi> to ſet up a
Miniſtry, and abide with Believers <hi>for ever, John</hi> 14. 16.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65205:6"/>
Thirdly, Conſider <hi>Chriſt's work in Spirit,</hi> which is <hi>to abide
for ever;</hi> But at this the Jewes ſtumbled, thinking it was in
fleſh he ſhould continue alwaies; and ſo they looked for a
temporal Kingdom,<note place="margin">Iohn 12 34</note> and outward glory, as many aim at in
theſe daies: whereas his Kingdom <hi>is not of this world, John</hi>
18. 36. neither are his Miniſters <hi>of the Letter,</hi> but <hi>of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. Called, <hi>New Teſtament</hi> (or New Covenant)
<hi>Miniſters,</hi> having that written in their hearts before promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. 33. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 54. 13. <hi>John</hi> 6. 45. Who ſhould not

               <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Commentaries</hi> and <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> as a <hi>Shop-book,</hi>
for a Sermon;<note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> but ſpeak from the power of Chriſt within,
as <hi>Paul</hi> did, and the Apoſtles did; <hi>having the Word in the
Mouth, and in the Heart, Rom.</hi> 10. 8. For the Scriptures
muſt be preached by the ſame Spirit that gave them forth,
and not onely by Humane Learning; for Fleſh is not able
to comprehend the things of God; and <hi>who hath not this
Spirit is none of his, Rom.</hi> 8. 9. From whence we may ſpeak
boldly, That thoſe which have not this Spirit, to preach from
it, and by it, they are none of Chriſt's: and by this Spirit
they knew the things of God, who had received it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.
10. 12. and this ſearcheth the deep things of God: So it is
plain,<note place="margin">Luke 10. 2</note> That <hi>True Miniſters</hi> muſt have Chriſt <hi>in Spirit,</hi> who
ſpeaks <hi>in Spirit, Mat.</hi> 10. 20, 40. And who heareth, or deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
them, is ſaid to do it unto Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt pray God <hi>to ſend us ſuch,</hi> for men cannot do it
by calling one another <hi>Batchelors</hi> and <hi>Maſters,</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi>
upon <hi>humane Arts</hi> and <hi>Acts;</hi> which is like that of the Jews,
<hi>John</hi> 5. 44. wherein one man took honour of another: And
take heed, leaſt it be with you as it was with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of
whom it is not ſaid, <hi>ye could not,</hi> but <hi>ye would not, Luke</hi> 13. 34.
<hi>A ſad condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now this 22, day of the 7<hi>th</hi> Month, the Word of the
Lord came unto me, to warn <hi>all you in power;</hi> and <hi>you
National Prieſts</hi> (or Miniſters) called, <hi>Biſhops, Deans, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi>
or <hi>Inferior;</hi> and you <hi>that are Hearers,</hi> Know ye, that
the Lord is pleading his own Cauſe, and hath a ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
with you; Therefore take heed what miniſtry you
plead for; and remember what I anſwered <hi>William Prynne;</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:65205:6"/>
That there is no Goſpel Plea for Tythes nor forced Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
&amp;c. To you <hi>that was,</hi> and <hi>this is</hi> from the <hi>Lords Spirit,</hi>
by me his Meſſenger.</p>
            <p>Now as the Apoſtles <hi>Silent Meeting</hi> was in expectation of
the Spirit before promiſed; ſo God (in Scriptures) having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
himſelf, that in theſe latter dayes there ſhould be flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
forth thereof, <hi>we ſilently wait for it;</hi> and whoſo looks now
for this promiſed Spirit (being a frequenter of <hi>Silent Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>)
muſt in the power of Jeſus Chriſt, ſincerely ſtrive to
have theſe Three things in themſelves:
<list>
                  <item>1. A Spiritual Watch.</item>
                  <item>2. A Spiritual Touchſtone.</item>
                  <item>3. The Spiritual Scales.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay unto all,<note place="margin">Mar. 13. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Watch;</hi> For ye know not when the time
of Tryal is,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 8.</note> or when the coming of the Spirit ſhall be; it
being as the Winde, <hi>which bloweth where it liſteth;</hi> For fleſh
loves to break out, and have it's will, and the luſts thereof;
therefore <hi>the ſpiritual Watch</hi> muſt be truly kept within, to
ſee and note what works are in hand, and what words are
iſſuing forth, and what thoughts are in thee: But thoſe
which keep not <hi>this Watch,</hi> do run haſtily upon action, and
their tongues ſpeake unadviſedly, in haſty Queſtions and
Anſwers, oftentimes proceeding to Paſſion, and Rage, like
ſhort fits of madneſs, with their hearts wandering out after
folly, and carnal objects, by which means many Profeſſors
break forth into filth;<note place="margin">Pſal. 39. 1.</note> yet ſay, They are Souldiers of Chriſt,
but keep not a <hi>Spiritual Watch</hi> under him; ſo their tongues
are not bridled, nor have they learned to take heed unto their
wayes.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if thou ſeekeſt to reap the pure Benefit of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Meetings,</hi> learne firſt to come unto a <hi>pure Silence</hi> in
thine own ſelf, which is <hi>to ſilence all in thee that is evil,</hi> by
that Eternal Power of God; ſo thy tongue, heart and hands
ſhall be under <hi>the Faithful Watch,</hi> and the Actions without
in the body, with thy Actions within of thy mind, as Love,
Joy, Deſire &amp;c. will by degrees be all brought into true O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65205:7"/>
which <hi>Watch</hi> keeping according to thy meaſure
(or Talents received) ſin ſhall not have dominion over thee:
but thou wilt grow in Grace, and become a Conqueror in
him that hath loved thee:<note place="margin">Mar. 13. 37.</note> Therefore remember what
Chriſt ſpake to his Diſciples, was alſo to thee, and me,
<hi>Watch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, When the work, word or thought, is thus ſlaid
<hi>by the Watch,</hi> then bring it <hi>to the ſpiritual Touch-ſtone;</hi> for
tryal, whether it be good or no; for oftentimes Satan and
Fleſh covers Vices under the names of Virtues, and will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
extenuate or leſſen a Sin, or elſe flouriſh it over with ſome
zeal, or pretence of holineſs; therefore we muſt <hi>prove</hi> and
<hi>try them</hi> in the Light of Chriſt: which the Apoſtle ſets forth
by Examination and Proof of a man's own work, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5.
<hi>Gal.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5, 10.</note> 6. 4. and thereby is ſeen what is acceptable to the Lord:<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 3.</note>
For God <hi>by his ſpiritual work</hi> cometh into a man as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finer,
to purifie; and unto what ſtrength and heat the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
fire in thee is come, ſo is the melting, trying; and refining
within, upon proof of thy actions, and taking away
of droſs and filth: Yea, note in words themſelves, how ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they are <hi>too many;</hi> ſometimes <hi>unſound</hi> and <hi>untrue;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>too ſhort,</hi> in telling <hi>but half a truth, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore let
them firſt <hi>be tried <hi>by the Spiritual Touchſtone,</hi>
               </hi> before they
proceed out of thy mouth, whether they are pure or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Uſe <hi>the Spiritual Scales,</hi> to <hi>weigh, ponder,</hi> or
<hi>conſider all things</hi> to bee <hi>ſpoken</hi> or <hi>done,</hi> before they paſs
from thee: For man durſt not let ſo many filthy words drop
from his tongue, if firſt they <hi>were weighed</hi> or <hi>conſidered</hi>
within at the heart: <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay, Yes</hi> and <hi>No,</hi> muſt bee
the ſame as they are ſpoken, and ſo ſpeak the ſame thing <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi>
and <hi>pretended;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 8.</note> for otherwiſe <hi>you are Lyars,</hi> and
<hi>Lyars are for the Lake,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 15</note> 
               <hi>to bee amongſt Doggs, and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers
without:</hi> yet with many, lying is common, who
have not learned to ſpeak the ſame thing intended; as,
if you ask them <hi>to eat, to drink, to tarry,</hi> &amp;c. they will
ſay <hi>No;</hi> yet deſire them again, and <hi>they will accept it;</hi>
ſo here <hi>they are Lyars:</hi> Some in ſcoffs and mocks, think
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65205:7"/>
it is witty to ſpeake a Lye, in a Jeſt; others being asked
the truth of a thing, will ſometimes flouriſh and enlarge it,
making the ſame <hi>too much,</hi> or <hi>too little,</hi> as in praiſing or
diſpraſing, in buying or ſelling, and account themſelves
expert dealers, and cunning Chapmen, becauſe they can
uſe their Tongues for advantage; whereas <hi>they are but
Lyars in it;</hi> and ſuch know not what a <hi>Spiritual Watch</hi>
meaneth: Therefore know, That in all ſuch Eſtates ye
are quite out <hi>of the Good Old Way,</hi> or <hi>Way of Truth;</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
If any ſuch ſeem Religious, yet they are not ſo,
ſeeing their tongues are unbridled,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 26.</note> not brought to the Truth,
and their Religion is vain or empty. Yet becauſe you are ſuch,
I do not ſay, you are damn'd; but declare your being captive
in fleſhly <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſhewing from the Spirit of God, what muſt
be done by you, if ye are ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any are in Chriſt, they are new Creatures;</hi> and there is
<hi>a New Heaven,</hi> and <hi>a New Earth in them:</hi> For all their <hi>Parts,
Members, Faculties,</hi> and <hi>Abilities;</hi> are put <hi>to a New Uſe,</hi>
the <hi>New Heart,</hi> and <hi>New Spirit</hi> is in them; ſo they
<hi>Speake</hi> and <hi>Act New Things</hi> from that Law of God written
in their inward Parts;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 31.</note> and ſuch dare not Vent their Frothy
Words, as Fleſh did formerly; but now there is a killing of
that; as <hi>Paul</hi> dyed daily; ſo the new Creature Dyes daily
to Sin; he is Dead as to Act in Sin, but Lively to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;
whereas the Sinner is quick to Sin, but Dead and
Dull in the things of God; So thou ſhalt ſee the difference
of theſe Two Eſtates, betwixt <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> when
thou comeſt to uſe <hi>the Spiritual Watch, Spiritual Touchſtone,</hi>
and <hi>Spiritual Scales;</hi> according to thy meaſure in the
growth of Grace, to know the power of an endleſs life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thee, working and effecting theſe things; and then thou
mayeſt ſay, <hi>I now ſee what pure ſilence is;</hi> yea, then thou ſhalt
benefit by <hi>Silent Meetings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thoſe that are come <hi>to the pure ſilencing of fleſh,</hi> to
bridle the tongue,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 12 2 Cor. 10. 5.</note> to wreſtle with the ſpiritual Wickedneſs
in the high place of the heart, that each Tongue may be
brought into Obedience unto Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 31.</note> and whatſoever they
Act, do all to the Glory of God; ſuch can witneſs the Power
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65205:8"/>
of Chriſt in them, and when he pleaſe to call them by his
Eternal Spirit, to go forth as Miniſters, they can beſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what God hath Revealed unto them. As the Man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Devil's caſt forth,<note place="margin">Mar. 5 20</note> publiſhed in <hi>Decapolis,</hi> how great,
things Jeſus had done for him: Whereas they that preach
<hi>by hear-ſay,</hi> and <hi>humane ſtudy,</hi> ſhew, they ſpeak not as the
Spirit gives them utterance, but with the Tongues of fleſh,
from Carnal Apprehenſions: So that, when they preach
unto the people, it might be objected: <hi>Jeſus I know hath
the Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 19 15</note> 
               <hi>and Paul I know had it; but who are ye? Upon what
account would you conjure forth ſin out of others, who have not the
true Spirit your ſelves?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore let none Aſſume or Own any other Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
then thoſe called forth by the Spirit of God, as
Chriſt in Spirit,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 6</note> after his Reſurrection and Aſcention, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
the ſame, to lead them into all Truth, and bring all
things to their Remembrance, as able Miniſters of the Spirit,
and not of the Letter, as Carnal men do, who teach one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Humane Learning, and then ſell it for Divinity, forcing
many to pay for it <hi>a dear rate,</hi> even to <hi>ſpoyling of Goods, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment</hi>
and <hi>Cruelty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome will object, Their Non-Scripture Diſtinctions
of <hi>Mediate,</hi> and <hi>Immediate; Ordinary,</hi> and <hi>Extraordinary, &amp;c.</hi>
ſaying, That although the Apoſtles were ſo called of God,
yet they ordained others not ſo called; and ſo out of their
Carnal Inventions, they undertake to conſecrate or make
<hi>Steeple-houſes, Maſs-Houſes, High-Places,</hi> or the <hi>Tower-houſes</hi>
to be Churches, and to be <hi>Holy-places,</hi> and fit men by their
<hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi> to preach in ſuch places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>

the Pulpit,</hi> then <hi>into a Tub:</hi> For <hi>God is worſhipped in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Truth:</hi>

&amp;c. Now it is not fleſh and blood that Reveals this unto
them, nor the Tongues of Humane Learning, which qualifies
men thus for the Miniſtry, but the ſame Spirit of God:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65205:8"/>
Therefore it is common to ſee thoſe having much Humane
Learning to be Great Perſecutors, and will not take up the
Croſs to follow Chriſt, and ſo croſs their own Luſts, Pride, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,
Envie and Filth, but give way unto it, by which
means we find ſo many cruel Prieſts; For there is ſcarce any
