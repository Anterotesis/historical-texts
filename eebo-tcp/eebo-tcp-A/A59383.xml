            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Where, in a great Storm and Tempest, he falleth into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressable Horror and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of Minde; till at length, by Shipwrack, losing all his Company, he is cast on a scraggy Rock, and There, by a Religious Person (as an Hermite entertained; till reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his Peace and strength with a quiet minde, he also Learned the <hi>Religion, Laws, Customs, Language and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,</hi> of That <hi>New Iland:</hi> fully described in the Books following this First Part.</p>

            <p>How Christ, taught his Disciples and others to pray, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. How He prayed to His Father; and How a Christian to Christ, and the Father, in and through Christ. As <hi>Calebs</hi> Daughter to Her

And This Covenant with our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Sure Mercies of David,</hi> are made Good to the Lowest, Least Believer; and <hi>He that is Weak shall be as David;</hi> and receive his <hi>sure</hi> Holy things, as Esay 53, with Acts <hi>2d</hi> and 13.

            <p>And When, This is like to be; is One Great Part of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: Concluding, that As Time began with <hi>Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Day,</hi> or Evening before Morning; so with Winter before Summer; Or in <hi>Tisry,</hi> the Seventh Month (as the Jewes render <hi>Beresith,</hi> as the Hebrew Letters, in the first word of <hi>Genesis:)</hi> So it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable, the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the New Heaven, and the New Earth, shall be, when the Year, that began at <hi>Nisan,</hi> when they came from <hi>Egypt;</hi> shall come to <hi>Tisry;</hi> or the <hi>7th</hi> Month; and Great Feast of <hi>Tabernacles;</hi> Or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathering of all the Fruits of the Earth, at the Close of Harvest, and Vintage, at the End of the Year (as the

            </p>
            <p>In the mean time there are Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses fixed, As at <hi>Mispa the Watch;</hi> and <hi>Gilead,</hi> the Rouls or Stones of Witness; That <hi>Laban,</hi> and <hi>Haran,</hi> Wrath, and Care, and Fear shall pass away (As <hi>Wrath</hi> in Hebrew, is somewhat <hi>Passing away:)</hi> but shall not pass over, Those Witnesses, for Hurt to <hi>Jacob,</hi> or his Relations, though his Wages be Changed as often as the <hi>Moon</hi> (or <hi>Lebana</hi> from <hi>Laban:)</hi> and he be rouled between <hi>Hamath</hi> and <hi>Haran,</hi> the Heat of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and Cold of the <hi>Moon,</hi> or its Wandrings.

            </p>
            <p>Which are still much measured by 3 and an Half. As at first Creation (which did <hi>Bare</hi> or <hi>Bear</hi> out, somewhat Hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den before;) The Sun and Moon did not appear till the <hi>4th</hi> Morning (and the Jewes assign the <hi>3d</hi> Hour:) Till which, they lay as Dead, or <hi>asleep in their Causes,</hi> as the Schools express. And This, being First in the Kind, is Measure to All that follow, Both in <hi>Weeks;</hi> which have 3 and an Half, or 7 Halves, of Light, in Dayes; and as much Darkness, in their Nights: and in <hi>Months,</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> or the Earth, may be Eclipsed, 3 Hours and an Half; or be Hidden, in the Rayes of the Sun, 3 Dayes and an Half. Which Changes of the Moon, may represent the Changes of the World also. And at every New Creation, the <hi>Witnesses</hi> to be Hidden, as Dead, for 3 Days and an Half; or about the <hi>10th</hi> part of the Time of That Month, or Age, or World: and Then Rise with such an Earthquake, as we read in Psalm 104, and Rev. 11. 13. and Then the voyce from Heaven, <hi>Come up Hither,</hi> is but as the Word, at first Creation, <hi>Let there be Lights in the Firmament,</hi> As Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And the New Moons, or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, were solemn <hi>Moeds;</hi> as appointed by the <hi>Sanedrin;</hi> and not under 2 or 3 <hi>Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> deposing that they had seen the New Moon. Who were therefore Feasted, and Encouraged, to Watch for it: as Holy <hi>Job</hi> may allude in That, <hi>All my appointed Time I will Wait, Till my Change Come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the New Moon were seen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Noon, That was the First of the Month; but if not till After Noon, the Next Day, was accounted First, by Their Rule; who also tell us, that at first, the Moon was equal to the Sun, but in contest, God made her blush, and hide her face so long, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> saw her not, till the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon of the <hi>6th</hi> Day. And to bring it neerer yet to the <hi>Revelation;</hi> The Moon Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> in the <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack</hi> (that Crooked <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,)</hi> meets a <hi>Dragon,</hi> as they call those <hi>Nodes,</hi> of <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons Head and Tayl;</hi> ready to Catch the Woman in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, or her Child, by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipses;</hi>

in which the Moon, or Earth, is Darkned.</p>
            <p>So that Darkness may shadow the <hi>Dragon,</hi> or the <hi>Beast,</hi> of the Bottomless pit; or that <hi>Abyss,</hi> we read in Gen. 1. the measure of the Rest. This slayeth the Witnesses of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth; and bindeth up our Eyes, and other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses also, both in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the Temple, or <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of Witness</hi> also.</p>
            <p>Where all the <hi>Witnesses</hi> were measured by them in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and their Goings and Comings; and by 3 and an Half, or 7 Halves; and 7 (as in the Lamps:) There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no less Number, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, made of 3 and an Half, in whole Numbers, but 7, and those that come of 7. and Seven in Heb notes <hi>Fulness;</hi> and <hi>Rest,</hi> and <hi>Turning,</hi> as in <hi>Sabbath;</hi> as in every <hi>7th</hi> Hour of the Sun and Moons Motion. And 7 Dayes also make the Moons Quarters, and 14 Change her whole Face: and bring her up to Those at the Poles also: Where she is Hidden Half her Monthly Course; and so is the Sun Half his Year, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning in the <hi>7th</hi> Month: As to All the World; in One of the <hi>Equinoctials.</hi> And so, ln the Temple; As in slaying the Lambs, and offering all the Witnesses, there might be found, Daily, 3 or 4 Hours; So, they ceased also, 7 Hours, from the Morning Sacrifice, to the Evening <hi>Minha;</hi> and Then 14, to the next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. As Their Longest Night was but 7 minutes more than 14 Hours (as the Moons Returns and Fulls, in somewhat more then 14 Dayes:) and yet they made or counted Their Night <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> (to the Day) as the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish still call it: whose Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, Phrases and Idioms, are neer akin to the Hebrew; as this Discourse sheweth, in very many Instances.</p>
            <p>And as 7, is made of 2 Threes and an Half, or 3 times 2 and an Half; So All Their sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Blood, in their Dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrifice, were by 7, or 3 and an Half, on their Great Altar, made with 3 Corners and an Half; being Cut, to bring it All into <hi>Benjamine,</hi> (and their Incense Altar, and divers other things, by 2 or 3 Cubits and an Half:) and the 7 Lamps, in the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick, branched by 3 and an Half, on either side. And their Musick, with 3 sorts of Instruments; besides their breath or spirit; and 3 kinds of Blasts, with Quavering,
<pb facs="tcp:51941:8"/>
between 2 plain Songs; as singing <hi>Catches,</hi> or <hi>Chatses;)</hi> or it may be <hi>Watches:</hi> Some of which had Musick, to part them (as our Waites) and others Silence; as the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; Silence for Half an Hour;</hi> while the Incense was offering, and the People stood without, in silent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Prayer.</p>
            <p>And as 7, is the Lowest Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber made of 3 and an Half, in whole Numbers; so is 14 the next, of 3 times 4 and an Half. (for 3 times 3 and an Half, is a Fraction of 10½.) As 7 is made of 3 and 4; or 3 times 2 and an Half, So is 14 of 3 with 4, and 2. 3 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Father of All Numbers; and 2 the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Great with Child in 4, which is its Square; and the First <hi>Square</hi> (as its name and form in Hebrew:) and the measure to All other <hi>squares;</hi> which may be All Resolved by 4, as <hi>Cubes</hi> by 8.</p>
            <p>Here, discoursing the Scripture Numbers of 7 and 14, the Author finds them All mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by the Times and Changes, made by the Sun, upon the Moon, or Earth; in every <hi>7th</hi> Hour, <hi>7th</hi> Day, <hi>7th</hi> Month, and <hi>7th</hi> Year, which was also <hi>Sabatical;</hi> as the Seven <hi>7th</hi> a <hi>Jubilee.</hi> And the Months so fixed, that whether we begin the Year about the <hi>Vernal Equinox,</hi> as the Jewes did after their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of <hi>Egipt;</hi> or at the <hi>Autumnal,</hi> as probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yet still, the <hi>7th</hi> Month also, will be Holy. One of them for the <hi>Passover,</hi> on the <hi>14th</hi> Day, and the Other for the <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> from the <hi>14th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Both, had a solemn <hi>Moed,</hi> of 3 Dayes and an Half, for the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> before the Feast. As the Paschal Lamb was Tyed up from the 10th, to the 14th (and so the Dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lambs were kept, and searched, and prepared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they might be Offered:) And Though Sackcloth and Ashes might go off, at the Close of the 10th of the 7th Month; the Great Day of <hi>Attonement;</hi> yet Their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Gods Sitting to Judge, All Dying That Year, made them All as Tyed up, in Fasting and Prayer, till the Eve of <hi>Tabernacles:</hi> which was As the Resurrection, in the Morning Light, freeing our Eyes and All the other Witnesses, from their <hi>Chains of Darkness. And he bringeth His Judgment, also to Light, every Morning; Though the wicked will not see it;</hi> As

            <p>And the Sun and Moons returns to Them in 14 Hours at Longest Night, and in 14 Dayes, of the Moon; to Them at the Poles; and for Changing her own Face, and the Earth, and Tides; may be Measures to all the Great Things, in the Temple, and other places, Done on the 14th Hour, or Day, or Year, in Scripture. Where also many Persons or Places, as <hi>Witnesses,</hi> lying Dead, or as Dead, and lost, for 3 and an Half; or 3 times 2 and an Half; or 3 times 4 and an Half, whlch is 14.

And <hi>Paul</hi> was strucken Down and Blind till the 4th Day: and in a great storm by Sea, first 3 Dayes; and Then they Lightned the Ship; and was not fully freed, till the 14th; and so, he went up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (or to the 3d Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) in the 14th year.

            <p>The <hi>10th</hi> Day of the <hi>7th</hi> Month, was the only Fast appointed by God; or the Great Day of Attonement; to which they reckoned 187 Dayes of the year: as there were 187 Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits in the Court of the Priests and Clean men of <hi>Israel;</hi> about the Temple.</p>

            <p>The First of Those 3 Months, or <hi>Moeds,</hi> of 666, Was from the First Temple, to the Second sack'd by the <hi>Romans;</hi> (as That by the <hi>Babylonians;)</hi> just 666.

            <p>Then, the Great, and Rich, and Mighty men, were All carried Captive; and the Vineyards and Olives, &amp;c. Left to the Poor; As promised, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34. <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. with <hi>Ex.</hi> 23. adding, that <hi>What the Poor left, the Beasts should eat.</hi>

            <p>And though we do not know the just Hour of that Day; It seemeth very early; so that some assign it to the <hi>9th</hi> (as that Decree, They should not enter into <hi>Canaan:)</hi> and 1526 Hours (As Years from the First <hi>Pentecost)</hi> came to the Morning Sacrifice, of the <hi>64th</hi> Day, ending in 1536 Hours; as it beginneth in 1512.

            </p>
            <p>1290 more in Hours come about the very day of the <hi>7th</hi> Month, Fasting for <hi>Gedeliah:</hi> slain by <hi>Ishmael:</hi> As so many years of Christ bring up the <hi>Ottoman Family</hi> (which the Jews call <hi>Ishmael,</hi> as <hi>Hagarens;)</hi> in the East: As many Great Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Earth-quakes, in the West; besides the <hi>Sicilian Vespers,</hi> and the first great Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee,

            <p>And 1572, That famous Year in <hi>France,</hi> and other Nations, may thus close the <hi>10th</hi> of the <hi>7th</hi> Month, being but just 240 (the hours of ten dayes) more than 1332; being twice 666, or two Changes of the Moon, from the last Great Sack of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by the <hi>Romans.</hi> And if the 2d Change, begun the <hi>7th</hi> Month (or <hi>7th</hi> Trumpet) Then 333 more, come up to the Evening Sacrifice of the <hi>14th</hi> Day, or Preparation for the <hi>Feast of Tabernacles;</hi> which begins the <hi>15th</hi> Day of the same Month: the great Time here Enquired.

<pb facs="tcp:51941:15"/>
State:) And then, the <hi>24th</hi> or last Hour of that Day, will be at the <hi>95th</hi> of Christ, which so many make the first year of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of <hi>Domitian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>50 Dayes more (or 1200 hours) bring us quite through the <hi>5th</hi> and <hi>6th</hi> Months: although Both of them should have 30 days; As the Scripture Months in the <hi>Revelation</hi> (where 42 Months have 1260 Dayes;) and other places; besides the Flood, of 365 Dayes.</p>
            <p>So that 1200, added to 95, come to the Feast of <hi>Trumpets,</hi> or, to the <hi>7th Trumpet;</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>7th</hi> Month: in 1295.</p>
            <p>360 more, in 15 Days, come up to 1655: The first Day of <hi>Tabernacles.</hi> Which may also be sooner, if the <hi>Roman Sack</hi> were not Till the Morning of the 10th Day: Or if each other Month had but 29 days, as the Jews now reckon, by <hi>Middle Motions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, it may be Hereabout, by all Accounts: yet so, that the first Day of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> must begin (as all other) with 12 hours of <hi>Night before Day.</hi> And they <hi>Dance</hi> not, till the Evening <hi>Minha,</hi> or Incence, closing the Evening Sacrifice, with All its Songs and Waters from the <hi>Wells of Salvation,</hi> as they called them, from <hi>Isa.</hi> 12. So that if it began in 1654, we are yet but at <hi>Midnight:</hi> and the Sun of This Day, will not Rise, till 1666, twice 666 and an half.</p>
            <p>And we found 666, and all its principal parts, very signal to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Troden down by the <hi>Jebuzites,</hi> 444 years after <hi>Aegypt:</hi> Then Recovered by <hi>David.</hi> Then again by <hi>Sesac,</hi> K. of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>Rehoboam:</hi> which may be 444 years from <hi>Judahs</hi> Burning it (in <hi>Judges</hi> 1.) As That, about 444 years from <hi>Sodoms</hi> flames; After <hi>Abraham</hi> was met by the K. of <hi>Sodom;</hi> and <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedech of Salem:</hi> which must meet also at this Great Return both of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Sodom,</hi> as we find in That to <hi>Abraham,</hi> with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures Here discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. And That First Burning of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (in <hi>Judges)</hi> might be as long, After Their First <hi>Pentecost;</hi> As the Last Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, was After the Last Great <hi>Pentecost,</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Then again by <hi>Joash,</hi> in the 14th of <hi>Amaziah;</hi> just 666 years from <hi>Egypt:</hi> As <hi>Samaria</hi> much about 777.</p>
            <p>Then besieged by <hi>Senacherib,</hi> in the 14th of <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> 666 years, before it was Taken again by <hi>Herod.</hi> As by <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> 666 years from the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51941:16"/>
first coming on <hi>Israel:</hi> And the Temple sacked by <hi>Crassus</hi> (slain at <hi>Abrahams Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran;)</hi> 666 years after <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> Death. As by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> 666 years from <hi>Joash</hi> sacking it 666 from <hi>Egypt:</hi> and by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> just 666, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its Last Sack, by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To whom 666, is also very sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, from the very Building of <hi>Rome:</hi> coming up with <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah;</hi> Born of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> but 12 <hi>years old;</hi> which in page 149 is <hi>Two,</hi> and 75 for 57, in This <hi>Sum</hi> printed.</p>

So much speaking the goodnesse and bounty of God, the great Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, with the Liberal hand, upbraiding none, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Persons, but in all Nations devising how to keep his Banished from perishing (as the woman of <hi>Tekoa</hi> spake to <hi>David;)</hi> and still accepting and rewarding those that fear and diligently seek him, hoping in his goodnesse through Jesus Christ, the onely way of pleasing him: to whom be given, as of right belongeth, Kingdom, Power and Glory, through all ages, for ever more. Amen.</p>
            <p>Touching the Author, it may be, we should not ask or enquire his Name, Nation or Quality, seeing himself so Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in it: and it may be as unlawful to pry into others secrets (especially of their mind and spirit) as to unseal a Letter, break open an house, or discover that which is committed to ones greatest Trust. Yet by some passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he seemeth to intimate his Parents Christian and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, who bred him tenderly (and yet strictly) in the best way they could, both in Learning and Religion; which seemed to have taken a deeper impression in his tender years, then he well retained afterwards, in the croud of this World and worldly employments, both in War and Peace, with many Civil Relations. In all which he found himself so much entangled, beyond his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or desire, that for some years together, it seems he wrestled with something within him, that oft moved him to a more retired life; which yet seemed to flie from him, the more he pursued it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51941:18"/>
About the height or greatest heat of the late Plague in <hi>Naples,</hi> having lost his Father, with other near and dear Relations, he became so disconsolate, that in a sad for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn manner, he wandred a while, rather then Travelled, all alone: till among other places, coming at length too neer the great City of <hi>Rome,</hi> in that contagious season, when he hoped for some little rest, he fell into great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Death among some strict searches, for suspected Persons, from infected places.</p>
            <p>But by great mercy, escaping that danger also, he was yet it seems so followed by the al-seeing eye, that he was scarce got out of sight of <hi>Civita Vechia</hi> (or some other place about that City, whence he might escape by Sea,) But in a terrible storme and Tempest, he was also seized and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested with many privie Seals on his Conscience, in most unutterable pangs of fear, Terror, and amazed Horror; with a most heavie weight of guilt, from all his former course of life, which then lay gnawing on him, with a grim vizage of death (that King of fears) staring and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping on him, with its open jaws, ready to devour him.</p>
            <p>This grew up to that height at length (the storm still lasting and encreasing) that there needed no other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse or witnesse, Judges or Jury, to Indict, arreign, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn and execute this Malefactor, but Himself, and his own hands in his own bowels; had not some over-ruling secret Power restrained him, or prevented opportunities.</p>
            <p>Which ere long yet, might seem to be offered, when he heard the sad doleful shreekings of his fellow passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, while All at once saw their hopes and ship broken together, spliting on a scraggie Rock; where they all bid adieu, to themselves and Time; Now lanching out as they all thought, into the boundlesse Ocean of Eternity.</p>
            <p>Wearied with expectance and pursuit of death, (which they feared, and he wished, as a little pauze to that Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which he judged worse than Death,) rather then struggling for life; he lay gasping on the top of a scrag, somewhat higher then his fellows: where those waves that had cast him up, seemed to leave him a while, as step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping back a little, in regret, rather then pitty; that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51941:18"/>
with greater and renewed force, as he was like enough to fear, they might return again to assault and afflict him.</p>
            <p>In these hoping fears, and strength enough to recollect so much of his bewildred reason, as to think he yet lived, though he knew not how or where: a grave aged Person came, or was rather sent from some higher power that had seen and pittied him it seems, as having been a mournful spectator of that shipwreck.</p>
            <p>After some real expressions of most cordial sympathy with his sad forlorn condition (which came out in sighs, and groans and Tears, rather than words:) the grave Hermite (for such he seemed) carried, rather then led him, into his Cell, which was hard by the place, and in the same Rock, where the proud swelling waves had been commanded so to leave him.</p>
            <p>As he was preparing such repast, as that distance from the World could afford, he perceived such a meen and carriage, with other characters, in his wearied Guest, as made him much guesse of his native Countrey and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: to which therefore he suited his Language, as he judged likest to be understood by his Stranger. Who yet replyed little, but so many sighs and broken groans onely, as with piercing looks, might intimate he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sensible of his goodnesse and compassion; but that it could not avail him now, since he was become the most wretched object of the Creators wrath, and the whole Creations scorn and hatred.</p>
            <p>There needed no more to melt the good Fathers heart, and make his bowels yern over his Strangers soul and spirit, more then before on his broken and distressed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Yet it was some comfort to discern such a sense of his sore, and what it was. For which also he was the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prepared, by the like workings and sufferings in his own spirit: which by many years experience of much affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and sorrow, had been taught to sympathize with all dejected spirits, and to long much for their cure and healing. To which therefore he now soon applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, after some few questions, onely to discover more clearly the breadth and depth of the wound; that so he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51941:19"/>
might more perfectly discern what Teincts, Plaisters, or other remedies, were proper for his oure.</p>
            <p>The poor Soul had very few words to answer any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; not that he would not, but he could not, speak his grief, and sorrows of a heart too full to vent it self, in ought but Horror and amazement: when a necessity of Breathing sometimes, forced out such sighs and groans, as otherwise were unutterable. In those breathing paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, when he had not strength enough to weep more, his eyes and spirit, rather then words, expressed such an ingenuous willingnesse to speak his heart, without any reserve (or such shinesse, as is usual to strangers) that the Father had no need to presse him to Confession: which he waved rather, seeing his poor Guest ready enough to pour out his soul, when ever he could, and in some things which he thought not meet to hear: much lesse to presse him, to All particulars, which might occasion such Horror, as was like enough to overwhelme his soul and body both; so that he thought it very requisite to apply Cordials as soon as he might; seeing him ready to faint, and swoon away, in his spirit, almost every moment.</p>
            <p>Here the Authour craveth pardon, if he be forced to be more confused, then becomes so great a Subject. But the poor soul being then in great sorrow and confusion of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, could not keep method, in asking questions, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning answers: or be clear in stating their discourse. It being written also some pretty time after; so that he cannot be punctual, in saying this was first, and this next: His intent being matter and substance, much rather then Manner, or circumstance. Nor must the Reader wonder, if he sometimes find a long discourse of many things added together, which came out by degrees, at several times and occasions, as their mutual discourse, or dialogue invited or lead, rather then drew them: although one part of the Dialogue (Questions and Objections) be omitted now.</p>
            <p>He is also desired to consider, All things are better much in their Original, or native dresse and Language, then they well can be in a Translation: and from such a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51941:19"/>
as constraineth the Translator to conjecture (that I say not divine) at the Authours meaning in some places. Where haply also, a broken line and points, may hint the Original there imperfect, or somewhat wanting. Which yet possibly might be supplied from some other copy; which is not yet found: and the characters of this, in some places also, scarce Legible.</p>
            <p>Yet All things material, and of consequence, are as faithfully represented and expressed, as they well may be, from such a discourse as sighs, and great pangs of sorrow (and perhaps also some other causes) make abrupt, and broken, more then is usual: especially in the first Book; which is therefore presented by way of Abstract (rather then a literal Translation:) and as the Ancients did their Parables.</p>
            <p>To all the poor soul said against it self, it was replyed, to this purpose. All this may arise very much from mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of God and your self; and although you cannot have too great and high thoughts of God in any thing; yet you may have too great thoughts of your self, in every thing: yea in your very sins.</p>
            <p>God hath made all our hearts so much alike, that there is perhaps, no great difference in Temptations, Thoughts or Actions, but what is common unto men. And to think our selves better or worse then other men, may be from Ignorance of our own and other mens heart; which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and special, is so desparately evil, and deceitful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, that it may be worst when we think it best; and it may be best, when we judge it worst.</p>
            <p>Yea, it may be great Pride, and no Humility, to judge one self a greater sinner then others; from conceit of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving greater Light, or Love, then our neighbours have. Or, if you think you have more abused these, though not more of these, then others; yet in this also you may be deceived: and God needeth not your Lye for him, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your self in any thing. And if you judge amisse of your self, God is so Holy and Just, that you never
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51941:20"/>
need fear that He will confirm or execute your wrong Judgement.</p>
            <p>And if you judge rightly of your self, you are not so miserable, as you conceive your self; but as you do that which is one of the Highest and Hardest Acts possible (which is to judge ones self rightly:) so you have one of the Greatest Bbessings which God giveth to the Sons of men, (or to his own Son:) which is a right understanding of a right Judgement; which was the Great Argument used by the greatest and best man that ever lived, to prove that he was of God, and had His Spirit, and a Will also moulded into His Holy Will: for else, he saith, he could not Judge Righteous Judgement. And who ever doth this of himself, and his own sins, is in a special manner, partaker of the Holy Ghost; whose proper work is to convince us rightly of sin, Righteousnesse and Judgement: and who ever judgeth himself rightly, shall not be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God.</p>
            <p>Here he stopt, and sweetly bowed, and turned aside a little; but returned soon again, looking as cheerful as he could well force himself: It being not very easie, so to clear up his eyes and face, but that it might be seen (though he hid it) that he had wept. Which also pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Guest; both to see the Fathers affection, and his own misery. Who was still so unhappy as he some way expressed) to be a burthen to himself, and all he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with: supposing he had grieved or displeased him by some of his expressions. But when the Good Father perceived those thoughts, with a most sweet, tender and melting look, he replyed,</p>
            <p>No my Dear Brother, no: you do not burthen me at all; or in any thing displease me. But as my general du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bids, or helps me in some measure, to mourn with every one that mourneth, and to weep with every one that weepeth; So my particular respect and affection now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth me: if at least, it can be force, upon a Fathers tender bowels, to yearn over his son; or a brother, over his own dearly beloved brother.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:51941:20"/>
Yet there is somewhat in You, that maketh me melt in Joy, rather then sorrow: tho it may be unutterable; for I cannot expresse it. I saw you were my Neighbour at the first, as a Man: and so I found my self obliged (This is Little and low) both to Love and Honour you; for that Image of God I ought to acknowledge in you: and the great Law of Love, that commands Brotherly kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, bids us adde Love also; yea and to strangers also: for the same chapter that bids us <hi>Love our Neighbour as our self,</hi> bids us <hi>Love a stranger</hi> also as we love our selves.</p>
            <p>And among divers reasons why we should love strangers, it is sometimes added, <hi>Because God loveth strangers.</hi> Yea and we are bid to <hi>entertain them</hi> so, <hi>As</hi> if they were or might be <hi>Angels:</hi> seeing some had unawares so entertained Angels.</p>
            <p>But now I see somewhat more in you: not onely a Man, and my Neighbour, but a Christian also; and my Dear and pretious Brother: whom the Angels do attend, and love, and honour, as a lively Image of their great Lord and Master Jesus Christ. And how is it, that the Brother of my Lord thus cometh to visit me?</p>
            <p>And you are so far from having committed that great sin, against the Holy Ghost (which you so much fear,) that you are still under the most gracious workings of that Holy Spirit: Whose great work is to convince the world (even the world, and not onely the Apostles or Disciples, but the World) of Sin, Righteousnesse and Judgement. which is also promised to the World, even to the World: and is fulfilled in you, who are thus, under the convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing spirit of Promise.</p>
            <p>And it will also comfort you: for the same spirit that convinceth, is also the Comforter: and where it wounds, it heals: and when it hath convinced both of Sin, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Righteousness; (which is there promised;) it will also comfort. It being the promise, or indeed the property and nature; yea and heart of God, to heal and quicken whom he wounds and kills: which from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Song,</hi> runs all along through the Psalms and Prophets: Who tell us, <hi>If he wound, he will heal:</hi> Yea though he kill
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51941:21"/>
for two dayes. He wil revive and quicken on the Third. For he will turn again, and have compassion on us; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he delighteth in mercy: though he cause grief for a while, and yet not willingly, or from his heart, afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the children of men; which is his Strange work. But Mercy is his Child, his Son; and comes as naturally from him, as a child from any father: For he is the Father of Mercy; yea of a multitude of mani-fold Mercies: which are also One with the heart of Christ: for, He is the onely begotten of the Father: and yet His Father, is also the Father of Mercies: so that Christ and Mercies lay toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one womb; and indeed are the same: for, how else is Christ the Onely begotten of the Father?</p>
            <p>And you are under the tender mercies of Christ, even that Christ who is Mercy it self: and this holy Spirit of Promise will certainly be your Comforter: being already I see your Remembrancer, to bring to mind his words, one of his proper Works: having also convinced you of Righteousnesse enough in him, (Everlasting Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) to satisfie God, and sanctifie you.</p>
            <p>And I hear you not onely acknowledge him to be the Son of God, and sent of God, to be the Saviour of the World; but also you are convinced of sin, because you have not believed on him (the great promise of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,) and are made most truly and highly to value, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, long and pray for him, and To him: which you could not, but by the gracious workings of that Holy Spirit of promise; whose great work was, and still is, to set up Christ, as he set up his Father.</p>
            <p>Which Character given by Christ, of his own spirit, is repeated also by the Apostles. And St. <hi>John</hi> gives it as the Touch-stone whereby we should try the spirits; saying, <hi>Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus is come in the flesh, is of God:</hi> and again, <hi>he that confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, dwelleth in God, and God in him:</hi> and again, <hi>whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God:</hi> and again, <hi>He that is born of God, sinneth not,</hi> (that sin) or <hi>worketh not</hi> sin: (which is a common phrase in the Language of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51941:21"/>
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and other places of Scripture:) Doeth not sin, So, but that <hi>the seed of God still remaineth in him; as the sap of an Oake or Teile, when it casteth its leaves:</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> in that most remarkable Chap. cited in the six first books of the New Testament. For the Jews rejection and return again, as an emblem of the whole Worlds Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing or Resurrection: it being plain in the Prophets, and our Saviour also, that God would never deal worse with any, then with that Nation. And the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> saith, <hi>he that believeth shall never cease from giving fruit,</hi> and the Psalmist, <hi>that his leaves shall never quite fall off:</hi> and Christ saith, that he which beareth any fruit in him, <hi>shall be purged, that he may bear more.</hi> In him, <hi>is all our fruit found:</hi> and in him we go in and out, and still find fresh pasture: and he that once drinketh of His living waters, never thirsteth more; or is quite dry, but still findeth a fountain in him, flowing up to Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>If thou shalt confesse with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raised him from the Dead thou shalt be saved.</hi> For which also, he citeth two great Prophets, <hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Joel;</hi> which is cited also by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in his first publique Sermon: <hi>For whosoever shall call upon the Name of the Lord, shall be saved. For this Jesus is Lord of All,</hi> (even <hi>Davids</hi> Lord also,) <hi>and Rich unto All, that call upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> also saith, that <hi>no man can say, that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</hi> (Which was oft no little stay to one I sometime knew, in great anguish, fearing the good Spirit had forsaken him) And to all that so acknowledge Christ for their Lord, and as their Lord worship him (as the <hi>Psalms</hi> bid us) and call upon him; the same Apostle saith, that <hi>no temptation comes but common unto man; And that God is faithful and will not suffer them to be Templed above their strength; but with the Temptation will provide an Issue, that they may be able to bear it:</hi> Which is also the last Petition in Our Lords Prayer, and so sure to be granted.</p>
            <p>And to All, so acknowledging Christ, St. <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousnesse;</hi> And to All
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51941:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
such he saith, <hi>If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, even Jesus Christ the Righteous, and he is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our sin, and not for ours onely, but for the sins of the whole World;</hi> which are some of the sweetest places in the Bible, and belonging to All that call on Jesus of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth;</hi> which I see you do.</p>
            <p>And to All such, and therefore to you also, St. <hi>Paul</hi> (the great Teacher of the <hi>Gentiles)</hi> writeth, as from God in Heaven, and his Son Jesus, the Judge of all men and Angels also, that <hi>if we judge our selves</hi> (as I see you do) <hi>we shall not be judged by him,</hi> which is one of the greatest and highest Prerogatives, or Royalties, a mortal man can be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of.</p>
            <p>The Jews speak of it, as one of the first things delivered by God to <hi>Moses,</hi> and by him to <hi>Joshua</hi> (and so down through all their Elders and Wise men in all ages) to be <hi>Slow to judge,</hi> or very slow in judging; and it is one of the greatest and most difficult things in the world, to be a righteous Judge, in any matters of concernment, more of our selves, and yet more in matters of another world, and yet most of all for all eternity; so far above our sence and reason also, that we know not how to guess about it but by Revelation.</p>
            <p>The great thing foretold of Christ in the Psalms and Prophets, is, That he was to be the great and most supream Judge of all Persons in all Causes. Which we might track through all the Bible up as high as <hi>Enoch, Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his Saints to execute judgement upon all,</hi> &amp;c: and for this he received a most solemn Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and was fitted, and filled also with the <hi>spirit of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Knowledge, Understanding, Councell, Power,</hi> and <hi>Fear of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Lord;</hi> yea to make him <hi>very quick or tender in the Fear of God,</hi> that he might <hi>judge righteous judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this was one great reason of his being made Man, that he might be our Peer, and an equal daies-man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, that should not make us afraid with his Terror when he judged us: it being so consonant to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and to Scripture also, that the Power <hi>Legislative, Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:51941:22"/>
and <hi>Executive,</hi> should be in distinct persons, and run in distinct Channels; God would have it so in himself also, and came out in the person of the <hi>Father, giving the Law,</hi> (though indeed the Free persons that receive and submit, (even the <hi>Law-takers)</hi> are the great <hi>Law-makers:)</hi> But the <hi>Sonne</hi> is the <hi>Judge,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> executes his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Son; that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. For as the Father hath life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself: (and the Son quickneth whom he will:) and hath given him authority to execute judgement also, because he is the Son of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jesus Christ therefore being the great and only Judge, (having all judgement committed to him) no man may pre sume to make himself a Judge, or take it on him, but when Christ committeth it; and then onely As he commandeth and directeth. Let me therefore first desire you to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that you run not on a Premunire, or be Anti-christian, or a Traitor, against the main office of Christ, while you judge your self, or any other; for, who hath made you a Judge or a divider?</p>
            <p>If you say Christ hath bid you judge your self, you must be sure of your Commission; that you have it, and can read and understand it also. For his own general rule, out of his own mouth, was, <hi>Judge not, that ye be not judged.</hi> And he that taketh upon him to judge and condemn another, or so much as to think evil of his neighbour (and t'is worse of a stranger whom he knoweth not,) <hi>speaketh evill of the Law, and judgeth,</hi> or condemneth <hi>the Law;</hi> yea, and it may be, the Law-maker also.</p>
            <p>And though Christ did promise first to his twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <hi>(Judas</hi> also, it seems, being among them) that they, <hi>having followed him in the Regeneration, should sit on twelve Thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of Israel.</hi> And afterwards (even after his last supper, before his death) he said to them, <hi>Yee are they which have continued with me in my Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and I appoint you a Kingdom, as my Father hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto me; that you may eat and drink at my table, in my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:51941:23"/>
               <hi>and sit on Thrones judging the twelve Tribes of Israel,</hi> (there being then also, it seems, twelve with him, and so <hi>Judas</hi> also, though Saint <hi>John</hi> saith, he went out immedate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the sop.)</p>
            <p>Yet this was not to be, till he himself was to receive his Kingdom, and As he did receive it at his Fathers hand and appointment; which was not till after Death, and Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and Ascention to his glory.</p>
            <p>Then, <hi>he received gifts for men, and for the Rebel also:</hi> Then, and not till then, he gave out the Spirit, which was <hi>not to be given, while he was not glorified:</hi> Or till he was exalted, and <hi>set on the right hand of God, and made a Prince and a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, for to Cive repentance and remission of sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, he never speaks of himself as a King or Judge, till his second coming: Being (as himself said) <hi>to go a great journey, to receive a Kingdom, and after a long time</hi> to come again, and call his servants to account. And if the wicked servant shall say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; and <hi>shall begin,</hi> so much as once begin, to beat or strike his fellow-servants (for <hi>the Lords servant must be gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle towards all, and be no striker)</hi> when he shall but <hi>begin to strike;</hi> his Master will come when he looketh not for him, and will cut him asunder, and give him his portion with Hypocrites, the Doom of Antichrist, who thus took on him, so before his time to sit, and rule, and judge, before his master gave him power or leave, or indeed was come to sit and reign, and judge in his own Person.</p>
            <p>Which was not till other Thrones be cast down, or set, as we read in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Revelation.</hi> For he must sit, at his Fathers Right hand, till all his enemies be put under him; and then his Throne and Judgement shall sit: and judgement shall be given to them also that shall sit with him: who still called himself <hi>the Son of man,</hi> and never a King, or Prince, or Judge, till That Comming and That judgement.</p>
            <p>And then he saith, <hi>They shall see the Son of man come in the Clouds with great power and glory: and when you see those things,</hi> (and that sign of the Son of Man comming in the Clouds;) <hi>Then know the kingdom of God is come, even at the</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:51941:23"/>
               <hi>very doors:</hi> Then, and not till then; it is come, actually come, and till that time but comming; and he bids us pray, and say, <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then, shal <hi>the Son of man send forth his Angels,</hi> (which before he called his Fathers Angels, and the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,) now, <hi>His Angels;</hi> the Son of Man shall send forth <hi>His Angels,</hi> and <hi>they shall gather out of His Kingdom</hi> (which is Then his Kingdom) <hi>all things which offend, and them which do iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then, and not till then, the Son of Man shall sit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Throne of glory;</hi> and <hi>then the King shall say to them at his Right hand;</hi> and again the King shall answer them. But to the goats at his left hand, He shal say, (he saith not, the King shall say; as if he were only a King to the sheep, or they only were members of his Kingdom; but to the goats he saith) Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels. For as the Son of Man hath his Angels, so the Devil hath his Angels also: of which we read again in the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where, as also in <hi>Pauls</hi> great charge to <hi>Timothy,</hi> &amp; several other Texts of Scripture, we read of his Kingdom joyned or annexed to his second comming or appearing again after his Ascention, at which time he was asked, If he then would restore the Kingdom unto <hi>Israel;</hi> which he doth not deny, but waveth only, forbidding their curious prying into times and seasons, which the Father yet had kept so secret, that the Son then knew them not, but had them afterwards, it seems, by Revelation.</p>
            <p>Which God gave him also, to shew unto his servants, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom he saith it was given to know the secrets, or the mysteries of that Kingdom, and to search them out also, by that Spirit, which was given, to make known the things which were freely given them of God; yea and to search the hidden Depths or Baths of God: as that Apostle saith, who also tells us, The natural man believeth not the things of God, or of the Spirit of God, nor can he know them, being only discerned spiritually.</p>
            <p>And no man can so much as <hi>see the Kingdom of God, till horn again</hi> of that Spirit; which the <hi>World;</hi> as such, <hi>neither</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:51941:24"/>
               <hi>knoweth nor receiveth;</hi> but it is promised to the <hi>World</hi> also, and <hi>to convince the world also;</hi> and when a worldly carnal man is born again of the Spirit, and so made Spiritual, then <hi>he also judgeth all things, but himself is judged of no man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor may any man judge another man, or any person whatsoever, (or can judge himself rightly,) till he be made spiritual; and so fitted by Christ the great and only Judge, of all Causes, and of all Persons.</p>
            <p>And to whom, and in what cases, Christ committeth this Prerogative of judging either themselves or others; I know not any hath declared better then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of the same Epistle.</p>
            <p>But as Christ gave that general rule, <hi>Judge not according to appearance;</hi> and then surely we may not judge things that appear not, or things of another world, and for all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity: Whereas the Wise man saith, <hi>A man cannot know Love or Hatred,</hi> and much less, <hi>Eternal Love or</hi> Hatred, by <hi>all before him,</hi> or appertaining to him:</p>
            <p>So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giveth us that generall Rule, <hi>Judge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> even nothing at all, <hi>before the time:</hi> That is, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self addeth, <hi>Till the Lord come.</hi> (For his comming is the time of judging, and his Kingdom: as we have seen from that Apostle, and from many other scriptures.) And <hi>I would to God your time were come,</hi> that <hi>you might judge and reign, that we might reign also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>the Kingdom of God,</hi> and this <hi>judging also,</hi> is <hi>not in word,</hi> but in Power: As our Lord taught us, Thine is the Kingdom, the Power and Glory. And in the Revelation, Now is salvation and strength, the Kingdom of God, and Power of his Christ; for the Accuser of our Brethren is cast down: For Christ also maketh the kingdom of God to be a Power to cast out Satan by the spirit or finger of God; and when <hi>Judas</hi> was gone out (as a Type of Satan or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ) he saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God glorified in him.</p>
            <p>And so Christ said, Some standing there should not taste of death, till they saw the <hi>Kingdom of God come with Power.</hi> Which another Evangelist expresseth by the <hi>Son of man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in his Kingdom.</hi> And S. <hi>Pet.</hi> (One of the Eye-witnesses of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51941:24"/>
that glorious Transfiguration which was an Emblem or preludium to his Kingdom) calleth it <hi>The Power and coming of our Lord Jesus.</hi> And himself being asked if he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> bad them stay, till they received <hi>Power</hi> from on High, or the Power of the Holy Ghost com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them, which he also calleth the <hi>Promise of the Father.</hi> For the Spirit of Promise, which is to be given to all the Lord shall call, yea to be poured out on all flesh, is called by <hi>Esay,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Power:</hi> and it is so observed of them that received it in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that they were full of the Holy Ghost and <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> also calleth it a spirit of Power, and Love, and of a sound mind; and saith, he came with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the Spirit and of Power: And again, when you meet with my spirit, and the <hi>Power of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this was a Judging Power, is plain by all that Chap. speaking of casting out, and judging them which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, while God only judgeth them that be without.</p>
            <p>And in the next Chapter, Do you not know, <hi>The Saints shall judge the world?</hi> Are you not worthy then, to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not, that <hi>we shall judge An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?</hi> how much more, things that pertain to this life? Set ye them to judge, who are least esteemed in the Church? Is there not a wise man among you? not onethat is able to judge <hi>between his Brethren?</hi> And in that very Chapter (you presse so much against your self) he saith, <hi>Judge in your selves, Is it comly that a woman pray to God uncovered?</hi> And of their Church-meetings he saith, If ye speak with Tongues, speak by two or three at most; but if ye Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, do it by two or three at the least (for so seems the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position) and let the others judge: For you may all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and you should all desire earnestly, and pray, that you may Prophecy (even above all other spiritual Gifts;) but it must be in order, and not confusion, while some <hi>Iudge:</hi> and still the spirit of all Prophets are subject to the Prophets; both old, and now also; while you be in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, you must keep Church Order; and your spirits must be subject to the Prophets, before you, and among you also.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:51941:25"/>
But of the Sacrament he saith, You must here <hi>Iudge your selves;</hi> and be not concluded by others Judgement. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat and drink: For, He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and drinketh Damnation (or at least Judgement) to himself: and for this cause are many weak and sick, and many sleep: For, <hi>If wee would judge our selves, we should not be judged; but when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the World.</hi> Which is one of the most sweet and comfortable places in the whole Bible; as before we observed, in this Epistle also about Temptation.</p>
            <p>Which also may, and should comfort you: So far are you from being condemned, as you think, by God, who will never confirm or execute any wrong judgement, though you give it against your self. And yet you should be tender how you judge your self unworthy of Eternal Life, which is the free gift of God; least the spirit say (as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to the <hi>Iews, Seeing you put the Gospel from you, and judge your selves unworthy of Eternal Life, Lo we turn to the Gentiles.</hi> But if you judge a wrong judgement, God is so merciful and just also, as not to confirm it.</p>
            <p>And if you judge <hi>Rightly,</hi> you are so far from being so wretched and miserable as you think your self, that you are one of the happiest men in the World; and not onely still under the gracious Spirit of Promise convincing you ofsin, and also of righteousnesse, setting up Christ in you, and making you bow and long for him; but also receiving from him one of the greatest and highest gifts possible; which is a right Judgement, and a power and priviledge to judge your self (the hardest and highest work in the world:) so that you never shal be judged by the Lord.</p>
            <p>A Royalty not given unto any, but the Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or first-born of Jesus Christ; his Churches, as at <hi>Corinth,</hi> or the members of them, or such as are sanctified in Christ Jesus; called to be Saints: and to such as in any place call upon the Name of Jesus Christ the Lord, both theirs and ours: as I hear, and see, and know you do.</p>
            <p>And therefore I pronounce it, written to you also, as a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51941:25"/>
letter from Heaven, or the Throne and Heart of God, in Jesus Christ our Lord and yours; whom you so call upon, and trust in. For, how could you call upon Him, if you had not believed on him? As you may read in the Tenth of the Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> compared with the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which we now speak of.</p>
            <p>Nor do I wonder <hi>Paul</hi> should put such a stresse upon calling on Christ, when (by his own experience, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of all Christians) he had found it the great Badge of a Christian; and the greatest Character he could well expresse of one taught and drawn by God to come to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; who (though the Mediator to God) yet indeed is the end also of all the Teaching and Drawing of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which I will therefore on this occasion more largely insist upon, as one of the greatest and sweetest things I can declare to you, especially in this great hour of darknesse and temptation.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> saw <hi>Stephen</hi> the first Martyr stoned (consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his death, and standing by, keeping the clothes of them which stoned him,) he might easily observe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that he died, calling on Jesus Christ, and saying, <hi>Lord Jesus receive my spirit.</hi> And again kneeling down, he cryed, <hi>Lord lay not this sin to their charge;</hi> and saying this, he fell asleep.</p>
            <p>He might very well wonder that in the very Infancy of Christian Religion, any could so quickly speak and pray to Christ: and that also, with such courage and boldnesse, as daring to die in it; and to desire no other rest or happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then, that Jesus only should receive his spirit, and forgive his stoners. Doubtlesse it could not but take deep impression in so wise a man as <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Saul</hi> was.</p>
            <p>And so it seems it did, for presently he went and got a Commission from the Rulers to bring bound to <hi>Jerusalem all that he</hi> should find <hi>calling on Jesus.</hi> Which he could not but see a most distinguishing Character between Jews and Christians; for the Jews also called on God; but the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians only called on Jesus Christ: and by that character he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51941:26"/>
might easily discern who were only Jews, and who were also Christians; and so binde All, he found calling on Christ.</p>
            <p>And when Christ appeared to <hi>Ananias</hi> in a vision, he bad him Enquire in the house of <hi>Iudas:</hi> Which we may consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der again, when we see <hi>Paul</hi> rising up in the room of <hi>Iudas;</hi> and of <hi>Saul</hi> also, being of the same Tribe, much about a Thousand years after <hi>David,</hi> that is <hi>Love,</hi> had cast him out, and bound him up; as Satan must be bound for a Thousand years, and then perhaps struck down, as <hi>Saul</hi> here was, by fire from heaven; <hi>Saul</hi> also signifying <hi>Hell,</hi> or the <hi>Grave;</hi> and so might well be an Emblem of Satan, which is the very Phrase used by <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Abishai;</hi> to which Christ also might allude, when he called <hi>Peter</hi> Satan.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Ananias</hi> (or the Lords grace) was sent by Christ to look out <hi>Saul,</hi> he said, <hi>Lord, I hear he hath authority to bind all</hi> that <hi>call on thy Name:</hi> To which Christ replyed, Go, for he is a chosen Vessel to bear my Name to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and to Kings, and the children of <hi>Israel</hi> (though the Jews shall reject and persecute him; yet he shall bear my Name even to the Ten Tribes of <hi>Israel,)</hi> and I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my Name, even for my Name, which now he fights against.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Ananias</hi> came, he laid his hands upon him, saying, Brother <hi>Saul,</hi> the Lord, even Jesus, who appeared to thee in the way, hath sent me, that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. Adding also (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> observeth, to the chief Captain and people of <hi>Ierusalem,)</hi> The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his Will, and see that just One, and hear the voice of his mouth; for thou shalt be his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse unto all men. And now why tarriest thou? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins (for even those that were baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire, like the Apostles at <hi>Pentecost;</hi> yet were to be baptized with water also, as we see in the History of <hi>Cornelius:)</hi> calling on the Name of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And that it was the Lord Jesus, on whose Name he bad <hi>Paul</hi> pray, and that he prayed to him, is very plain by that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51941:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which <hi>Paul</hi> himself addeth to those words, <hi>Arise and call upon the Name of the Lord: And while I prayed in the Temple, I fell in a Trance, and saw him, saying to me, Hast and get thee out of Ierusalem, for they will not receive thy testimony concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me. And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every Synagogue those that believed on thee: And when the blood of thy Martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by and consenting to his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him. And he said unto me, Depart, for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.</hi> As before, Unto my people Israel.</p>
            <p>Which may be one among other, divers other, Reasons why I may think the Ten Tribes scattered among them, were then also called Gentiles; yea and that they might be even some of those <hi>Gentiles,</hi> while they were to be called <hi>Loammi,</hi> and <hi>Loruhama;</hi> though afterwards the very same people were to be called <hi>Ammi,</hi> and the people of God; as an Emblem also that the world should come to be the Lords <hi>Ammi</hi> and <hi>Ruhama,</hi> from <hi>Loammi</hi> &amp; <hi>Loruhama.</hi> Israel being but the first fruits of the world, as we may clear anon.</p>
            <p>And there are many things which makes me a little su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, that some Gentile Nations (as they seem) may be some of the Ten Tribes; or at least the posterity of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> by <hi>Keturah,</hi> or by <hi>Ishmael,</hi> if not by <hi>Isaak</hi> also through <hi>Esau;</hi> especially the old <hi>Saxons,</hi> and those Northern people, whose very Lawes, Customs and Language savour so much of the Hebrew in very many things, and words, besides their common use of A and The for Articles, with very many Monosillables, and words written with ch. gh. gn. cn. or kn. th. dh. wh. wr. fr. And many others, plainly Hebrew sounds.</p>
            <p>In another place also <hi>Paul</hi> giving an account of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Agrippa</hi> the King, saith, I verily thought, I ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Jesus of <hi>Nazareth;</hi> which I did also, having received authority from the chief Priests; and I punished them in every Synagogue, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to blaspheme; (styling himself also a Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:) And being exceeding mad against them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But being strucken down, and hearing a voice speaking, I said, Who are thou Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51941:27"/>
thou persecutest; But arise and stand upon thy feet, for I have appeared to thee for this purpose, to make thee a Minister and a Martyr, both of these things which thou hast seen, and those in which I wil appear unto thee; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering thee from the people (of the Jews) and from the Gentiles unto whom now I send thee: To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God; that they may receive forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sins, and inheritance among them which are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by faith which is in me.</p>
            <p>Which I cite so largely, because I take it for the best compendium of the Gospel, and a true Ministers Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that I remember. And that phrase of Faith in me (not only on me, but in me) seemeth not by chance, but so considerable, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> often useth it in divers places, especially to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> where he calleth it Faith of Christ, or Christs faith; as if he would say, <hi>He lived,</hi> and was saved by faith indeed; but that which was in Christ rather then in himself; or Christs faith, rather then His: as if Christ by believing (for he was justified by faith also in a true sense) did not only carry out himself, but all his Members also, from the Grave, and Death, and Hell, to life and glory.</p>
            <p>And to summe up all I have, or should deliver, of <hi>Pauls</hi> observing prayers unto Jesus Christ, 'tis said in the Ninth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> That when he Preached Christ in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, that he is the Son of God; all that heard him, were amazed, and said, Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this Name? and came hither that he might bring them bound to the chief Priests? So that it is clear, it was in <hi>Pauls</hi> account the great Badge of a Christian, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing Character of Christian profession.</p>
            <p>And it is worth observing, How he useth that Name, and what a stresse he put upon it, all along his life and writings. Having obtained help of God (saith he) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue witnessing to small and great, saying no other things then what <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets said; that Christ should suffer, and should be the first (the very first) that should
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51941:27"/>
rise from the Dead (though others might be raised before him) and should shew light unto the People, and to the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>Which also he cites to the Jews, in that most remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sermon at <hi>Anioch, Acts</hi> the Thirteenth (of the sure mercies or holy things of <hi>David,</hi> promised to every one that thirsteth, and cometh to the waters; and many other particulars:) concluding with their turning to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as the Lord commanded saying, I have set thee to be a <hi>Light to the Gentiles,</hi> and for salvation to the utmost ends of the earth.</p>
            <p>And the Psalm addeth, To them also that are afar off in the seas, (and <hi>America</hi> in the Hebrew may signifie a <hi>People afar off;</hi> though I believe, that Phrase in the Psalms may mean some farther, or mere lost, or miserable, then the poor <hi>Americans.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So old <hi>Simeon</hi> said, Christ was to be a Light to lighten the Gentiles (first to lighten the Gentiles) and then to be the glory also to <hi>Israel,</hi> his people <hi>Israel:</hi> Whence People often opposed to the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>And another <hi>Simeon</hi> at the great Council, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. saith, God put no difference between them and us, purifying their hearts by faith: But we believe (saith he) that through the Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved, even as they.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Paul</hi> learned (or might learn) his Character, or proper mark he giveth them of his genuine Epistles; The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all: Which he wrote with his own hand, it seems, in all his true epistles.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Antioch, Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> came to <hi>Iconium,</hi> and there spake boldly in the Lord, which gave Testimony to the Word of his Grace, granting signes and wonders to be done by their hands. And returning again to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi> (and other places) confirming the souls of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God (which St. <hi>Matthew</hi> onely, calleth the Kingdom of Heaven:) and ordaining them Elders in every Church, praying with fasting, they commended them <hi>to the Lord Iesus,</hi> in whom they believed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:51941:28"/>
Thence coming up, to the Counsel, at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they there declared the Miracles and Wonders, God had wrought by them, among the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> where <hi>Iames</hi> (whom <hi>Paul</hi> calls an Apostle, and so <hi>Peter</hi> also owned him as chief among the Brethren, in the twelfth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> which tells us before of <hi>Herods</hi> killing the Apostle <hi>Iames:)</hi> discourseth of Gods promise to raise up the Tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> that the residue of men might seek after the Lord; and all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> upon whom My Name is called, saith the Lord, (even Jesus) who doth all these things.</p>
            <p>For we may generally observe that by Lord (especially where distinct from God) they mean the Lord Jesus: who is Lord of All, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and rich unto All that call upon him: and we have but one God, the Father, and One Lord, Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>And to Him, the Apostles, and whole Church, prayed, at the Election of <hi>Matthias;</hi> calling him the Lord Jesus; and then set two, saying, <hi>Thou Lord that knowest or search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est the Hearts of All men:</hi> the proper character of Christ, as he writes to <hi>Thiatyra,</hi> all the Churches shall know that I search the reins and hearts: and that also as God Man: for as God only, he need not search our Hearts.</p>
            <p>From that great Counsel, <hi>It seemed good to the Apostles and Elders, with the whole Church, to send chosen men, with their beloved</hi> (who had hazzarded their lives, for the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ) <hi>Barnabas and Paul.</hi> For, the Holy Ghost setteth <hi>Barnabas</hi> generally before <hi>Saul,</hi> and often also before <hi>Paul:</hi> which name is not given him, till he taught <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> that prudent Roman Governour. Assaying to go into <hi>Bithynia,</hi> the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them: for so it is read in some of the best copies.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Philippi</hi> (called by a man of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> in a vision) <hi>Paul</hi> meets a Damsel possessed with a spirit of Divination, (tho she cried, <hi>These men are the servants of the most High God, which shew unto us the way of salvation;</hi> For, an evil spirit may preach true Doctrine:) but <hi>Paul</hi> being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee <hi>in the Name of Iesus Christ,</hi> to come out of her; and he came out the same hour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:51941:28"/>
And on this, being beaten and cast in prison, and there loosed at midnight, to the Trembling Jayler they say, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Lord Iesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.</hi> Thine House also: Even as salvation came to <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> House also, when to him; and to <hi>Lydias</hi> Houshold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, when to her.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Ephesus,</hi> finding certain Disciples, they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed <hi>in the Name of the Lord Iesus.</hi> Which seems equal therefore to the name of Father, Son and Holy Ghost: for the Apostles were commanded to baptize in the Name of Father, Son and Holy Ghost; and yet they did it in the Name of Christ onely: and no wonder</p>
            <p>For, the full latitude, or fulnesse of the god-head dwelt in Him: and there is no other God, but in him, and one with him; and therefore he that sees him, sees the Father also; and he that worships him, worships the Father also; and him that serves him, will his Father honour, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self saith; and by consequence him that prayes to him; which a great piece of worship and service.</p>
            <p>He is thy Lord, Worship him: as the Psalmist to the Spouse, or whole Church; which therefore prayeth unto him, all along the <hi>Canticles,</hi> and Revelation also, where the Bride or whole Church and Spouse of Christ, and the Spirit also, prayeth to Him, saying, <hi>Come Lord Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> had laid his hands on the Twelve Disciples also of the Gentiles at <hi>Ephesus</hi> (which then might be the head of the Gentiles, and the first that received an Epistle from Christ in the Revelation:) the Holy Ghost came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and they spake with Tongues and Prophesied; as the Twelve Apostles at <hi>Pentecost.</hi> To which also, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> seems plainly to allude, in the first Chapter of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to that Church at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> or to the Saints there, and faithfull in Christ Jesus, as he styleth them, and not a Church; as at <hi>Corinth</hi> and other places.</p>
            <p>Some Vagabond Jews adjure evil spirits there, in the Name of Jesus, whom <hi>Paul</hi> preacheth; and the evil spirit answering, Jesus I know, and <hi>Paul</hi> I know, but who are you? and leaping beat them through the man possessed:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51941:29"/>
Whence fear fell on them all, and the Name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. As we read at the close of that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Miletus,</hi> calling the Elders from <hi>Ephesus</hi> also, most pathetically he discourseth, how for divers years he had served the Lord Jesus among them, with all humility of minde, and with many tears and temptations; testifying both to Jewes and Greeks Repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ. But none of these (troubles) move me, nor count I my life dear to me, so I may finish my course with joy, and the Ministry which I have received of the Lord Iesus, to testifie the gospel of the grace of God; even of the grace of God.</p>
            <p>And now I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the Kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. And yet that he came after this also, again to that very place, is probable, or certain, from his leaving <hi>Trophimus</hi> at <hi>Miletus</hi> sick (in the 2. to <hi>Tim.)</hi> who now went with him to <hi>Jerusalem.,</hi> Acts 21. 29. Or shall we say, he was deceived, when from <hi>Rome</hi> also he wrote, to so many neer those countreys, that he trusted to be given to their prayers, and to come to them again. O how watchful must a good man be, least his own spirit rise too much, with the true Spirit of God: or least the Envio us one sow Tares, with the good mans Wheat.</p>
            <p>And (when <hi>Agabus</hi> had bound his hands and feet with <hi>Pauls</hi> girdle) he saith, What mean you to weep and to break my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, <hi>but to die</hi> also, for the Name of the Lord Iesus. Then they ceased, saying, The will of the Lord (that Lord) be done.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where he spake often of that Name, and in it, and of praying to it, as I observed before; he is brought by a dangerous Voyage and shipwrack to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no sign that a man is out of the way, or not sent by God, or called by him to a journey, when he meets with great storms, and danger of death, by shipwrack, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. For the Lord met <hi>Moses</hi> in the Inn, and sought to, slay him, in his way to <hi>Aegypt:</hi> though he sent him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on so great an errand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:51941:29"/>
               <hi>Noah</hi> brought rest to the World through the Floud, and many tossings in great Waters; And we might have lost some of the sweetest portions of the Gospel, but for such storms by Sea.</p>
            <p>In one of them Christ is in the Ship, but asleep; and they wake him, crying, Carest thou not, that we perish? And he soon took care, and rebuked the winds, though blaming their unbelief, and fear with amazement: which is <hi>Peters</hi> phrase (to the Daughters of our good Mother <hi>Sara)</hi> and he might learn it from our Saviour, in their storms and fears, with such amazement: which is a phrase used several times in the Gospel.</p>
            <p>But doth God take care of bodies? Will he not be more careful of our souls? and pity them more? If we would cry (and wake him also, when he seems asleep, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, or in us, and among us) and say to him, Master, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest thou not, that our souls perish? Even those precious and Immortal souls, which thou seemest to value above the whole World, saying, <hi>What shall a man give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his soul?</hi> It is said Our blood shall be precious in thy eyes; and shall not our Souls be more precious? O we of little faith.</p>
            <p>At another time, Our Saviour did not onely send away his Disciples, but constrained them to go in a ship, when they might have gone another way: But they would have sent away the poor people supperlesse from him; and when he had supped them, He sends away his Hard Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples to be tossed in the Sea, while he blessed the poor people. In the fourth watch of the night, he shews himself (God is nearer us in a storm, then we believe or Expect:) and he saw them tossed, some pretty while it seems; but would not help them (or appear) till the last watch: and then they are more afraid, and cryed out, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it to be an evil spirit. So easily may we mistake the kindnesse of God, and think him to be the Devil, to devour us, even then when he comes in goodnesse to save us. But he first rebuketh their fears; and saith, <hi>It is I, be not afraid.</hi> And when <hi>Peter</hi> would venture out beyond his strength, and ready to sink, cryed <hi>Save me, I perish;</hi> He
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51941:30"/>
is moved with compassion, and immediately stretcheth out his hand, and catcheth him, the very phrase used to the <hi>Hebrews, He caught not the nature of Angels,</hi> but he caught the seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> He suddenly reached out his hand, and caught, as we snatch a thing perishing in fire or water: So he caught <hi>Peter</hi> (As he would do us also; if in our fears and sinking, we would so cry out to Him, <hi>Help Lord, I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.)</hi> How quickly did he bring him into the Ship, and it, with them all, safe in a calme to their wished Haven? O that men would praise the Lord for his goodnesse, and wonderful kindnesse to the sons of men, as the Psalmist re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats it several times in the 107. Psalm.</p>
            <p>Such goodnesse and wonderful kindnesse did the Lord shew to <hi>Paul</hi> also, in that stormy voyage to <hi>Rome;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yet he did not onely preserve Him safe, but all his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low passengers also: as he told him in a night vision: saying <hi>Fear not Paul, thou must be brought to Cesar; and lo God hath given thee all them which sail with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> he expounded and testified the Kingdom of God, perswading them of Jesus, both out of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and out of the Prophets. And for two years dwelt in an hired house, receiving All that came to him, Preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence. As we read in the <hi>Acts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he also taught them to pray to Jesus Christ, is plain enough from the stresse he putteth on it, in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to those very <hi>Romanes,</hi> in the tenth chapter; Where, to believing with the heart, he joyns also confession with the mouth: and explaineth it by praying to him: For it is written, <hi>Whosoever shall call upon the Name of the Lord shall be saved. For the same Lord over All is Rich unto All that call upon him. But how shall they call on Him, in whom they have not believed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> is directed to the Church of God at <hi>Corinth;</hi> to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be Saints; with All that in every place call upon the Name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51941:30"/>
theirs and ours. And concludes thus, <hi>The Salutation of me Paul with my own hand; If any man love not the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, let him be Anathema, Maranatha; The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you; my love be with you all, in Christ Jesus. Amen.</hi> Which belongeth to every one that in any place calleth on Jesus Christ. And to All us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are All things, and we by him: as he speaketh in the same Epistle.</p>
            <p>And the second Epistle concludeth with <hi>the Grace of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and the love of God the Father, and the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghost be with you All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As that Epistle, so all his Epistles generally, begin with <hi>Grace and Peace,</hi> (and some add <hi>Mercy</hi> also) <hi>from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, who</hi> (as the Epistle to the <hi>Galathians</hi> addeth) <hi>gave Himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil World, according to the will of God and our Father: and I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the Grace of Christ.</hi> And concludes that Epistle, <hi>From henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> among many other remarkable passages of Jesus Christ, he prayes, that <hi>Christ may dwell in their hearts by Faith, that ye being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fulnesse of God.</hi> Namely, <hi>by him in whom All fulnesse dwelleth; Yea, all the fulness of the Godhead:</hi> And therefore He that desireth Him, and prayeth to Him, prayeth to the whole fulnesse of the Godhead, and desireth it. And in the same Epistle, <hi>He that descended, is now ascended far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Heavens, that he might fill All things, and gave gifts, &amp;c. for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</hi> And concludes that Epistle, <hi>Peace be to the</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:51941:31"/>
               <hi>Brethren, and Love with faith from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be with All them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So to the <hi>Philippians</hi> every where, Especially in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous place of Bowing in the Name of Jesus: paralel to that of the Psalm, <hi>Early will I seek thee, and ever will I bless thee, and lift up my hands</hi> (as here bow the knee) <hi>in thy Name; when I pray I will pray in thy Name, and confesse to the glory of God:</hi> which Christ challengeth to himself, in the Prophet <hi>Isaiah:</hi> and at conclusion, <hi>The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</hi> And in the Epistle to the <hi>Colossions, For, it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; and having made Peace by the blood of his cross, by him, to reconcile All things unto Himself, by Him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be things in Earth, or things in Heaven:</hi> Which to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> is, <hi>according to the good pleasure of his will, which he had purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather All into One, in Christ;</hi> All things in Heaven or Earth, even in him.</p>
            <p>And to the <hi>Thessalonians, Now God Himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way to you, and the Lord make you to increase and abound in Love to One another, and to all men, even as we to you: that he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness, before God.</hi> And again, <hi>That the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in Him: according to the Grace of our God, and the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> And again, <hi>Now our Lord Iesus Christ himself, and God even our Father, which hath loved us,</hi> (for the Father is Love) <hi>and hath given us everlasting consolation, and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work. And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and patience of Christ. Now we command you bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother walking disorderly, yet count him not an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but admonish him as a brother. Now the God of Peace him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, give you Peace, alwayes, by all means. The Lord be with you All. The salutation of Paul, with mine own hand, which is the token in every Epistle, so I write, The Grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</hi> And it may also be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51941:31"/>
observed, that what we read, <hi>be with you,</hi> might be read, <hi>is with you;</hi> and so it is not onely a prayer, but a promise, and assurance that the grace of Christ is with All, calling on Christ, and so believing on him: <hi>for how can they call on him, on whom they believe not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Timothy, This is a faithful saying, and worthy of All Acce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now unto the King Immortal, Eternal, Invisible, the onely wise God,</hi> (which <hi>Jude</hi> also calleth <hi>Our Saviour,</hi> speaking in the language of this very Text:) <hi>be honour and glory, for ever and ever, Amen.</hi> Which he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns on this Great Cause, <hi>I obtained Mercy, that in me first Iesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a patern to them,</hi> (even to all them) <hi>that should hereafter believe on him to Eternal life.</hi> So that Christ did not mainly mind <hi>Paul,</hi> in shewing him that patience and kindnesse; but did it to Him, that he might be a patern unto others, even unto all others that should ever after believe, even to all Eternity. And to the same <hi>Timothy</hi> he writeth, <hi>Flee also fleshly lusts, but follow Righteousness, Faith, Charity, Peace, with them that call on the Lord, out of a pure heart.</hi> And concludes, <hi>the Lord Iesus Christ be with thy spirit, Grace be with you. Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great businesse of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Epistle, is to presse for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and so he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ; to him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.</hi> Which also runs very much through the whole Epistle.</p>
            <p>The Revelation of Jesus Christ (wch God gave to him to shew to his servants) is ful of prayers, &amp; praises, &amp; blessings, of, and from, and to, the same Jesus. Who so plainly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himself <hi>the first and the last, which is and was, and is to come; the great Iehovah; Lord God Almighty,</hi> leads us plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the paralel places, in the Prophet <hi>Isaiah;</hi> where he saith the same of himself, adding also that <hi>there is no other God,</hi> or indeed no other True Being besides himself, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting himself in several species, or Idea's. For <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> was not the first that taught there was but One, which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51941:32"/>
yet was All.) And yet again, in the same chapter of that Prophet, he saith, <hi>Lo here I am, and His spirit hath sent me; even the Lord God and His Spirit: though I am God, and there is none besides me;</hi> or none else but I and in me; and One with me as the Root, and every Branch is One with the Vine. And in the same Prophet, <hi>It is this One True God, the First and the last,</hi> and so All True Being (which yet is sent by God, and anointed by his Spirit, and so the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, or-Jesus Christ;) <hi>which plainly sweareth by Himself,</hi> and therefore hath no greater) <hi>that every knee shall bow,</hi> or pray, <hi>to Him, and every tongue shall confess to Him:</hi> which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle citeth in that noted place of praying in the Name of Jesus; and confessing to the glory of God, even the Father also. And may we add? or may we not add, what Christ of himself said? <hi>If God be glorified in Him, or in Them, will not God also glorifie Him, or Them, with Himself;</hi> Yea, he will shortly do it; nay, he hath already done it, before any other can glorifie Him: for who can give him first; or lend to him that it may be paid again.</p>
            <p>To this also we might refer those passages of holding fast his Name, and not denying his Name, and confessing his Name; as he will also confesse their names, before his Father and the holy Angels, both in the Gospels and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation: and the call and Counsel of Christ (as also the Fathers Drawing) being that we come to Christ, and learn of Him, and buy of Him, and open to Him, that is still knocking to come in, (till his locks be wet with dew, and his spirit be not onely abused, but dispised and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) argue much our speaking, praying to him (as well as hearing him) who indeed is the end of the Fathers Teachings and Drawings; so that he that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh &amp; wil come to Jesus Christ, and converseth with him, as a man with his friend, whom he most loveth, and honoureth also.</p>
            <p>And the Angels of Heaven (for they are all bid to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him, as we read in the Psalmes and Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews)</hi> with the four Watches or Watchers, and the four and twenty Elders (of which again when we shew all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures borrowed from the twelve hours of darknesse, or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51941:32"/>
the twelve sons of <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and the twelve sons of Light, or of <hi>Israel)</hi> they all fall down and Worship, Praying, and singing Praises to the Lamb also, (even as cloathed with flesh:) as well as to him that sat on the Throne: which yet was Christ also (as is clear from many passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) but Christ in more Majesty, and Glory of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then onely as a Lamb slain: For it was the Lamb ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and set down in Glory, even in his Fathers Throne;</p>
            <p>As of old, the 24. courses of Priests, and of <hi>Levites,</hi> and of Porters, or Watchers, or Singers, and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, so ordered by <hi>David,</hi> (who was also the 24th. from <hi>Noah,</hi> as the number of his Name in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and the 14th. from <hi>Abraham,</hi> as also his Name, when written without a <hi>jod,</hi> as frequently it is; and signifieth love, and a Fathers Brother, or a very neer kindsman:) so in the Revelation those 24. Elders did fall down, in Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Lamb, (even to the Lamb that was slain, &amp; they had Harps its said; and golden Vials full of Odours, which are the praiers of Saints.</p>
            <p>Which may intimate, that as our great High Priest, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Houshold in Heaven and Earth; The great Angel of the Covenant, offers up his own Incence with the Prayers of all Saints to his Father: So these Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors also to the Lamb, even the Elders of Churches; offer up their Churches, yea and other Saints Prayers, to the Lamb. For, the whole Bride and the Spirit acting the Bride also, do not onely converse with Christ as her Husband, but Worship him also, as Her Lord (as <hi>Sarah</hi> called <hi>Abraham)</hi> and she is so commanded in the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> both to Kisse him and to Worship him; And she so practiseth in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> and the Revelation also: crying to the last, come, even come, and so come: <hi>Even come Lord Iesus, come quickly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may also be easie to shew very many, if not most or all, of the Prayers and praises in the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed to Christ: and many commands and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to call upon him there also.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As, He arken unto my cry, my King and my God, for unto</hi>

               <hi>Thee will I Pray: my voice shall thou hear in the morning, O Lord in the morning, will I direct my prayers to Thee, and will look up.</hi> And again, <hi>they that know Thy Name will trust in Thee, for Thou Lord hast not forsaken them that seek Thee.</hi> And again, <hi>Lord thou hast heard the desire of the humble; Thou wilt prepare their heart, and thou wilt cause their ear to hear.</hi> And again, <hi>Blessed be my Rock; and blessed be the God of my Rock; and my Saviour, clense me from my secret sins, and keep me that presumptuous sins prevail not over me, and let the words of my Mouth, and the Meditations of my Heart, be acceptable in Thy sight, O Lord my Rock, and my Redeemer.</hi> And again, <hi>Thy Throne O God is for ever and ever, and ride on prosperously, because of Truth and Meeknesse of Righteousnesse.</hi> And to the Spouse of Christ, <hi>He is thy Lord, Worship thou him.</hi> And again, <hi>Be still and know that I am God: Clap hands all People, sing unto God with Triumph, He shall speak the people under us; He shall chuse our Inheritance for us, even the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of</hi> Jacob <hi>whom he loved (and his blessing prevailed over all the blessings of his Ancestors.)</hi> And again, <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Saints together, and I will speak (and then declares the forme of the great Judgement both to the good and evil:)</hi> And concludes, <hi>call upon me in the day of thy trouble I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorifie me</hi> (plainly spoken by Christ, and repeated by the Psalmist afterwards; Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>In the day of my trouble I will call upon Thee, for Thou wilt answer me:</hi> And in an other Psalm, <hi>Thou calledst in trouble, and I did deliver thee; and answered thee in the secret place of Thunder.) And what time I am afraid I will trust in Thee.</hi> And again, <hi>Trust in him at all times ye People, and power out your Souls before him.</hi> And again, <hi>Praise waiteth in silence for thee; And to thee shall the Vow be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come. Iniquity prevaileth over me, but thou hast made Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our transgressions: O our Jesus: or our Salvation. The hope of the ends of the Earth, and them that are a far off in the Seas.</hi> And again, <hi>my lips shall ever praise Thee, and and in thy Name will I lift up my hands when I pray.</hi> And again, <hi>Thou hast ascended up on High, Thou hast led Captivity Captive: Thou hast received gifts for men, even for the Reb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:51941:33"/>
               <hi>also, that God may dwell among them.</hi> And thy God hath commanded thy strength. Strengthen, O God, that thou hast wrought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, <hi>In the day of my trouble I will call upon Thee, for Thou wilt answer me: and Thou Lord art good and ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and plenteous in Mercy to all that call upon Thee.</hi> Or, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans, Lord of All, and Rich unto all that call upon him:</hi> plainly spoken of Christ. As that also, of the Lord speaking unto my Lord, <hi>Sit at my right hand,</hi> &amp;c. And then the Psalmist speaketh to him, the Lord at Thy hand, shall smite through Thy enemies; and Thy people shall be a willing people in the day of thy power; and the Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a Priest for ever: cited so remarkably in the New Testament, by the Apostles, and by Christ also, asking the Jews, who it was there, or how, <hi>David</hi> called him Lord.</p>
            <p>And the 102. Psalm (being entituled a prayer of one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, when his soul is overwhelmed in him, and poureth out his sighing before the Lord,) is plainly spoken to Christ: as we see, by divers verses cited in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as spoken to Him, and proving Him to be the Son of God: and so are many other, like passages cited in the New Testament, and applyed to Christ. As also the context will shew; speaking somewhat that belongeth properly to Christ, and not to God, but as he is in Christ, and the Humane Nature: and so he hath eyes, ears, heart and hands, and passions also, and affections; which are else improperly given to God, or supposed to be in him: and so, he descends to earth, &amp; ascends on high, Returning also to judge the World. Which is oft spoken by <hi>David</hi> to Him he calleth Lord and King, and Judge of All. <hi>But the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> judgement to the Son;</hi> and authority also to execute judgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is the son of man. And often doth the Psalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist speak to a Lord, or King, or Judge, (as <hi>Job</hi> also, saying I will make supplication to my Judge; and my Redeemer liveth: a phrase also frequently used by the Psalmist) and his Rock; which yet had a God, had a Lord, or a Father; which is a plain character of Christ. As very many others
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51941:34"/>
which an attentive Reader will easily observe, through the whole book of Psalmes: yea, the Prophets also, in very many places.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> do not onely bid us lift up our voyce to Wisdom, and cry aloud to Understanding, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us also to call her our Sister, and our near kinswo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: which is a plain character he means That Wisdom which was hid in Christ (in whom are hid All Treasures of wisdom; For He is the Power and Wisdom of God, who hath made him also Wisdom for us, and unto us) Being our Brother, who of old dwelt with Prudence, and was brought up with him; But His delight was with the Sons of men: whom he is not ashamed to call His Brethren. Nay, he commandeth us to call him Brother, (saying also, that a Brother is Born for a Day of Trouble:) and to call His Wisdom our Sister, and His Understanding our near Kinswoman: which is a Comment on that of the Psalmes, He is Thy Lord, and therefore Worship him; But He is also Thy Brother, and therefore Kisse him also, least thou displease and grieve him: which we see all along through the <hi>Canticles</hi> also.</p>
            <p>Shall I add yet more to perswade, or encourage you in praying to Christ? Or why rather to Christ, then to God otherwise? Though we may speak to the Father also, and with great comfort and boldnesse. If at least I can, and dare say, My Father forgive me, as I forgive others: which yet I desire to do, and in some measure do: but oft found it so hard, to make it the measure of Gods forgiving me; that it made me oft turn to Christ, and say, Lord teach me to pray this Prayer, as <hi>John</hi> taught his Disciples. And at length I hope he taught me: and to speak and pray to Him also, as He to His Father; For, he is not onely my Lord, but my Father also; and the Father of Eternity; or (as some read it) of the World to come: Yea, and my Father in Heaven, where he then also said he was: Nay, the Son of man which is in Heaven, and your Father which is out of Heaven; or came out of Heaven; in that remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able passage of our Saviour added by St. <hi>Luke</hi> to the Lords
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51941:34"/>
Prayer, taught his Disciples in a secret place, as they found him praying, and said, Lord teach us, as <hi>John</hi> taught his Disciples: and he taught them with some difference from what he said before all the People (in his Sermon on the Mount) whom yet he bid say, <hi>Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> But in <hi>Luke</hi> he addeth, If you that be evil, can give good gifts to them that ask you, How much more your Father, who is, or who came, Out of Heaven: For so it is in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and by that character he may perhaps hint, That very prayer may be spoken to him. For, He that seeth Him, seeth the Father also, and He that worships him, worships the Father also; and Him that serveth Him, the Father will love and honour. He that speaketh to him, speaketh to the ear and Heart of God. For the whole fulnesse of the Godhead is in Him; and that I may not separate the Persons, or have wrong conceits of God, (as I am apt enough to; and so it may be, worship Idols of my own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, in my own brain; which may be easier, and so more dangerous, then Idols made by my own hands:) I chuse much to speak to Christ: and to God onely as in Him.</p>
            <p>As of old, They were to pray to the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that spake to <hi>Moses,</hi> and dwelt in the Tabernacle, between the cherubims of glory, shadowing the Mercy Seat, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Arck; so I speak to God onely as He is in Christ, where he dwelleth for ever.</p>
            <p>And though, it may be very lawful to pray to God through Christ and for Christ; Yet (not to speak of out aptnesse to look on God as wholly wrath in Himself, when he is Love; even the Father is Love; and so loved the world also, that he sent his onely begotten Son, to save the world and not to destroy it:) If one should run me in, to the heart, and I should cry to God the Father, to cure me for Christs sake; would he not answer, (and all wise men,) Go also to the Physitian, or to the Chyrurgion, who is to work out thy cure under God, and is so appointed by God.</p>
            <p>So, when sinne or Satan Tempts or wounds me to the heart, if I cry only to God, to heal or help me, for Christs sake; will he not say, <hi>Go to Ioseph, I have trusted him with all things:</hi> go to the proper Physitian or Surgion for the

heart, Jesus Christ, whom I sent &amp; sanctified for that end to heal your soul and body both. And He that heareth and learneth of the Father, will go to him, who indeed is the End of the Fathers Teachings and Drawings, as he is the End of all the Law: And Himself also crieth, <hi>Come unto me, and learn of me; and buy of me; and I will give you drink, and Ease and Rest, and Ey-salve thst you may see.</hi> And though none come to him, but whom the Father drew; yet himself also promised, that lifted up, he would draws All men: even All men unto himself. And out of his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall flow Rivers of Living Waters. And to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria</hi> he said, <hi>If thou knewest the Gift of God, and who it is that speaketh to thee, Thou wouldst Ask</hi> (and ask of Him surely) <hi>and He would give thee Living Water, which should be a Fountain, still flowing up to Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they did pray to Him, here on Earth: and sure we might do so again, if we should meet him here, or could see him with our bodily eyes; or could lay hold of him with our hands, and wash his feet with our Tears, and wipe them with the hairs of our heads. If I should meet him as I walked, why might I not speak to him, as <hi>Paul</hi> did when he saw him in the way, or afterwards in the Temple, as he was praying? Or as <hi>Stephen</hi> did, when he died? And is he not as neer us, and as ready to hear, and help and save us Now: though we see him not with our bodily eyes, as he was then? And yet sure if we could but learn to speak and do all we do, in the Name of Jesus Christ, as we are bid, we should even see and feel and taste Christ in our selves, and in one another. When it shall please God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal, Christ in us, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> intimating that he may be in us, when we do not see him, or believe him so; for God onely can manifest himself and him to us: and how, or why doth he manifest himself to us, and not unto the world? But he hath promised to be among and in us, and manifest himself, and his Fathers Name, that the love wherewith he loved him, might be in us, and he in us also: which is the great thing he promised and prayed for; that All that did and shall believe in him through all ages, might be One with Him (He that is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51941:35"/>
to the Lord is One spirit with him: and know you not that Christ is in you, and the hope of glory in you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, except you be Reprobates?) and that they might be made perfect in One: They in Him, and He in them.</p>
            <p>For if they be In him onely, they may bear little fruit, except he also be In them, as the sap of the Root is in the Branch; or the spirit of the Head, is in every member of the body, knit together by bands or nerves; receiving nourishment from the Head; yet so also, that every joynt supplies to one another: so blessed a thing it is, to be in union with Christ Jesus our Head, and in communion of Saints, and fellowship with them as his Members, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Members to each other. So that, as the eye may not say to the hand, I have no need of thee, so neither may the Head say (a very sweet scripture) to the foot, or least toe of the foot, I have no need of you. For, he doth not onely take care of the least pin of the Tabernacle, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is made up of a multitude of differing Members (for; if they did not differ, they were All One, and the whole Body were but One Member:) and as in all our bodies, one part is Hot, another cold; One Hard, another soft; one puls up, another down; and so it must be; and yet most accurate Harmony in All parts, and in the whole:</p>
            <p>So is it, and so must it be, with the Body of Christ, the fulnesse of Him (a most remarkable expression) that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth All in All: and yet they are All in Him, and His Body; and have all His Mind and spirit flowing, acting and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in them; even the same spirit which is in the Head; but in several and differing measures, and proportions, &amp; to several ends and uses; as in all the differing Organs and Members of our Bodies: For All are not eyes, or ears, or hands, or feet; and yet All are Members.</p>
            <p>And as it is natural to the spirit; that is now in any of our members, on the least touch of fear, or other passion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to run to the Head, or Heart, as its fountain; and thence soon to bring out new supply of more spirits, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion is: (whence we first look pale in our passions, and then quickly redder then before:) so, in the Body of Christ any little Touch upon any of his members, makes the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51941:36"/>
of that Member presently run to the Head, which is chief; or to the very heart of God (the Root of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in him also) and soon returns with a Legion of Angels, as a stock of new spirits; or it may be, with Christ himself calling, as to <hi>Saul</hi> (when he pinched some of his little fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and toes, or other parts of his body,) <hi>Saul, Saul,</hi> why dost thou pinch or persecute me? Even me, the Head or Heart of all these Members, and the whole Body? for if any one member be pressed or hurt, the Head and all the Body is grieved or pressed also. And why do you press me, saith Christ? for in all their affliction, he is afflicted.</p>
            <p>And certainly it is not more Natural, for the Spirit of the Body, or any one Member of it, to run up to the Brain or Head, then it is for the Spirit of Christ, and those that have received it, upon all occasions, yea alwayes to be breathing to God in Christ; Yea, to Jesus Christ himself, the head of the Body: And through him onely to God the Father, (that is the whole Deity) who is the head of Christ also; As Christ is the Head of his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: Yea, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, the Head of every man. and the Church is his Glory also, as his Fulness, even as the Woman is the glory of the man: and man is the Image and glory of God. So is the Church (and special Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or Messengers of it, as <hi>Titus</hi> was) the Glory of Christ. So also, Christ speaketh in the Prophets, I will place Salvation in <hi>Zion,</hi> for <hi>Israel</hi> my glory. And again, Thou shalt also be a Krown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and as a Royal Diadem in the hand of thy God. Thou shalt be no more termed forsaken, but <hi>Hephzibah;</hi> Which also was the very Name of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Queen, living about that time. And again, that they might be unto me as a People and a Name, and a Praise, and a Glory. And although they then rejected that great hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our offered them, yet it must be, and shall be; For God hath said it and ordained it. <hi>The skies shall power down Righteousnesse, and the Earth shall open, and they shall bring forth Salvation.</hi> And again, I will build them as at first, and I will cleanse them from all Iniquity, and I will pardon all their Transgressions: And it shall be to me (not onely) a name of Joy; But a Praise, and Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51941:36"/>
(or Glory,) before all the Nations of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Should not a Spouse converse with her Husband? Or should she be runing to his Father rather, or Himself, in all her wants or desires? And yet his Father also will hear and Answer. For, he that speaks to the Son, speaketh to the Father also: And the Son speaketh nothing of Himself, but as the Father speaketh.</p>
            <p>And That surely, is one great Reason why we should speak to Christ; Immediately to Christ: and to God onely, through Him. As of old they might not offer up their own sacrifice, but by the hand of the Priest: So now he is our Priest &amp; our High Priest also, to receive all the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of Insence, even from the Elders who are Priests also; but the High Priest as the great Angel of the Covenant, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers up the Prayers of All Saints: And we should bring them all to him; and desire him to present them, with all our wants, and all our returns also, of praise and service unto him. And this seemeth clearly the sence of those Scriptures that bid us offer all, we offer unto God, not only in his Name, but also, Through Him; presenting them to Him, that he may present them to the Father. And our Immediate coming to the Father (while we say 'tis, through Christ) though it may be lawful also in its sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, if rightly understood; Yet surely, may be fitter for that time when the Son also shall give up the Kingdom to his Father; that God may be All in All. Though it may be, Then, our Prayers shall cease; Or be turned to Praises or Embracings: as also with the Spouse, when she is not onely betrothed, as now, but maried also to Christ, as she shall be. As the Revelation also represents her: when the New <hi>Ierusalem</hi> comes down from Heaven, as a Bride decked for her Husband. And yet, Then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so (which I have a little wondered at) She seems to be solitary a while; as if she had left her Husband, and her heart also behind her, when she came down from Heaven; and her cry all along, even to the very end of all the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is, <hi>Come Lord Iesus, Come quickly. As if Christ were not with her, on earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the greatest stresse of the Argument, may seem
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51941:37"/>
to be in this, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> God speaks nothing to us now, but in, and through his Son. Our Prayers, Praises, sighs and groans, if right, are but reflections back of somewhat spoken to us, spoken in us. Which must therefore be through Christ and to Christ Immediately, by His Spirit in us. Which or who, (for that is the Scripture Language) as he knows the mind of Christ, and so of God in him, and brings it into us; So he toucheth our heart, and makes it warble, as the Heart of Christ did, when God spake to Him, and in Him, to us. And he whose Spirit it is (that helps us by sighs and groans unutterable) knows the meaning of his own Spirit. For, it is he, that maketh intercession for us.</p>
            <p>Yea and in us also: so that all our breathings out to God, are but his breathings, by his Spirit in us. And in this sence we may and do pray to the Father; as <hi>Christ in us the hope of Glory</hi> prayeth to the <hi>Father of Glory</hi> (so he is called) and the Father of mercies; as he is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Christ, who therefore is both Grace and Glory, as the Psalmist expresseth him, and yet still the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Father.</p>
            <p>Let me add also, that the Spirit in us crying Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the Spirit of God made Flesh, or in actual Union with Humanity: For else it calls not God its Father, and in us it speaks its own Natural Language, for it speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in us, Praying, Crying, Abba Father;</p>
            <p>Our Father, (For Christs Spirit speaketh, boweth, prayeth in us:) <hi>Hollowed be Thy Name: let Thy Kingdom come,</hi> for it is ours also; And if God be glorified in us, He will also glorifie Us with himself. Yea, he will straight way gloryfie us. <hi>Let thy will be done in our Earth, as in thy Heaven;</hi> Even in thy Highest Heaven (For in this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition it is in The Heaven, but in the preface it is, in the Heavens, even all the Heavens:) For, <hi>Thy will is ours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,</hi> and not only wiser, but better for us also, then our own will is, till fully moulded into thy Will.</p>
            <p>And then a poor Soul dare say, <hi>forgive us, even as we forgive.</hi> We, and not I, but we, as all the members toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; with the Spirit of the Head also; and in his Person too: which hath often made me hope, he meant and had
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51941:37"/>
promised also, (for our Prayers, or His in us, are good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises also) to forgive more of his Enemies, then it may be, I ever thought or believed. Which I cannot much wonder at, when All his enemies must come to be at peace with him, as his wayes please the Lord. And when the spirit also shall come to Act His Kingdom (which it shall do in the Heart of His Spouse; for the spirit &amp; the Bride shal abide and Act, and shal stil Live together, as they cryed together here:) I hope it will also forgive more, then it may be, all men now believe or hope.</p>
            <p>Yet as the Soul should generally say, and pray to Christ, as the Apostles did, <hi>Lord shew us the Father</hi> (which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so his great promise to us, and his Father also, in his solemn prayer, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>I have declared Thy Name, and I will declare it; that the Love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I in them:)</hi> Yet there may be some seasons also, in which a poor soul may think it self so great a stranger unto Christ, or at such a distance from him, that it may, and doth cry to the Father, <hi>Draw me to the Son;</hi> shew me thy Son; and acquaint me with thy Son: for I am a stranger to him, or at a losse in seeking Him.</p>
            <p>And yet sure, this is not very usual in a Woman; or it may be, handsom, or civil for her, to come to a strange man, and say, Pray Sir, acquaint me with your Son, that I may woe him. But when the Good man hath first bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the matter, in discourse to the Virgin soul, and hath Invited and woed for the Son; Then doth the Son come (and is sent of the Father) and woes the soul for himself: and yet perhaps till the marriage be, or at least the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract or betrothing, It may sometimes not onely be fit, but requisit, to Treat with the Father also, for settlement of state or other things.</p>
            <p>But Then she goes and speaks and converseth with the Son, when she is Married, or at least betrothed: which indeed is Most, if not All, that is yet done, between Christ and our souls; it may be, the whole Church yet, is no more but betrothed onely till the New <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Which yet in some measure doth come down and appear unto, and in, every poor soul, betrothed unto Christ. <hi>For Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:51941:38"/>
               <hi>which is above, is Mother to us all</hi> The good <hi>Sarah,</hi> spouse to <hi>Abram, The High Father</hi> (as the name signifies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was <hi>Abraham,</hi> a Father of many) rather then to <hi>Isack,</hi> the Son, who was not married, till his Mother <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> was dead. Though perhaps, That was onely to the <hi>Gentile</hi> Church, brought out of <hi>Syria</hi> (a <hi>Gentile</hi> Land) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Sara,</hi> the Jewish Church was dead, or gone. But she must appear again, and that out of Heaven also: where the Woman first appeared as a great wonder, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Wife of <hi>Jaacob,</hi> as some think, or Mother to the twelve Patriarchs; presented there (as in <hi>Josephs</hi> Dream also) by twelve stars, round about her. But there is more in it, seeing she was also in the Sun, or clothed with His Light and Glory, Having also the Moon at her Feet; and a crown of twelve stars about her head, of which we may speak more hereafter.</p>
            <p>And when the Virgin is espoused, then she begins to speak freely to Her spouse. And I know not any more sure character, of being so betrothed unto Christ, then such a free converse with him, as our friend, our Brother, Yea, our neerer Relation. And yet truly, we do not: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive His spirit, (but some glances onely, through his eyes or mouth, at a distance, if we may so expresse it,) till we be actually married; which is scarcely consummate in this Life: though it may be also, at the coming of the new <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that all we speak or do, of Praying, or such manner of converse, as is yet usual with Christ, is in our way only, Yet as betroathed; rather than in our end, or spiritual enjoyments of him in the marriage bed: where only we shall fully receive his Spirit. And those whom he sent as his Father sent him, received it, but as in his breath; for he breathed on them, saying, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost.</hi> And afterwards also they received but the first fruits of the Spirit; as themselves expressed it: saying also it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed unto all the Lord should call. For it was then but the Feast of Pentecost, or fiftieth Day of first Fruits, and that but of Barley. O but now we wait, and hope, and expect the Feast of Tabernacles also (and the latter
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51941:38"/>
Rain, as the former little drops) even the greatest Feast of Tabernacles; which all Nations also must keep with Israel; when they shall joy as at Harvest; even at the end of full Harvest, when all the fruits of the Earth shall be gathered in: and all Nations also shall come flowing in; as the fruits of all the Earth, in that solemn Feast. Which was acted also in a Type, as we may say, of som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to come; when, in the last and great day (of the many Feasts, of that great Feast of all, the Feast of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles) Christ stood out, and cryed, as the Gospel saith, <hi>O every one that thirsteth, come unto the Waters, and he that believeth on me,</hi> as the Scripture saith, <hi>out of his belly shall flow Rivers of Living Water;</hi> as alluding both to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of drawing and powring out Waters from <hi>Siloam</hi> (with joy from the wells of Salvation;) and also to the most remarkable place in <hi>Zech:</hi> where all Nations are invited to that Feast; that they might have Water, and the Rain of Heaven.</p>
            <p>And it may be, he that can rightly count the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Feast of Pentecost and Tabernacles, may guess also when that latter Rain, or fuller powring out of the Spirit shall be. Which in general, was in the seventh Month; yet by another reckoning, at the end of the yeer: as the seventh Day was the end of the week. Even as Gods appearings and Angels also were generally towards the end of the day, or about the evening Sacrifice: which is one of many Reasons why I think the Lords Supper was and now should also be, at Supper, or at Evening, rather then Morning.</p>
            <p>And to all yet said, to perswade us in our prayers, to direct our hearts, and words to Christ; and to God, only as he is in Christ (as of old in the Tabernacle between the Cherubims of Glory over-shadowing the Mercy Seat, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Ark) I may add, That Prayer is a Dialogue between our Soul and God, indited by the Spirit of Christ: which differeth from the Spirit of God; as being That cloathed with flesh, and actually united to a Humane Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; which the Spirit of God, as God, or of the Father,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51941:39"/>
as such, is not. Which distinction it may be St. <hi>John</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth, by the Holy Ghost in Heaven; One with the Word and Father: and by the Spirit on Earth, or in the fleshly Members of Christ. Now as Christ in the daies of his flesh, did offer up strong sighs, and groans, and tears, and prayers; yea, and himself also; by his eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; unto him that was able to save him; and was heard in all he feared or prayed: So doth he now, by the same Spirit, in the hearts, or flesh of his Members, which are here on Earth. Yet so, as all those Members give up their Spirit to their Head; (As the Elders also in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> present their Vials full of Prayers of Saints to the Lamb:) and he, as the great Angel of the Covenant, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles them with his dayly Incense, in his Temple, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents them all, even all the Prayers of all Saints, to his God and his Father, and their Father, in and through him. They all being indeed but his own sighs and groans, or motions of his own Spirit, in his Members.</p>
            <p>That we may yet more cleerly understand this, let us first consider how Christ prayed to his Father; and then, how the Christian prayeth unto Christ, or to his Father, through Christ.</p>
            <p>As the Apostle saith, <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself;</hi> so, in a right sence I may say, God was in Christ, Praying or speaking to himself; even as our Soul communes with it self; or as a man communes with his own Heart: a Phrase we find in the <hi>Psalms</hi> or other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, and we may use it to illustrate This.</p>
            <p>For which also, I may cite that notable passage of our Saviour, (which I somtime look upon, as one of the Keys, to open and discover the rich, but hidden, Cabinet, of the Mysterious Scripture) where he doth so plainly tell us, that he never said one word of himself; and yet he said all that was ever said by God; for he is the only Word and Mouth of God: and in the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> he tells us plainly, that he said all that was ever spoken; and yet, now he tells us that he never spake one word of, that is, From Himself: or of his own: but of and from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and what He said: yea and As, He spake it, unto
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51941:39"/>
Him; so he repeated it. Being (as it seems) but Gods Holy Echo, to repeat those Words, and only Those, his Father speaketh of himself, and in himself, and to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>As if Christ also, compared with God, were such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, that he could not speak one sentence, word, sillable, or letter, but as God sounded it before him, and In him, and To him: and so He, only Ecchoed back some little part, it may be, as the latter end, or loudest part of that Infinite Discourse, the Father had, and hath to Him, from all Eternity to al Eternity.</p>
            <p>Thus when God saith, in and to Christ, <hi>My Son, Give me thy Heart:</hi> Christ then as it were ruminating or repeating in himself, what the Father saith, He Ecchoes back, <hi>Give me Thy Heart:</hi> And so it sounds as a Prayer. To <hi>Bow down;</hi> He cries <hi>Bow down.</hi> To <hi>Seek my Face; Seek my Face.</hi> And at length his Spirit cries (in his Members al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so) <hi>Thy Face I will seek; Lord Hide not thy Face from me.</hi> So that the Head only properly speaketh in Prayer; but His Members draw, also, by the spirit of the Head, resting and sighing, In Them.</p>
            <p>Thus, we have seen a tender Mother or a Father, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their children to speak, and do, and go, by spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king To them, in them, as it were; and going, bowing; kissing their hand; and Doing All before them, and as much as they can, in them, That they would have them to Do and say. Bow down, They say, and kiss your Hand, and say, I am your servant; or the like; by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by saying, what they mean, their child should do or say. And then, he stammers after them; and after many Essaies, comes at length to stumble on that gesture, posture, carriage, word or work, the Parents have been often Teaching Him, or speaking In him. For, one may speak his heart out, to a child, or other person, who will never learn and Do, till he have the Fathers, or the Teachers spirit, or his meaning, and his Meen, by accent, gesture, or some other way, rather than by word only, impressed on him. So, that we see our children, and such as are acquainted with our spirit can discern and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51941:40"/>
understand our minde, by becks, or nods, or looks, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, somtimes without words; and somtimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against our words, and quite and clean contrary to our words. As, when we say, O well done; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they know we mean Ill done; and when we say now fall, or go do, so or so; they understand we mean they should not fall, or do so: and many other things we speak by way of tempting, or of Irony, or otherwise, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to our words.</p>
            <p>It being Thus also in the Scriptures: where oft times the sence might be gathered by accents, stops or pauses, with the signs of questions, parenthesis, and Ironies, with many other things, which are now very hard to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, especially in the old Testament: This is one of the many reasons, why we cannot pretend to the full or True sence and meaning of the Scriptures, without That Spirit which did make them, and interpret them, as Christ pleased to give out through all the several Ages of his Church. Which yet possibly might differ as the sence and understanding of an Infant or Minor, differs much from That of a Man, a Wise Man: who now sees another sence and meaning of his Fathers words spoken or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten long since, than he once did or could do, by many readings. And this differing sence and understanding, even in Principles, may somtimes occasion or cause diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Practice also among good men, and children of the same Father; in the same or several Ages. Which we might observe from the difference of Judgment and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, that I say not Affection, found among the Apostles themselves, and the most primitive Christians, about the good Will of God to the Gentiles, and about the Law, and Circumcision; that I say nothing of the Nature and Office of the Holy Ghost, or of Christ himself, in Person, Natures, Offices; the manner and the Vertue of his Death and Resurrection; with the Form of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Kingdom; with his Coming again, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which are so cleerly written in the old Testament, and yet so little understood by Them, or Us either; even to This day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:51941:40"/>
And as the Spirit of God in Christ, doth say and do, all that Christ saieth, prayeth, worketh; so also, doth the Spirit of Christ, in his Members: so that every one of them may truly say, I cannot speak, or pray, or do, any one thing, pleasing to God or my self (if I know my self) but what the Spirit of Christ, my Head and Father also, as my Spouse, saieth, prayeth, doeth in me. I do nothing of my self, and I say nothing of my self; but what my Fathers Spirit worketh, speaketh in me. What and How he saith in me, I say; and what he doth, I do: My Father worketh hitherto, and I work: but my Father worketh what I work. And This takes me off, from solicitous Care what to say, or do (as well as what to eat and drink) because it is given, in that hour, by our Fathers Spirit. For, <hi>Without me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>you can do nothing;</hi> and by Him, we may both do, and bear, and suffer, All things. All our Fruit is found in Him: whose Dew, is as the dew of Herbs. As the Dew of the morning, from the Womb of Eternity.</p>
            <p>Now as the spirit of God never comes on us, or speaks in us, or to us, Immediately, (as from the Father, to his Onely begotten Son) but only mediately, through Christ; who is the Mouth and Word of God: (which may be one character to try the spirit in some, these dayes, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to immediate voices from the Father, concerning His Son Jesus; whereas God speaketh not to us, but through his son Jesus:)</p>
            <p>So when we speak to God, we do not, may not, yet speak to him Immediately: but through Christ, and to Christ; that He may speak it unto God his Father, Even as God speaks to Christ, and sent him a new Revelation, after his Ascension, that he might speak, and give it to his Members.</p>
            <p>As I cannot speak Immediately to the soul or spirit of a man (though he be with me) but through his ear or eye, or somewhat of his outward man or body. So I yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, may not speak to God, but through his outward man; if I may so speak of Jesus Christ: and yet I speak to a mans ear, or eye, or outer man, that it may reach also to his heart, and soul, or spirit, and may affect that also. And
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51941:41"/>
so I speak to Christ also, (as the Outward Man of God,) that yet it may affect his heart, the very heart of God his Father, who is in him. And I tell him, that I do no so worship him, or pray to him, or trust in him, as a Man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or mainly; for I am forbidden to put my trust in any man, or in the Son of Man himself, as Man onely; but as he hath God in him, and the Heart of God in his heart: Yea, is One with God his Father: and so One, that there is no other God besides him; as himself often speaketh in the Prophets: where he also calleth himself the first and the last, (as in the <hi>Revelation)</hi> and the onely True God; and so he is called the Onely Wise God our Saviour.</p>
            <p>He is so perfectly One with the Father, that when we see him, we see the Father also; and we pray to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when we pray to him: who is the everlasting Father, or the Father of Eternitie, or World to come, as some translate the Prophet <hi>Isay.</hi> So that we may say to him, <hi>Our Father, let Thy Name be glorified, and Thy Kingdom come,</hi> for it is the Fathers also. And it may be marked, that Our Saviour taught that Prayer Twice; first to the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, in his sermon on the Mount: and 'tis no little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for them All to see their leave or Right to cry <hi>Our heavenly Father.</hi> Afterwards alone, and praying, some or one of his Disciples came and said, <hi>Lord teach us to pray;</hi> (for Thou hast Told us a Prayer before, but now we pray thee <hi>Teach us to pray)</hi> even as <hi>John</hi> taught his Disciples.</p>
            <p>Then he said, <hi>When you pray, say Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. much as before; but then he said, <hi>After this manner therefore pray ye:</hi> and 'tis there, <hi>Forgive us, as we forgive our Debtors:</hi> but in <hi>Luke,</hi> to his Disciples in private, it is, <hi>Forgive us, for we also forgive all our Debtors.</hi> Which is better rendred so, then some that read it, <hi>Those that Trespasse against us.</hi> But it seems plainly to allude to that Law and custom of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting debts to all their Debtors, as the Law required, in the Jubile and other sabboth years: and so they might speak it more sensibly, then it may be we, or I now can; if we should render it, <hi>Forgive us as we forgive all that tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe against us.</hi> Yet I have sometimes thought that Christ even drives us to Himself, when we dare not speak those words to the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:51941:41"/>
Yet to speak freely, the spirit of Christ in a Christian, is or will be very free; and 'tis hardly at Any time, much lesse at All times, tied up to a form of words (or kept in rank and file, of any One mans Method:) but as God leads it. And our experience may shew us, that some times we think to speak to God, and we find our selves such strangers to him, or at such a distance, that we flie to Christ and cry, <hi>Lord shew us the Father,</hi> and <hi>Lord teach us to Pray,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> taught his Disciples; Yea and better too, as Thou art a better Teacher. At another time, it may be, we bow down and think to speak to Christ, and then perhaps, we find a damp upon our spirits, unto him, and some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strangement from him: so that we flie to the Father, and cry, <hi>Good Father, shew us Thy Son;</hi> Draw us to thy Son; yea draw us heartily, that so we may know him more, and better then ever: for, we are strangers to him. And I have known some, that usually began their prayers unto Christ; or at least bowed their spirits silently to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they spake to God; and desired Christ both to help them expresse their own wants, and then also present them to His Father; Praying in them, to His Father, while they bowed in his spirit, crying, as he bad his children say, <hi>Abba Father;</hi> for all persons, and for all things, they ought or might pray for (which perhaps are more then they are Tied to) and so usually they concluded with the plainest sence, rather than words of the Lords Prayer. Which also seemeth to have been a more ancient custom in the Church, than only of late; when some discoursed only, what they wanted, or would beg of God. Which yet I should not disallow, if done with such an Heart, and life, and Power, and Spirit, as it may, and yet I hope, it will be done, among the Churches of Christ.</p>
            <p>But I may sum up all in this, the good Father, by the Holy Ghost, (in his Ordinances,) first breaks the Match to the Virgin soul, and shews her great want of an helper, in her wretched and forlorn estate; He tells her also, he hath a Son, who will use her kindly and tenderly, if she will accept him. Then, he sends the Son, a woer; and till all
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51941:42"/>
be agreed, for portion and joynture, and other things, the, Treaty is much with the Father; who also giveth assurance of his hearty consent to the match, and to his making good all the Son shall promise: and indeed, is as it were, his Sons surety, to the poor soul. And when the Son is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, yea and contracted; he still useth his Fathers Name; and bids the spouse be confident of all his Father ever promised. And if there do arise any doubt or scruple in the matter, or manner of contract, dowrie, or the like; the soul hath not onely leave, but most great encouragement, to go and speak to the Father: as also to reconcile any difference, or strangenesse that at any time shall rise, or seem to be, between the parties. But when they be married or espoused, the Son useth her so sweetly and kindly, that she never hath occasion, much lesse cause to complain to the Father (which yet she might freely do upon any cause:) but she is so wholly taken up with the spouses affection, and most hearty love; that her main converse, and solace of her life, is with Him: Though she often ask her Father Blessing, and very often bow to him, with most child-like Reverence and dutiful Love, rather then fear; which if servile or slavish, is exceeding much displeasing unto God and Jesus Christ, and to the true ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of a Christian, established with a free, Noble, Royal spirit.</p>
            <p>Have we not a Type and Emblem of this, or somewhat more, in <hi>Caleb</hi> and his son, and daughter <hi>Achsa. Caleb</hi> As the Heart (it signifies) and may shadow out the Heart of God, whom he wholly followed, with an honest, plain, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, which in scripture Language, is a perfect heart. He saith, who ever conquers <hi>Kiriath Sepher</hi> (which may note the book of scripture, which was also called <hi>Dehir,</hi> that is the Oracle:) shall have my Daughter, and my blessing with her. <hi>Othniel</hi> conquers it (and afterwards is made a Judge, and saves his people from the cruel Tyrant:) and he getteth <hi>Calebs</hi> Daughter. Who first moveth her Husband to ask a field of her Father: and afterwards free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her self from her Asse, (or bestial nature) she boweth her self to her Father, and asks him in her own person;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51941:42"/>
saying, O my Father, <hi>Thou hast given me a piece of Earth, O but give me thy Blessing with it; and a spring of Water.</hi> So, he gave her, both the <hi>Upper and the Lower Springs.</hi> An Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, so repeated in the Bible, that I have often thought some great matter is in it.</p>
            <p>Besides, that it cleerly shews us the Heart of God; such an infinite Fountain, still flowing up, and flowing over; that he is so far from being drawn dry, by our sucking; or from being displeased, at our Asking, and Begging of him; that he expects rather that all we have received from him, even by his Sons Asking, should but encourage us yet, to ask more, and more still, as we receive more from him. And when he hath given us a Field, or a piece of Earth, He expects we should ask his Blessing, even the rather, and the Springs of Water. Even as our Father <hi>Abraham;</hi> when God came to him after his great deliverance from the four great Kings (which may be Types, as their names import, of the four great Monarchies; that should cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive his people, and the good men of the world also, till He should bring back their Captivity, and the Captivity of <hi>Sodom</hi> also (to be paralel'd with the 16. of <hi>Ezekiel;)</hi> just before the appearing of <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> resembling Christ in his second Coming; Pursuing them to <hi>Dan,</hi> even to the great Judgment, as the place imports. And when God might so justly expect that <hi>Abraham</hi> should have been bowing down in great Thankfulness for That deliverance; <hi>Abraham</hi> saies not a word of That, but is Begging a new boon; (O the mans confidence!) and cries, <hi>Lord God, what wilt thou give me?</hi> as if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived nothing yet, or at least very little, in comparison of That he knew the Infinite Heart of God still had, for him; and was straitned, till it was more drawn and suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And the Mothers Breast is somtimes so full, that she is glad of a strangers child to suck that which her own child cannot master.</p>
            <p>And when it might have been expected of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Zelophehad,</hi> that the modesty of their Sex, should have kept them silent; or the shame, or sorrow, which they should have born for their father, being cut off, in the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51941:43"/>
Wilderness, and dying in his sin; and they left Orphans and Virgins: Yet they sue for their Inheritance. And the Lord heard it, and it pleased him so, that upon this occasion he Enacted a new Law very beneficial to Women, who had therefore much cause to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and bless the memory of these Daughters. And God was so far, from upbraiding them, or their father; that he answers, <hi>They have well done,</hi> or well said, and rightly too, in what they say; (in that they do not judg themselves unworthy of eternal life; seeing it is the gift; &amp; the free gift of God.) For, the Fathers sin, may not forfeit the childrens Inheritance. Nor shall the child die, or lose his Inheritance, for the fathers sin. Which may not only be considered by those that so deeply stain the childrens blood, for the fathers sin (perhaps contrary to the Laws of God, and Practice of his People in several Ages, through the Scriptures:) But it may be also carried much further, (and Higher also perhaps; even to our first Father in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice) then I shall urge it now. But the very Orphans of <hi>Edom,</hi> even of hated cursed <hi>Fsay;</hi> are yet bid in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> to come to God and trust in him; who will preserve them alive, and be the God and Father also of the fatherless and widdows; even of those also that die in their sins, and are out off, for their Transgression, or Rebellion. Which is also but suitable to that good Law in <hi>Deut.</hi> (which I hope ere long we shall find and see, lying on Christ also, who was made under the Law, even the whole Law; and so under this Law also:) When thou goest to War with any people (How the excepted Cananites were also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to mercy, we may shew anon) <hi>Thou shalt offer peace; and if they Take it; Well: They all shall live. But if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, Thou mayest slay the men</hi> (and so 'tis said, they slew the Males of <hi>Edom,</hi> or <hi>Amalech,</hi> a branch of <hi>Esau;</hi> and the Jews add a story of <hi>Joabs</hi> wrath to his Master that should have taught him the difference between <hi>Zachar</hi> &amp; <hi>Zecher;</hi> Male and Memory:) But though the Men might be cut off; yet the Women and children might not; but even by that Law (and so Christ practised to <hi>Edoms</hi> Widdows and Orphans;) They must be kept alive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:51941:43"/>
Thus, ere I am aware, I am come to that great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for speaking and Praying to Christ; which I shall more fully insist upon; as the richest Pearl of all, I can yet produce for comforting afflicted minds and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>I speak, and Pray to Christ (and have great comfort in it, through his grace;) not only because he speaketh All that ever God speaketh unto me, (and so, sure, in all Christian civility, I should speak to him again:) But also, I may, and can, and dare, and should say, That, even ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, to Him, which I dare not, cannot, may not speak, to the <hi>Father,</hi> as <hi>Father:</hi> But that he see them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and Done, by his Son: whom I Therefore press upon. And it may be, These Things (which I so may speak to Christ only) are the best and sweetest, I can yet present to Him, or expect his Returns upon. Which also flesh and Blood, I hope, did not reveal to me; but my Heavenly Father, in his Drawing me to Jesus Christ; and Teaching me some little os That Truth, which is in Jesus; and some little of his Love which passeth All knowledg: which yet All Saints must come to Tast and see, that so they may be filled with All the Fulness of God. And He that hath heard and learned of the Father, will come unto Christ; and by Him to the Father.</p>
            <p>I may say to Christ, O Lord Thou art <hi>the feed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> promised to bruise, or <hi>break the Serpents Head:</hi> to loose his knots, <hi>dissolve his Works;</hi> yea, to <hi>destroy him who had the Power of death, which is the Devil.</hi> Or, as the <hi>Psalm</hi> expresseth it, <hi>He shall break in pieces the Oppressor.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> Thus, <hi>With his sore and Great, and strong Sword, he shall punish Leviathan,</hi> the piercing or the <hi>Crossing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; even Leviathan;</hi> (for he that made him, can cause his Sword to approach to him) <hi>That crooked Serpent</hi> (laughing at the shaking of our spears, and ratling of our Quivers;) <hi>and shall slay,</hi> quite slay, the <hi>Dragon,</hi> in the great Deep. To which the <hi>Revelation</hi> alludeth plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, both in the <hi>Serpent</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And, as he is the Womans Seed, so is he also, the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51941:44"/>
seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and That blessed Seed of Promise, in whom not only All Nations, but also All Families; and every Family of the Earth shall be blessed: as is express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promised, more then once. And <hi>St. Peter</hi> citing that Promise, concludeth thus, <hi>God hath sent him to Bless you, in Turning every one of you from his Iniquities.</hi> So that I may also say to him, Thou wert promised to Bless me; and sent to Turn me from my Iniquities. Thou wert made Man for my sake.</p>
            <p>Thou art also my Kinsman: Bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh: and did Any, ever, hate his own flesh? May I not call him <hi>Brother?</hi> and say unto him, that a <hi>Brother, is born for a day of distress and sorrow?</hi> as the wise man tells me. And he doth not only give me leave, but councels and commands me, not only <hi>to lift up my voyce to Wisdom,</hi> and cry after her, but also <hi>to call her my Sister;</hi> and to <hi>Understanding</hi> I am bid to say, <hi>Thou art my neer Kinswoman.</hi> And is not this Wisdom the Spirit of Christ? Which is yet promised to stand in every street and path; and that <hi>she shall cry</hi> (for, so it is promised in the future time, yet to come; and not only time past or present, as some ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.) Yea she crieth, <hi>and shall cry,</hi> to <hi>All the sons of men,</hi> to <hi>All the simple ones.</hi> Yea 'tis expressly said she <hi>shall</hi> cry to the <hi>Scorners</hi> also; <hi>How long will you love scorning? Turn ye yet at my Reproof, and I will yet powr out my spirit on you.</hi> And again in another Chapter, 'tis also, <hi>Shall not Wisdom cry? shall she not give her voyce? by the way, in the paths, at the gate, she shall shout, and at the entry of the City, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in at doors: Unto you O men I will call, and my voyce to the Sons of man: O ye simple, understand Wisdom; and ye fools, be ye of an understanding Heart.</hi> And again, <hi>I love them that love me; and they that seek me early shall find me. And my delights both were, and are, with the sons of men: Now therefore hearken to me.</hi> And to this Wisdom, which is There described as begotten by God (the same word used by <hi>Eve</hi> of <hi>Cain,</hi> I have <hi>Gotten the man Jehovah:)</hi> even in the beginning of his waies, before his Works of old, &amp;c. (which is plainly Christ:) and yet, to This <hi>Wisdom,</hi> I am bid to call her my <hi>Sister,</hi> and <hi>my neer</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:51941:44"/>
               <hi>Kinswoman.</hi> So that I wonder not at the Divine Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of Those that cried after Christ, <hi>O thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</hi> For, by This, he was their Neighbor, and their <hi>Brother; born for a day of sorrow.</hi> Which was also caught, and pressed, by the poor forlorn and cursed Woman of <hi>Canaan;</hi> though Christ was first silent, and then called her as a <hi>Dogg,</hi> but at length helped her with much compassion, as a Neighbor, or a Brother: which is large enough to reach a <hi>stranger</hi> also, and an <hi>Enemy;</hi> as we see, by his own answer to him that said, <hi>Lord, who is my Neighbor?</hi> and it took in, a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> with one of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:</hi> though at more defiance, and distance of heart and affection, than of Place or Nation. For this also see the 2. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and the 10. last verses.</p>
            <p>And we may see, what a stress, God himself put, and would have Us put, upon This, that Christ is our <hi>Brother;</hi> by That Great Promise in <hi>Moses</hi> (cited so often in the new Testament) <hi>I will raise them up a Prophet, from among their Brethren, like unto Thee:</hi> which words are also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly repeated several times in the <hi>Acts. A Prophet of your Brethren, like unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is also the more considerable, because in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next Chapter before This Promise (of Raising up a <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophet)</hi> It is also strictly commanded, that when, at any time they desired <hi>a King,</hi> they might not choose a <hi>Stranger,</hi> which was not a <hi>Brother;</hi> but <hi>from among thy Brethren, shalt thou set a King over thee.</hi> Which is also seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times pressed and repeated with an especial Emphasis, on that of a <hi>Brother,</hi> and from <hi>among your Brethren.</hi> So that, I may now tell Christ, that I neither do, nor may, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, either as a <hi>Priest,</hi> or <hi>Prophet,</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> but as he is, and so must be, <hi>My Brother.</hi> Else he is not <hi>That Prophet,</hi> which the Lord promised to raise; nor may I choose, or set him <hi>King,</hi> over me; except he will own himself to be my Brother: and so carry himself towards me, and must not exalt himself above his Brethren.</p>
            <p>Which was read, it seems, at the Coronation of their Kings: and the Jews tell us of such piercing looks, at the Reading of This, before <hi>Agrippa</hi> was admitted, or Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51941:45"/>
for their King; that Himself also could not hold from Tears: because he was not their <hi>Brother</hi> Born, but only made.</p>
            <p>And when their King was chosen, and set over them, He is bounded and limitted in that Law: and the great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is added, that his Heart be not lifted up above His Brethren.</p>
            <p>One of the great things required of the King, set over them, was This, That when he sate on the <hi>Throne of his Kingdom,</hi> he should <hi>write him a Copy of the Law, out of that which was before the Priests: and he must read therein, all the daies of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this Law, and these statutes to do them:</hi> as we read expressly in the 17. of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Phrase of <hi>Writing, when he sate on the Throne of his Kingdom,</hi> hath made me remember, that when the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation hath, with very great solemnity, brought Christ, or the Lamb, to the Throne of his Glorious Kingdom; <hi>He that sate upon the Throne said, Behold I make All things</hi> (even All things) <hi>New: Write,</hi> (saith He, to St. <hi>John) For, these words are true and faithful.</hi> And is it not a most sweet Promise? seeing All, in Christ Jesus, must be <hi>New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> that Himself promiseth to make <hi>All New?</hi> Yea and that also sitting on his Throne; and bidding it be written; with a <hi>Behold</hi> also before it, as a faithful and True saying: of Him also, who before his death, promised, that being lifted up, he would <hi>draw all men to him.</hi> And being lifted up, and set on his Throne, instead of Writing the Law, in Tables of stone, or other materials, he promiseth in the Prophets, to <hi>Write it in our Hearts:</hi> and by that also to make us New: and to give us a <hi>New Heart,</hi> and Mind, and Spirit; yea His Spirit in us: and by This to make us <hi>New.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another great matter, to be pressed also, upon Christ our King (sitting on the Throne of his Kingdom) out of that very Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> is this; That he must so <hi>Write the Law, for himself;</hi> that he must <hi>study it,</hi> and <hi>Keep it also, all his life.</hi> Even the very same Law, he gives, and governs by; he himself must <hi>Write it,</hi> and <hi>study it,</hi> and <hi>Keep it To us,</hi> all his daies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:51941:45"/>
Which St. <hi>Paul</hi> also hath taught us, saying, That he was not only <hi>made of a woman</hi> (as we observed before;) but also <hi>Made Under the Law:</hi> and that he was made <hi>Like us in All things</hi> (but sin) and therefore in <hi>Obedience</hi> also. Nay, as if it would be vain to promise the Law written in our hearts, before it was written in his own; he professeth in the fortieth <hi>Psalm,</hi> that it was written of him, that he should <hi>do the Will of God;</hi> even the whole Will of God; yea it was written in his heart also; so that he came to do it; and delighted in it, even with his whole heart. As we also find the Law, written over, a second time, by God himself, in the new Tables also, that <hi>Moses</hi> (as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of Christ) had prepared, after he had broken the First Tables, made and written by God; as an Emblem of our Hearts written and broken also; yea and renewed too, by the Law, new written in them, and put in the <hi>Ark</hi> (a Type of the <hi>Heart)</hi> covered by the <hi>Mercy Seat</hi> (repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Christ also; covering and comprehending the <hi>Law,)</hi> over-shadowed also, with the Cherubins of Glory: as the Seat and Throne of God, dwelling between the Cherubins; who stand prying into the Ark, or Heart of Man, and the Law in it; seeing by <hi>the Churches, the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Wisdom of God, is made known</hi> to the very <hi>Angels;</hi> who thus pry into the mysteries of Christ.</p>
            <p>This I take to be one of the sweetest things, I ever lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or can teach another; that the same person who is to Teach, and judg and govern me; is made under the same Law with me. Yea rather more than I, or the first <hi>Adam</hi> was; who was Put, or Brought under the Law, rather then Made under it; as Christ Was. So that he, can as soon cast out his own Being, as he can, cast out the Law of God; or any one Title of it, from his own heart. Which hath it All so moulded, and rivetted into it self, that <hi>Heaven and Earth shall pass away,</hi> much sooner, than any one <hi>Tittle, or Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta of the Law of God, pass away,</hi> or be unperformed by him. For, he came not to disanul the Law; but to perform it in his own person, most of All. And while others dispute for whom he did it; I ask only, Whether we think or doubt he did it not, in his own person? Which is one
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51941:46"/>
of the greatest things I therefore study; that by seeing All the Law, in its greatest Latitude, I may see the Duty of Christ, (for, I may so speak with Reverence) and his great Obligation both to God and Man; and his Joy, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; being written in his Heart to do the whole Law of God.</p>
            <p>So God spake to <hi>Joshua</hi> (that great Type of Jesus) Thou shalt divide the Land, and make them possess it, only be strong that thou mayest observe to <hi>do All the Law of</hi> Moses <hi>my Servant,</hi> that thou mayest be wise, or prosper, in all thou dost (which is <hi>Thence,</hi> in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and to <hi>Solomon</hi> &amp; divers others) <hi>and I will never leave thee.</hi> Which is also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to us All: in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> with so many repetitions, as God spake it several times to <hi>Joshua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which destroyed Israel, was observing the Laws of <hi>Omry,</hi> or other Kings among them; and leaving the Law of God, which was so good, and just, and wise, that all Nations also should say, they were a wise people that had such a Law. Which indeed made them the people of God, and so owned by him, so long as they accepted and owned his Law for their Rule. And he never cast them off, till they chose a <hi>stranger</hi> for their King, and a <hi>New Law,</hi> to govern them.</p>
            <p>Yea the great badg of Antichrist (which we should hate) may be, to place himself above the Law, and think to change the Law, which God hath promised to magnifie among all Nations.</p>
            <p>And although it be exceeding sweet, to see and know that he was made under the <hi>Suffering</hi> part of the Law: In all its heavy Threatnings and its Curses also: so that all the Waves of God, and all his Billows, rowled over him: and all his Arrows, did stick fast in Him; (and in <hi>Job, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Heman, Jonah,</hi> but as Types of Christ, and partakers of his Spirit, and acting some part of his Sufferings:) and when God had so powred out his Anger, his Soul rested, his Spirit was quiet, and he will be no more angry: as he often speaketh; as an angry person that hath vented his heat and is quiet. So, was he in Christ, when he had born his Wrath, the Fathers Soul Rested in him, and his Spirit is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51941:46"/>
quiet: so that he can be no more angry. But we may come to him as the Psalmist, <hi>Lord, Thou hast turned from the fierceness of thine anger, and hast put away all thy wrath</hi> (even All thy Wrath in Christ:) Why then should it lie on us thy poor Worms? O <hi>Turn us therefore</hi> as thou hast turned thy self, and Reconcile us also; seeing Thou art Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled; and art in Christ also Reconciling the World to thy self, and not imputing sin. Yet because this hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned so many disputes, How far, and for Whom, or How many, he so bare, the Curses of the Law; I shall therefore Now rather consider the <hi>Doing part of the Law:</hi> and what it required of Man to Man, as well as to God. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no doubt at all that I know, but that he was made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, to All, and for All, the Law required it. So that now look what ever was required of man, either to God, or to man, Christ was surely made, and put himself under all that; as his Duty to God also; whose Law lay upon him, and was written in his Heart also, as his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, Honor, Joy, Delight and Happiness; as to be made and kept in the Image of God.</p>
            <p>Though also the Suffering part, would soon be cleerer to us, if we did consider That the Infinite God could have no other fit and full Object of his Infinite Power, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; or could shew the strength of his Almighty Arm, the Power of his Wrath, or its heavy weight in no other But himself only, or his own Match, and his Fellow: which surely, no meer finite Beeing, was, or could be. If we therefore may imagine God could be any more Angry in Time, then he was from all Eternity, before the fall, or sin of any Creature: (which sure he could not be in himself, but to manifestation, and as he maketh us afraid, we judg him Angry:) Or, that he had a mind, or saw it requisite, to shew his mighty Strength and Justice, with the Power of his wrath to the uttermost: yet sure, he would not chuse a little Worm to shew it on; (or such, as are much less than the dust of the Ballance; or a drop of a Bucket; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven nothing, less than nothing;) When he had his full Match; and Fellow, which his Sword might challenge; when it most would wake, and shew it self in all its sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51941:47"/>
hardness; with all power and strength of that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Arm, that held and drew, and brandished that flaming Sword. Which therefore, none have cause to fear (or strength to feel, as Christ:) but such only as are high, and strong, and stout, to think themselves Gods fellows, or his match, and so challenge him. As He or she that sits as God, even in the Throne of God, and Temple: who must therefore look to feel the Sword of God, and all that take that Character: which All will take, <hi>whose names are not written in the Lambs Book of Life, even before the Foundation of the World.</hi> And yet These also shall not feel the Sword of his Hand or Arm (as Christ felt it) but only the Sword of his Mouth: a bright two edged, blessed Sword; which shall scatter and pierce them so, that as the <hi>Psalms</hi> and Prophets speak in several places, <hi>He will speak them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him:</hi> for, so, the Phrase is, and may be so translated; rather than he shall destroy, or subdue, them under him, or under us.</p>
            <p>Which Phrase of Speaking them under him (even then, when they have most cause, to expect destruction) makes me remember a notable place in the 3. of <hi>Zephany.</hi> Which the Jews also have marked, as one of the most especial pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in all the Scripture: having in one verse, every letter of their Alphabet, and those also, that are only final, as they call them; with other things observable. Which it may be, also bids us often read and meditate upon it; as One of the most notable descriptions of the mind; and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of God, even in his greatest Judgments; or in that, we use to call the great, or last Judgment. Which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is There also hinted. While he speaketh Thus; <hi>Therefore wait upon me, saith the Lord, to the Day of my Rising up to Eternity;</hi> (which some read, <hi>to the Prey) for, my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, to gather the Nations, that I may assemble the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, to powr upon them my Indignation, all my fierce Anger; for by the fire of my Jealousie, All the Earth shall be devoured. For,</hi> (though it seem a strange For,) <hi>Then, I will turn to the Peoples</hi> (it is plural, in the Original) <hi>a pure Lip, or Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> (Is not this a Blessed Speaking of them under him?) <hi>That all of them may call upon the Name of the Lord, with one</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:51941:47"/>
               <hi>consent, or with one shoulder.</hi> Or one <hi>Sechem.</hi> For, That is the word in the Hebrew Text; being the very same with His Name, that circumcised himself, and All the men of his City <hi>Sechem,</hi> for the Love of <hi>Dinah</hi> (which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so signifies <hi>Judgment,</hi> and may perhaps lead us to the great (or last) Judgment, which may circumcise more men, than may be, is expected: and be a sore surprize or ravishment to those that think to ravish it. Which should also be compared with the Judgment on <hi>Sechem,</hi> in <hi>Judges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will come rather to the plain things of the Gospel, cleerly comprehended, in the Doing Part of the Law. Which I am therefore made to study, that I may see, not only, my Duty to God or man; but Christs Duty unto me; a poor Worm, sprauling here in dust, or thick clay. And yet his Wisdom, and the Best in him, being now united to Flesh, <hi>will not,</hi> must not, say to the Foot, I have no need of Thee: yea, must not disdain to say to this Worm, <hi>Thou art my Brother,</hi> or <hi>my Sister;</hi> and <hi>Corruption is my Mother, or my neer kindred.</hi> And while others talk of <hi>Doing the Law,</hi> and performing it to others: I am mainly bent to see and hope, believe and pray, that Christ will Do it, and perform it unto me: and so by working in me, teach me, and help me also, so to Act to others, in some measure As he doth to me.</p>
            <p>What is the Law which hath so long kept us in awe? As if it had, or could, <hi>disanul the free Grace of God,</hi> and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant thereof, which was made with our Fathers, and with us in them also, so many hundred years before the Law rose up. As also the Goodness and Pities of God were from everlasting to everlasting, and so much longer, and stronger, than his wrath, (which we use to call his Justice) which is not in him but as a stranger, coming cross his way, or calling on him, and at most, was but of yester day; when some poor creature had sinned.</p>
            <p>Is not the Law the very mind and Heart of God? even That God, which is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and perfect goodness? Is it not summed up, by Christ himself, into <hi>Love?</hi> All the Law nothing but Love? <hi>Thou shalt Love the Lord thy God,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:51941:48"/>
               <hi>with all thy mind, and heart, and might; and the other is like unto this.</hi> (Like unto This! For, Man also is like unto God, and thou must Love, yea, and honor Man too (But Like as thou dost God?) <hi>Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how can I possibly Love God, or my Neighbor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God Love me? yea and some way manifest his Love to me? Can I first give unto God, or lend him, that it may be paid again? Is it Probable, or Possible, (that I say not noble, generous, or Ingenuous) for my God to ask and expect my Heart, and Hearts Love to him, before he had given his Heart, and Hearts Love to me?</p>
            <p>What shall we say then? Having loved Man once, he loved him still, being his own; in his own Image, which he yet owns still in him, after the Fast, and after the Flood too; <hi>Thou shalt not shed Mans blood; for, in the Image of God He is created.</hi> Nay, St. <hi>Paul</hi> is so bold, as to call man not only the <hi>Image of God,</hi> but also his <hi>Glory: the Image and Glory of God.</hi> And yet he speaks of Man as Man, and of every man; saying also, that Christ is the <hi>Head of every man:</hi> and that Man is the Image and Glory of God.</p>
            <p>And Wisdom, which is Christ, plainly saith, His delights were not only with Man, but with the <hi>Sons of men:</hi> or Man-kind. And there were no <hi>Sons of men,</hi> till after the <hi>Fall,</hi> and when man had sinned. And Gods <hi>Philanthropy,</hi> or <hi>Love to Man-kind</hi> (so much spoken of by St. <hi>Paul</hi> and others in the New Testament) is also observed by <hi>Moses</hi> himself, who beginning to bless the twelve Tribes of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, plainly saith, <hi>God loveth the Peoples also;</hi> (for, the word is Plural, and may take in, all the Gentile Nations also, in the Earth:) yea, he carries them all in his bosom, as the word he there useth may import. Though he have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so some especial to them that sit at his Feet, and receive the Law at his Mouth, which he there giveth for a sure Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Gods especial Love: even his Giving, and their Receiving, of his Law: the Good and Royal Law of Love. And <hi>God so loved the World,</hi> even the World, that he <hi>gave his Son for the world;</hi> not to condemn the World, but to save it: for, <hi>God,</hi> even the <hi>Father</hi> himself, is Love, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51941:48"/>
hath sent forth his Son in Love: and hath also promised his Spirit to <hi>convince the world,</hi> even the World, <hi>of Sin; and to powr it out on all flesh; that All may see the Glory of God;</hi> Yea, every eye may see his <hi>Salvation.</hi> And hath therefore given his Law to the World, even to the worst of men, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues to <hi>Timothy;</hi> that by it, he may convince them, and draw them to Christ. Having so shut them all up, in unbelief, and conclude them All under sin, and breach of the Law, that he might have Mercy on them. Which indeed, and properly speaking, could not be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till there was an Object for it; and there was no Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which is the Object of Mercy, till Sin was in the world.</p>
            <p>And doth not This very Law (this Holy, perfect, Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law of Love) express and speak this Heart and Love of God, to every man, that it speaketh to? and that is the worst of men living. Doth it not say, Thou shalt love me, because I love thee? Doth it not begin to every Man, to whom it speaks, and say, <hi>I am the Lord thy God?</hi> even <hi>Thy Lord,</hi> and <hi>Thy God!</hi> and Therefore <hi>Thou shalt have No other God,</hi> because I am Thy God. And therefore thou shalt not bow to Images, but Worship me only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I only, am <hi>the Lord Thy God.</hi> And therefore thou shalt honor my Name, and not abuse my Love, or take my Name or Goodness in vain, or turn it into Wantonness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>I am the Lord thy God.</hi> And wilt thou not both love and honor, That is <hi>Reverence,</hi> that great and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Name, <hi>The Lordthy God.</hi> Not a <hi>Terrible</hi> Name, but a <hi>Reverend</hi> Name: and therefore to be loved, and greatly honored, or Reverenced; as God bids us Reverence his Sanctuary, and a Woman must Reverence her Husband: and the time is coming that we shall not call our God <hi>Baali,</hi> that is, <hi>My Lord,</hi> or <hi>hard Master;</hi> But <hi>Ishi,</hi> my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. And yet we shall then most Love and Reverence him with Godly, Sonly, Fear and Reverence.</p>
            <p>And because this Name of the Lord my God is so great, and holy, and reverend; Therefore I am bid to reverence it, and hallow it; even as the first Petition of our Lords Prayer, teacheth us to pray; and by no means to take it in vain. For, they that name it, must depart from Iniquity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:51941:49"/>
And although the words added, of not holding him <hi>guiltlesse, that takes his Holy Name in vain,</hi> ought still to keep me in great aufull Reverence, yet they ought not to make me have any hard thoughts of God, as if he were an Hard Master, which our Saviour shewed as the Root of all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage. And those words may seem to speak a selfish per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and so hard to please, and so unexorable when dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased, that do little suit the sweet and Gracious Heart of God; which is <hi>Pure and Peaceful, hardly provoked, and Gentle, easie to be entreated: Slow to anger, and without fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> (which rest onely in the bosome of Fools) <hi>Delighting in Mercy and abounding in Goodnesse; The Father of Mercies, pardoning Iniquity, Transgression and Sin;</hi> And when he is provoked to visit and chasten, yet he doth it Gently and Slowly, and by degrees, not at once, <hi>but in three or four Generations,</hi> as it may be born, <hi>least the spirit that he hath made, should fail before him.</hi> And when he afflicteth, He will not do it <hi>for ever,</hi> For, he doth it not <hi>willingly,</hi> or <hi>from his Heart: but he will Turn again, and shew compassion, because he delighteth in Goodnesse; and his pitties and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions never fail;</hi> and <hi>his tender Mercies are over all his works. yea all his works shall praise him,</hi> the earth and all that is in it, and the <hi>Sea also is full of his Goodnesse. He openeth his Handwide, and filleth all things with Good, and giveth the desire of every living thing. Every Tree in the Forest shall clap hands, and sing, and rejoyce,</hi> the very <hi>Dragons shall praise him,</hi> the <hi>Owls</hi> shall answer one another in his Praises. <hi>Every thing that hath breath shall praise him. All flesh shall see his glory; and every eye shall see his Salvation.</hi> For, what is Glory, in some places, speaking thus, is <hi>Salvation</hi> in others, and so in the Gospel also, Citing it out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
            <p>In a word, there is nothing in that Threatning, or in any other, in this <hi>Law</hi> (and why then should we fear the Gospel?) but what speaks, Gods tender Love, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Pities and Compassions. Even his very Jealousie (which yet is made the Foundation of all his visitting) springeth from <hi>Love.</hi> It is so in man, much more in God, who is love its self, and when he means to shew his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51941:49"/>
Love, to his poor people, in recovering them from all captivity and sorrow: he expresseth it, by being <hi>Jealous</hi> over them, and for them, with a <hi>great Jealousie.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth his tender bowels to the poor Saints, a <hi>Godly Jealousie,</hi> or a Godlike <hi>Jealousie.</hi> Lest a stranger should attempt to get away their heart, which he had, like God the Father, Espoused to his dear Son Jesus. And when the Lord resolves both effectually and speedily to recover his back-sliding people, he promiseth to move them to <hi>Jealousie</hi> also; as himself is moved with <hi>Jealousie</hi> for them: lest another get their heart from him, which would never trouble him, if he did not very much love them, and very tenderly.</p>
            <p>And although <hi>Jealousie</hi> in Christ (for, it is proper to an <hi>Husband)</hi> may seem as the <hi>Wrath of a man that will not spare or pardon in his day of visitation,</hi> as the wise man expresseth it: Yet even That very phrase of <hi>Not sparing,</hi> or <hi>Not pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> (which yet is one of the hardest or harshest expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the whole Scriptures) is no other, than the very same <hi>Solomon,</hi> doth not only observe and commend, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and comman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>so, in a tender hearted Father, to the Son of his own bowels: whom yet he must <hi>Chasten, and not spare, or pardon:</hi> 'tis that very phrase. Which, yet sure, cannot mean, that he shall be alwaies angry, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled; but that he sorely chasten and correct in earnest, and as an Ordinance of God, and not for lust or dalliance, or so as may occasion sin, or harden in the sin so visited. May it not be possible also, that the dearest children of God, even <hi>Moses,</hi> may commit such a Failor in his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration work, as may in such a sense be never forgiven; that is, Sorely chastened, as <hi>David</hi> was, and be still remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a Spot, for that Generation work, though they may, and shall be saved. May They also, or only, commit such Unpardonable sins?</p>
            <p>And such a visitation may be threatned, in the second Command: as was promised, rather than threatned, to <hi>Davids</hi> children. Who yet had the everlasting Covenant, and the sure <hi>Mercies,</hi> or as the <hi>Acts</hi> expresseth it, <hi>the sure Holy things</hi> of <hi>David:</hi> which are also promised to every
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51941:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Believer, or every one that Thirsteth, and thirsting co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the Waters; even to them, and their seed for ever. So that if his children break the Law, and shal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise his Statutes, <hi>Then will I visit their Transgression with the Rod, and their Iniquity with stripes.</hi> He will chasten them with Rods, and as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> expresseth it, cause them <hi>to pass under the Rod,</hi> and <hi>Bond of the Covenant:</hi> So that <hi>Rods</hi> are a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Cevenant,</hi> and its Bond. But he will not take away his Everlasting Kindness. Yet, as he speaketh of <hi>Solomon</hi> (perhaps one of the greatest sinners ever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:) for this, <hi>I will afflict,</hi> or chasten <hi>the House of</hi> David: <hi>but not for Ever.</hi> Not for ever. <hi>I will not retain my Anger for Ever;</hi> which is expressly forbidden Man in general, And so Christ also, in the very Law that saith,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou shalt not avenge thy self, or reserve thine Anger:</hi> No not till the Sun go down. For so this Law is pressed upon us; and why not so, upon every one made under that Law also? and by consequence on Christ himself! <hi>Nor shalt thou bear any grudg, or thought in thy heart, against the Children of thy People:</hi> for my Covenant is with them and their childrens children also, for evermore. Therefore thou shalt bear no grudg against them, or any of their Children: <hi>But thou shalt love thy Neighbor as thy self.</hi> Which our Savior, and the Apostles, so much, the sum of the whole Law. And to this very place, and the phrase here used, of <hi>not reserving Anger,</hi> or not <hi>retaining ought</hi> in heart, he very many times alludeth: when he saith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>I will not retain for ever;</hi> or I will <hi>not reserve my Anger;</hi> or I will not be <hi>alwaies Wroth;</hi> or I will <hi>not contend for ever:</hi> and the like expressions, which himself, and all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affirms of him, divers times: as one of the first and chiefest things we ought to believe os him. Which is also a most comfortable acknowledgment, that He also takes, himself to be obliged, with the following words of the same verse (which he citeth also several times:) <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbor, as thou lovest thy self.</hi> Very sweet, as Lying on Man to Man; but yet much sweeter, as it lieth on Christ (the Son of Man) to Man, Man-kind, every Man: As I hope will be fully cleered anon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:51941:50"/>
Nor do I find any thing in any of the Commandements, contrary to this. No, not That of Gods Jealousie (which we touched before) and his visiting the Iniquity of the Fathers on their children. Even when he seeth so much Iniquity in the Father, that by his general Laws of Justice, Truth, Equity, and Mercy too, (for they go all together,) he must visit; yet he is so slow to anger, and so loth to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, that he will do it by degrees, and by steps: and not so, that may make the Father so miserable as he deserves, and might very justly be. But so, that he may have some part of the rod, as <hi>David</hi> had; and his children also some other part of it; so, as may bring them to see, and know, and acknowledg, the Iniquities of their Fathers also. Which God promised, rather than threatned, to <hi>Moses,</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> also, as we read in the 26. of <hi>Leviticus:</hi> so much cited and confessed (sor their Fathers also) in the ninth chapters of <hi>Daniel, Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> that I say nothing of <hi>David</hi> in the 50. <hi>Psalm:</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the Son of Man, (and so a special Type of Christ the Son of Man) is bid to make his people Know their sins, and the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions and Iniquities of their Fathers. Which are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given when Seen and acknowledged, bemoaned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented; as God promiseth he will bring them unto. For, it is not, as some read it, <hi>If they shall confess, &amp;c.</hi> But 'tis an absolute Promise, in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> (and so cited also by <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> or <hi>Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,)</hi> that he would bring them to confess: and that they should, confess their own Iniquities, and their Fathers also, and be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for them.</p>
            <p>That which also followeth in the second Command, is very sweet; and far from shewing God to be an Angry, Wrathful God; as Satan would fain represent him. As at first in Paradice, some of his very first spawn, (cast on our great Mother, and continued ever since, till Christ shall break his head, and destroy his malice with his works,) was This, That God, was an <hi>Envious</hi> God: the Root of all evil, and hard thoughts of God. Who even in Judging, and in Chastening, and in all, his worst visitations, There Threatned, (where yet, he spake his heart, and seems to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51941:51"/>
speak his worst;) will still remember Mercy. Even in <hi>Judgment,</hi> and in visiting most, as a <hi>Jealous God, he will remember Mercy.</hi> And will but correct in measure: and will not contend for ever, lest the Spirit fail, which he hath made. But will visit only, to the third or fourth Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even in those that Hate him. Which yet we All do, and could not but do; Till he Turn us, by manifesting <hi>Love</hi> to us. Love, which he still beareth in his heart; and it is there Rivetted so fast, that he can as soon Un-god himself, I would speak with Reverence, as he can cast out Love, from his Heart; or act to his poor creatures without Love. Nay, give me leave to tell you, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Adam</hi> Better, more: or with a Better Love, or more Godlike, after his Fall, than before. Nay it may be, Now much better, since his long sorrows and sufferings, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Paradice. Nay, I had almost said with a better Love than he loved Christ himself, before his Fall or Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. For, he tels us, it is a Little Love, to love our like, our Friend; one lovely, fair, and beautiful: kind and thankful, still to us, for all our love. A very smal, and poor, and little Love: which sinners shew, and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and All, to All their like. But, that God might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease his Love to <hi>Adam;</hi> or might shew a Better Love than he could manifest (be it spoken with Reverence) while Man was Like him, Holy, Wise, and Just, Truly Fair and Beautiful in All: he let him fall, into the dirt, and dust of death. Into the Pox, or worse disease, that might deform him wholly; so that he might commend his love indeed, to such as hated him, and were unworthy, ugly: more deformed then poor <hi>Job,</hi> when botched all, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, most forlorn and miserable, in his own and others thoughts, and left in the hand of Sathan, at his will, But <hi>onely save his Life, or Soul:</hi> as God expresseth it. Not onely for a Type of somewhat yet to come, unto All that will wait with <hi>Job,</hi> and expect the Lords End: but it may be, representing <hi>Adam</hi> also, as accused and tempted by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and at length left in his hands; till God could shew, his love was not onely skin deep, as we say; but everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting. Nay encreasing more and more, as it could make

or find an Object, for that pity and compassion, and that gracious Mercy, which could not appear, but still had been unseen abroad, from God, or hid within him; had not his Wisdom contrived an Object for it, which was Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, and guilt: which was not, till Sin came in: and so he let him fall, and shut him up under sin and guilt, that he migh shew him Mercy: which he could not do before.</p>
            <p>And as before his fall, God did not absolutely tye him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to Punish him; So, After the fall, he did not execute That upon him, which he might have done: but <hi>devised devices,</hi> (as the Wise Woman of <hi>Tekoa</hi> said to <hi>David) that his poor Banished might not perish.</hi> And yet still preserved his own Honour and Majesty, Truth and Justice too; with such a kind of Love and Tender pity, merciful compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which could not appear abroad, or possibly be shewn till sin, or guilt, or shame, or fear, or sorrow, grief or pain, or some such misery, or other, made an Object capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of pity, mercy, or compassion.</p>
            <p>I shall yet a little more insist on these Particulars, &amp; shew I hope, they very well agree, and no way contradict the Words and Mind of God, even in the Law, or harshest part of all the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>First I premise, God loved him: and could not but love him, very intirely (if he loved himself,) while he was in his own Image. And having so loved him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so Immutable, in his Heart, Love and Nature, <hi>he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to the End.</hi> And I do not yet clearly see how any Promise can Oblige God, to a more Constant Love, of Man restored to that Image; Then his own Nature and Heart, moved him to love <hi>Adam,</hi> In that Image.</p>
            <p>Now, if his Heart, be not so truly Tender, Gratious, and Perfectly Good, and immutable also, in his most Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine and Natural Love; but that it could, really change, towards <hi>Adam,</hi> in his own Image; (yea and that also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fall, or any demerit what ever;) as to decree his everlasting ruine; or at least to leave him to it so, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing that he would, so fall, and rise no more, in himself and his Posterity; How can any man be sure, and rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Word, or Promise, that he will not leave him,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51941:52"/>
when he is renewed again, into that Image? Seeing it may be still doubted, whether any man living, can fully know Gods heart, and mind, by his words, or expressions; except there be, some way else, to know it (and to rest and trust in it) then his words can expresse, or import.</p>
            <p>Or unlesse, a man may also be taught, to believe his Word, is Better, Truer, and more Certain, Fixed, and Obliging also, then his very Heart and Nature is. Which (as some Teach or Believe) was Such, even then, when it loved most (or as much as it could love its self, or its own Image) that it yet hated, and forsook, and left to I know not what, Irrecoverable misery, his own Image, and his dearly beloved; in his own person, or at least his posterity: even his very next Son, and Sons Sons, to all Generations, yea to all Eternity, for the far greatest part of his Posterity.</p>
            <p>May we not therefore believe and say, that with a true, constant and Eternal Love of Delight and Complacence, from all Eternity to all Eternity, God loved himself: and his own Image, where ever it was? And nothing else but kimself, and his own Image, with that kind of Love? And so, before the fall, he loved man; And being fallen, with a Sweeter, better, Greater, Kinder kinde of Love, of Pitty, Mercy and most tender Bowels of Compassion: Which was ever in that Infinite Fountain of All being; But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not abroad, till the Wisdom of God, contrived how to shut up some in fear and guilt, that so he might at once, shew Justice Truth and Mercy also, which then Met and Kist, Embracing one another.</p>
            <p>And the Lord foreseeing, and Resolving all this, that so it should, and so it must be, while his Heart was such (and such it must be, while he was, and is himself: which was and will be ever, and beyond all words that expresse Eternity) He still spake so wisely, that when he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned most, yet he lefr an Issue for goodnesse to come forth, and shew it self, with Truth and Justice too. And therefore at the very first Command and Threatning to our Father, <hi>Dying thou shalt Dye</hi> (or thou shalt surely Die) he did not tye his hands, or bind himself, without such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51941:52"/>
as might still afford, room large enough, for Truth and Mercy both.</p>
            <p>I shall not enquire at present, upon what account, it pleased the Lord, to abridge <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, of That which he granted before (when he gave him for meat e-Every hearb bearing Seed, and every Tree, in which is the Fruit of a Tree yielding Seed;) which is not Usual with God: To give and then to take away, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit. Nor do I say, <hi>Adam</hi> obliged himself to that, which he needed not, if he had considered his former Pattent, or his Deed of Gift. But this I say in general, there is not a Word, Command, or Threatning, spoken to man, that is not spoken by Christ; And first therefore spoken by God, in and to Christ: who then speaketh nothing, but what God said to him, in him; and As the Father spake it unto him, so he speaketh unto man. But certainly there was not any one word ever spoken by God to Christ, either Precept or Threatning, with any purpose to make him Despair; But to Do believe and live. And by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, never any one Word or Threatning of the whole Law, spoken by Christ, to any man, but As the Father spake it unto him: not to make him Despare, but believe and live. For which also see, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 29. &amp; 29. 29. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 78. 5, 6, 7, 8. 81. 13. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 19, 20. <hi>Isa.</hi> 48. 17, 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. <hi>John</hi> 3. 17. 17. &amp; 5. 34. &amp; 12. 47, 48, 49, 50. &amp; 20. 31. Again I do not see plainly, what God meant by Dying, when he said, <hi>thou shalt surely dye, or dying dye.</hi> Or, that if he meant the worst of deaths for kinde, he meant it, so also for Duration. Seeing Christ, when he bore the Curse, and its heavy weight, did not dye such a kinde of death: or at least for such duration, as it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be here threatned. And the very phrase here used to <hi>Adam,</hi> is threatned to Davids <hi>Child by</hi> Bathsheba; and to many others in the Scripture. And to <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> it is added, <hi>Thou shalt not live:</hi> And yet, he did not die, but live. And <hi>David</hi> hoped that his Child might live, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that threatning, dying it shall die, or it shall surely die. And sure when it did die, he did not believe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51941:53"/>
it dyed Etetnally: or that this was threatned by that phrase, so frequent also in Scripture.</p>
            <p>And if God had meant any such Eternal death to <hi>Adam,</hi> by that threatning, it is somewhat strange, that after the fall, he removed them out of Paradise, and guarded it so, least they should yet eat of the Tree of Life, <hi>and Live for Ever:</hi> though he had said, <hi>Thou shalt surely dye.</hi> But to put the matter out of doubt: We may see Gods Meaning of this Threatning, in the 24. cha. of <hi>Ezek.</hi> where he saith the people should so certainly <hi>die in their sins,</hi> and <hi>pine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in their Iniquities;</hi> with the most terrible expressions, and most vehement assertions, that can well be imagined. as, <hi>Because, I would have purged thee, and thou wast not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, thou shalt not be purged, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee; I the Lord have spoken it, it shall come to pass, and I will do it. I will not goe back, neither will I repent; But you shall pine away, for your iniquity, &amp;c.</hi> which is the terrible Threatning, reserved for the last place, in that famous and gradual Judgement, so solemnly denounced in the twenty sixth of <hi>Leviticsn.</hi> And As a Seal of this most heavy doom, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is strucken dumb (and can no more admonish or comfort them, so finally devoted to destruction,) so that he never speaks a word more to them from that 24. chap. to the thirty third.</p>
            <p>And there, God lets and bids him speak again, unto the <hi>Children of his people.</hi> By which very phrase, we are led back to that sweet place, we cited so lately out of the 19. of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> of bearing no grudge <hi>against the Children of his people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self; thou shalt not hate thy Brother in thy heart, but shalt certainly rebuke him, and not suffer sin to lye upon him.</hi> Which is the Text on which the Lord so comments, to the <hi>Son of man,</hi> whom God there setteth up (as a mighty Type of Christ) to be the great Watchman and warner, to his brethren and his neighbours. Or to be a light to lighten the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> also; each man, and <hi>every Man, that cometh into the World.</hi> Adding also on that occasion, that if a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or a people of a place, do of themselves, in a time of darknesse and danger, choose a man, and set him up for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51941:53"/>
a Watchman, or a Teacher, or a Ruler among them (there being alike reason;) God will own it as His Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: though but of Humane Choyce and Institution. Which may be compared with That of the Apostle, of submitting to <hi>Mans Institutions</hi> in Government, even <hi>for the Lord;</hi> or as an <hi>Ordinance of God.</hi> To be much consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, by those that reject Rulers, or Teachers, if they cannot shew a special Call, or Mission by God.</p>
            <p>Upon That occasion, the Son of Man, (which also rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to Christ, whose work is much described in <hi>Ezekiel:)</hi> hath his strict, yet general Rules also; when ever God threatneth Man. And Then remembring the last solemn Threatning, but now cited from the 24. chapter, (which was the last spoken to them) He commandeth Thus, <hi>O thou Son of Man, speak unto the House of Israel: Thus you speak, saying, If our sins be so upon us, that we must Pine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in them</hi> (which was the last great Threatning,) <hi>How then</hi> shall we, or <hi>can we, possibly Live? Say unto them. As I live saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the Death of the wicked</hi> (even of the wicked) <hi>but that the wicked, Turn from his Way, and live. Turn you, Turn you, from your evil waies, for, why will you die, O ye House of Israel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then giveth that sweet, and yet general Rule, for interpreting All the Lords Threatnings; and This in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, used to <hi>Adam, Dying thou shalt die,</hi> or <hi>Thou shalt surely die:</hi> The very Words spoken to <hi>Adam,</hi> and the worst of All that was Threatned to Him. <hi>When I say to the Wicked</hi> (as I did once, to my dearly beloved <hi>Adam,</hi> in Innocence) <hi>Thou shalt surely die: Yet if he Turn</hi> (and Thou must warn him of those very words; that he may Turn and Repent; and Then) <hi>he shall surely live, he shall not die.</hi> Which is several times repeated, notwithstanding that Doom, <hi>Thou shalt surely Die.</hi> Which in general, God hath here interpreted, when ever he so speaketh, or shall so speak; (for it is the <hi>Infinite</hi> Mood or Manner of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;) <hi>In my saying,</hi> or when ever I do say, or shall say, <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou shalt Dië,</hi> or Thou shalt surely Die: Yet it is not, nor may be taken as any Absolute Doom; but a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Threatning. Which, in case of Repentance, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51941:54"/>
come to Sentence, and much less to Execution.</p>
            <p>And yet it was to a <hi>Wicked Man,</hi> as Wicked; <hi>O Thou wicked Man:</hi> and so to one in a much worse condition, and more desperate, than <hi>Adam</hi> was; when it was so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to him, in Paradice.</p>
            <p>And upon This Occasion also, God Comments on that Clause in the second Command, of visiting the Fathers sins upon the Children: which the Jews judged not Equal; and expressed by their usual Proverb, <hi>The Fathers have Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the sowr Grapes, and the Childrens Teeth are set on Edge.</hi> Which he confutes at large, in the 18 of <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> and sweareth it shall not be used any more. Which is to be compared with That most sweet Chapter, the 31. of <hi>Jerem.</hi> Where also That Evil Proverb, is commanded and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Down: with such a sweet and gracious Context, both before, and after it, as can never be, too much considered.</p>
            <p>And the Lords Discourse against That Proverb, may be a good Comment, on that passage in the second Command, <hi>of visiting Iniquities of the Fathers, on the Children:</hi> But on Those that go on, in their Fathers Iniquities. And Then also, the Children never <hi>Die for the Fathers sin.</hi> They may be visited, or chastened; But They shall not Die, for their Fathers sin. No not for their Great Father <hi>Adams.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is a very comfortable thing, and much to be considered by All: and in special, with relation to Infants, that die without Actual sin; having <hi>not sinned, after the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of</hi> Adams <hi>Transgression.</hi> But the Lord hath here promised, the Children shall not die for, or <hi>Bear, the Fathers sin.</hi> Nor indeed, was That Expressed to <hi>Adam:</hi> or for ought appeareth, was intended; that His Children should Die for His sin. Nay rather, God hath expressly declared the contrary: that They shall not. And yet Death came in, by sin, and passed over All: seeing All have sinned and came short of the Glory of God. And yet They do not Die (and sure Then not Eternally) for their Fathers sin. Which may be compared with That of our Savior, touching the man born blind: and yet neither for His Own sin, or his Fathers; but that the Glory of God might be seen in his blindness. And yet the Fathers Iniquity
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51941:54"/>
(for, That is the Phrase) May be visited upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and are the Visitations of God Smal things? But yet, why should we despair of the Goodness of God, even in his visitation? seeing Himself also hath chosen such a Phrase, that with God and man speaketh kindness? And a Love visit rather than any Hatred? And if we rightly understand Gods heart in All, we would long for his visits, though he should come, but to chide, or to chasten us: and we should value the very lowest, and the meanest of his visits, at a very great rate. Sure it is not a little thing to be visited by a great Man! How much more by a good Man? which if we understood, and saw the person they represent to us, and the Embassage they still come about, we should cry, as <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the Virgin <hi>Mary: How is it,</hi> that the <hi>Mother, Brother, Sister, of my Lord, vouchsafeth thus to visit me?</hi> for, every one that is His, and doth His Fathers will; is his <hi>Mother, Brother, Sister;</hi> as himself speaketh. And have not many <hi>Thus entertained Angels?</hi> How much more is it then, for God, and Jesus Christ, to come and visit, such poor Worms, as we are? For, <hi>What is Man, that thou shouldest so magnifie him?</hi> (even so magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him!) <hi>and that thou shouldest set thy heart upon him?</hi> and <hi>That Thou shouldest Visit him every morning, and Try him every moment?</hi> Yea, as if <hi>David</hi> would lead us up, to the very Visits made by God, to <hi>Adams Children,</hi> after the Fall; he expresseth it Thus; <hi>Lord what is</hi> Enos, <hi>that thou shouldest remember him;</hi> and the <hi>Son of</hi> Adam, <hi>that thou shouldest visit him?</hi> For he very well knew it a great condescention in God, and happiness to Man, that God should come, to visit him. For, his <hi>Visitations sustain our spirits,</hi> and preserve us alive. I need not tel you what the Jews say of <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons visiting his Wife with a Kid:</hi> or <hi>Abrahams</hi> visiting of <hi>Hagar,</hi> in the Wilderness; a Type of what is on her, and her Children to this day; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh. Or what is promised to all the Kings and great men in the Terrible Pit; that <hi>after many daies they should be visited;</hi> as we read in <hi>Esay;</hi> to be compared also with <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 11, 12. Yea even when his Visit is to chasten us, it is an Honor, and an Happiness. <hi>My Son despise not thou the Chastening of the</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:51941:55"/>
               <hi>Lord, neither be thou weary of His Correction: for, whom the Lord loveth he correcteth, even as a Father doth a Son of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold, Happy is the man, whom the Lord correcteth, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore despise not thou the chastising of the Almighty. For, be maketh sore, and bindeth up: He woundeth, and his hands make whole.</hi> Which, in That very Book also, is more largely repeated by <hi>Elihu</hi> (in the person of Christ, as his Name imports, <hi>He is my God)</hi> who sheweth Gods designs in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of Man: yea and Then when he <hi>visiteth in Anger, though he know it not in great Extremity;</hi> a very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Expression, whether we take it of God, or of <hi>Job:</hi> who was taught that all Gods Angry visits, were for Good of man, <hi>to shew him his Way, and to hide Pride from him,</hi> and to recover him from his sins and sorrows also. Which is confirmed also, by the Psalmist, in divers places. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after he hath so solemnly called, Invited, and Woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Nations and People of the Earth, to come in, and bow to God, because of his Goodness and marvelous Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to the children of men: from the 95. onward. Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also that Afflictions, and the Lords visits, even unto Fools (the worst of men,) is to make them cry to God, and stir up his Pities and Compassions, that never fail: and to make his tender bowels yearn over them so, <hi>that he will hear them in their trouble, and will save them out of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress; He will send his Word and heal them; and deliver them from their destructions. They</hi> (even They also) <hi>shall praise the Lord for his Goodness, and for his wonderful Works to the Children of men.</hi> Which is divers times repeated in one Psalm; and that also, by way of Prophesie or Promise; and not only by Wishing, as some now translate it.</p>
            <p>Though the very Wishes of the Spirit of God, writing the Scripture; and it's, <hi>O that all the Lords People were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and O that they would hearken, and had Ears to hear, or hearts to do as they say: And O that they would consider and Turn; and O that they would confess to God,</hi> or acknowledg God, or praise and bless God: And Let <hi>All flesh praise him, and every thing that hath breath praise the Lord:</hi> and the like Sighs and Groans, Wishes and Prayers, of the good
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51941:55"/>
Spirit of God in the hearts of his People (especially those that wrot the Scriptures;) are indeed both Prophesies and Promises: or very strong convincing Arguments, that such things so wished, prayed, and desired, shall be granted to men, and performed in them, and in all the Earth also.</p>
            <p>Even as Christs setting all his People to pray, that our <hi>Fathers Kingdom might come, and his Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven,</hi> (Even in The Heaven, or Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens) is a very strong argument, and great assurance, with Evidence, that It shall be so; Even <hi>in Earth,</hi> as it is in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Yea, and it is very usual in Scripture, first for the Spirit to express its sighs and groans, and ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and longings, for a thing; and afterwards, we read it prophesied, and promised, It shall be so. First it cries, <hi>Let All the Earth be full of thy Glory:</hi> and then afterwards, <hi>It shal be All full of my Glory.</hi> First, <hi>Let all thy Works praise thee:</hi> and Then, <hi>They shall All praise thee.</hi> Let <hi>All Nations see thy Glory:</hi> and Then All Nations, and <hi>Every Eye, shall see the Glory,</hi> yea and the <hi>Salvation, of God. The Skies shall powr down Righteousness, and the Earth shall open, and they shall bring forth Salvation: for, the Lord hath created, and commanded it.</hi> He hath willed it, and his people will it also. For, <hi>Concerning his Sons and his Daughters, They will Ask him; but concerning the Works of his Hands,</hi> even All the works of his Hands; <hi>They may, and will, and shall,</hi> (as they are bid) <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him.</hi> And shall do the <hi>same works, yea and Greater al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,</hi> than ever Christ did, Then on Earth. For, he did but <hi>begin</hi> (but <hi>Begin) to do and Teach</hi> (as we read in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Acts)</hi> and hath left All to be finished, by his Servants after him: who for This, is gone to the Father, and set down at his Right Hand; and so hath Power, or must, and shall, have Power, over All the Works of his Hands.</p>
            <p>And hath he received All that <hi>Power,</hi> in Heaven &amp; Earth, for <hi>Destruction, or for Edification?</hi> I trust verily for <hi>Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not for Destruction.</hi> As S. <hi>Paul</hi> spake of His. So it is, and much more, and better much, I hope, in JesusChrist: seeing <hi>that he can heal us if he will</hi> (as the poor Lepar said) and <hi>can quicken whom he will</hi> (as himself saith) why should we
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51941:56"/>
doubt his <hi>Will?</hi> seeing with us, it is one of the lowest steps of Grace, and Goodnesse, to be <hi>Willing to be Good,</hi> and Graceful: Yea and as Good, and full of Grace, as we can be, and have any Power to be. Why may we not hope it so, in Christs Will also? Is it Lesse and Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, or Worse, and Weaker, then his Power? Is his Heart Narrow, as Mine is? And his Bowels straitned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so? Or his Eye Evil, and his Heart Envious also? That he will not give, or do, or cannot abide to see, the Good, he might both See, and Do, and Give, and Work, very easily in us, by that Power he hath received; and the Gifts he had, for Rebels also.</p>
            <p>I have sometimes thought it might be better much, and more Ingenuous farr, to think our Saviour <hi>Weak,</hi> or quite unable, to do what he would; then wilful, or unwilling, to do what he can, for Good. The one, doth but make him Weak as a man; the other, Evil, Envious, or Malicious, as a Wicked Man or Devil. Or an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> that makes a great shew of Grace, and good in his <hi>Face;</hi> as the <hi>Heb Canaph,</hi> or <hi>Knave,</hi> is one that hath <hi>Grace,</hi> which in Heb is <hi>Can ap-pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> But not in his Heart. Or one that can, but will not, be Gracious. Or makes a shew of Good, without an Heart to it, or a will to be so Good, as easily he might, if he would.</p>
            <p>Especially, when I plainly see Christ founding his Calls and Invitations of the Gospel, on this very Botom and Foundation: That he hath <hi>All Power, given him by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and All things.</hi> So in Saint Matthew, <hi>All things are delivered to me of my Father; Come unto me, All ye that Labour and are heavy Laden; I will givey ou Rest. Come Learn of me, for I am Meek and Lowly,</hi> (even as Good in Heart, as in Head, or Arm, or any Power whatever;) <hi>And you shall find Rest, to your Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, at his Resurrection, and before his Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>All Power is Given me, both in Heaven and Earth; Therefore go Preach.</hi> Do not fight, or force; though I have All Power; and you shall have it also, <hi>for I will be with you to the end of the World:</hi> And therefore Preach.</p>
            <p>And so also, before, he Cured a Poor Man, that was borne by others, and had no Tongue or Heart, that we
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51941:56"/>
read, to speak for himself; Or it may be, Faith to believe, or expect it; for it is said, <hi>Christ seeing Their Faith;</hi> not His, but <hi>Theirs;</hi> he said, <hi>Son, be of Good Chear, Thy sins be forgiven thee:</hi> and moved with Compassion also, Healed him (as divers also, that were onely in his Sight, though they said nothing for themselves; and he never denyed any, for themselves or others:) and This was, That he might shew, <hi>the Son of man had Power,</hi> even power on Earth also, <hi>to forgive sins.</hi> And hath he lesse Power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Or lesse Heart to use it? Seeing <hi>he is Exalted, and set at the Right Hand of God</hi> (and so hath Power over all his handy Works) and <hi>made a Prince and Saviour,</hi> for this very end, and purpose, <hi>that he may Give Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins:</hi> to All that Ask and Wrestle for it: as the Seed of true Seekers, and that Brood of Travelers, as <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi> who by seeking so, and wrestling, did become a Prince with God: and Thence was called <hi>Israel.</hi> And the Lord delighteth to call himself <hi>The God of Israel.</hi> Though it might make him blush (more then any Name, or all the Names in all the Bible:) were not his Heart, rather better, then his Strength and Power was. For, every time he calls himself <hi>the God of Israel,</hi> he remembers How a Poor, Weak, Frail, Halting Man, Overcame him, at his own Weapons. For he set upon him, and was overcome; and could not go, (he would not let him go) <hi>till he had Blessed him.</hi>

            <p>He appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> by the Name <hi>Elshaddai, God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;</hi> (and <hi>Abrahams</hi> believing but This Power, was <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for Righteousnesse:)</hi> But afterwards by the Name <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> which speaketh his <hi>Will</hi> also: And <hi>I will be, what I will be,</hi> or what I can be. As the Words are; and not as some read them, <hi>I am what I am;</hi> which the lowest Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be said to be.</p>
            <p>And at the Close of the <hi>Baptists</hi> Testimony of Christ, in the third of <hi>John,</hi> This is made the very Ground work of our Faith, and Hope in Christ, and coming to him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>the Father hath loved him, and given All things into his hand.</hi> And so doth himself also make it, several times, in That very Gospel. <hi>For, the Father Loveth the Son, and sheweth him, all he doth; and will shew him greater things</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:51941:57"/>
               <hi>then these, that you may Marvel; For, as the Father quickens the dead, even so the Son quickeneth whom he will: For, the Father judgeth no man, but hath commited all judgement to the Son, that all men should Honour the Son, even as they Honour the Father. For, as the Father hath Life in himself, so hath he given the Son also, to have Life in himself, and hath given him Authority to execute Judgement also, because he is the Son of Man.</hi> And again, <hi>the Hour is come that the Son of Man should be Glorisied; But, as a Corn of Wheat, he must first die</hi> (that so he may be made a <hi>quickening Spirit;)</hi> and <hi>then he shall bring forth much Fruit;</hi> (for he will not die as a <hi>Fool dyeth;</hi> But will improve his death to the utmost, and do as much good as he Can; and will Work while he may VVork; Least the Night come, and then he cannot VVork. He will therefore do, what is in his <hi>Hand,</hi> and <hi>Power to do,</hi> and will do it, <hi>with all his Might:</hi> Remembering him that said, <hi>withhold not thy hand, while it is in thy Power to Work; Say not to thy Neighbour goe and come again to Morrow; When it is now in thy Power to do him Good.)</hi> And <hi>now shall the Prince of this World be cast out; And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw All men unto me: and Him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me, will I in no wise (I will not, I will not) cast him off, or cast him out: But walk while you have the Light, least Darknesse come upon you.</hi> These things he spake, <hi>and did Hide himself from them.</hi> But he came, and <hi>Cryed again, He that seeth me, seeth him that sent me: I am come a Light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World</hi> (and he lighteth <hi>every one that cometh into the World) that whosoever believeth, should not abide in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. If any Man hear my Words and believe not, I judge him not, for I came not to judge the World, but to Save the World:</hi> and <hi>these things</hi> I say, <hi>that you might be Saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, <hi>Jesus knowing that the</hi> Father <hi>had given All things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; he riseth from Supper, and took a Towel, and gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himself, and washed his Disciples feet:</hi> (O see his Heart, when he hath <hi>Power;</hi> for, all this is) <hi>because the</hi> Father <hi>had given, All things, into His Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when <hi>Judas</hi> was gone out, immediately after the Sop (though St <hi>Luke</hi> seem to make him present at the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:51941:57"/>
and one of the twelve, of whom, or to whom, he spake of <hi>twelve Thrones, and Judging the twelve Tribes of</hi> Israel) he saith, <hi>Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him: and if God be glorified in him, God shall also glorifie him, in himself, and shall straightway glorifie him.</hi> And shall not All bow to him, and to the Glory of God also? <hi>And if God be glorified in them, God will glorifie them with himself:</hi> or where is the stress of our Saviors Argument?</p>
            <p>And again, <hi>It is expedient, that I go; for else the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will not come; and when he comes, he shall convince the World, of sin.</hi> For, <hi>so God loved the World, that he sent his Son, not to condemn, the world, or Judg it, but to save the world:</hi> by That which <hi>he will give for the Life of the World.</hi> And again, <hi>which he shall give unto you: for, Him hath God the Father sealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, <hi>I have many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now. Howbeit when the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth; for, he shall glorifie me, and shall receive of mine, and shew it unto you. All things that the Father hath, are mine: therefore I said, that he shall take of mine, and shew It unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, <hi>Father, Glorifie thy Son, that thy Son also may glorifie Thee,</hi> (a Good Comment on the Lords Prayer: for who can first <hi>give to God, that it may be given? or can lend, that it may be paid again?) As thou hast given him Power, over All flesh, that he should,—</hi>not onely may, but <hi>should give Eternal Life, to as many, as thou hast given him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, if That be not yet plain enough before; in That very chapter he repeats it again; saying, <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; For they are Thine. And all Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine, and I am glorified in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And his saying here, <hi>I pray not for the world;</hi> stands as much alone, without a Fellow, or any like it, as most words in all the Bible. And how can we build any great matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> upon That which hath not two or three Witnesses to confirm it? Yet if it were said, <hi>I Will not pray for the world:</hi> Is it more, or more obliging, or conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, than That in <hi>Hosea? Call her</hi> Lo-ruhamah; <hi>I will no more have mercy upon the House of</hi> Israel; <hi>and I will not have</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:51941:58"/>
               <hi>mercy on her children; and I will not be their God.</hi> And yet he did <hi>turn again, and had pity on them, because he delighted in Mercy: and where it was said, You are not my People, There it shall be said, You are the Sons of the Living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So also, <hi>Thy Name shall be no more called</hi> Jaacob, <hi>but</hi> Israel. And yet God himself often called him <hi>Jaacob,</hi> after This.</p>
            <p>So also, <hi>I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice.</hi> And <hi>I did not command your Fathers, or speak to them, concerning Sacrifice.</hi> And in the same Prophet, <hi>They shall teach no more, saying, Know the Lord.</hi> And <hi>You murmur not against us, but God.</hi> And <hi>they have not rejected Thee, but</hi> Me. As in the Gospel: <hi>I came not to Judg the world; nor will I Judg you.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, I do not, or <hi>I will not, call you Servants.</hi> And, <hi>You shall ask me Nothing.</hi> And <hi>when thou makest a Feast, Thou shalt not invite thy Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all which, and divers other places, sure we do not believe any absolute Negative, but Comparative: Or at least not so definitive, but such as may be reversed.</p>
            <p>And why should that saying, <hi>I will not Pray for the world</hi> (if he had said so) oblige Christ more, than That, <hi>I will not be your God,</hi> or <hi>I will not shew you mercy?</hi> Or, <hi>Thou shalt Die, and thou shalt not Live?</hi> as it was said to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and yet he did not Die, but Live. Or that to <hi>Samuel</hi> or <hi>Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah; Thou shalt not Pray for This man, or This people?</hi> Which yet, it may be, made them Pray More than they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and so perhaps was One good means to recover them that else might have been so irrecoverable. And so This very saying of Christ, (if he had so said) <hi>I will not Pray for the world,</hi> might have been a great means to save the World, and to recover them, by convincing them of their forlorn and desperate estate.</p>
            <p>For, This may be one great End of the heaviest Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in the Scripture, not only <hi>to shut men under fear and guilt</hi> (that so they may be fitter Objects of Pity and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;) but to <hi>Convince them also,</hi> that they may be in a way for mercy. It being the great Art of the Holy Ghost, to work along with the Word, sutable to the Subject, and Object it hath, to work upon. And in a sharp Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it is as <hi>Vinegar,</hi> or <hi>burnt Allum,</hi> or some <hi>Corrasive</hi> to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51941:58"/>
putrid flesh, that must be taken off.</p>
            <p>And How will a poor Soul Tremble under This, That Christ, who is Love it self, should once say, <hi>I will not Pray for you.</hi> As every one is ready to apply it to himself, while under the Convincing Work of the Spirit: which is promised <hi>to Convince the world</hi> also, <hi>of sin, and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he doth not say, <hi>I Will not Pray for the world:</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>I Do not.</hi> Just perhaps as in the Chapter before, he said to his own Disciples, <hi>I do not say, I will pray for you: for, the Father himself loveth you. And in That day you shall ask me Nothing.</hi> And hitherto you have asked <hi>Nothing.</hi> Which are Negatives comparative, not absolute.</p>
            <p>And why not This also, I <hi>do not pray,</hi> only, or mainly, and chiefly, <hi>for the world; but for Those thou hast given me, out of the world.</hi> And it may be, Christ finds enough upon him, <hi>as a Man,</hi> (and so only he <hi>Prayes) to mind his Elect,</hi> and care for Them: Though God (and He also as God) Loveth the <hi>world also (and the Peoples,</hi> in distinction from <hi>Israel,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> expresseth it.) Yea, and He was given al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, for the <hi>world;</hi> and sent to <hi>bear away the sins of the world; and not to condemn, but save the world; and to be a Propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the sins of the world.</hi> As we read (with many such passages) in This very Apostle, who records This Prayer.</p>
            <p>And if we take the words asstrictly as we may, being only in the Present Tence, <hi>I do not yet Pray for the world:</hi> We know not how soon, he yet might pray, for the <hi>world</hi> also: Though he Now did not.</p>
            <p>Seeing in this very Prayer, towards the end, he prayed for others, Many others, then he Now Prayed for, at the beginning of it. And I know not but the <hi>VVorld,</hi> might Then, come in also; if I should grant it did not Now.</p>
            <p>Epecially seeing, One great End of all he asked, for his Disciples also, and for all others, was, that the <hi>World may come to know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the beginning of this very Prayer, Christ shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that it is <hi>Eternal Life to know God, and Him whom God</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:51941:59"/>
               <hi>had sent.</hi> And by this, he proved that his Disciples knew the Name of God, and kept his Word, because they now believed that <hi>God sent him, and knew surely that he was come out from God.</hi> And yet in the latter end of this Prayer, he beggeth so, and so, for His, and all that should believe; <hi>that the</hi> whol World also, <hi>might come to know, that God had sent him, and had loved them, as he loved him.</hi> Which may be added to That we noted in the chap. before; <hi>VVhen the Comforter shall come to You, he shall Convince the VVorld also, of sin, and of Righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet (as himself, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> also said) the World, as the World; and the Carnal man, as Carnal; <hi>did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> conceive, or understand the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or the things thereof. So, in a safe sence also, we may say, Christ did not Then Pray for the World; that, As the World, they might be saved, or be Happy, while they remained Such. But that they might be changed, and called out of the World, and so <hi>Turned from Darkness to Light, from the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Satan unto God:</hi> and then might also <hi>receive an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, among them that are sanctified, through Faith in Christ.</hi> Which was the sum of This Prayer, it may be, and the great Commission, given by our Lord himself, when he sent <hi>Paul</hi> to the Gentiles: and made him a Minister, and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or <hi>Martyr</hi> also; to the whole World.</p>
            <p>And He gives us This Sum of the Gospel he was to preach, <hi>That God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself,</hi> and <hi>Not imputing their sins.</hi> And the Mystery of Godliness; <hi>God manifest in the Flesh, and believed on by the VVorld.</hi> And if any take the <hi>VVorld</hi> here for the <hi>Systeme of Elements,</hi> and not for Men of the World; I may say, Christ also might mean only the Worldly Systeme: which he prayed not for, but for all men of the world, and in the world. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places saith (and that also in the Spirit, or person of Christ; whom we found before, as <hi>Ezekiel (the strong God, and yet the Son of Man)</hi> to be the great Watcher and Warner for every man: and as <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> bid to order <hi>a Sacrifice for every one that erreth, and is simple:)</hi> he was <hi>Warning every man, and Teaching every man, in all</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:51941:59"/>
               <hi>Wisdom, that we may present every man, perfect in Christ Jesus.</hi> And he bids us <hi>Love All men;</hi> and prayes they might <hi>Love All men, even as He loved them.</hi> Yea, and we are bid to <hi>Honour All men.</hi> For, <hi>Man is the Image, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God.</hi> And, directly against the sence which some suppose in Christs words <hi>(I pray not for the World, but for These:)</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>first of all,</hi> That <hi>Prayers, Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Supplications,</hi> yea and <hi>giving of Thanks</hi> also, <hi>be made for All men.</hi> Which he saith, is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>acceptable, in the sight of God, our Saviour.</hi> Who <hi>Will</hi> (directly <hi>Will) have All men,</hi> All men, <hi>to be saved; and to come unto the knowledg of the Truth. For, there is One God, and One Mediator, between God, and Men,</hi> (All Man-kind) <hi>the Man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a Ransom for All,</hi> (for, he is the <hi>Propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole World:) to be testified, or witnessed,</hi> or manifest, <hi>in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> or its <hi>proper seasons.</hi> For, it is plural, in the Original; expressing divers, several, and proper seasons: for the manifestation of That Truth, to the World. Of which we may speak again, in <hi>Times and Seasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet also, in a True and safe sence, we may say, Christ loveth not the <hi>World, as the World;</hi> nor prayeth for the World, as such. No more than a Man ought to love or cherish his Flesh, as such. But only in order to change it, and make it New. And this indeed seems one of the most proper sences of Gods <hi>Hating</hi> any. Which in Hebrew is expressed by a word so neer That which is to <hi>Change;</hi> as if Hating were but in order to a <hi>Change:</hi> which is also very neer the sound of the words that in Hebrew signifie both to <hi>Change,</hi> and to <hi>Hate.</hi> And as <hi>Sone,</hi> comes from their <hi>Sana</hi> to Hate (as we touched before;) So doth <hi>Sin</hi> which is <hi>Hate</hi> or <hi>Shun.</hi> And That which <hi>English Saxons</hi> (whose Language is much Hebrew) do call <hi>Sin,</hi> is in Gods Language <hi>Hatred.</hi> For, he hateth Nothing but <hi>Sin.</hi> And the Eng <hi>Sin,</hi> is in Heb <hi>Hate,</hi> or <hi>Chate,</hi> or <hi>Hhate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that God Hateth Nothing but Sin. And no person but (as Sinful, and so) in Order to <hi>Changing</hi> of him. As we see in his own Covenant? His <hi>First Covenant</hi> (and so his First Creation, and the <hi>First born</hi> in all Dispensations)
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51941:60"/>
must give place to a <hi>Second,</hi> which is Better. And the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der must still serve the Younger:</hi> or give place to it. God will still shew himself Better and Better: and so will ever to All Eternity. <hi>And finding fault with his first</hi> Expressions or Manifestations, <hi>he Disanuls</hi> and rejects, or Hates and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates them, in order to change them, and make them Better. VVhich he is still Doing. For, what he doth once, he doth ever. And the VVheel still goeth round, as we find in the 90. <hi>Psalm,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> in divers places; to be compared with that of our Saviour, (so often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,) <hi>They that are First shall be Last, and the last first. And behold I make All things New.</hi> As in the beginning, so it shall be ever.</p>
            <p>I may add also, That in divers Scriptures, we may find <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hate,</hi> to be but relative Terms, or comparative.</p>
            <p>God as God, Loveth Himself only, with an Absolute Love: and Hateth nothing but sin, with absolute Hatred. But among Creatures, He Loveth One before another, as it cometh neerer to himself, and his own Image: So he prefers it before another, which he hateth, in comparison.</p>
            <p>So, <hi>Leah</hi> was <hi>Hated,</hi> that is, <hi>Less loved than</hi> Rachel, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before <hi>Leah;</hi> who was loved also, but below <hi>Rachel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in such a sence God speaketh, <hi>If a man have two Wives, the one Loved, and the other Hated;</hi> that is, less Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For else sure, God would never countenance any mans <hi>Hating</hi> his VVife. But only, as he doth a mans Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his own flesh, in order to change it, and prefer som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what before it.</p>
            <p>And so Christ telleth us that no man can be His Disciple, except he <hi>Hate his Father, Mother, Brother, Sister, Wife and self.</hi> Whom yet he never should, or could Hate, if he be His Disciple; and be moulded into Love. But his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, (as we find in another Evangelist) <hi>Except he prefer Christ, and so Love Him, before All Those:</hi> Which therefore in Scripture Language, are All said, to be Hated; in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of Christ.</p>
            <p>And why may not <hi>Jacob</hi> the Younger, be Thus Loved, that is, preferred before <hi>Esau?</hi> who in This sence is <hi>Hated,</hi> and <hi>rejected,</hi> that is, set behind, his younger Brother.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51941:60"/>
But however These may be used, or looked upon, as Types of the <hi>Elect and Reprobate:</hi> we cannot from Thence deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Final Reprobation (as the Schools express it) in the person of either. Though the Scripture give us very sad Characters of <hi>Esau,</hi> calling him a <hi>Profane Person:</hi> yet I know not that it ever shews him to be Eternally Reprobate. That Repentance which is spoken of in the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> being his Fathers, (and not his own, but) the changing of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mind towards him: which he could not obtain, though he sought it with Tears. But yet his Father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Blessed him: and though he must serve his younger Brother, it was but for a season, till he could break his yoak, as we shall see anon. And This also, but as general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all the Dispensations of God, out to the World, the Elder (as we may commonly see, in most, or All the Elder Sons named in the Bible) or the first, must give place to the Second. Even the first Covenant it self, must be rejected and disanulled, and judged Faulty also (that is, Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate) in order to a <hi>Second,</hi> Better, and more Gracious.</p>
            <p>So it was said, <hi>The Elder shall serve the Younger.</hi> And Christ himself came <hi>to Serve, and to Minister, and not to be Ministred unto.</hi> As it is said, <hi>Joseph</hi> in Prison, was Trusted with the Care or Government, of all the Prisoners; and set to <hi>serve them:</hi> As indeed a Governor is a great Servant, to his Servants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As it is written,</hi> Jacob <hi>have I Loved,</hi> (is it indeed an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, rather than affirmation?) <hi>But</hi> Esau <hi>have I hated.</hi> But How <hi>Hated?</hi> The very next words of the Prophet, who is cited by the Apostle, shew us that This Hating was some frowning of Gods Face, (as we may say) but not of his Heart: and but upon the outward Man, or Estate of <hi>Esau;</hi> whom he therefore saith he Hated, because he laid his <hi>Mountains and his Heritage waste, for the Dragons of the Wilderness.</hi> But may, or can, any man know, or judg of True Real <hi>Love or Hatred</hi> (especially That which is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal) <hi>by All that is without, or before him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is there not much worse, spoken of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> (in that very Prophet) than of <hi>Esau?</hi> Doth not the same <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy,</hi> say of <hi>Israel, VVill the Lord regard your persons?</hi> Even
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51941:61"/>
your persons? And no wonder then his Soul abhors their Sacrifice. Which yet is one of the worst things that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> observes of a wicked man: But How frequent in the Prophets against <hi>Israel?</hi> And in <hi>Jeremy</hi> 12. we see, How God <hi>Forsook and Hated, the deerly beloved of his soul.</hi> As an Emblem of Christ himself (so <hi>forsaken, Hated, cursed,</hi> and <hi>Rejected</hi> by God;) or of all the <hi>Elect,</hi> who once were (as <hi>Paul,</hi> to the <hi>Fphesians)</hi> children of <hi>VVrath,</hi> or <hi>curse, as well, or much, as Any others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the same <hi>Malachy</hi> doth not only observe the Jews so <hi>neglected and rejected,</hi> but Cursed also, by God himself: several times. Yea, and that, the Lord would also, <hi>curse their very Blessings: Yea, and had cursed them already.</hi> One of the heaviest, or worst, Curses in the Bible.</p>
            <p>And This is for Spiritual Adultery, and <hi>Judahs marrying the Daughter of a strange god.</hi> As <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. <hi>Judah leaving his Brethren</hi> (for, <hi>it is not good for man to be alone;) Turned in, to a Canaanite:</hi> who bore <hi>Er and Onan: so wicked, that the Lord slew them.</hi> Which is also in <hi>Malachy;</hi> though lost by reading it; <hi>Therefore will the Lord cut off the Master and the Teacher,</hi> which in Heb is, <hi>Er and Oneh.</hi> And the Scripture seems often to allude to <hi>Tamar</hi> also, at the end of that History (Mother of All <hi>Judahs</hi> Posterity:) As the Church (or every Christian) waiting for Christ (that <hi>Shilo,</hi> or <hi>Shela)</hi> till <hi>with child by his Father also; leaving his Signet and Bracelets,</hi> which save her at the fiery Judgment. But we translate <hi>Tamar</hi> the <hi>Palm tree,</hi> which it also signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies: as That, <hi>which Riseth, by Pressing down:</hi> and was used at the Feast of Tabernacles: and yet also, by the Jews, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their <hi>Palms,</hi> Thrice every way, crying, <hi>Hosanna, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanna!</hi> As their Fathers did to Christ, spreading Palm branches, as we read in the Gospel.</p>
            <p>But how Hated, and Cursed Things and Persons may be Loved and Blessed; <hi>as changed, by Him that is not changed;</hi> as we read in the same Prophet (to which also St. <hi>James</hi> alludeth) who also telleth us, <hi>We are All begotten by One Father:</hi> and that <hi>He hateth putting away</hi> (in himself also, I hope,) more than any person: We must speak anon.</p>

When I consider the solemn engagement of God to his Son; <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee all Nations, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ends of the Earth;</hi> or in the Gospel-words, <hi>Ask and thou shalt receive, seek and thou shalt finde, knock and it shall be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> (which was first said to Christ, before he said it unto us; and he saith it to every one, and with that also, Because it is <hi>so to every one,</hi> therefore so to you, or them that then heard him:) I have often thought it such a ground of Faith and Hope, that instead of doubting whether I was given to him, or not; I have often pressed it on him: Ask me, that thou mayst receive me, seek me, and thou shalt finde me; and by vertue of the Covenant, my hard heart also, shall be opened to thee, if thou wilt knock heartily. Now thou saist, thou <hi>standest at the door and knockest;</hi> O but do it heartily, which is the great Law of All <hi>Servants,</hi> and thou art the Lords <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> and so called, through the Prophets, Gospel, all the Bible; <hi>And the Lords servant must be gentle towards all, even to them which oppose themselves</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I have also judged it an unworthy thought of God, to think he would so solemnly bid him, <hi>ask</hi> what he would, and whom he would, and then to tye his tongue, or narrow his heart, so as he durst not, or he would not, ask as many as he could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose or manage.</p>
            <p>And to put it out of doubt, I see him very solicitous to perswade and assure us, that the Father hath so far preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all his asking, or our fears &amp; doubts, that he hath given him all Things, all Persons, all Power, in Heaven and Earth. And on this Rock he grounds his Calls, and all our Faith and Hope, and coming to him.</p>
            <p>For we must needs have staggered at all his words and promises, till with <hi>Abraham,</hi> we were fully perswaded, that he <hi>was able to perform what ever he promised; and this was imputed to him for Righteousness, and not unto him only, but unto us also it shall be imputed;</hi> (a strange expression to the Gentile Romans,) <hi>If we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our Justification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We erre greatly, not knowing the Scriptures, and the mighty Power of Christ; which if we knew, we should not</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:51941:62"/>
               <hi>dispute his will,</hi> but rowle our selves upon it, (as we daily pray) and say <hi>Lord if thou wilt, thou canst make us whole and cleane.</hi> The God whom we worship, is able to deliver us out of this Pit, and fiery Furnace (was it not a great mystery?) But however, we will not worship the Golden Image of the Beast, or him that was, or is to be a Beast, and to eate grass as an Oxe; nor will we receive his character, or name or number of it; though set up in the plain of <hi>Dura,</hi> (every Generation of this World) made up of 6. in bredth, and 60. in height, 666 was also the number of Talents of Gold brought year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto <hi>Solomon.</hi> But of this again in our discourse of times and numbers, weights and measures.</p>
            <p>And when our Saviour himself came to dye, and all the Scripture was against him that he could not live, yet he was not afraid to put himself upon the infinite Power of God; with <hi>Father, if it be be possible, and all things are possible.</hi> The Angel to the Virgin said, <hi>all things shall be possible with God,</hi> and Christ several times, <hi>with God all things are possible:</hi> and at his coming down from the Mount (an embleme of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming) he addeth, all things are possible to him also, (even to a poor weeping man) that believeth. All things are possible to thee O Father, and to mealso, (they shall be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:) But not my will, but thine be done on Earth, and my Earth also, as in thy highest Heavenly Throne, which shall also be my Throne. And Father, I will that those which thou hast given me (to whom thou hast given all things) may be with me, and see my Glory, and sit on my throne also.</p>
            <p>And <hi>his Throne is established with Mercy,</hi> as we read in the Prophet <hi>Isa.</hi> Yea, rather with <hi>Mercy</hi> than <hi>Truth,</hi> or any other thing; for so the Proverbs say, <hi>Mercy and Truth preserve the King, but his Throne is established with Mercy.</hi> So that if he cannot hold both, he must let go <hi>Truth,</hi> and all Justice, rather than <hi>Mercy:</hi> For <hi>Mercy shall triumph over all Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and in Judgement, he still will, still doth, remember Mercy: And <hi>he that sheweth not mercy,</hi> in all things, and all times, <hi>shall have no mercy shewed him;</hi> and himself bid them <hi>go learn what that meant, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice;</hi> or mercy rather than any sacrifice. <hi>He hath shewed thee O man,</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:51941:62"/>
               <hi>what is good, and what the Lord delighteth in, to do Justice,</hi> but (especially,) <hi>to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God. Ride on prosperously, because of Truth, and Meekness of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness:</hi> and seeing God accepteth mercy rather than any other sacrifice; let him guide thee also, in the way he shall chose and best accept, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaketh.</p>
            <p>I will therefore sing of the mercies of the Lord for ever, for I have said, mercy shall be built up for ever, <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> shall go before thy face. O blessed are the people that know that joyfull sound (and understand it:) They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance, in thy name they shall rejoyce all the day, (for they that know thy name, will trust in it) and in thy very Justice, they shall be exalted. <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> are met together, Righteousness and Peace do kiss each other. <hi>Melchizedek</hi> (the King of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness) is also King of <hi>Salem,</hi> that is, Peace: and his Throne of Judgement, (in the Revelation) is a white Throne, and is established with mercy. <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> Even that <hi>Mercy which is Over all his works, and his compassions never fall.</hi> And <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> saith, <hi>he that honoureth his Maker, hath Mercy on the Poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He shall hear the Poor when he cryeth, and him that hath no Helper</hi> (no Helper!) <hi>He shall save their souls, and shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them from deceipt and violence;</hi> (or as this Psalm is expressed in <hi>Ezechiel; He shall offer sacrifice for every one that erreth and is simple.) Precious in his eyes shall be their Bloud,</hi> and yet more precious their souls, which himself said, was so exceeding precious, as not to be compared with the World; must it only be precious in our own eyes, and shall it not be so in his also? Let us then bowe down to him, as the third Captain of 50. did to <hi>Elijah,</hi> saying, <hi>Let my soul be precious in thine eyes, and the soules of thy servants;</hi> for so the words are in the original.</p>
            <p>And himself summed up all the Law into Love, adding also that it was a little love to love a friend, or one that was lovely, or like us, fair and beautifull, kind and thankfull; <hi>even sinners and Hypocrites do so;</hi> but I say unto you, <hi>love your enemies, and them that hate you,</hi> pray for them that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51941:63"/>
you, revile you, blaspheme and offer all despite to you. Blesse them that curse you, yea, blesse and curse not, be ever blessing and never cursing. In a word, <hi>Be mercifull as your Heavenly Father is mercifull;</hi> and then addeth, <hi>Judge not, that you be not judged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is the more to be marked, because himself so often intimates, that although the Father hath committed <hi>all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him,</hi> and authority to execute it also, (as we shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) yet that he neither came to <hi>judge the world, nor will</hi> judge it, or any man, it may be in his own person; but will commit it to his Children, who shall <hi>judge the world and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells also:</hi> and then the Son of man shall sit on the Throne of his Glory, to seperate those that are judged.</p>
            <p>And there also, none are condemned, but those that justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themselves; for if we could, or would <hi>Judge our selves, we should not be judged.</hi> Yet even then also, we are judged by the Son of man, <hi>For we must all stand before his judgement seat,</hi> who yet loved our nation, and our nature, and was made our Advocate, and under the same Law with us: The same <hi>Law of Love.</hi> And did any man ever <hi>Hate his own flesh?</hi> though he may chasten it, and keep it in subjection, <hi>Plucking it under the eyes.</hi> as some render the Apostles phrase.</p>
            <p>Or if he could <hi>hate his own flesh,</hi> will he not <hi>love his own Spirit,</hi> and his owm Image? Will not That love seek to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate it all he may? he hath received the Spirit without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: He is infinitely full of that (as <hi>Elihu</hi> speaks) which is as <hi>New Wine,</hi> yea, as <hi>Fire in his bones and heart,</hi> which as the Spring in the watch, is ever clicking, and the cause of all the beating in the Arteries, and all the Pulses, and it must have vent, he cannot hold it in.</p>
            <p>So it hath now pleased <hi>infinite Wisdome and Goodnesse</hi> to screw it selfe into the finite heart of Christ in his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, so that he cannot hold it in, or stifle it if he would, as that which is infinite might have done, and so swallowed it up, as that we might never have seene, or felt, or any way enjoyed it.</p>
            <p>But <hi>infinite</hi> is now so <hi>riveted</hi> into finite, that this finite cannot comprehend it, or detain it if he would: He cannot detain it in <hi>unrighteousnesse;</hi> not so much as he may the wind in his hand,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51941:63"/>
or all the great Ocean in his bowels. So that if his eye were evil, or his heart hard and narrow, when he seems so kindly to invite, and call and woo us to his dainties: which the Scripture yet forbids us once to tast from an evil eye, or from one that cryeth eat and drink, but his heart is not with us, which the soul of God abhors: Yet indeed if Christ do but love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his own Spirit, and his own ease, he still will, and still must, give out freely, having received that which is too great and strong for him to hold in, and keep down, if he would, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an infinite Fountain still flowing up, and still flowing out with Rivers of living water round about him.</p>
            <p>So it is in all that do but receive some little drops of it from him: How much more, is it so in himself, that hath it without such bounds and limits? O how is he straitned (tis his own expression) till he poure out himself and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit among us. It cannot be taken from him against his will, and yet it cannot be held in: but is as an Ointment or a sweet perfume in ones hand, the more it is pressed and heated, the more it flows out and sends forth it's sweet Odours. <hi>And she came behind him saying, If I can but touch him, or so much as the hemme of his Garment, I shall be healed:</hi> and vertue went out at every touch.</p>
            <p>As the sweet perfume and precious Ointment on the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers head, it drencht his Beard, even <hi>Aaron</hi>'s beard (which yet was but an Excrement, and to be cut off with every Sissors) and it ran down through all his Garments, and to every hemm and Fringe of them, although to be changed and laid off, very many times, besides every nights rest.</p>
            <p>And the Laver of old in the Tabernacle, had no cover; how much lesse the great Molten Sea in the Temple? which had such a Fountain or Fountains still flowing up in it, or into it, as the very words in the Hebrew may teach us.</p>
            <p>Have you not seen a tender Mothers breast so full and swel'd for want of sucking, that she hath been glad of a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Child to draw it, when her own could not, or would not? So, and much more is it with the full breast of Jesus Christ; which is such an infinite Fountain, that the more it gives, the more it may. <hi>And if thou knewst the gift of God, and who it is that giveth, thou wouldst ask, and ask again,</hi> and never
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51941:64"/>
give over asking (as we found before in <hi>Acksa,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) till he filleth thee also <hi>with the upper and the lower springs. Rejoyce yee then and be glad with him, all yee that love him, rejoyce with him all yee that mourned after him, that you may suck and be satisfied with those breasts of Consolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And a drop that runneth over (for he hath enough for his Children, Servants, Strangers, Cattle, all his Creatures,:) every drop hath power enough to make us hunger and thirst, and long for more, till it may stretch out our narrow hearts and make them <hi>as</hi> wide as the very Heavens.</p>

            <p>And for more clear expressing his own mind and heart, and will, for doing good, according to his Power, (which is still the measure of goodnesse also:) He hath not only promised to receive All that come to him; and by <hi>no means, no means, to cast them off, or out; but also to draw All men to him, and to make All things new;</hi> being (as the Psalms expresse) not only to <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the desire of every living thing,</hi> which is no great matter, except also they have great and good desires (for else I know not ought I feare, or more oppose, or pray against, then his giving me the desire of my own foolish narrow heart,) but also, that he <hi>shall give forth Good, and goodnesse so,</hi> that all things shall be filled with it: As we may find by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the 85. <hi>Psalm</hi> (concluding thus; <hi>Yea the Lord shall give forth Good,</hi> or goodnesse, <hi>and Righteousnesse shall go before him, and direct or set us in the way of his steps)</hi> with the 104. and 145. <hi>Psal.</hi> which of all is to be marked most, as that which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth name to all the Book of Psalms, (as the <hi>Jews</hi> tell us) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thence All called Praises, or Songs of blessing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger, and of great mercy: the Lord is good to All, and his tender mercies are over All his works. All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord, and thy Sainis shall bless thee. The Lord upholdeth All that fall</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:51941:64"/>
               <hi>and raiseth up all that are bowed down.</hi> which is again so repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and enlarged in the next Psalm also, that it may teach us how Christ put himself under that Law also, <hi>to mourn with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that mourneth, and to weep with every one that weepeth;</hi> yea, and to make us sensible of our own wants and emptinesse, that so he may fill us: being sent to <hi>comfort every one that mourneth, and to replenish every empty soul. At this I awaked, and my sleep was sweet to me,</hi> as the Prophet expresseth it.</p>
            <p>Yea, and Christ is such an <hi>Head to every man,</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth) and such a Root to all our soules and Spirits, that our mourning and our sufferings reach and pierce his soul also: And in all our afflictions, he is afflicted: For <hi>if any one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber suffers, all suffer</hi> (but especially the head and heart:) <hi>and if one be honoured, all rejoyce with it.</hi>

            <p>May we not all say to our Saviour as <hi>Abigail</hi> did to <hi>David?</hi> When my Lord shall sit on the throne of his Rest, and when the Lord hath done to my Lord according to all he promised, shall it indeed be any offence or <hi>grief of heart to my Lord, that he spared us and did not shed our blood, or avenge himself</hi> (which is so much forbidden) <hi>or reserve a grudge in his heart against the Children of his people?</hi> When he shall see us all come bowing to him, to his glory, and his Fathers glory also: who is glorified (he saith) when we bear much fruit, And is not he so also, <hi>When He beareth much?</hi> And as much as he can.</p>
            <p>If he could have been contented to be happy, glorious all alone, he never needed any world of men or Angels. But O! how was he straitned in himself, till he had found a means to multiply himself, his Image, Happinesse, and Glory, by Creation? How much more than by Redemption? while we live, we shall praise him; and shall ever bless him, if he

            <p>And what profit is there in our bloud? He did not care to drink the bloud of beasts: doth he now delight in eating mans flesh, and drinking mans bloud? Or what doth he gain by losing us? Can the enemie give a recompense for us? As <hi>Esther</hi> spake of Haman. And if he cut us off, will he not <hi>look in the morning,</hi> and when he <hi>sees our places empty, will he not have desire to the work of his own hands (as</hi> Job <hi>and the</hi> Psalmist) <hi>to that needle work he curiously wrought in his closet.</hi> When he hath ground us to powder, will he not say <hi>return again,</hi> againe, yee sons of men! O that God would perswade us, even in suffering according to his will, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our souls to his keeping, as to a Faithfull Creator.</p>
            <p>Can he be angry more in time, then from eternity, before he made the World, or ought that could provoke him? Or if he can, may little children so provoke him, with their raising dust, or dirty pies against him, that he must also turn, and curse them in the name of God, and give them up to Bears to teare them? will he offer children also, and his own, to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch?</hi> Or with musick drown their yellings in <hi>Gehinnon,</hi> or in <hi>Tophet,</hi> which he so much hates, and threatens, and his soul abhors so much in others?

            <p>Or if he must, for some great reason, act a part awhile, and wear a mask, or frown, and cast abroad his Thunderbolts, and shew the fierceness of his sore displeasure, or the Power of his anger or wrath; can it be shown upon a moath, a bubble, nothing, weaker than nothing? will he also set his eyes, (or heart, or heavy hand,) on that which is not?</p>

As a tender man, (How much more a tender God?) never striketh any, but it even pierceth his own soul or Bowels; and the harder the object is, the more it makes our hand also to ake in striking it: but it is because our hand is hard also.

            <p>
               <hi>But thou art Holy still.</hi> We are yet but in the Porch, and have scarce touched the threshold of his Sufferings; which the old <hi>Greek Liturgy</hi> so rightly tearmed, as well <hi>unknowable,</hi> as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable.</hi> O how he loved us! How great is his goodnesse? How great is his Beauty! which was yet, deformed more then any man, or any Creature. <hi>Surely he hath born our griefs, and carried our sorrows: He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was on him, and by his stripes we are healed: All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all.</hi> I might add also, that sufferings are of such account with God, that though he never promise, ought but sutable, to all our doings; Yet our light afflictions, or sufferings, which are but for a moment, work unto us also [but his shadows], a far more exceeding and eternall weight of glory; with so great <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expressed.</p>
            <p>And because he made his soul an offering for sinne, he did prolong his daies; raised from the dead; and shall see his seed, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand: And therefore he shall divide the spoile with the strong, and have a portion with the mighty. And for suffering of Death, he was Crowned with Honour and Glory; that by the grace of God, he should taste death for every man; For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sonnes unto glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation Perfect through Sufferings: and though he were a Sonne, yet he learned Obedience, by the things he suffered.</p>
            <p>For as it pleased the Lord that <hi>All fulnesse should dwel in him,</hi> so it pleased him also, in bringing in that fulness, into his nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowness, as a man, to put him to sore pain; and thus to make and keep him still quick, or of tender sence, in the Fear of the Lord: which of all he needed most, because he knew, and saw,

and felt, most Love: Which was therefore poyzed with most Holy fear, which kept him still in aw, and made him most ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der also unto others: as we see discoursed in the Epist to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> God would not trust him (or us in his hands) while he was only taughr his fear, or his love, by precept; till he had it also by the deepest experience. And when he put him under the Law <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And to the <hi>Colossions,</hi> having said of Christ, that <hi>it pleased the Father, that in him all fulness should dwell, and having made peace through the blood of his Cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself,</hi> (which afterwards in that very Chapter, and to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> also, he calleth the <hi>Mistery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> to be compared with the 5. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> &amp; many other Scriptures:) He addeth also, that <hi>this Gospell was preached to every Creature under heaven,</hi> (as our Lords commission was;) <hi>Whereof I</hi> Paul <hi>am made a Minister, who now rejoyce in my suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, for you: and fill up that which is behind, of the afflictions or sufferings of Christ in my flesh, for his Bodies sake, which is the Church.</hi> And to <hi>Timothy</hi> he writes; <hi>For the which cause I also suffer these things: Therefore I endure all things, for the Elects sake: (for the Elects sake!) that they may also obtain the Salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with eternall glory.</hi>

            <p>But if Christ neither loved us, nor himself, or valued his own Glory, or his own Sufferings; yet his love to his Father or his very duty to him, though he did not love him, may be found a great foundation of our Faith and Hope in him, and in God through him. And for this, I may not only cite the Scriptures that speak of Gods loving Christ, <hi>because he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, and laid down his life for us;</hi> (One of the sweetest and the strangest sayings in the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ble!) But also as <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>A necessity is laid upon me, and wo to me if I do not preach the Gospell:</hi> Even so our Saviour also, <hi>This Commandement I have received of my Father.</hi> And had he not received it, he
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51941:68"/>
neither would, nor could, have given that Commandement to others, (which he so often presseth and repeateth as his own, his new Commandement, to all his Children, Friends, or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:) that they love one another, as, even as, he loved them, which was to lay down his life for them; and this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement he received of his Father: and solemny professeth, he never said a word, but what, and how, and as, the Father spake it to him; nor did ever do a work but what he saw the Father do, and what he did; as if the Father also, Suffered in him.</p>
            <p>Nor shall we go far to search for this Commandement of God to him, either in that of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> (the son of man) the great Watch man, and the great Warner, at whose hand God would require the soules of all that were under him (who are all men) yea, and at the price, and weight of his own blood: with which he must therefore prepare a sacrifice for every one that erreth, and is simple (as we touched before) to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the 53 of <hi>Esay,</hi> and divers other Scriptures. And the 58 of the same Prophet, sheweth, how it delighteth the soul of God, that Christ should break every yoak, and deal his bread to the hungry, and bring the poore and them that are cast out, or banished, into his own House; &amp; when he doth but see a man, naked (though he weep not, beg not, yet) to cover him, and not to hide himself from his own flesh. If then thou draw out thy soul, thy very soul to the hungry, and satisfie the aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

One of the sweetest promises in all the Bible; and yet sweeter, if we consider it spoken to Christ, before it was to us: and then follow the gracious promises upon the keeping of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, in which also we shall find, our Saviour very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. But the very ten Commandements, and all the Law of God (through all the Bible,) which he took upon him, and was made under it; was written in his heart: and so rivetted in, that he can unmake himself again, as soon as leave, or lose, one tittle of that Wise, and Just, and Holy Law of God; which is all yet, one Royall Law of Love. Did not himself summe it all up into Love? <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and soul, and mind, and might;</hi> and there is another word of <hi>Love,</hi> yet like to this, a strange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression! <hi>like to this,</hi> or as good as this, or as much required

and accepted as this; and of as much stresse, and strength or force, as this: which is, <hi>Thou must love thy Neighbour also, as thou lovest thy self.</hi> Yea, and this is not only as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, of loving God, but rather before i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as if, God would measure all our Love to himself, by our loving our poor Neighbour, St. John saith, <hi>Let a man never talk of loving God whom he never saw, if he do not love his Brother whom he hath seen:</hi> and if he do but <hi>see him in want, and shut up his bowels,</hi> (though his wants be not wept, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out, but only Seen) <hi>How doth the love of God dwell in such a man?</hi> as we found also in <hi>Esay,</hi> when thou Seest the naked, that thou cover him. Which hath sometimes been very sweet to me, when I had no words or tears to expresse my miseries to Christ, or was sensible enough of any of my wants: Yet I have often spoken to him from that place (and others in the Psalmes, or Job, or Lamentations) <hi>Crying, See my affliction,</hi> though I do not see it, or am afflicted for it, as I should or would. Yet do thou See my miseries, Even when I see them not; and let thy tender eye affect thy tender heart, for the Love of God dwelleth in thee. Do not therefore shut up thy bowels, when thou seest my want, though I do not see it, or am not affected with it: Give me Eye salve that I may see: And thou hast promised an holy Spirit to <hi>Convince the world of sinne, Righteousnesse, and Judgement. Withhold not Good whilst it is in the God of thy hand to do it.</hi> Why then wilt thou send me away, saying, <hi>Come again to morrow, when it is in the power of thy hand to do me good?</hi> For thou hast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>But it is yet sweter than many words, or any, can express, to consider, that if Christ did neither love Us, nor Himself, nor his <hi>Father,</hi> as he surely doth: Yet his very Duty to Him, and that Law which bids him <hi>Love the Lord his God, with all his heart, and soul, and minde,</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Is it indeed enough for Him, in himself and his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to have no other God, or other wayes of worship, than are Right, and set by God; and not to bear his Name in vain, (who yet beareth it more upon him, both in words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than all men living:) Except he also propagate this Love of God, his waies of worship, and his Name, his True Name, which is his Nature; all he can, or may (and he may <hi>quicken whom he will)</hi> with all his Might? to all his Children, Servants, Neighbours, Subjects and Relations under him, and in his Povver? and they are All.</p>

For what is there said, <hi>Of Gods shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy unto thousands,</hi> is plainly meant of <hi>Thousand Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:</hi> as appeareth by the opposition <hi>of three or four Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations</hi> (before in the same Commandement:) And in the 7. of <hi>Deutronomy,</hi> it is so expressed</p>
            <p>Know therefore, that the <hi>Lord thy God he is God, the faithful God, Which keepeth Covenant, and Mercy also,</hi> (which is hence remembred by <hi>Daniell</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,) wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h them that love him, and keep his Commandments, even to a Thousand Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Which also plainly sheweth, that the words of the second Commandement, are not to be restrained to those only that actually love God, and walk in his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themselves: But to their Seed also, even to a <hi>Thousand Generations.</hi> And in the name of Goodnesse, proclaimed to <hi>Moses,</hi> this of <hi>Keeping Mercy for Thousands,</hi> is written with a very Great and unusuall Letter, as to intimate some unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible <hi>Greatnesse of Goodnesse,</hi> as the Jews will teach us.</p>
            <p>And those which are not the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> may yet be within the thousand Generations of <hi>Noah;</hi> who was also a <hi>Perfect man in his Generations,</hi> and very dearly beloved, and Blessed by God; who also blessed his Sonns, and made an everlasting Covenant with them. And his mercy is to a <hi>thousand Generations,</hi> yea to <hi>All Generations</hi> (as the Psalmes expresse it) <hi>from everlasting to everlasting, upon them that fear him, and their Childrens Children.</hi> Whereas, on the other side, when he would expresse his great <hi>Jealoufie,</hi> and visiting the <hi>Fathers Iniquity upon their Children,</hi> it is but <hi>for three or</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:51941:71"/>
               <hi>four Generations.</hi> VVhich is so far from such a Threatning, as may be taken by some, that it is very great Goodnesse; That the worst of Gods Visitations here threatned, shall be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>for three or four Generations:</hi> &amp; was so proclaimed by God, when he caused all his <hi>Goodnesse to passe before Moses;</hi> who also repeated this on God, (as a promise) when he interceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Israel</hi> at their making the Calf. which sure he would not have then pressed, if he had not taken it for a great peece of Goodnesse, as it was the last in that great Proclamation, [and God useth to reserve his <hi>Best</hi> for the last.] And when <hi>Moses</hi> heard it, he made hast to worship; as if he had now seen the very worst of God, to be Very Good, and much better then he knew before. Though it was a good Report he had long had of Gods Goodnesse, but not half, or it may be, the thousand part of that which will be known; <hi>When he shall come to be Admired, by All that Beleeve.</hi> Yea and That also, of <hi>Not holding guiltless,</hi> or not <hi>Quitting the Guilty;</hi> speaketh <hi>Goodness</hi> also: and was in his <hi>Name of Goodness,</hi> Proclaimed to <hi>Moses;</hi> and so taken by Him, and repeated and pressed on God, as an argument for Pardoning, and sparing the poore People, when the Calf was made. And God answered, <hi>I have Pardoned according to thy Word: And truly All the earth shall be filled with the Glory of the Lord,</hi> or with the <hi>Salvation of God;</hi> [as we have found by comparing two Psalms toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the 40 of <hi>Esay,</hi> with the <hi>Evangelist</hi> c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing it:] which is a very Sweet and Gracious Promise.</p>
            <p>By which we may clearly see, that the worst of those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, did not mean <hi>Eternall Punishment;</hi> but only such a Visitation for some few Generations, as might very well stand with <hi>Pardoning.</hi> So that the persons so Visited, should not be destroyed [for the Lord visits not to destroy, but to save] but yet Chastened and Corrected in measure, and not wholly left unpunished. As we find the very same Phrase used by God severall times in the Prophets [and twice in <hi>Jeremy;]</hi> of his own dearest Children; whom he saith, he will not <hi>Cut off or destroy;</hi> but only chasten, visit, or <hi>Correct in measure;</hi> but not <hi>Hold Guiltless,</hi> or acquit them wholly. The very same Phrase used in the Third Commandement, and in the Name of God Proclaimed in <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Numbers</hi> 14. And the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51941:71"/>
very same Phrase is used by <hi>Job</hi> of himself, divers times: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we may be sure he did not beleeve. God had cut him off for ever, or would never acquit him, or hold him Guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse; though he so speak of himself. But it is such a phrase as the Prophet <hi>Esays, Therefore forgive them not;</hi> which yet is no worse, or more, then we find commended, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded also, by <hi>Solomon,</hi> to a tender Father: who is bid to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten his Son, and not <hi>to spa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e him,</hi> or <hi>forgive,</hi> or <hi>acquit,</hi> or <hi>Hold him Guiltless.</hi> For they are much the same Phrases.</p>
            <p>Yet I may ad (to make us fear the Goodnesse of God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then All his <hi>Wrath:)</hi> He that taketh the Good <hi>Name of God,</hi> this gracious God, <hi>in vain;</hi> or he that so <hi>Turneth it into wantonness,</hi> is the most guilty Person in All the Bible, that I know; or most in danger, not to be quit, or held <hi>Guiltless;</hi> as we find hinted in severall places, from the third Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Except haply we may also say, the <hi>most Guilty Person</hi> in the World, whom God will least acquit, or hold guiltlesse, is <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> In whom the <hi>Curses</hi> also, <hi>are Yea and Amen,</hi> or fulfilled; rather more then the <hi>Promises.</hi> For in These, he joynes his Children, who are Co-heirs in All the Promises, and Purposes of God.</p>
            <p>But in bearing the Threatnings and Curses; He is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, then in All the Promises. <hi>He treads the Winepress of Gods Wrath alone; and of the People there is none with Him:</hi> He alone can bear it; He alone need fear it. <hi>All the Billows</hi> of the Almighty, <hi>rowled upon Christ; and All his Arrows stuck in his Heart, and drunk up his Spirit,</hi> more then All the world besides. All else, being little, weak, nothing, lighter then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Compared with Him that was <hi>Gods Fellow,</hi> and his Match: <hi>Who thought it no Robbery to be Equall with God;</hi> who therefore laid his stroaks upon H m, who was only able to bear them, with our guilt. So that in a right sence, He is the most guilty Person, as Bearing Gods most Holy Name, more then All the World besides: And bearing all our guilt for bearing at in vain.</p>
            <p>And as the third Commandement hath its <hi>not Acquitting:</hi> So the second hath it's <hi>Jealousie,</hi> and visiting the <hi>Fathers sinn upon the Children.</hi> As if this, were most proper to the false, or Superstitious wayes of Worshipping the true God; rather

then to the having other Gods, forbidden in the first. As if God also were <hi>Jealous</hi> of none, but such as were <hi>Marryed to him,</hi> and had chosen him for their Husband: But now wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred out in strange wayes of Worship, which provokes his <hi>Jealousie,</hi> and makes him visit more (it may be) then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sinnes. <hi>If it had been an Enemy I could easily bear it.

               </gap>sh Habit, as it were, inticing Strangers. Which the Lord abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth more it may be, then the grossest Idolatry of those that are Strangers. Which is not so grievous as the <hi>Provocation of his Sonns and Daughters,</hi> (as <hi>Caesar</hi> also cryed, <hi>What and thou my Sonn Brutus!)</hi> or his nerest Relations; which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps also may be more properly called <hi>Haters of God</hi> (in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Sone,</hi> much akin to the <hi>Saxon English</hi> Name of <hi>Sonn)</hi> rather then <hi>Strangers;</hi> who have not knowledge enough to <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Hate Him</hi> in a proper sence; as those that by not walking in the light and love they have received, come at length to be so guilty and full of slavish fear, that they turn downright Rebbels; and such <hi>Sonns,</hi> as God commanded should be brought out to the Judges, to be stoned for Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Which is very neer perhaps, if not the very sin, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Holy Ghost;</hi> Or that presumptuous wickednesse, which <hi>David</hi> so prayed against, remembring that there was <hi>No Sacrifice for presumptuous Sinners:</hi> but (as the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> speaketh) <hi>A certain fearfull looking for, of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fiery indignation to devour the Rebbels.</hi> As the <hi>Jews</hi> also had the <hi>Cutting off,</hi> and the <hi>Hand of Heaven;</hi> yea and that also, they called the <hi>Rebels stroake.</hi>

            <p>But of All <hi>Images</hi> forbidden in the second <hi>Commandement,</hi> (as so much moving God to <hi>Iealousie,)</hi> Those which are most common, and most dangerous, as little taken notice of (being most Spirituall, or most Divelish) are the Images we are so prone to make and mould of God, by that within us, which is therefore rightly called <hi>Imagination,</hi> and the proper forge of Images, which yet may reach farther, higher, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then our sences, or that which the <hi>Schooles</hi> call <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> Worse much, then <hi>Images</hi> made by hands, which we are so long in Moulding and Carving, that we bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

worship That we have sweat so much about, and warmed our selves with part of. But a <hi>deceived Heart, makes us eate the very</hi> Excrements and <hi>ashes</hi> of those Images, or Image-makers. And as the great thing which brought the <hi>Flood,</hi> was the <hi>evil Imagination of mans Heart continually,</hi> So it is the great promise (in many places of Scripture) that his people should no more walk after the <hi>Imagination,</hi> or the <hi>Image ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi> or the <hi>Idols,</hi> of their own foolish <hi>Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is the great Judgement and Punishment of those, that <hi>when they knew God, did not glorifie him as God, nor were thankfull;</hi> that they should become <hi>vain in their Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> (or in Image making:) and their <hi>foolish hearts so darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as to change the Glory of God, into an Image,</hi> or an Idol of their own fancies; the most dangerous Idolatry. And thus indeed they change the Image and glory of God in themselves, to the Image of a <hi>Beast</hi> eating grass, (as <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar:)</hi> and it may be, This is some emblem of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Beast, or receiving that character, which the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation saith, <hi>All the World should do, but those only whose names were written in the Lambs book of Life, before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World.</hi> And That <hi>Beast,</hi> or sensual beastly spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, may be more common, than is thought. And when man was made in the <hi>Image of God,</hi> He was to <hi>Rule over all the Beasts,</hi> or Beastly natures or spirits: But now losing the <hi>Image of God,</hi> and of man also, he taketh the <hi>Image of a Beast,</hi> and of The <hi>Beast,</hi> so much spoken of in the <hi>Revelation.</hi>

            <p>But as <hi>Love</hi> was the foundation of the very <hi>Law</hi> also, springing out of the <hi>Heart</hi> of God, which is <hi>Love,</hi> (However, it may now <hi>gender unto Bondage)</hi> yet it rose from <hi>Love:</hi> So it speaketh <hi>Love;</hi> to the very worst of men (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth) till their Rebellion make them <hi>Outlaws,</hi> and put them out of the <hi>Protection</hi> of that good Law, which is given to them all: saying to every one of them, <hi>I am the Lord thy God: and upon this Rock I will build my whole Law.</hi> and therefore thou shalt have <hi>no other God, or make to thy self any Images,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For I am a jealous God;</hi> which yet I could not be, if I did not <hi>Love</hi> thee dearly, as a spouse: Or else, I should not much care, whither thou goest, or what thou doest; But for my great and spouse-like Love, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

               </gap>oorish wanderings from the God of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>the Guide of our youth.</hi> And so intended by God, to recover them so visited, as we may clearly see by <hi>Elihues</hi> discourse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Job:</hi> and the Psalmist in the 107 <hi>th.</hi> and many other Psalms; to be compared with the 3 <hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and the 2 <hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seah,</hi> with the first and second of <hi>Zechariah,</hi> with divers other Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And our great comfort is, that all the Law also, lay on Christ, as much, or more, than any of us, or all of us. And besides his love to his own flesh and nature, or to himself, or his Father, His very Duty to Him, by this Law, requires him so to love his God, with all his <hi>Might</hi> also, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate his love, to all he may: and to manifest his Name and Worship, with the true way and means thereof. That is, as the 72 <hi>d.</hi> Psalm expresseth, <hi>to redeem our souls from all deceipt and violence;</hi> or as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> hath it (in the Laws of the New Temple) to order a <hi>sacrifice for every one that erreth, or is simple.</hi> And the Psalmist saith, <hi>He hath received gifts for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels also,</hi> that the Lord may dwell among them. Yea, and to <hi>cast down all our vain Imaginations,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth it.</p>
            <p>And though we strangely degenerate into very <hi>Beasts,</hi> or to the worst of Beasts, or worse than Beasts: Yet the very same Law, which biddeth us and Christ also, to <hi>Love a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> biddeth also to love a <hi>Stranger,</hi> and an <hi>Enemie:</hi> Yea, and the very <hi>Oxe and Asse of an Enemie,</hi> so as to help it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Burthen, or straying out of the way.</p>
            <p>And is not our heart (as <hi>Ishmael</hi> was foretold to be) the <hi>wilde Asses Colt,</hi> on which no man can sit, till Christ send his Apostles, (as in the Gospel) who finde it <hi>bound</hi> and <hi>tyed, in a broad place where two waies met:</hi> and They loose our Asses Colte, and bring it to Christ, who then <hi>rideth on it; O daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion, Meek and Lowly: on an Asse, the foal of an Asse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And may we not find All this, in the very fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement? where every Man, (and so Jesus Christ also) is bid <hi>to remember to keep the sabboth:</hi> so, that not only his <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> but <hi>his servants, and his Cattle,</hi> and the <hi>Stranger in his</hi>

               <hi>Gate, may Rest,</hi> and keep that Rest of God. <hi>That they may Rest as well as Thou;</hi> as it is repeated in <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> And in the 23. of <hi>Exodus</hi> it is, <hi>that thine Oxe and thy Ass may Rest, and the Son of thy Handmaid</hi> (to which the Psalmist may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude several times, calling himself the <hi>Son of thy Handmaid:) And that the stranger also may be Refreshed.</hi> The very same Phrase and word, that is used by God of himself (and his own <hi>Kest and Refreshing,</hi> on That Sabbath day:) in the 31. of <hi>Exodus.</hi> And our Saviour maketh the helping of an <hi>Oxe or Ass,</hi> and their Loosing, and leading to the Water, to be a special work, or duty, of the <hi>Sabbath daies Rest.</hi> Which we may compare with that of the Prophet <hi>Esay: He led them</hi> (gently) <hi>as an Horse in the Wilderness;</hi> or as a <hi>Beast is led down a Valley</hi> (or to a Brook) <hi>So his spirit caused them to Rest.</hi> And in the Proverbs, <hi>Agur</hi> saith, <hi>I am more brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish than any Man:</hi> and the Psalmist, <hi>so Bruitish was I;</hi> yea <hi>Behemoth with thee</hi> (as alluding to <hi>Behemoth,</hi> in <hi>Job:)</hi> and That, some render <hi>Congregation of thy People</hi> (in several Psalms) is <hi>Beasts,</hi> or <hi>Thy Beasts.</hi> As under Those Banners of four Beasts (or Animals) of which we read in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Yea <hi>Solomon</hi> saith the great design of God (that is Christ, who as Man also, is the great <hi>Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of hearts;) is to Try us, and to make us know, we are but Beasts.

            </p>
            <p>And that the <hi>Stranger also, may be Refreshed.</hi> Which is but a piece of that great Law (in the very same chapter, of <hi>Loving our Neighbor:) Thou shalt also love a Stranger, as thou lovest thy self.</hi> And in several places it is added, <hi>For thou wast a stranger, and thou knowest the heart of a stranger in Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> And the word for <hi>stranger</hi> in the Heb. is so neer to <hi>Hagar,</hi> as if God would put them in mind of <hi>that Bond-woman,</hi> who was an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> also; and as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Gendered unto Bondage, with a spirit of Fear,</hi> (which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther signification of its Root also.) And Gods Love to <hi>Hagar,</hi> and to her son <hi>Ishmael,</hi> (that is, <hi>God will Hear,</hi> as he will <hi>appear</hi> also, in the <hi>Mount:)</hi> may shew the <hi>Heart of God,</hi> and his Goodness, more than all his Kindness to <hi>Abraham:</hi> who was Kind and Thankful unto God also. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other reasons for our Loving <hi>strangers,</hi> it is added,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51941:74"/>
that <hi>God loveth Strangers:</hi> and in a special manner provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for them. And it hath been an especial argument, used by good men in all ages of the Bible: <hi>For we are stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Pilgrims.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when we consider, that the <hi>Sabboth day</hi> did Typifie some greater <hi>Rest,</hi> may it not be hoped that at length, we may hear the <hi>Lord of that Day also,</hi> saying, to his children, and his servants (and the <hi>Sons of his handmaids</hi> also) and his <hi>Cattel, and the stranger also, within his gates: Come, enter, into your Masters Rest:</hi> (seeing it is greater than can enter into you:) <hi>For, this Commandement I have received of my good Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do we not also read, that the <hi>Owles,</hi> and the <hi>Dragons, and the Beasts of the field, and every thing that hath breath; yea and All his Works, shall praise the Lord: but his Saints shall Bless him?</hi> Do we not find <hi>Sabbatical Years <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>For, the <hi>whol Earth also,</hi> must <hi>Rest,</hi> and keep its <hi>Sabboth.</hi> And not only the Land of <hi>Israel</hi> (which was but as the <hi>First Fruits of the Earth:)</hi> and That had such a strict Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of observing <hi>Sabbatical Years,</hi> that they must stay, so many yeers, in <hi>Babylon,</hi> as the Land should have kept <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths</hi> by the Law, while They were in it.

For, God is able even of stones to raise up sons to</hi> Abraham.

The Glory of Lebanon, shall be given to it: The Excellency of Carmell and Sharon: They shall see the glory of the Lord, and the Excellency of our God.</hi> Yea, All the Earth shall Rest, and Rejoyce, and be <hi>full of the Glory of God, as Waters fill up the Sea.</hi> And Then the Lord shall be called the <hi>God of All the Earth;</hi> and the Possessor of <hi>Earth,</hi> as well as <hi>Heaven.</hi> Which was the phrase used by <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> in blessing <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he had pursued the four Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51941:75"/>
               <hi>(or four Monarchies)</hi> to <hi>Dan,</hi> even to <hi>Judgment:</hi> and brought back the <hi>Captivity of Sodom</hi> also; of which we read in several places. Although <hi>Sodom</hi> was so accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and made a <hi>Perpetual Desolation,</hi> that it is a Type of Hell, or of the worst Judgments, in all the Bible. Yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Sodom</hi> must return <hi>again, and her Daughters.</hi> And when our Lord Jesus <hi>Exulted in spirit,</hi> (as he saith, <hi>Abraham did, to see his Day:)</hi> he said, <hi>I bless thee Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth;</hi> even of the <hi>Earth</hi> also, as of <hi>Heaven:</hi> as alluding to that Blessing of <hi>Melchizedecks;</hi> at the return of <hi>Sodoms</hi> Captivity.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Revelation</hi> tells us, that <hi>when the seventh Angel sounded, there was great Voyces</hi> (or Joy) <hi>in Heaven,</hi> saying, <hi>The Kingdoms of this world, are become the Lords, and His Christs; and he shall reign for ever and ever. And the twenty four Elders blessed God, that</hi> (yet at length) <hi>he had taken to him his great Power, and reigned: and the Nations were Angry; and thy Wrath is come, and the time of the Dead, that they should be Judged; and that thou shouldest Reward Thy Saints, &amp;c.</hi> and shouldest <hi>destroy them which destroy the Earth.</hi> And Then the <hi>Temple of God was opened in Heaven &amp;c.</hi> Where before, the <hi>twenty four Elders,</hi> and the four Watchers also, had blessed the <hi>Lamb,</hi> that They should come (even out of Heaven) <hi>to Reign upon the Earth,</hi> even upon the Earth. As if the Earth should be the Centre also, to All the Glory of God; and that it should be more, and greater, on the <hi>Earth,</hi> than it is in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet it may be remembred, that from the very first sin of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice, the Earth was the Great (that I say not the <hi>Only)</hi> Object of <hi>the Curse of God.</hi> The <hi>Serpent</hi> it self, was not Absolutely Cursed; but <hi>above all Cattel, and above every Beast of the field.</hi> And when the Earth shall be New moulded, yet Dust <hi>shall</hi> be the <hi>Serpents</hi> meat: as we read <hi>Esay</hi> 65. Adam <hi>must labor and sweat; the Woman must be in subjection, and bring forth in pain:</hi> but not a word of <hi>Cursing</hi> them: For God had loved them, and <hi>Blessed them. Yea, and they shall be Blessed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Ground</hi> is <hi>Cursed,</hi> for Mans sake: and <hi>in sorrow must he eat thereof, All the daies of his life. Yea, it shall bring</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:51941:75"/>
               <hi>forth thorns and thistles:</hi> and when Nothing else, comes after Dews, and Rain of Heaven; <hi>It is nigh unto Cursing:</hi> as we read in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when the Cursed Earth, had also drunk up the blood of <hi>Righteous Abel</hi> (every word of our Savior, is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable:) Then <hi>Cain</hi> the <hi>Murderer</hi> (as every One is, that <hi>Hateth his brother)</hi> was also <hi>Cursed</hi> from the <hi>Earth:</hi> but not from <hi>Heaven,</hi> that we read: and yet a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and laid <hi>at his door, for sin: that he may have Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over it.</hi> Though I shall not here dispute the Jews Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that <hi>Cain</hi> also, was saved.</p>
            <p>Or, that the <hi>Earth</hi> it self, was cursed, as a Type of our <hi>Heart,</hi> or somwhat in us, more spiritual than our fleshly <hi>Heart:</hi> which is a Metathesis of <hi>Earth:</hi> as in Hebrew of <hi>Babel,</hi> which is <hi>Lebab</hi> (the Heart) turned backward. And an Heart, turned back from God, is but <hi>Babel</hi> (Confusion:) As the <hi>Earth</hi> which the Lord cursed. Bringing forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Thorns and Thistles;</hi> yet its <hi>Conception is greatly multiplied, and its sorrow.</hi> But I must not here shew, How our Body, represents the whole World: with its three <hi>Regions of Heaven above</hi> (in our <hi>Head)</hi> and the <hi>Earth below,</hi> in our <hi>Heart;</hi> with its <hi>Pericardium</hi> of <hi>Waters,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with the <hi>Lungs,</hi> as the Air; separate by the <hi>Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Midriff;</hi> from the <hi>Heaven above,</hi> in the <hi>Head;</hi> and the <hi>Waters</hi> under the <hi>Earth,</hi> in the <hi>Bowels:</hi> which in <hi>Heb</hi> are expressed by the same word with the Waves of the Sea: whose Rowlings, and <hi>Ebbings and flowings,</hi> are much akin to the motion and yearnings of our <hi>Bowels.</hi> And in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the off-spring of our <hi>Bowels,</hi> is compared to the <hi>Sand of the Sea, and the gravel thereof.</hi> As the Hebrew words for the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of our Hearts, do also signifie the <hi>sprouts</hi> of the <hi>Earth:</hi> That Earth which the Lord Cursed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Noah found grace with God;</hi> which may allude to his <hi>Name,</hi> being the very same Letters, which in Heb signify <hi>Grace.</hi> He is called the eighth <hi>Preacher of Righteousnesse,</hi> being the eighth from <hi>Enos. When</hi> (it is said) <hi>Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Preach,</hi> or <hi>Proclaim the Name of the Lord.</hi> The same phrase with Gods <hi>Proclaiming, his own Name, to</hi> Moses.

in the 80. and 79. <hi>Psalm.

            </p>
            <p>And if I should so paraphrase the Words, that <hi>Noah</hi> was the eighth from <hi>Enos who began to Preach Jesus,</hi> Or to own him so, as to <hi>call upon his Name;</hi> I might not onely shew many Scriptures alluding (though we now render them by <hi>Man, and the Son of Man;</hi> Where in <hi>Heb</hi> it is <hi>Enos, or the Son of Adam:)</hi> But I might also, bring great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to prove <hi>Jehovah</hi> (there used) to be most proper to Christ: Or the great <hi>Angel Jehovah,</hi> as he is called in <hi>Zech.</hi> as alluding to the <hi>Angel</hi> so often speaking to <hi>Moses</hi> (and giving the Law at <hi>Sinai)</hi> out of the Burning Bush: (and <hi>Sinai</hi> is my <hi>Bush,</hi> or <hi>my Thorns,</hi> or <hi>my Sin,</hi> or <hi>my Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,</hi> as it is written, or at least, sounded in the <hi>Heb.)</hi> And That <hi>Angel,</hi> speaking to <hi>Moses</hi> (when he was first made <hi>to turn aside, and say, he would consider,</hi> that great thing, a <hi>Bush Burning,</hi> and yet not consuming, as Christ also was) plainly telleth him, He <hi>was the God of his Fathers; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them</hi> (as tis said the Word of the Lord appeared to <hi>Abraham:</hi> and the old Chaldee Paraphrase useth it very often, where we read the Lord:) Though it was onely, by his Name of <hi>Elshadday,</hi> or <hi>God Almighty</hi> (which we found the Object of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith:) but not yet as <hi>Jehovah,</hi> speaking his <hi>Will</hi> also, with his <hi>Power: Ehje asher Ehje, I will be what I will (or can) be.</hi> Which now God would be in Christ, delivering them out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> (which in Heb is <hi>Misery:)</hi> as he speaks in the Law, calling himself <hi>Jehovah, the Lord thy God.</hi>

               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:51941:76"/>
And This Name also, may seem to be foretold to our Grand-mother <hi>Eve,</hi> and that He should come from <hi>Her:</hi> and she could not hold it in (her Name being <hi>Chave,</hi> which may also signifie a <hi>Tatler:)</hi> and as soon as <hi>Kain</hi> was born, she cries, <hi>I have kuned (or kinned) the Man Jehovah.</hi> See the same Idiome, particles and accents, in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Seth</hi> was <hi>Set</hi> (the Saxon English is very much Hebrew, and a kin to <hi>Abraham:)</hi> in the room of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Abel,</hi> whom <hi>Kain</hi> slew: So there was a Righteous Man also, to rise up, and be set in the room of <hi>Kain, the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, and Brother Hater.</hi> Which might be hinted perhaps, when <hi>Kain</hi> named his Son <hi>Enoch</hi> (sounding alike to <hi>Enos)</hi> the very same name with the Blessed Patriarch <hi>Enoch:</hi> That is the <hi>Chatechist,</hi> or <hi>Catechumenus.</hi> As is touched also, in <hi>Abrahams</hi> taking out his <hi>Enochs,</hi> or his <hi>Catechised servants,</hi> against the four great Monarchies. And <hi>Enoch</hi> was a great Type of Christ, <hi>Walking with God, and was not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God took him: but before his Translation, he had this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, that he Pleased God.</hi> Living also 365. years, as there be Dayes, in a year. And so long also, did Christ remain in the Purity of the Primitive Church (as the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle answered, <hi>That Christian Religion should remain, but One (Great or Prophetick) year:</hi> and then came up. That Grand <hi>Apostacy,</hi> so much spoken of; and ushered in by Him, that through all ages since, is Called <hi>The Apostate.</hi> For, <hi>Julian</hi> was about 365 years after Christ: of which we may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course again, in an other Season.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Enoch</hi> was Taken away, and <hi>Seth</hi> Dead, <hi>Noah</hi> is Born. So Gracious is God, in raising up other <hi>Comforters</hi> (as our Saviour speaketh) when it is <hi>expedient that some be taken from us.</hi> Who is to be set in the room of <hi>Kain</hi> and his issue: called the <hi>Children of Men,</hi> in opposition to the Sons of <hi>Enos,</hi> Named the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> as some will have it. <hi>Then began Men to be called by the Name of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All <hi>Kains</hi> Issue was washed off, by the <hi>Floud;</hi> so, that all men now, are the Children of <hi>Seth,</hi> (as we read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) as well as Children of <hi>Noah.</hi> And as we see the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God in washing away the Sons of <hi>Cursed Kain;</hi> so
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51941:77"/>
we may see the goodnesse of God, in bringing us all since from Blessed <hi>Noah:</hi> while also our sins (as the Sons of <hi>Kain)</hi> are washed off, by the Blessed Flood of <hi>Baptism,</hi> by <hi>Water and the Spirit.</hi> Which must <hi>move on those Waters</hi> also (as at first, on the great Waters) till it bring forth a <hi>New Heaven and a New Earth, in which Righteousness shall dwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not Here stay to compare <hi>Noahs Ark</hi> with <hi>Peters Sheet;</hi> having all kind of beasts, <hi>Unclean and Clean:</hi> which He must <hi>slay, and eat,</hi> and Turn into himself, and his own spirit. And from This, he is Taught at length, <hi>to call No Man Common or Unclean.</hi> Seeing All, are together, and may be alike; as they were, in the sheet, and in the Ark: Resembling Christ with Rest also, as the Name of <hi>Noah</hi> signifies. Which was therefore given him, because He shall give us <hi>Rest, or Comfort, in our Toyl, because of the Earth which the Lord hath Cursed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which also the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> may allude, <hi>This Man shall be Our Peace, whon the Assyrian Overflows our Land.</hi> For, so also, <hi>Esay</hi> Prophesied, that <hi>Assyria</hi> should rise up as a <hi>Flood,</hi> and overflow the breadth of the Land of <hi>Emanuel:</hi> as Antichrist the Church of Christ. (see also <hi>Jer.</hi> 47. 2.) But Christ shall give us <hi>Rest:</hi> as himself also promiseth, when he calleth <hi>all that are laden, and that Labour,</hi> (as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to That of <hi>Noah) I will give you Rest;</hi> and again you shall find Rest to your Souls. And the flood so Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised <hi>Noah,</hi> that God blessed Him and his Sons also; which was more then we read done, to <hi>Adams Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, <hi>Noah</hi> had a greater blessing then <hi>Adam</hi> had (as may be shewed in divers Particulars:) and an <hi>Everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> so established with Him, and his Seed also, that it is made the Pattern of all Covenants with <hi>Israel,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as we may find in divers places.</p>
            <p>And the Flood was such a <hi>Baptism</hi> to the <hi>Earth,</hi> also, As helped to wash away its <hi>Curss:</hi> and Then, <hi>God said in his Heart, I will no more,</hi> Or I will not <hi>yet add,</hi> or go on, <hi>to Curss the Earth, for mans sake;</hi> For, <hi>or although, all the mouldings of his heart be evil continually.</hi> Which was the great reason brought for the <hi>Flood:</hi> and yet now against it, and the <hi>Curse,</hi> or its continuance. So gracious was God;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51941:77"/>
seeing the Flood also, did not change mans heart (but still left it as bad, as it found it) he resolved another Course; and that he would, <hi>Overcome Man with Kindness.</hi> For, it it was not only the Heathen Poet that told us, <hi>Love would Conquer All:</hi> Nor the Apostle only, that <hi>Love</hi> covereth <hi>a multitude of sins:</hi> but <hi>Solomon</hi> expressly saith, <hi>Love cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> or <hi>shall cover</hi> (as the Original expresseth,) <hi>All Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions.</hi> Which St. <hi>Paul</hi> also Comments on: <hi>Love bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth All, believeth All, hopeth All, endureth All.</hi> Which was seen before in <hi>Davids</hi> (that is <hi>Loves)</hi> perfect Victory over All his Enemies; Yea and <hi>Saul</hi> also, which is the <hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Hell:</hi> to which <hi>David</hi> also, alludeth perhaps, in That very Psalm, Crying, <hi>the Kables of Hell laid hold of me: Kable Seol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not digress, Here to shew, How the <hi>Flood</hi> it self, was a <hi>Blessing</hi> also to the <hi>Earth,</hi> and a Type of a greater Blessing to come; <hi>When the skies shall pour down Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the Earth also shall bring forth Salvation.</hi> When we shall receive the great showrs, and the <hi>Latter Rain</hi> of the Spirit, as we have received the <hi>Former little drops</hi> (and first fruits of it) hinted in divers places of Scripture. For, <hi>the whole Earth also must be full of the Knowledg of God, as the Waters fill up the Sea;</hi> and did once cover the Earth: yea once and again. But the <hi>Spirit also moved on the Waters,</hi> and formed out the <hi>Heaven and the Earth:</hi> so also it shall bring forth <hi>a new Heaven, and a new Earth, in which Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness shall dwell.</hi> And in the Revelation, the <hi>Earth also holped the woman, and drunk up the Flood, cast out of the Dragons mouth.</hi> May it not also be, about 1656 from Christs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, or the New Creation; as the Flood was so long after the Old Creation? And, That very Earth, which God so cursed, even This <hi>Cursed Earth,</hi> must become, <hi>the Blessed of the Lord.</hi> Yea so much his Darling; That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth to make it the very Centre of All his Glory: and to fill it so, with his glorious presence; that the very Saints, or Angels in Heaven, rejoyced in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that they should come (out of Heaven) to <hi>reign upon the Earth.</hi> Which is many times also hinted in the Psalms, and All the Prophets: to be compared with that most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable

Discourse of God with <hi>Moses,</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> of the Lands enjoying her <hi>Sabboth</hi> of Rest, in <hi>Leviticus.</hi> And the very <hi>Song of Moses</hi> (which is as the <hi>Bass,</hi> to All fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Prophesies,) concludeth with This, <hi>He will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to his Land</hi> (as to his People,) or he will <hi>Cover,</hi> or <hi>Atone,</hi> or <hi>Expiate his Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, the very word by which God named the <hi>Earth</hi> (which is one of the few things God Himself named, and would not leave to <hi>Adams</hi> Naming, as he did other things:) is such a word, as might be also rendered, <hi>I will delight,</hi> or <hi>be pleased:</hi> as if Here, he meant to take his pleasure, and delight; rather than in All the <hi>Heavens. Which must pass away, as a Scroul of Parchment, before the fire; and They shall be no more:</hi> being only as a Canopy, or Curtains, now to hide the Glory of God; which must ere long fill the Earth: which therefore shall <hi>Endure for ever, and be never moved;</hi> though renewed and filled, both with <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Peace.</hi> And God will come to keep his <hi>Sabboth of Rest,</hi> and will <hi>delight on Earth;</hi> and take his pleasure Here: and Here also <hi>accept his People:</hi> as himself seemeth sweetly to allude (to the very Name <hi>Erets,</hi> by which he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Earth)</hi> in the 40. verse of the 20. chapter of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel.</hi> Where also This allusion is more sweet, and fuller much, in the Original, than other Languages can well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press. <hi>Berets sam eretsem.</hi> And in the 34. of the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, he saith, <hi>I will make them, and the places about my Hill,</hi> a Blessing: <hi>I will cause the showr to come in his season: there shall be showers of Blessing. And the Tree of the field shall yield her fruit; and the Earth</hi> (even the whole Earth) <hi>shall then yield her Increase.</hi> Which we also read in the 67. 96, 97, 98, 99. and divers other <hi>Psalms:</hi> and in the second of <hi>Hosea,</hi> and divers other Prophets.</p>
            <p>And this Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> (more <hi>Accursed,</hi> than the whole Earth besides; while it was held by those accursed Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so devoted to destruction:) came to be; the <hi>Pleasant Land,</hi> the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> the place of <hi>Gods Delight,</hi> and Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; on which his Eyes and Heart were fixed, All the Year.</p>
            <p>And This also, but as the <hi>First fruits of the Earth.</hi> For,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51941:78"/>
it must <hi>All, be Full of the glory of God: And All Nations must worship him; and All Kingdoms must be His.</hi> So it is pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and promised in many places of Scripture. <hi>Let All the Earth fear the Lord: let all the Inhabitants of the World Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him. For, he looketh on them, and fashioneth their hearts alike; and his Eyes are on them: that fear him, and Hope in his Mercy. All his Works are done in Truth, He loveth Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Judgment. All the Earth is full of his Goodness.</hi> And the next Psalm is <hi>Davids</hi> Heart: or Christs; when driven out from <hi>Abimeleck</hi> (the King my Father, or the Father of the King) <hi>he Changed his Habit &amp;c.</hi> And among other sweet Expressions, That may be One; When <hi>the Face of God is against the wicked to cut them off from Earth, They Cry</hi> (for, so is the Original) <hi>and the Lord heareth and delivereth them, out of all their Trouble.</hi> And again, <hi>All the Ends of the World shall remember and Turn unto the Lord. And All Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Kindreds, shall worship him.</hi> Yea, <hi>All Kings shall fall down before him, and All Nations shall serve him. For, he shall deliver the Needy when he Cryeth; the Poor also, and Him that hath no Helper.</hi> And again, <hi>All Nations which thou hast made, shall come and Worship before thee O Lord, and glorifie thy Name.</hi> And the reason is in the same Psalm, <hi>For, the Lord is Good, and ready to forgive, and plenteous in Mercy, to all that call upon him. O sing unto the Lord a New Song</hi> (which is cited also in the <hi>Revelation) Sing unto the Lord, All the Earth. Fear before him, All the Earth. Say among the Heathen the Lord Reigneth, and the</hi> whole <hi>World shall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be Established, that it thall not be moved. Let the Heavens rejoyce, and let the Earth be glad: Let the Sea</hi> Dance and <hi>Rowl, with All the Fulness thereof</hi> (which hereafter we may understand.) <hi>Let the Field be Joyful, and All in it.</hi> Yea, <hi>Then shall all the Trees of the Wood rejoyce</hi> before the Lord. <hi>For he Cometh,</hi> He <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, to Judg the World. The Lord Reigneth, let the Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and let the many Isles be glad. The Heavens declare his Righteousness, and all the People see his Glory.</hi> Which in the next Psalm is, <hi>All the ends of the Earth have seen the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God.</hi> As in <hi>Luke</hi> also, <hi>All flesh shall see the salvation of God:</hi> Which in <hi>Esay</hi> is Thus, <hi>The Glory of God shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and all flesh shall see it together.</hi> And in the same

Prophet, <hi>Sing O Heavens, for, the Lord hath done it; Shout O lower parts of the Earth; break forth into singing ye Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains: O Forrest, and every Tree therein.</hi> And again, <hi>Look unto me and be saved, All the ends of the Earth.

As taking possession of them, <hi>Blessing</hi> them also, by his blessed presence. For, the time was coming, yea and Then come, when <hi>not only at That,</hi> or other <hi>Mountains</hi> of that Holy Land, but <hi>in All places, men should Worship God in Spirit and in Truth. For the Father Seeketh such to worship him.</hi> Yea, and Those Lands also, that had so afflicted, and oppressed the People of God in all Ages (even <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Assyria,)</hi> must come to sharers with the Land of <hi>Israel</hi> it self, in the greatest Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings. For, <hi>in that day shall Israel be a Third</hi> (and but a Third) <hi>with</hi> Aegypt <hi>and</hi> Assyria; <hi>even a Blessing in the midst of the Earth: whom the Lord of Hosts himself shall bless; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Blessed be</hi> Aegypt <hi>my People, and</hi> Assyria <hi>the work of my hands:</hi> as we read in the Prophet <hi>Esay;</hi> to be compared with other places.</p>
            <p>And the Reason given in the very Law of <hi>Redemption,</hi> speaketh This: because <hi>the Land was Gods Land,</hi> and they were but Gods Tenants in it: though in the Best and freest Fee; for it was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>his seed for Ever:</hi> who was <hi>Heir of the World,</hi> as the Apostle speaks. And yet So, that they must still acknowledg God to be their <hi>Lord Paramount;</hi> their Grand Landlord. And They might never give, or sell, or aliene, no nor forfeit it, (which is very comfortable) but so, that it still must, and should, and shall, be <hi>Redeemed again,</hi> by the Tenant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or his Kinsman. Or however (which was still to be observed) it must <hi>go out Free,</hi> wholly Free, at the great Year of <hi>Jubilee:</hi> of which more ere long. And the Reason was This, <hi>Because the Land was Gods Land:</hi> and He would
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51941:79"/>
still retain his Right to it, and in it: and would still dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it as he pleased; whatever the present <hi>Tenant</hi> did.</p>
            <p>And doth not the same Reason hold, for All the <hi>Earth?</hi> Yea, did it not hold, from the very first <hi>Fall of Adam,</hi> and Man-kind in him? Was not Then also the <hi>Earth,</hi> even the whole Earth, the same Landlords? Had he not, as much Right to it, as to This Land of <hi>Canaan?</hi> Would he so easily quit his Right in it? Though Man (a weak, and vain, and foolish Creature) made a Forfeiture of His Possession, or His Right? shall it not, then be, (as it was, divers times, with this Land of <hi>Canaan?)</hi> that when <hi>he shall have purged out the filth thereof, by the spirit of Judgment and of Burning; That which remaineth shall be Holy?</hi> And why may it not be Thus also, with our bodies and our flesh, which hath so long been, As the accursed Earth? Yea, as <hi>Babylon</hi> it self? <hi>an Habitation of unclean spirits, and a Cage of all unclean birds?</hi> Why may it not also become the blessed Land of <hi>Promise,</hi> and the Land of <hi>Rest:</hi> Yea, the Holy Place, and Temple of the <hi>Lord of all the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is a Phrase very much to be marked: As a name in which the Lord himself seemeth to glory: being also the same Lord that is stiled <hi>the God of the Spirits of All flesh.</hi> Which may be the Foundation of That Prayer, and That Promise also, that <hi>All flesh may,</hi> and shall, be brought to <hi>praise and bless the Lord:</hi> as also that <hi>All the Earth</hi> must be <hi>full of the Glory of God.</hi> For, the <hi>place of his very Feet, must be Glorious.</hi> And what Glory Then, will be upon This Earth; when the Curtains, or Canopy of the Heavens, shall be drawn, and the Glory of God shall appear, and will the Earth, as his chiefest Residence? Will he not Then <hi>Give the Greatest Honour, to the Weaker Vessel! and the more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant honor to the most uncomly parts; or That which lacked most</hi> before?</p>
            <p>It might be added also, that the very City <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was not only Accursed as the rest, but longer, than other parts of the Land. Trodden down by the accursed <hi>Jebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites</hi> (which had their very name from <hi>Tredding down;</hi> as the <hi>Revelation</hi> also seemeth to allude) and These <hi>Jebusites</hi> grew up to be so Odious, that before he conquered them,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51941:80"/>
'tis said, His Soul, even <hi>Davids Soul</hi> (that is <hi>Love it self)</hi> Hated them. Even Them, who possessed That very Fort, which was afterwards his Darling; and the dearly beloved of his Soul. Yea That, which <hi>God Chose-above all the Gates or Cities of Judah.</hi> Yet in it self (besides its accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed possessors) it was but a dry barren Rock; and so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Zion, Drought,</hi> or a Dry barren place. And <hi>Mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> also, where the Temple stood, was but the Threshing place of one of these accursed <hi>Jebusites</hi> (though as a Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Prince to <hi>David</hi> himself:) And though, in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> it may signifie, <hi>the Lords Teaching,</hi> yet others bring it up to <hi>Myrrh,</hi> or <hi>Bitterness:</hi> and in Greek it signifieth <hi>Foolishness:</hi> to which also the Apostle may allude in several places.</p>
            <p>And by This time, I may conclude this Discourse of Turning accursed places, or unholy, into Blessed and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with That solemn saying of our Saviour, <hi>The last shall be first, and the first last.</hi> Which he repeated so, that I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten think, it might intimate, a greater Mystery, than I am yet sensible of. As if, All the Course of Gods Providence were as a Wheel in constant Motion; pulling down the high Spoaks, and bringing up the low ones. Which <hi>Moses</hi> also, long before, described in his Psalm of Nature, Grace and Glory. <hi>Thou turnest man about</hi> (as grinding him, with the upper and the lower Milstone, of Grief and Pain) <hi>to clay or dust; and Then thou sayest, Return again; Again ye Sons of Man. Return again O Lord, How long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants</hi> (That is, Make them Turn and Repent, as we find it plain enough in the 80. Psalm, and divers other places, that <hi>Gods Effects</hi> In Man, are expressed, as His <hi>Affections</hi> To Man:) <hi>O satisfie us with thy Free Grace, in the morning;</hi> (when our Night of pain and sorrow is past: For, <hi>Though sorrow may continue all night, yet Joy shall come in the morning:) and we shall be glad, and rejoyce all day. Make us glad according to the daies wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil:</hi> (and although I might not see thy <hi>Face</hi> when I prayed to see thy <hi>Glory;</hi> yet) <hi>let Thy Work</hi> (at length) <hi>appear unto thy Servants, and Thy Glory also to our Children</hi> when we are dead. <hi>And let the Beauty also of the Lord our</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:51941:80"/>
               <hi>God, be on us All; and establish Thou the Work of our hands to us, yea the Work of our hands, do Thou establish it.</hi> And will he not Then also establish the work of his own hands? Which is so often brought as a Reason why the <hi>Earth must stand and abide for ever.</hi> Seeing <hi>All the Works of God are perfect, and must abide for ever.</hi> Yea, and he hath set the <hi>World</hi> also, or <hi>Eternity</hi> (as the word is often rendered) in the <hi>Heart</hi> of every man. And though it may be (for a while) the Glory of God, to hide some things: Yet it is not only Lawful, but our glory (and the Glory of the greatest, largest, Kingly heart, like <hi>Solomon)</hi> to searth it out: and to search him out. For, in God, there is No <hi>Mole,</hi> or shadow of Deformity. Nor will he envy, that <hi>All Flesh should see his glorious face together.</hi> Nay our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour promiseth, that <hi>Nothing Shall be Hid</hi> (no not in God himself, I hope,) <hi>but shall be revealed.</hi> And every New Revelation of God, to All Eternity, will be to <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> (as That we now read:) but <hi>to shew it</hi> to his Children, and <hi>his Servants.</hi> Which have also <hi>received a spirit,</hi> not only <hi>to know</hi> and discern <hi>the things of God (as the spirit of man, doth the things of a man) and to know the things that are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given us of God:</hi> but also <hi>to search out the Depths, or Baths of God.</hi> Who still speaketh perhaps, to them All; as to the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, Ask of me, and I will yet shew thee great and wonderful things, which thou knowest not.</hi> For, such a God we have, so Infinite; that still he is, a Fountain flowing up, still flowing over: and a little drop of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Ocean, can stretch out our narrow souls, still wider, and yet wider; to receive more, and yet more, and still more, to Eternity: till we are wider than the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. For our Saviour and our Head is <hi>gone up, Over All Heavens</hi> (still spinning out the spring of his Watch, which was <hi>wound up,</hi> Here on Earth, while He was strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and made perfect by suffering:) <hi>that he may now-fill All things:</hi> and bring us All up, to his own <hi>Ballance</hi> of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory. Even <hi>to the fulness of that stature</hi> which each Member is to have, in His Great Body; <hi>Which is the Fulness of Him which filleth All in All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:51941:81"/>
This also of Turning Cursed things or places into Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, might be yet more cleered from <hi>Jericho:</hi> which was the <hi>first Fruits,</hi> of all the I and of <hi>Chanaan,</hi> And (as all first Fruits) it was so <hi>sacred,</hi> that all were cursed, that but touched it. And yet, <hi>the Vallie of Achan, or Achor</hi> (that is the <hi>Troubler,)</hi> afterwards, is made a <hi>Door of Hope, in the great day of Iezreel, the Seed of God.</hi> Yet, so accursed it was, by prophesie, that He, that should but attempt to build it again, was solemnly <hi>Cursed by Iosuah,</hi> the great Type of Jesus.</p>
            <p>Yet in the Reign of <hi>Achab</hi> (the <hi>Brother</hi> and the <hi>Father,</hi> as the Name implies) the guilty Man of the Kings of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el;</hi> there riseth up one <hi>Hiell (the Living God:)</hi> and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to rebuild this Cursed City. Yet we read of nothing els of harm to him, but onely that he laid its groundwork in his Eldest Son, and finished it, in his Youngest; which we may consider again.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all the Curss, This <hi>Jericho,</hi> in a very few years, grew up to be a Blessed <hi>School of Prophets;</hi> as we may gather from the History of <hi>Elijahs</hi> taking up into Heaven. And to make the Cure yet perfecter the Citizens bemoan themselves, before <hi>Elisha,</hi> that the situation of their City, was indeed <hi>pleasant, but the Water Naught, and the ground so, that it caused to miscarry:</hi> as some read the place. <hi>And he said, bring me a New Cruse, and put salt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and he went forth to the spring</hi> (or very Fountain of the cursed Waters;) <hi>and cast in the salt, and said, Thus saith the Lord, I have Healed these Waters; there shall be Thence, No more Death,</hi> or Curss, or <hi>Barrennesse.</hi> So the <hi>Waters were Heald unto this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Elisha</hi> the Prophet, was in This also, a great Type of Jesus Christ, Healing the <hi>Earth,</hi> and taking off the Curss thereof (as he <hi>bore away the sins of the World;)</hi> I do believe the rather, because I find Our Saviour thereabout so often; with his Healing Wings also, to so many. That I say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his famous Parable of the <hi>good Samaritan, Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying towards</hi> Jericho.</p>
            <p>Nor shall I now spend time to shew, how all this, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so shadowed out, in the very Heavens; by the frequent
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51941:81"/>
               <hi>Changings of the Moon:</hi> although the Name of <hi>Jericho</hi> might lead us to That also. Or that, as <hi>Jericho</hi> was the <hi>First fruits,</hi> to the whole Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> So was <hi>Israel</hi> also, to the <hi>World.</hi> As we might prove, by many Scriptures, besides That of <hi>Jeremy</hi> the 2. Where it is called the <hi>First Fruits unto God, of All his Increase: and All that eat it</hi> (or in some other places, all that <hi>touch it,</hi> to destroy it) <hi>are Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and be guilty.</hi> So also is our Saviour himself called the <hi>First Fruits of the Resurrection.</hi> Though but as the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Sheaf</hi> (or Barley Cake of <hi>Gideon)</hi> that was <hi>Heaved</hi> up before the Lord, on the Third day, after the <hi>Passover</hi> was slain: as an Emblem of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> on the third day, after his death. And This, is often called in Scripture, (as in <hi>Genesis, Revelation,</hi> and St. <hi>Johns Epistle and Gospel;</hi> the <hi>Beginning of the Creation, and the VVorks of God:</hi> So here,) the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the <hi>First Fruits.</hi> Which came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, on the day of <hi>Pentecost</hi> (when also we received the <hi>First Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> in the 2 of <hi>Acts:)</hi> and those first Fruits were Loaves of fine Flowr; and moulded together, as a Type of the <hi>Elect:</hi> (as the very name of <hi>First Fruits,</hi> in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, may intimate:) or of Christ, in All his Members together; as before, it was Christ in his own person: who was the <hi>First First Fruits;</hi> or <hi>Beginning</hi> os the First Fruits of the Resurrection, and of all that slept. And the same Apostle tells us also, that <hi>if the Root be Holy, the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are Holy; and if the First fruits be Holy, so is the whole Lump.</hi> Which should be considered much: with all those places that speak our Saviour, and the whole Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, to be (as <hi>Israel</hi> to the whole World besides) but as the <hi>First born,</hi> with the double portion: or the <hi>first fruits</hi> of the Earth; as we may read in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and divers other places. As the <hi>Barly Sheaf</hi> first, and Then the siner Loaves at <hi>Pentecost,</hi> were but the <hi>first fruits</hi> of all the Increase of the Earth: which was not gathered All in, till the end of all the Harvest, and Vintage also; about the great Feast of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> at the End of the yeer. Which yet is called (on the New account from <hi>Exodus)</hi> the <hi>Seventh</hi> Month. Which also made every <hi>Seventh</hi> Month Holy. As also, every Seventh <hi>Year</hi> was (especially
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51941:82"/>
the seventh Seventh, as we shall find in the <hi>Jubilee:)</hi> and every seventh Week; or every seventh Day, or <hi>Sabboth;</hi> and perhaps every seventh Hour also, in each Day. As we see, it makes a great Turn in the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> (begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our reckoning from <hi>Sun-set,</hi> as the <hi>Jews,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations did:) which we see Dayly attended also with a constant <hi>Ebbing and flowing of the Sea,</hi> six Hours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, in the great Ocean: as we may discourse more largely in the place of <hi>Times and Seasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might add also, that although the <hi>Curse,</hi> that was due enough to <hi>Man,</hi> fell on the <hi>Earth</hi> in general, our common Mother (crying to us, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> did to her son <hi>Jaacob, Thy Curse be upon me my son;)</hi> yet there have been several places, which in several Ages, have been especially under this Curse; and yet none of them, lay so under it, but that they grew up to be <hi>Blessed</hi> again. Yea, it may be, the more Blessed, because they were once so Cursed. For, it was not only <hi>Micha's</hi> Mother, that blessed her son in the name of the Lord, because she had cursed so before; but even God himself, doth <hi>so earnestly Remember One that he hath spoken against</hi> (as himself saith to <hi>Ephraim,) that his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels do the more yern over him:</hi> and it may be, blesseth them more, because they were formerly cursed. That is, under <hi>Sorrow;</hi> as we find the <hi>Curse</hi> of God, so rendered in the <hi>Lamentations; Give them O Lord, thy Curse, even Sorrow on their heart.</hi> And our first Parents had sorrow, and sweat, and pain, for their portion; when the <hi>Curse</hi> fel on the <hi>Earth:</hi> bearing Bryars and Thorns, Thistles and Nettles, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press this Curse or <hi>Wrath of God:</hi> as the very name of a <hi>Nettle</hi> in Hebrew may import.</p>
            <p>If there be any place in all the Law, more under the Curse, than the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> it seemeth to be <hi>Idumea:</hi> one of the Neighbor Countries, which is expressly called <hi>the People of my Curse:</hi> and threatned to <hi>Perpetual desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when the whol Earth shall rejoyce, Edom</hi> must mourn, and be so cursed also, that it is the very Type of <hi>Hell,</hi> as may plainly appear, by reading the 34. of <hi>Esay.</hi> It being also the Land of Him or them that God so <hi>Hated;</hi> as was toucht before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:51941:82"/>
And yet I know not one word in all the Curse of <hi>Edom,</hi> that we do not also find Inflicted, (and not only Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) on <hi>Jaacob</hi> and <hi>Israel:</hi> Whom, God himself saith, <hi>he had given, or devoted, to the Curse:</hi> by that very phrase, which is used, in that place, where <hi>Edom</hi> is called <hi>the People of my Curse.</hi> And what more frequent, than <hi>Jerusalem</hi> it self, to be a <hi>Scorn, Reproach and Curse:</hi> yea, a Curse to all Nations? Yea, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd Perpetual Desolations; never to be Built again, or more Inhabited.</p>
            <p>And yet we find That <hi>Ever,</hi> or <hi>Eternity,</hi> run out, at the end of seventy years Captivity; in which, not only the Threatnings, but Curse also, was accomplished, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out; as we find in that remarkable Prayer, left us in the 9. of <hi>Daniel:</hi> (to be compared with That of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>Wrath is come upon them to the uttermost:)</hi> and Then it is a <hi>Blessed Land</hi> again, and a Blessed People: and a Blessing also to the World and Nations round about. For, <hi>It shall come to pass, that As you were a Curse, to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then round about, so shall you be a Blessing;</hi> as we read in <hi>Zechary;</hi> yea and a <hi>Blessing</hi> to <hi>All Nations,</hi> as the Promise is in <hi>Malachy</hi> (and divers other Prophets:) who doth not only shew them a way, how from a <hi>Curse,</hi> they should come to be Blessed, and a Blessing also to All Nations: But in the very close of that Prophet, and so of the whole Law, God himself provideth a Cure for the Earth also; <hi>Lest he should come, and smite the Earth, with a Curse.</hi> Even the <hi>Earth;</hi> which was That, which God had <hi>Cursed,</hi> so much more than <hi>Adam.</hi> Yet <hi>Elijah</hi> must come, lest That very Cursed Earth, should be smitten with the Curse. And as the Jews repeat That verse <hi>of Elijahs Coming</hi> (after the last verse,) lest the Scripture should end, in <hi>Curse:</hi> so it seemeth, God also meant to <hi>repeat</hi> His Coming. Or to send him (or his spirit) Twice. Or, before the latter Coming of Christ; as before the Former. There being also <hi>Two daies</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> There spoken of: One is called <hi>Great</hi> (and so was his first Coming;) and the other <hi>Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> or <hi>Terrible:</hi> which seems the Epithet of his latter Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, much rather than his former. And it may be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that after <hi>John the Baptist</hi> was dead (even at our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viors
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51941:83"/>
coming from his Transfiguration: which was such a Type of his <hi>second Coming and Kingdom:)</hi> He Then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth, that <hi>Elijah Shall first Come, and Shall restore All things.</hi> Which is a Proverb with the <hi>Jews</hi> to this day: and was also the constant Belief and Expectation of the Primitive Church of Christians; as may be shewed by a full Jury of Ancient Fathers, of the Christian Church.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>John</hi> the Baptists Time was called the <hi>Day-spring from on High:</hi> So it may be, <hi>Elijahs</hi> second Coming also, (before the second coming of Christ,) is hinted in all those Scriptures, which speak of a <hi>Morning Star,</hi> to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Sun of Righteousness:</hi> which is also the phrase u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the same Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> who promiseth the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Elijah.</hi> And the <hi>Revelation</hi> plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth That <hi>Morning Star,</hi> in the dark time of <hi>Jesabel;</hi> and in <hi>Jesabels</hi> time, <hi>Elijah</hi> slew her Prophets, and the Prophets of <hi>Baal:</hi> and so made that great change both in Church and State, that in the <hi>Revel</hi> may be hinted, by a Power to break the Nations. Though That phrase, reach up, as High as <hi>Josuab,</hi> breaking the seven Nations: As the <hi>Manna,</hi> in the Church before, may intimate their passing through the Wilderness towards <hi>Canaan.</hi> And that phrase of <hi>Breaking the Nations,</hi> being coupled with that Promise of <hi>Elijahs</hi> coming, under the Notion of the Bright <hi>Morning Star,</hi> may put us in mind of a speech of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>Job: Hast thou considered the Day-star,</hi> or the <hi>Day-spring: which I have made to shake the wicked out of the Earth? They shall be turned as wax to the seal</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>when the wicked are cut off, Thou shalt see,</hi> those Promises ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, that the <hi>Meek shall inherit the Earth:</hi> As we read in the Psalms, and in our Saviours Blessings also; and the Revelation addeth to That Blessing, <hi>that there shall be no more Curse.</hi> No more Curse.</p>
            <p>For, the very <hi>Leaves of the Trees,</hi> about the Waters of Life, <hi>shall heal the Nations.</hi> And those Waters flow out round about; Even to the <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> or Lake of <hi>Sodom</hi> (for, even <hi>Her Captivity</hi> must return again; as we saw in <hi>Abrahams</hi> History compared with <hi>Ezekiel:)</hi> and where ever those Waters came, there was Life, and Healing; and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51941:83"/>
no more curse. Its possible also, that the Time of This great change may be hinted, in the fourteenth year, or second <hi>Sabboth,</hi> of Prophetical years (as <hi>David</hi> also was the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth from <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Number of his Name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports:) after the four great Monarchies had Lorded it, Twelve whole years: which may be also Prophetical years from <hi>Nimrod:</hi> Or from <hi>Abrahams</hi> Time, or Promise.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Israel</hi> got off their <hi>Curss;</hi> and Gods goodnesse turned it into a Blessing; (as our evil sometimes turns our <hi>Blessings into Curses;</hi> so doth his Goodnesse, turn his <hi>Curses in Blessings:</hi> whence it may be, the very same Word in Hebrew, signifieth both to <hi>Curse</hi> and to <hi>Blesse;</hi> as we find in several places of <hi>Job,</hi> and other Scriptures:) So did <hi>Edom</hi> also, cast off his <hi>Yoak,</hi> and his <hi>Curse</hi> also it seems, and got a Blessing. As we see in his Fathers Blessing and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Which was also hinted by his Brother, when by wrestling he had got the Name of <hi>Israel, a Prince with God;</hi> and had prevailed also with men: he useth his <hi>Power for Edification</hi> presently (as the Apostle speaketh) <hi>and not for Destruction.</hi> And cometh out in the Power and Spirit of that God, whom he had so conquered: and doth not only carry a <hi>Blessing</hi> to his Brother <hi>Esaw,</hi> and intreateth him; but with an Holy violence, <hi>forceth</hi> him to take it. <hi>Receive the Blessing, which I bring thee from God:</hi> and he urged (or forced) <hi>him,</hi> by pressing on him, <hi>and he took it.</hi> And we read, how he cast off the Yoak of <hi>Israel</hi> (even to this day:) at the time of <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> or the <hi>Lords Judgement.</hi> Yea, he did not only cast off <hi>Israels</hi> Yoak, but came to rule and reign over <hi>Israel</hi> himself, at the comming of Christ. As we find in the <hi>Herods,</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi> the King, from the Seed of <hi>Edom,</hi> hated, cursed <hi>Esaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which we may consider when we read of Gods Shining out from <hi>Seir:</hi> Coming from <hi>Teman,</hi> or appearing from <hi>Paran.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> cryeth, <hi>Who is This that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from</hi> Edom, <hi>with Dyed garments from</hi> Bozra? <hi>I that speak Righteousnesse; mighty to Save.</hi> And his Red Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may allude to <hi>Edom,</hi> if it signifie Red, as many will have it: which may be rather a <hi>Glutton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though <hi>Balaam</hi> say, <hi>the Star of</hi> Jacob, or the <hi>Scepter</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:51941:84"/>
               <hi>of Israel</hi> shall smite the <hi>Corners</hi> of <hi>Moab,</hi> and Destroy all the <hi>Children of Seth;</hi> and <hi>Edom shall be a Possession</hi> (to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Obadiah:)</hi> yet the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> speaketh of <hi>Edoms Possessing the Tabernacle of David,</hi> when raised up. As we may Translate the words, cited also in the <hi>Acts:</hi> where <hi>Edom</hi> also, is coupled with Those that <hi>call upon,</hi> or are <hi>called by, the Name of the Lord.</hi> &amp; in <hi>Dan</hi> we read that <hi>Edom</hi> (with <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon)</hi> shall escape out of the hand of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer, which some make Antichrist, or the <hi>Turck:</hi> who to this day payes Tribute to those <hi>Arabs</hi> of <hi>Edom, Moab and Ammon,</hi> rather then Ruleth over them.</p>
            <p>Yet, as <hi>Babylon</hi> is threatned with perpetual Desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, because he <hi>laid the World wast, and would not open his Prison Doors to let his Prisoners loose, and send them home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again</hi> (which hath been very comfortable when I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed it to Christ in prayer:)</p>
            <p>So also, the great Curse, Threatned to <hi>Edom,</hi> was, because <hi>he forgot the Brotherly kindnesse,</hi> and the Covenant that should have been between Him <hi>and his Brother Jacob; and let his Wrath tear for ever.</hi> Which hath also been sweet to my thoughts, when I have applyed it to Christ: and asked, whither <hi>He also,</hi> would put himself under the <hi>perpetual Curse of</hi> Edom, <hi>by forgetting the Brotherly Kindnesse,</hi> and Brotherly Covenant? and by letting <hi>His wrath also Tear for Ever?</hi> God forbid.</p>
            <p>Next unto Cursed <hi>Edom, Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> may be well placed; the Incestuous Children of <hi>Lot:</hi> which signifieth a veil (or cloth) as God himself seemeth to allude; when after <hi>Lot was Separate from Abraham</hi> (for <hi>Israel</hi> must dwell alone) God said, <hi>Lift up now thy eyes and look, &amp;c.</hi> And again in the Prophet <hi>Isa. I will take away the Veil,</hi> or <hi>Lot</hi> (for, that is the Word in Hebrew) <hi>from the face of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Even in that Mountain, where he will tread down Moab,</hi> who was Son of that <hi>Lot,</hi> twice named There, in Heb.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Moab and Ammon,</hi> it is said, <hi>they should never come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of God;</hi> (one of the worst threatnings in all the Bible:) and the cause in <hi>Deut.</hi> and <hi>Neh.</hi> is, <hi>because they met not their Brethren with Bread and Water; and hired Balaam to curse them, but God turned his curse into a blessing;</hi> and so
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51941:84"/>
I hope he did This Curse also, of <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon.</hi> For, their Ever, or Never, is in another place, limited by Ten <hi>Generations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing God himself hath expounded <hi>ever,</hi> and <hi>never,</hi> (in the Case of <hi>Ammon and Moab)</hi> by Ten <hi>Generations;</hi> Why may not we Take it so, in other places also? Especially seeing it is often used, where it cannot be meant of <hi>Eternity.</hi> As the Servant, <hi>bored in his ear,</hi> must serve for <hi>ever:</hi> which is but till the next <hi>Jubile:</hi> as we may find in the twenty fifth of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and all the Jews, on those places. And Christ also tells us, <hi>the Servant abides not in the House for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> And how often is it said, <hi>Jerusalem</hi> shall <hi>Ever be deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and never be built again, or Inhabited?</hi> (As we found in <hi>Idumeah)</hi> And yet it was built again, after the seventy Years Captivity; and may be yet again, after all This. As we find <hi>Ay,</hi> was built again, and inhabited, in the return of <hi>Nehemiah (the Lords Comfort, or Repentance;)</hi> Though <hi>Josuah</hi> himself, that mighty Type of Jesus, had made it so signally Desolate, and that for <hi>Ever</hi> also; <hi>a Desolate heap for ever:</hi> As the very Name may intimate in Hebrew, Greek, and divers other Languages. As the Stones also placed by the same <hi>Josuah,</hi> are called <hi>a Memorial for ever.</hi> And so are the Rites of the <hi>Passover,</hi> and the <hi>Shew-bread:</hi> and <hi>Aarons</hi> Priest-hood; Yea, in the very Family of <hi>Phine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> (though it was soon changed:) nay the very Garments of the Priests, are a Statute for <hi>ever.</hi> And his Trimming the Lamps: and Restraint of blood and fat also, for <hi>ever:</hi> and Circumcission is called an <hi>everlasting Covenant in their Flesh.</hi> And <hi>Samuel</hi> was presented at the Tabernacle, <hi>to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide There for ever.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> was chosen to be King over Israel for Ever: and his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>I know that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever God doth, it shall be for Ever.</hi> And I know not any Word, or Phrase, for <hi>Eternity,</hi> in Scripture, that is not applyed to Heaven and Earth, or other things, which pass away: But <hi>Christs Words shall Never passe away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for <hi>Moab and Ammon; As I live, saith the Lord, the God of Israel</hi> (and the Common Rule is, that Threatnings with an Oath, are never reversed:) <hi>Surely</hi> Moab <hi>shall be as</hi> Sodom, <hi>and</hi> Ammon <hi>as</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>and Perpetual Desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:51941:85"/>
as we read in <hi>Zeph.</hi> And yet in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> God promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to bring back the Captivity of <hi>Ammon</hi> (as of <hi>Sodom</hi> also, in <hi>Ezechiel;)</hi> and of <hi>Moab,</hi> in the latter dayes: or Time of <hi>Messiah:</hi> as the Jews use to expound that Phrase of the latter Dayes.</p>
            <p>And in the Tenth Generation, They also, may enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of God: though it was threatned, They should Never enter. And as <hi>David</hi> was the fourteenth Generation (and the fourteenth, seventy Years) from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi> so was <hi>Boas</hi> the Tenth, or eleventh: who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Ruth</hi> a <hi>Moabite</hi> (who might be the Tenth from Lot) who by a former Man of <hi>Iudah;</hi> was Daughter to <hi>Naomy (Beauty)</hi> Wife to <hi>Elimelech;</hi> who had two Sons, <hi>Mahlon</hi> (weaknesse) and <hi>Chilion</hi> (consumption, or perfection, or Espousal:) who had <hi>Orpha</hi> (stiffneckednesse) who left her Mother, The other, <hi>Ruth,</hi> who choosing her Mothers <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and God,</hi> is led to a field of <hi>Boaz,</hi> and is bid stick close to his Maidens; <hi>(O tell me where thou feedest, and restest at Noon, for why should I stray?)</hi> and at length is bid, to lie at his feet, and say, <hi>Thou art my Kinsman</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> bids us say to <hi>Wisdome, Thou art my Sister.)</hi> And Christ is both <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin and Boaz,</hi> the Wisdom and <hi>Strength of God,</hi> and so very near a kin to <hi>Elimelech</hi> (my God the King:) see the third of <hi>Esay,</hi> compared with the 7, 8, 17. 22. of the 23. chap. and see the Women of <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> married to Kings of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael and Judah.</p>
            <p>And <hi>David</hi> in his straits, carried his Parents, to the King of <hi>Moab;</hi> saying, <hi>Let my Father and Mother be with you, till I know what God will do for me.</hi> Or as <hi>Esay, Let my Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casts dwell with Thee</hi> Moab: <hi>be thou a Covert to them. And in Mercy shall the Throne be established</hi> (as we found before in the Psalms and Proverbs;) <hi>and he shall sit upon it in Truth, in the Tabernacle of</hi> David: <hi>judging and seeking judgement, and Hasting Righteousnesse.</hi> And <hi>my Heart shall Cry for Moab</hi> (O the Tender Heart of God!) <hi>Let his Fugitives flee to</hi> Zoar. As his Father <hi>Lot</hi> did from <hi>Sodom</hi> to <hi>Zoar:</hi> which seemeth therefore to have stood in <hi>Moab,</hi> on the <hi>East of Iordan;</hi> and not on the <hi>West,</hi> as the Tables place it. And again, <hi>send ye the Lamb to the Ruler of the People, to the mount</hi>

               <hi>of the Daughter of</hi> Zion; as alluding to the King of <hi>Moabs</hi> paying Lambs for Tribute to the King of <hi>Israel.</hi> But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Ahabs</hi> Death, <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Edom</hi> also, <hi>brake their yoak;</hi> and freed themselves from <hi>Iaacob;</hi> under <hi>Iehoram (the high Lord:)</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Elisha</hi> (or <hi>God Iesus,</hi> as the Name implies:) who had a double portion of the Spirit of <hi>Elijah the Lord my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And shall a Man be able to give a <hi>Double portion of his Spirit,</hi> (and That, at his Parting and going away;) and shall not He that hath <hi>the Residue of the spirit</hi> (in opposition to <hi>shear Baser, the Residue of the Flesh,</hi> which is so many times in Scripture Language, for <hi>near Kindred:)</hi> or He that <hi>hath the Spirit</hi> without Limits, <hi>or not by measure:</hi> shall not He, be able and willing also, to give <hi>His Holy Spirit unto all that ask it?</hi> and a <hi>Double Portion</hi> unto All his <hi>First Born?</hi> Who saw, and yet see, him ascending; and cry to him, <hi>my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my Father, the Charriot of Israel, and the Horsemen thereof!</hi> And it may be, That remarkable promise of <hi>the Spirit, unto all that ask it,</hi> may allude to. This very Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of <hi>Elijah,</hi> giving his Spirit to <hi>Elisha;</hi> crying, <hi>my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my Father.</hi> As in <hi>Luke</hi> it is (not as some read it, <hi>your Heavenly Father,</hi> But) <hi>Your Father, who is, Out of Heaven: or came out of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he took the Mantle of</hi> Elijah, <hi>and smote the Waters saying</hi> (as we may now say, Here indeed is the Mantle of <hi>Elijah,</hi> O but) <hi>Where is the Lord God</hi> (and the Spirit) of <hi>Elijah? and the Waters parted Hither and Thither.</hi> Though I do not yet say, when they so parted (as before, at <hi>Josuahs</hi> coming over <hi>Jordan,)</hi> there began an <hi>Other Generation,</hi> or a <hi>New Age of the World.</hi> As at first, <hi>dividing the Waters, by the Firmament of Heaven; with the Waters above the Heavens:</hi> of which in the Psalms, and divers other places, that I speak not of <hi>Esdras, Ecclesasticus,</hi> or <hi>Wisdom</hi> of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Sons of the Prophets said, the Spirit of Elijah rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on Elisha: and they bowed down,</hi> or Worshipped him: and afterwards he enlarged their Colledge, and it may be, their Spirit also. The Hebrew Word <hi>Saul,</hi> used in That Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, puts me in mind How <hi>Saul</hi> cut off the Lords Priests: and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51941:86"/>
How he fell, and How the Jews say, He was Recovered aand saved: though I dare not say, by the Mediation of <hi>Elias,</hi> or <hi>Elisha. Who,</hi> they say, <hi>must come and loose all knots;</hi> or, as our Saviour saith, <hi>He must Restore All Things;</hi> yea and that, <hi>after John the Baptist</hi> was beheaded.</p>
            <p>And some other words, in That History, put me also in mind, How <hi>Elijah</hi> destroyed the false prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and how <hi>Elisha</hi> did encourage and enlarge the True Prophets: and at length, by one of the young pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, annointeth <hi>Jehu</hi> (which yet was given in charge to <hi>Elijah</hi> himself: One of the best Texts I know for <hi>Deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.)</hi> And <hi>Jehu</hi> destroyeth <hi>Jezabel,</hi> who had not onely Destroyed, and Corrupted, the Lords Prophets, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Elisha;</hi> but had even quite stifled, the very Spirit of <hi>Prophecy, in the Seed of God:</hi> as the Hebrew words, <hi>Naboth in Jezreel,</hi> may import. Which may be compared with That of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> opposed by the <hi>Bright morning Star,</hi> breaking and scattering the Dark Clouds, and bringing in, the Morning, and Our <hi>Rising and cloathing with White and fresh Linnen</hi> in fourth and fifth Churches: and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>slaying of the two <hi>Witnesses</hi> (with the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy)</hi> in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> And the sixth Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> (or <hi>Brotherly Love)</hi> is plainly the <hi>New Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> (as Christ himself expresseth, in his Epistle to that Church:) before the General <hi>Iudgement of the People,</hi> or <hi>Laodicea:</hi> as the Word signifies. Which may also be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the latter part of the eleventh, and also the four last Chapters of the Revelation. Where the great Judgement also is Described, which the Prophets place in <hi>the Valley of Jehoshaphat</hi> (whose very Name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the <hi>Lords Judgement.)</hi> Which was also called the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Beraca,</hi> or <hi>Blessing;</hi> When they had troden down <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Edom.</hi> Which we find also cited in the Prophets, as foretelling somewhat, yet to be done, in the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And had it not been for <hi>Jehoshaphat, Elisha</hi> said, he would not have seen the other two Kings (met against <hi>Moab</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so:) saying <hi>Nay, but hath God gathered these Kings</hi> (and their people also) <hi>together, to Destroy them?</hi> But as <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaphat</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:51941:86"/>
smarted sorely, for joyning with <hi>Ahab</hi> and his Sons: so They Got by His good Company. In which, we may see, God pitying a Wicked man, and Hearing his Cry and Prayer: as most remarkably after, he did the Prayer of <hi>Jehoahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 4, 5, 6. 23.</p>
            <p>How the Waters came at the <hi>morning Sacrifice;</hi> and How he multiplyed the VViddows Oyl, that was like to lose her two Sons for bondslaves (which may be a great Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:) and how he gave a Son to a barren VVoman, and then raised him from the Dead: and how he Healed the Pottage, when Death was in the Pot; and fed a great Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude with a few <hi>barly loves;</hi> and Healed <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Lepar: and struck <hi>Gehezy</hi> with <hi>Leprosie,</hi> for seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things of the VVorld, in an ill time, or season. And How his dead bones raised a dead man: and many other things, we might observe, in this great Type of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>But especially His striking his Enemies blind, and then bringing them into <hi>Samaria:</hi> and when the King of <hi>Israel</hi> said, <hi>shall I smite them my Father, shall I smite them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He said, <hi>Noe. Wilt thou smite them, whom thou hast taken Prisoners, with thy sword and thy bow? Set bread and meat before them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And I have often heard one say, he knew not, that he ever had a sweeter return from Christ, then when once in great anguish, he could onely say, <hi>Now shew thy Kindnesse to thy Poor Enemy; Whom thou hast taken Captive, with Thy sword and thy bow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the King of <hi>Israels</hi> Feasting Those Prisoners, (for, <hi>he made great provision for them)</hi> may be more considered hereafter; and compared with That of <hi>Solomon, if thy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy hunger, feed him, and the Lord shall not onely requite, but reward thee:</hi> and this History may be the more considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because it may perhaps, be found the most desperate or most forlorn condition here on earth. VVhen a man Degenerates into a <hi>judicial blindnesse.</hi> Except it may yet be worse, to come unto a <hi>Beastly Spirit and Nature.</hi> VVhich is, when after great, and perhaps very long, <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Light and Love,</hi> (shewed from God and Christ) a man
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51941:87"/>
doth not only disobey, but <hi>grieve and quench that good spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> so much and so long, that at length it leaves him to degenerate into a blind and seared conscience, and a <hi>Brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Nature: till he becomes as a <hi>Dog,</hi> biting and snarling at all about him; and <hi>returning to his vomit;</hi> and as the <hi>Swine,</hi> to <hi>wallowing in the mire;</hi> and also <hi>Turning and Tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those that lay good things</hi> before him. Who now <hi>tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples them under his feet, and offers despite to the spirit of Grace, and accounteth his Saviors blood, as unclean and profane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was It perhaps, the Psalmist so prayed against; not only when he cries against <hi>Presumptuous sins;</hi> but Then also perhaps, when he prayeth so earnestly <hi>to be kept from the Dog,</hi> or Dog-like Nature: of which he speaketh divers times. And This it may be, is also, in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of <hi>Worshiping the Beast, and receiving his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter:</hi> where it is also said, that <hi>All the world should so fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Beast, but those that were written in the Lambs book of Life; From the Foundation of the World.</hi> And I have somtimes inclined to believe, that Christ is not only <hi>the True Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world;</hi> but that he <hi>Truly loves every man, as he loves himself;</hi> so long as he is a <hi>Man.</hi> But when he degenerates into the <hi>Nature and spirit of a Beast,</hi> (and it may be, the evil spirits are in the species of Ravening Beasts, as good Angels in others:) and when one so degenerates into the <hi>Beastly Nature,</hi> Then one falls out of <hi>Christs Neighborhood.</hi> Yea, and it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps come so far, that they may be <hi>no more warned,</hi> lest they <hi>Turn and Tear those that cast such precious Pearls before them.</hi> And in such a forlorn case, it may be hard to shew, why they should, or how they can, expect any more favor from <hi>Christ,</hi> than a <hi>Beast:</hi> or why so much. And It may be, This is, That <hi>Sin unto Death,</hi> of which the Apostle speaks: when he addeth also, that <hi>for such, He doth not say, that one ought to pray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet he Doth not say, One ought <hi>not to pray, even for such also.</hi> Which is One of the reasons, why I pray <hi>for All I ought, and All I may,</hi> pray for. When I am crying to an Infinite God, for All my <hi>Relations,</hi> (and Truly they are very many, as I somtimes say to God: for, I am <hi>Related to</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:51941:87"/>
               <hi>the whole Creation of God;</hi> and yet farther, than I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press:) and I know not, But I may, somtimes pray, for some, That, I am not Tyed, in duty, or by express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to pray for. But I am still Tyed, <hi>to Love my Neighbor as my self;</hi> and so is <hi>Christ also,</hi> I Trust: or else I lose one of the sweetest pieces of the whole Bible: and himself also brings the Notion of a <hi>Neighbor</hi> out so large, that it may not only include <hi>Strangers,</hi> but <hi>Enemies</hi> also. And <hi>when a mans waies please the Lord, he will make his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> his greatest Enemies, <hi>to be at peace with him.</hi> And if an Angel, or if God himself forbid a man to pray, for such or such a person, City, Nation, or number of men: yet This, may be, but to draw him larger out: by shewing the danger of such persons. As we see in the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and others, that never prayed more sweetly, than when they were forbidden to pray, for such or such: and yet they prayed Then most; because they saw, there was most need. And Gods commands never do, never will, forbid us, to <hi>Love our Neighbor as our self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that, No man may ever despair; we found Gods Love of pity and compassion, so to reach to Beasts also, that his great Command is, that They also, must be brought to keep the <hi>Sabboth,</hi> and to rest the Rest of God: <hi>and a good man</hi> (and Christ is the Best of men) must be, and will be, <hi>Merciful to his very Beast</hi> also. Yea to the Beast of his <hi>Enemy,</hi> and <hi>Him that hates him:</hi> as we see comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And for Those also, that degenerate into the <hi>Beastly Nature,</hi> (lest They also should at length <hi>despair:)</hi> not to speak how often men are invited in the Prophets and the Revelation, to come back again from the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>out of Babylon;</hi> which shews, they might return, <hi>Repent and live:</hi> we see How graciously God dealt with <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar;</hi> Though he so degenerated into a Beast; which may be much worse, than to be made a Beast at <hi>first, and so born.</hi> How Wisdom also crieth unto <hi>Scorners;</hi> and How it is promised <hi>She Shall yet cry;</hi> even unto <hi>Scorners:</hi> may be here again observed out of the <hi>Proverbs.</hi> To be compared with the 48. of <hi>Esay,</hi> sweetly calling, inviting, and wooing the most obstinate sinners, and <hi>Treacherous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volters.</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:51941:88"/>
Yet <hi>for my Names sake;</hi> and again, <hi>for my Names sake I will resrain: For, How shall I cut thee off? O that thou hadst,</hi> or wouldst yet, <hi>hearken:</hi> For, He speaketh in the present Tence, <hi>I am yet teaching thee &amp;c.</hi> And how shall I give away the <hi>Glory</hi> of my <hi>Patience, and my Goodness? Shall I be weary also of well doing? and having begun in the spirit of Goodness, shall I also end, in a fleshly Wrath or Passion?</hi> God forbid.</p>
            <p>The Psalmist also saith, <hi>He received Gifts for Rebels also</hi> (even for Rebels) as we saw before; the worst of sinners. And we see how gracious Christ was also, to the <hi>Woman of Canaan;</hi> although she were as a <hi>Dog;</hi> or one degenerate into a <hi>Dog-like spirit and nature. Yet the Dogs also enjoy Crumbs:</hi> and in great Families (and Christ is <hi>Lord of All the Family in Heaven and Earth.)</hi> The very Dogs have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Diet, than it may be, Children have, in other houses. And That Dog-like Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was received into favor, and had great Grace, and <hi>Faith</hi> given her, though a cursed Woman: under the greatest Curse both of God and Man. <hi>Noah</hi> cursed her; and God also cursed her so, that he commanded all his people to hate and curse her Nation so, that they might neither <hi>Treat with them, nor seek their good, all their daies.</hi> Which we see how Christ observed towards her; when he would not so much as Treat with her, or speak to her, till his Disciples (as the Representatives of his Church) <hi>interceded</hi> with him for her: or, it may be against her; for, the Text is somwhat doubtful. Yet <hi>by Faith Her heart also is purified;</hi> and there is <hi>No difference between Jew and Gentile;</hi> No not a <hi>Cursed Canaanite.</hi>

            <p>Which might also be seen, long before, when the high, and proud, and stout, <hi>Gibeonites</hi> (some of the chiefest of those cursed <hi>Canaanites,)</hi> bowed down: and though by a <hi>Wile</hi> only they got into a Covenant with <hi>Joshua,</hi> (a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Type of <hi>Jesus,)</hi> yet they could never be cast off: No, <hi>by no means, by no means.</hi> But when <hi>Adonizedech (the Lords Justice)</hi> King of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and other Kings with him, would have chalenged them back again, as to have brought them back into the Curse again: <hi>Joshua</hi> must not
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51941:88"/>
only stand up, and rise early; Yea and march all night, in defence of these poor (late accursed) <hi>Canaanites;</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the <hi>Sun and Moon</hi> must stand still over <hi>Gibeon;</hi> and the course of <hi>Nature</hi> must be changed: rather than <hi>Gibeon</hi> must be deserted, or so much as left into the hand of <hi>Gods Justice in his own Throne:</hi> which is <hi>Adonizedech King of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Gibeon,</hi> is not only made, one of the greatest Scenes of Gods presence, a long time together, (as we often find in Scripture, before it was <hi>Solomons</hi> greatest High Place: Where God also appeared to him, after such great Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in <hi>Gibeon:)</hi> But also This very History of the strange Works of God, in defending <hi>Gibeon,</hi> is made the Type of what God means to do <hi>(Hereafter also, I suppose)</hi> for his People; and his Enemies also; <hi>When he shall rise up to do his great and strange Work of</hi> Gibeon, <hi>or as he did at</hi> Gibeon; <hi>or Mount Perazim.</hi> Where also, at <hi>Davids</hi> coming up, the five great Lords of the <hi>Philistins,</hi> rose up against him; as at <hi>Gibeon,</hi> the five great Kings of the <hi>Amorites</hi> or <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> against <hi>Joshua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And about <hi>Gibeon</hi> also, the great Quarrel was ended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>David,</hi> that is <hi>Love;</hi> and the House of <hi>Saul,</hi> that is <hi>the Grave or Hell.</hi> Acted by <hi>Abner,</hi> the <hi>Fathers Light or Understanding;</hi> and by <hi>Joab,</hi> his <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Affection,</hi> which were here reconciled; and a New <hi>Heaven and Earth</hi> brought up. As afterwards, the New <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> when <hi>David</hi> beat the <hi>Jebusites,</hi> which had their name from <hi>Tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down:</hi> for, the Holy City must be Trodden down, till the Times of the Centiles be fulfilled. And a Type of This <hi>Fulfilling of Time,</hi> might be in That, when the twelve men of <hi>Joab and Abner,</hi> ran through one another; as the twelve hours of Day and Night; and there fell down, slain on <hi>Sauls</hi> side, 360. For, their common Year had so many Daies in it.</p>
            <p>And though <hi>Saul</hi> himself was dead, cut off by God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he sought to the Devil, and <hi>would not seek to God,</hi> as we read in <hi>Chronicles,</hi> although he complained that <hi>God would not answer him;</hi> But the Truth was, he <hi>would not seek to God</hi> (who could yet have pardoned All; but he would
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51941:89"/>
not ask it:) and God therefore cut him off; and for his sparing <hi>Amaleck,</hi> himself was slain by an <hi>Amalachite;</hi> if at least, he Lyed not to <hi>David;</hi> (who could not be quiet in the Throne till he had also cut off the <hi>Amalachites,</hi> whom <hi>Saul</hi> spared:) even after <hi>Sauls</hi> Death, His House and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was sorely punished (and <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdom also affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with divers years <hi>Famine;)</hi> for <hi>Sauls</hi> afflicting the poor <hi>Gibeonites;</hi> though it were <hi>in Zeal to Israel.</hi> So much doth God abhor All Cruelty, and hard Usage of any poor men; though in never so much Zeal for God, or his Cause, or any of his People. Which the Lord make me, and all mine, and all His, still to remember, in all my Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: lest I afflict some poor <hi>Gibeonite, in Zeal to Israel;</hi> and <hi>thinking I do God good service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By All which, we may also learn, that even Those that are most Hated or cursed by God, as These <hi>Gibeonites and Canaanites</hi> were (and <hi>Children of Wrath and curse,</hi> as much as any Nation or People we read of:) Yet they may come to be <hi>Blessed</hi> and <hi>Loved,</hi> by the same God; who so hated and cursed them. And yet He changeth not himself, but Them; whom he first cursed, and so shut them up in guilt, and sin, and sorrow; That their cries, (that is, His in them) might draw out his own bowels, and compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more to them, by how much more he had cursed or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted them. Which is one of the great Mysteries of the Gospel, running Through the Law (and the Prophets) and the Curses thereof. Which should teach us not to despair, under the hardest and worst words, God doth, or ever will speak against us, while we live. O do not say, <hi>This Evil is from God, and why then should I wait or Hope on Him?</hi> Yea rather, make hast to bow down and Worship, and seek his face, as the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Captain to <hi>Elijah:</hi> For the King of <hi>Israel is a merciful King;</hi> He is a gracious God; and He <hi>delighteth in those that sear him, and Hope in his goodness, Trembling at his Word. For it is still good for a man to Hope and patiently wait for the salvation of God.</hi> Let me also tell you, It is an honor that God will speak to us, though he do but chide us, Threaten us, sharply rebuke, or chasten us: which himself and we may call Hating or cursing us.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51941:89"/>
But His Frowns, and Chidings, and Hatings, and Cursings as we may interpret them, may be better than the Smiles, and Loves, and Embracings, of the whole World besides. And we do not only read him saying, <hi>I have forsaken the dearly beloved of my soul</hi> (as we see Christ himself was so <hi>forsaken)</hi> but also, that he <hi>Hated Her:</hi> even the dearly beloved of his soul (as we read in <hi>Jeremy:)</hi> and did not only <hi>strike her with an</hi> hard, and sore, and <hi>Cruel stroke, as an Enemy;</hi> but even <hi>Curse her,</hi> and <hi>make her a Curse.</hi> As we know he dealt with Christ himself, his dearly beloved Son; and as a Type of Christ, with <hi>Israel: Because he knew them</hi> (and they should have known him) <hi>above All Nations of the Earth: Therefore he would punish them, above All Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: So that he never did, nor ever would do, so Hardly, to any in the World, as to Israel.</hi> As we read in <hi>Ezek. Daniel,</hi> and from Christ himself in the Gospel. And yet This, was his darling people, and the dearly beloved of his Soul; a Type of Jesus Christ, and All his <hi>Elect, or first sruits;</hi> or Blessed of the Lord; that were to have a <hi>double portion,</hi> as his <hi>first Born.</hi> But it was both of shame and glory. For, even These Darlings, and these dearly Beloved of his soul, are often called the <hi>Forsaken, Desolate, Afflicted;</hi> yea, <hi>Hated, Abhorred,</hi> and <hi>Cursed:</hi> Nay, <hi>Cursed with a great, and sore, and heavy, bitter Curse:</hi> as we read in <hi>Malachy.</hi> Where yet to That very People, whom he so cursed, He presently saith, Yet Try me, <hi>Prove me yet, whether</hi> (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this cursing you, yet if you will but do, that you may, and shall, by my Grace, if you will; and He also gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to will;) <hi>you shall be Blessed;</hi> and be Blessings also, to your Neighbors and Relations: yea and such Blessings, that the <hi>very Windows of Heaven shall be opened, and pour down-bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings on you,</hi> Notwithstanding all the Curses you lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. So it was with <hi>Israel;</hi> so it shall be. For, In every Every place, Where <hi>you were put to shame, you shall have Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and you shall be a praise to <hi>All the Earth:</hi> and where it was said, <hi>Go you cursed</hi> and rejected <hi>Loammi,</hi> and <hi>Loruhama; on whom I will no more have mercy;</hi> yet come again, ye Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; for <hi>you are my People,</hi> and I will be your God: And you shall be Blessed. So it was with <hi>Israel,</hi> and with <hi>Gibeon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:51941:90"/>
Yet it might be added, that This very <hi>Gibeon</hi> was one of the Cities to which God forbid his People <hi>to offer Peace, or to shew mercy, or to save any living:</hi> but commanded them, <hi>utterly to destroy it, and to save alive Nothing that breathed in it.</hi> And so it was with all the Cities of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> the Head of All those <hi>Canaanites:</hi> or if you will, the <hi>Tongue,</hi> or <hi>Speakers</hi> of them All. The <hi>Zamzummims</hi> or great <hi>Thinkers,</hi> were followed by <hi>Amorites,</hi> great <hi>Talkers:</hi> and their great Lord was <hi>Sihon</hi> King of <hi>Heshbon:</hi> That is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and <hi>Sighing.</hi> Which are All conquered by <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is also the more considerable, because These were Excepted out of that general <hi>Law of War,</hi> which was given to <hi>Israel;</hi> and so to Christ also, who was made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole Law; and was forbidden to kill; and commanded to save and keep alive, as much, or more than Any. Being of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was put <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law,</hi> More than All other Nations of the World besides. So that it may be better for us, that <hi>he took the Seed of Abraham,</hi> than the Seed of Any other Man.</p>
            <p>Now the General Law of War, given them in <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> which they might not transgress (being but a branch of the sixth Command;) was This, <hi>That when ever they went against a City, or a People,</hi> (except only those seven Nations which were so cursed by God, and devoted to extream de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:) <hi>They must first offer Peace.</hi> For, <hi>the Man, and Men of God, must be Gentle; ready more to save, than to kill, or to harm.</hi> Elijah <hi>called for Fire from Heaven,</hi> as it must come on those that <hi>compass the Holy City,</hi> (for, the Promise to <hi>Abraham</hi> was, <hi>to Curse them that Cursed Him,)</hi> and fourty two children were devoured: though I do not compare them with the fourty two months in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> But <hi>Elisha</hi> was generally of another Spirit, and especially called <hi>the Man of God.</hi> To which the Apostle may allude, or to meek <hi>Moses:</hi> in That to <hi>Timothy.</hi> The <hi>Man of God must be gentle.</hi> But when the Disciples-asked, <hi>If fire should come from Heaven, as to</hi> Elijah? Christ answered, <hi>You know not what a sweet spirit you must have, and be, if you will be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, or men of God,</hi> and bearing the Image of God and Christ; who was the Man of God more than All the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51941:90"/>
World, and <hi>gentle unto All;</hi> even to the worst of Enemies; and <hi>those that did oppose themselves: taken in the snares of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and led captive by him at his will.</hi> Yet even to them, and to All, <hi>the Man of God must be gentle.</hi> And when he must come to fight against them, (as we see he threatens sorely in the <hi>Revelation;</hi> but yet closeth sweetly, <hi>I must come, except they repent;</hi> and yet again, <hi>Repent, lest I come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee with the Sword of my mouth; and whom I love, I chasten; and Behold I stand at the Door,</hi> and Gate of the City, which I fight against: and <hi>first I knock and offer peace:</hi> for so the Law of War commands.</p>
            <p>And if it answer, Peace (and so His Ministers were sent to every House to <hi>offer Peace; and Peace be to this House;</hi> For They, and He, <hi>are sent to Bless us All, by Turning us from our sins, into the way of Peace;) and If the Son of Peace be There;</hi> which the Law expresseth, <hi>by an Answer of Peace, and coming out to them:</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> intreated <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, to go out to the King of Babylon,</hi> and to accept his terms of Peace. And Then, <hi>All in the House,</hi> or City, <hi>must be kept alive, and may be put to Tribute.</hi> But they may not be destroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if it will, make no place with thee; but will, make warr against thee:</hi> (How much wilfulnesse, is expressed in this slighting Peace, and making War?) If <hi>they will do so, thou shalt besiege it:</hi> But yet so, that thou <hi>cut not down so much as a Tree; any one Tree, that yieldeth fruit for mans Life, or food to preserve Life. And when the Lord shall deliver it into thy hands,</hi> (and thou must be content to stay till thou be clear and sure that God hath delivered it into thy hands:) <hi>Then thou maist destroy the Males, but thou shalt preserve the women, and the children, and the cattel.</hi> (So that the very Cattel must not be slain or hurt) These must be kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. And still take heed, thou do not so much as <hi>boil a Kid in his dams milk</hi> (take heed of all and every kind of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, besides all superstitious customs of some Eastern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which we learn from some of the <hi>Karrait writers:)</hi> and <hi>thou must not take a bird with its young ones;</hi> but must let the one or the other go free. <hi>And thou must not kill the old and young, in the same day; no not for sacrifice:</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> cried
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51941:91"/>
to God, <hi>Why shall he smite the Mother, and the Children, both in one day?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This great Law of war was also punctually observed by God himself and our Lord Jesus, towards the women and children of the <hi>Edomites,</hi> which were hated and accursed people, as any in the World; as a Type of the greatest Reprobation: and yet even to them, when their males were to be destroyed, or at least so threatned; yet <hi>Let thy fatherless children come to me;</hi> for I will preserve them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live (as the Law commands) <hi>and let thy widows trust in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gods inviting <hi>Edoms Widdows and Children,</hi> with promise <hi>to preserve them alive;</hi> (yea and <hi>Zelophehads</hi> Daughters su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Fathers Inheritance also, and had it, adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by God himself; Though their Father, <hi>died for his sin,</hi> or <hi>in his sin;</hi> as we saw before;) may be compared with that Gratious Word in <hi>Moses,</hi> and the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Cronicles,</hi> and <hi>Prophet Ezekiel, That the Son shall not Bear</hi> (much lesse <hi>Dye for) the iniquity of the Father.</hi> Though in other places, God declare himself a <hi>Jealous</hi> God; <hi>Visiting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity of the Fathers on the Children; to the third or fourth Generation.</hi> But yet There also, <hi>shewing mercy to a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Generations</hi> (for, so it is expressed in another place, <hi>to a Thousand Generations) of Those that love him</hi> and <hi>keep his Commandements.</hi> Which from Hence, Runs through all the Bible: and reacheth up to our Good Father <hi>Noah.</hi> We being all, within his <hi>Thousand Generations;</hi> and so also, within That Mercy, which was <hi>sure to Him and His Seed for ever.</hi> Or, as it is There expressed, <hi>for perpetual Generations:</hi> and an <hi>everlasting Covenant,</hi> with him and his Seed also. For, <hi>God blessed him and his sons also;</hi> yea and they shall be Blessed: and God made an <hi>Everlasting Covenant</hi> with them. so, that the Height of all the Covenants afterwards made with <hi>Israel,</hi> was but This, that it should be as sure and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting, as the <hi>Covenant with Noah;</hi> as we read in the Prophets. And <hi>Manasses</hi> (notwithstanding all his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great sins, scarce to be named) Humbled himself, <hi>or judged himself in prayer,</hi> (as the Phrase imports,) <hi>to the God of his Father:</hi> and was Heard, and <hi>accepted in the Beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:51941:91"/>
And as <hi>Manasseh</hi> was the Son of good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> so was he, the Son of wicked <hi>Ahaz</hi> (yet at two years old, before his great wickednesse.) And we may find some of the best men coming from cursed parents. As <hi>Samuel,</hi> and the sweet Singers, from <hi>Korah,</hi> though it is said, <hi>he went quick into the Pit, and All the men that pertained to him:</hi> yet his Sons were preserved so, as to bring forth <hi>Samuel</hi> from, <hi>Elkana</hi> (near akin to the <hi>jealous God,</hi> or <hi>God that begat him) Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, He will be very Gracious:</hi> and <hi>Elihu, He is my God:</hi> from <hi>Tohu,</hi> or the first <hi>Chaos of</hi> Creation: which arose from <hi>Zuph, Hony-comb:</hi> or Root of sweetnesse and goodnesse in the Heart of God: which also turned <hi>Korahs</hi> curse, into prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and Psalmes of blessing: as we find in <hi>Heman,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kindred of <hi>Samuel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have shewed How our Saviour was <hi>made under the Law,</hi> for us; and we have given instances of divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular branches of that Law, he was made under; for the time would fail us to go over All particulars: there being yet very many, that we have not so much as touched; but they may be applied, as we meet them. So that we shall come to delight, to study the Law, and long to see it in its fullest Latitude; and greatly rejoyce to find some new du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it, that we never knew before; because we get a new Argument to presse on Christ; on whom the Law lieth as much, or more then on any one of us: and so became the ground-work or foundation of the Gospel; next to the Heart of God and Christ.</p>
            <p>But there is One Particular which St. <hi>Paul</hi> maketh the main end of Christs being <hi>made under the Law; to Redeem them that were under the Law:</hi> &amp; were we not All, under the Law? How else are we guilty of its Breach, or Curse? and if we were all under the Law; Was not Christ made under it also, that he might Redeem us all? Which we may also find, in divers places of Scripture, where the Lord complains of wicked men, <hi>a sinful Nation, and a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Generation,</hi> that did not onely forsake and forget him <hi>that made, or begot them:</hi> but also <hi>Him that redeemed Them.</hi> So that the very word that signifies <hi>Redeemed,</hi> is also used
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51941:92"/>
to expresse them that are most <hi>Polluted:</hi> as in that remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable place of <hi>Zephany, Wo to the Polluted City,</hi> or to Her that hath been <hi>Redeemed:</hi> and in many other places. As, <hi>for whom Christ dyed;</hi> and Trampling That Blood, <hi>by which he was sanctified:</hi> which seemeth more then Redeemed.</p>
            <p>And that Christ hash so <hi>Redeemed us,</hi> may be hinted in the very Law it self: which, as it speaketh to every One to whom it is given (even to the worst of them all:) <hi>I am the Lord Thy God;</hi> so it addeth also, <hi>which have Redeemed thee: or brought thee out of Bondage, or the land of Misery:</hi> for so, <hi>Aegypt,</hi> soundeth in the Original; and to this day; as of old also, called <hi>Mesrie,</hi> or <hi>Misre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Law of <hi>Redemption,</hi> is One of the great things of the Law: and it may be the greatest; if we consider it, as we ought. We find it in <hi>Leviticus</hi> 25. with many other Scriptures.</p>
            <p>First, for the Land in general, <hi>It shall not be sold for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> Or be quite <hi>cut off:</hi> or wholy <hi>alienated. For, the Land is Mine: and you are strangers and sojourners with me. In all the Land of your possession, you shall grant a Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Either for Him that sold it, or for his Kindred. But doth God take care of Land?</hi> a little Clod of Earth? and of <hi>that Earth,</hi> which himself so <hi>Cursed,</hi> as we saw before! will he not, yea doth he not, more care for our Souls, and Bodies also? O we of little Faith! Doth he not so, in that very 25th chapter and 25th. verse? <hi>If thy Brother be waxen Poor, and sell any of his Possession</hi> (much more if it were his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance:) <hi>Any of his Kindred shall redeem it:</hi> and in the 35th. verse, <hi>If thy Brother wax Poor, or fall into decay with thee, Thou shalt relieve him: yea a stranger, or a sojourner</hi> (For, thou must love a stranger, as thy self, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 34.) <hi>Thou shalt not compel him to serve</hi> (or serve thy self on him) <hi>with hard service,</hi> or as a slave. But <hi>as an hired servant, or a sojourner:</hi> and onely <hi>till the Jubile. And then he shall go out, both Hee and his Children with him: To the Possession of his Father, he shall return. For, they are my servants; and thou shalt not rule over him with Rigour: but shalt fear thy God.</hi> And again, <hi>If thy Brother wax poor, and sell himself to a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or sojourner, or stock of a strangers Family</hi> (and why not,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51941:92"/>
if he sell himself to sin, or Satan? are They not strangers? <hi>He may redeem himself, if he can: Or one of his Kindred shall Redeem him.</hi> Or however, <hi>He shall not be ruled over with Rigour; And he shall go out, in the year of Jubile: He and his Children with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May we not, and ought we not to apply all this to our <hi>Neighbour, Kinsman, Brother,</hi> Jesus Christ? Was he not made under This Law also? a Branch of the <hi>Second Table As we spake of before the First.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth command, which the Apostle calleth <hi>the First, with Promise</hi> (and the former are Promises, rather then commands) Though it speak onely of <hi>Honouring our Parents</hi> (which lay also upon Him, that was still held out for the Pattern, of a <hi>Son of Man:)</hi> yet by the Apostles it is brought to <hi>All men;</hi> who must be <hi>Honoured and Loved</hi> also, as the <hi>Image of God our Father.</hi> And the <hi>Greater Honour, must be Given, to the Weaker Vessel:</hi> even as God also hath given it, to That, which might seem the most uncomely. Which is an Argument that may be well pressed on Christ; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>to bear with them that are weak;</hi> but to give them the more Honour as the Weaker Vessel. And those commands, yea and Prayers also, that we love and honour all men; speak more of the unspeakable love of Christ (who is the Root of this Spirit in All) then can be Here exptessed by many Words.</p>
            <p>The sixth Command, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> or thou shalt do All thou mayest, to preserve thy own Life, and thy Neighbours; lyeth also on our blessed Saviour: as the Text, commented by many Scriptures. Being by his Death, to bring in, <hi>Life and Immortality; and to destroy Him, who had the Power of Death, the Devil: and to redeem them, who through fear of Death, were all their life time, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto Bondage.</hi> Even as that pretious Psalm foretells; <hi>He shall save the Children of the Needy, and shall break in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Oppressor: He shall spare the Poor and Needy, and shall save the souls of the Needy: He shall Redeem their soul frrm Deceit and Violence</hi> (from force and fraud) <hi>and pretious shall their Blood be in his sight: He shall Live;</hi> and shall be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his <hi>Neighbours Life:</hi> and how much more of his
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51941:93"/>
Neighbours Soul? which himself hath said, is so exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pretious and unvaluable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From whence come Wars and Contentions; Come they not from our lusts within us; but the Wisdom from on high</hi> (and sure then more, as it is on high;) <hi>is Pure, and then peaceful</hi> (for without <hi>Peace and Holiness, No man shall ever see God:) Gentle and easie to be entreated. For, the man of God must be gentle; towards All men; even those that oppose themselves; being in the snares of Sathan, and led Captive at his will.</hi> A very sweet place, when it is applyed to Christ also; who is the great, and good, and best Man of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be <hi>gentle unto All. No striker;</hi> no quareler; but <hi>gentle unto All. The man of God must not strive,</hi> or fight. Which also puts me in mind, of That, prophecyed of him; <hi>He shall not strive, nor Cry, or braul, in the streets; the bruised reed he shall not break, nor quench the smoaking flax; till he bring out Judgement to victory,</hi> over all Lusts, and Pride, Passions, and Contentions. Seeing This, is the great Rule, given us in the Psalms and new Testament al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, <hi>that he that loves Life, and would see long dayes</hi> (as Christ ever shall:) <hi>must refrain from strife and guile; must follow peace and persue it: and who will harm you in so doing?</hi> when Himself also said (next to the Pure in Heart) <hi>Blessed are the Peacemakers</hi> (which is much to be applyed in our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto him;) <hi>for They shall be called the Children of God:</hi> as if himself also came to enjoy That Glorious Title of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> by being so Peaceful, and the Great <hi>Peace-maker.</hi> To which also I may add <hi>Davids</hi> Blessing of <hi>Abigael,</hi> and her Councel, saying, that when himself should rest from all his Enemies and Troubles, <hi>it should be no Grief of Heart to him, or offence, that he had spared his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies also, and had not shed their blood.</hi>

            <p>All This, or much more, lyeth in the sixth Command, and from Thence, is branched out in divers Laws, in <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and other books of Scripture; which all lie upon Christ, <hi>made under the Law,</hi> as much, or more, then any man: to Man also, as well as unto God his Father. And we lose very much of the sweetnesse of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> by not pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>Law;</hi> Yea the <hi>whole Law,</hi> upon Christ, that he may

still keep it <hi>to us also,</hi> as to God his Father: seing it is vain to talk of <hi>Loving God,</hi> if he do not also <hi>Love his poor Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> And who his Neighbour is, we may see, by divers places of the Law, and Gospel compared; especially in those which are branches of these great commands, for lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Neighbour as our self.</p>

               <hi>He that smiteth a man that he dye, shall be surely put to death.</hi> As of old, to <hi>Noah</hi> (the great Father of us all; and so the very Law of <hi>Nations or Nature;) He that sheddeth Mans blood, by Man his blood shall be shed:</hi> for, <hi>in the Image of God, he created Man.</hi> And that Image is still so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and preserved by Christ, who is the Head of every Man, that the same Apostle calleth Man, not onely the Image, but <hi>glory of God.</hi>

and those that are unlike him, froward and unthankful.

            <p>Which may be improved much in our addresses to Christ.

               <hi>Now sherefore shew thy pitty and compassion to the poor Asse,</hi> or the poor soul, the bruitish Heart, of him that is thy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and Hateth Thee. And I know one that said, He never received a more sweet, and kind return, from our Saviour, then when in great anguish of spirit, he bowed unto him, crying, onely This, [Now shew thy kindness to thy Poor Enemy! the Kindnesse thou hast spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, to a Poor Enemy! which is now at thy foot, and mercy! whom thou hast taken captive, with thy Sword, and thy Bow!] and while I am speaking Thus, I think also, of That spoken by the Prophet, to the King of <hi>Israel;</hi> when he had so many of his Enemies, at his Mercy, in the midst of his great City. <hi>Shall I smite them my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? shall I smite them?</hi> and the Prophet answered, [No, by no means: wilt thou smite them thou hast taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive with thy sword, and thy bow: give them to eat and drink, and let them go: and he prepared great provision for them, and sent them away;] so overcome with this Kindnesse, that they could hardly be drawn to come any more, as Enemies, against the King of <hi>Israel;</hi> who was
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51941:95"/>
so Merciful a Prince. And Mercy doth preserve, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish, a Kings Throne; more then any thing in the World; as <hi>Solomon</hi> shews; and <hi>David</hi> also, in divers places: and so it doth, and still shall, establish Christs Throne also. Which is a <hi>white Throne,</hi> even when he cometh to Judgement; and <hi>Mercy shall still go before him, and be the stability of his Throne and Kingdom; and blessed be they, that hear and know and believe that joyful sound:</hi> which is sweeter then all the Trumpets or the Bells about the fringe of <hi>Aarons</hi> Garment. Which yet had a better Ornament; even that sweet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume of the Good Oyntment, <hi>a meek and quiet spirit,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> expresseth it (and the Psalmist compareth it to <hi>Love) which with God, is of great value: and it drencht his beard throughout, even</hi> Aarons <hi>Beard</hi> (which was yet but an Excrement, and often to be cut away) <hi>and ran down through all his Garments;</hi> even to the seams and fringes also round about.</p>
            <p>And as if, God had not yet enough provided for the Poor, through all the Laws in <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Leviticus;</hi> He repeateth, and addeth in <hi>Deuteronomy. Thou shalt not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thy Heart, or shut thy hand, from thy Poor brother.</hi> [As if all shutting of hands, came from Hardnesse of Heart: and that This also, was mainly, or onely, against a <hi>poor man.] But thou shalt open thy hand wide, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in That which he wanteth. Beware there be not a word</hi> (or thought) <hi>in thy wicked heart saying, the seventh year, the year of Release, is at hand; and thy eye be evil, against thy poor brother; and thou givest him Nought; and he cry unto the Lord against thee, and it be Sin unto Thee. Thou shalt surely give him</hi> (which before was lend him, but at, or near, the year of Release, it was a gift, because to be forgiven then:) <hi>and Thy Heart shall not be grieved, when thou givest to him</hi> (a most sweet Command and Promise;) <hi>because that for This thing, the Lord thy God shall bless thee, in All thy Works, and in All that thou puttest thy hand unto.</hi> VVhich is the great promise to the Reading and Observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of the whole Law: so that <hi>love and pitty to our poor Neighbour,</hi> is rewarded, as keeping of the whole Law. As <hi>Daniel</hi> also, to <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> (even when the decree was
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51941:95"/>
made against him:) <hi>I councel thee to break off thy sins by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and by shewing Pity to the poor.</hi> And when the people asked <hi>John the Baptist, What shall we do?</hi> He said nothing but <hi>Pity the poor.</hi> And so our Savior also to the wicked Pharisees, <hi>Give Alms of all you have, and All things shall be clean to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lest All This, might yet, be too little, or too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; because it begun with a <hi>Poor Brother;</hi> It concludes as general, as well can be expressed. <hi>Thou shalt open thy hand wide unto thy Brother, to thy Poor, and thy Needy, in the Land.</hi> Which Phrase is remembred to Christ, several times in the Psalms; crying, <hi>Thy Poor, and Thy Needy; and forget not the Congregation of Thy Poor &amp;c.</hi> Where it is also Kite (as the English sound the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>Kite</hi> or <hi>Knite,)</hi> the <hi>Beast,</hi> or <hi>Beasts of thy Poor,</hi> As alluding to the <hi>Oxe,</hi> or <hi>Ass,</hi> or <hi>wild Asses Colt,</hi> (for, such is mans heart; And So was <hi>Ishmael</hi> foretold to be, in the Original:) as was touched before. And the 72. Psalm, and divers other Scriptures shew us, how Christ also was made, under All those Laws, that concern <hi>the Poor and Needy.</hi> And we should urge and press them All on Him. Yea, especially to make us <hi>Poor in spirit,</hi> or rightly sensible of all our wants, which indeed may be one of our greatest wants: and That for which Christ especially, calls us to Him. As we may see, in that most remarkable Epistle to the Church of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,</hi> in the <hi>Revelation:</hi> which shews us the Heart of Christ, even unto those that are not senfible of their wants. But He sees them: and remembers the Law, <hi>If thou see the Naked</hi> (in Esay) <hi>or thy poor Neighbor want;</hi> as we find in St. <hi>John</hi> and <hi>James.</hi> Yea though they do not weep, or word out any of their wants: Yet if thou do but <hi>See them;</hi> and thou must not <hi>Hide thy self from thy own flesh.</hi> Which have been exceeding sweet to me, in many cases, when I could urge them on Christ also: and Tell him, he hath said, <hi>a Brother is Born for a day of Sorrow.</hi> And the very <hi>Sigh,</hi> by which God hath taught us all to express sorrow, (which is <hi>Ah Ah,</hi> in Hebrew, and most Languages I know) in Gods Language is <hi>Brother, Brother:</hi> to which he seems to allude in <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. and divers places. As if he would have
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51941:96"/>
us in all our sorrow, cry out, <hi>Brother, brother, Help us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Christ was not only sent, <hi>to Preach the Gospel to the Poor, (and to comfort All that mourn;)</hi> but also gave That as the demonstrative Character (to <hi>Johns Disciples)</hi> that he was the True <hi>Messiah,</hi> That <hi>the Poor were Gospelized,</hi> or Turned into the Gospel; As the Phrase imports. And himself read his Commission, not only to <hi>Preach Deliverance to the Captives,</hi> (or opening of prison to them that are bound) but also <hi>to Deliver, and set at Liberty, those that are Bruised;</hi> which is less than <hi>Broken:</hi> with which he began, saying, he hath sent me to <hi>Heal the broken Hearted.</hi> Or the <hi>shivered,</hi> from the Heb. <hi>shiver</hi> (as in English also) to break into atomes, or <hi>Moats;</hi> which is also an Hebrew word. And though the Prophet speak of a <hi>Day of Vengeance,</hi> (where also, the word is akin to <hi>Repentance and Comfort al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so:)</hi> yet Christ omits That, in his reading it; and speaks not a word of <hi>Vengeance</hi> (though but a <hi>Day:)</hi> But the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Year</hi> of Jubilee. O How Acceptable it is to God!</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Poor,</hi> were so much upon Gods Heart, when he gave the Law, that he begins all his <hi>Judicial Laws,</hi> in the 21. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> with the case of a <hi>Poor</hi> man or woman, sold to be a <hi>Servant:</hi> As the Foundation of the great Law of <hi>Redemption;</hi> which is the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And in the next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he calls them <hi>His People,</hi> with an especial Emphasis. <hi>If thou lend mony to any of My People, the Poor with thee.</hi> And again, <hi>If thou take thy Neighbors Garment for a Pledg; Thou shalt deliver it to him again by Sun set: For it is his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and wherein he sleeps: and if he cry to me, I will hear, For I am Gracious.</hi> For I am Gracious. O how sweet is That, to a Poor Soul!</p>
            <p>That also of Delivering the Pledg <hi>by Sun set,</hi> (which in the Repetition of that Law is said <hi>should be their Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness before the Lord;</hi> a strange expression!) may occasion us to remember, How the same God, also commanded, that He that was <hi>Hanged up,</hi> (as a pledg of the greatest Wrath and Curse; as we find in the Law, and in Christ; whom the <hi>Jews</hi> to this day, call the <hi>Tall,</hi> or <hi>Lifted up,</hi> or <hi>Hanged</hi> person:) must be taken down by <hi>Sun set.</hi> As <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi> practised diverstimes, at the <hi>Going down of the Sun,</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:51941:96"/>
To which it may be, That also may allude, <hi>Let not the Sun go down upon your Wrath, nor give place to the Devil,</hi> the Prince of Wrath and Darkness.</p>
            <p>Which hath also put me in mind, that the word <hi>Wrath</hi> in Heb signifies somwhat, that (in God also, I hope, more than any man,) is <hi>to Pass away: and not to Endure for Ever.</hi> Which is one of the first Articles God seems to hold out, of our Faith and Hope in Him. Who is <hi>Wisdom</hi> it self <hi>(Pure and Peaceful,) Power and Goodness.</hi> But <hi>Wrath resteth</hi> only in the <hi>Bosom of Fools.</hi> And is their <hi>Weakness</hi> also: As we read in <hi>Solomon.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Micha</hi> saith, <hi>I will bear the Indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: till he return, &amp;c.</hi> And concludeth, <hi>Who is a God like unto Thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgressions of the remnant of his Heritage? He retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us: he will subdue our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; and thou wilt cast Their sins into the depths of the sea. Thou wilt perform the Truth to</hi> Jacob, <hi>and the Mercy to</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>which thou hast sworn unto our Fathers, from the daies of Old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the very next chapter in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> limits the punishing of a wicked man. Which must not exceed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty stripes <hi>(though he that knew his Masters will, may be beaten with many stripes:)</hi> but not above fourty. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is yet better; <hi>Lest Thy Brother should seem Vile unto thee.</hi> And yet, stripes were for the fools back, and for the vilest slaves: (they might not touch a <hi>Roman:)</hi> and they are here appointed for a <hi>Wicked man;</hi> and yet, how careful is God, that a <hi>Wicked man,</hi> even a <hi>VVicked man,</hi> (for, he is still a <hi>Brother,</hi> by this very Law,) <hi>may not be made too vile,</hi> in the eyes of any Judg; and so of Christ also, the great Judg; But <hi>made under this Law also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is considerable, that this number of 40. is the Trying, Tempting, Punishing number, much through all the Bible. Fourty Daies in the <hi>Flood</hi> divers times: And so for Purification, after a male child; and twice forty for a Female. Fourty years for <hi>Canaans</hi> Repentance, and <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi> wandring in the Wilderness: and Fourty years for
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51941:97"/>
               <hi>Judahs</hi> sin in <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> and fourty daies or years of <hi>Nineveh;</hi> and of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> (about our Saviors Resurrection, and Ascention after fourty daies:) and the City stood but fourty yeers after. And Thrice fourty yeers was the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the old World; or their Day of Repentance. And Then the Flood by fourty and fourty daies. And though <hi>Moses</hi> make our longest age, but twice fourty, or eighty years; yet he lived Thrice fourty years: and Fasted Thrice fourty daies, it may be, Representing both <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> also, fasting fourty daies.</p>
            <p>That which followeth in the same chapter, of the Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans raising seed to his dead Kinsman: (For, it is not a Brother, only, in Hebrew; and we see it in <hi>Ruth,</hi> at a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter distance:) may be applied to Christ also; for a <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual seed to God.</hi> Seeing the first <hi>Adam</hi> in us dieth childless. Nor may he plead, <hi>I shall mar my own Inheritance, or Family: I have a wife, or children of my own already.</hi> Seeing in this case, <hi>Polygamy</hi> is not only permitted, but commended and commanded. And <hi>Sauls wives</hi> were <hi>Given,</hi> it seems, by God himself, into <hi>Davids</hi> Bosom.</p>
            <p>And the omission of this Law, <hi>of doing the office of a Kinsman,</hi> had a perpetual brand of disgrace, <hi>By loosing the shoe, and spitting,</hi> to be added to the blessed History of <hi>Ruth</hi> (or <hi>Truth,</hi> or <hi>Drouth,</hi> as a Saxon may sound it,) the <hi>dry barren widdow of Mahlon</hi> (that is <hi>VVeakness)</hi> married un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Strength in him;</hi> As <hi>Boaz</hi> signifies. But <hi>I am unworthy to unloose his shoo,</hi> That was here also Typified. And the Reason of This Law, is, <hi>That his Brothers (or his Kinsmans) Name, be not put out of Israel,</hi> or out of the <hi>Book of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; or blotted out from under the Heavens of the Lord.</hi> Threatned to <hi>Amalech</hi> (a branch of <hi>Esau</hi> by a Concubine) or others; when their Males were to be rooted out, as we touched before. For the <hi>Male</hi> in Heb speaketh <hi>Memorial</hi> or <hi>Remembrance.</hi> And yet, <hi>Edoms Children and VViddows</hi> also, are called to <hi>Come and Trust in God;</hi> with promise to be kept alive: Though all the <hi>Males</hi> were rooted out; or their Memorial perished. Although I say not, that This was but according to This Law, of marrying the Kinsmans Widdow. But, However God abhorred <hi>Edom (for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:51941:97"/>
               <hi>his VVrath Tear for ever, and forgetting the Brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and Covenant:) yet, in that very place, where <hi>Israel</hi> is forbidden <hi>to seek the Peace of Moab and Ammon, All their Daies, for ever;</hi> They are forbidden also, <hi>to abhor an Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite: because</hi> He was, and still <hi>is, Thy Brother,</hi> as we read in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. And though the <hi>Lamentations</hi> say, that God wil <hi>visit Edom</hi> (and accomplish the Iniquity, or Punishment of <hi>Zion)</hi> yet <hi>Edom</hi> also is There bid to <hi>rejoyce.</hi> And (as allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word <hi>Edom,</hi> which <hi>Job</hi> also useth for, I will be <hi>Dumb)</hi> he saith, <hi>it is good for a man to be Dumb, and quietly wait for the Salvation of God</hi> (as <hi>Jacob</hi> also, on his death bed:) <hi>He sitteth alone, and is Dumb, &amp;c. For the Lord will not cast off for ever,</hi> (the very word used by <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:)</hi> or <hi>Forsake, even for Adultery:</hi> being neer akin in <hi>Heb.</hi>

            <p>And when God seemeth resolved to cut off <hi>Edom,</hi> or <hi>Moab;</hi> yet it is with such regret, and so much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Heart and Bowels, as a most tender Father, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, going to chasten a dear child. <hi>O give wings unto them, that they may flee away. Leave the Cities, dwell in the Rock; and be like the Dove, in the Clefts of the Rock. O my Heart, my Heart shall sound for him. I will Howl and Cry, and Mourn sor him. O Vine of</hi> Sibma, <hi>I will weep for thee: I will water thee with my Tears O Heshbon.</hi> And again, <hi>My Heart shall Cry out for</hi> Moab. <hi>Let his Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives flee unto</hi> Zoar. <hi>Take Councel, execute judgment, Hide the Ontcasts, bewray not him that wandreth. Flee ye, Turn back, dwell deep O Inhabitants of</hi> Dedan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As if he foresaw, That which <hi>Job</hi> or the Psalmist speaketh, when he shall have cut off, <hi>he will look in the morning, and see his place empty,</hi> (as <hi>Davids</hi> was before <hi>Saul;) and he will have desire to the work of his own hands.</hi> And when <hi>David</hi> had conquered <hi>Ishbosheth,</hi> and all <hi>Sauls</hi> Family, he melted, and said, to <hi>Ziba, Is there not yet any of the House of</hi> Saul, <hi>that I may shew the kindness of God unto him?</hi> The kindness of God! Even towards dead <hi>Saul.</hi> And there came an hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Son of <hi>Jonathan</hi> (or <hi>Jaacob)</hi> Trembling, and hardly believing <hi>the King would look upon such a Dead Dog.</hi> But it was to shew <hi>the Kindness of God,</hi> to an House he had cut off. And how sweetly and solemnly did <hi>David</hi> celebrate <hi>Sauls</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:51941:98"/>
Funeral? and bless the men of Jabez that shewed kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to his dead body? <hi>Blessed he ye of the Lord, that have shewed this Kindness to your Lord, even unto</hi> Saul, <hi>and have bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him. And now the Lord shew Kindness and Truth unto you. And I also will requite you this kindness, because you have done this thing.</hi> And the Kindness of <hi>Rispa</hi> to <hi>Sauls</hi> Sons, that were Hanged, up before the Lord, for <hi>Gibeon,</hi> was not only told <hi>David,</hi> but remaineth on Scripture Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, to all Eternity. And it also occasioned <hi>David,</hi> to shew new kindness to <hi>Saul</hi> and the Bones of his dead chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And though <hi>Shimei</hi> cursed with a bitter heavy Curse, as if <hi>David</hi> had been cruel or bloody to the House of <hi>Saul:</hi> Yet <hi>David</hi> bears it patiently, saying, <hi>Let him Curse, because the Lord hath said unto him, Curse</hi> David: And again, <hi>Let him Curse, for the Lord hath bidden him.</hi> And again, at his Return to his Kingdom, when <hi>Ahishai</hi> pressed, that he might die, who had so <hi>cursed the Lords An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed: David</hi> replied, <hi>You are Satan to me; Shall there a Man, he put to death this day in</hi> Israel? <hi>For, do I not know, that I am this day King of</hi> Israel? A saying so remarkable, and repeated so, that it may, not only, be pressed on a King (especially when God hath so restored him to his Kingdom, as <hi>David,</hi> After banishment.) But on Christ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, I hope, when he shall come again, and be restored to His Great Kingdom. Will he not Then also say, <hi>Shall a Man be put to death This day? Am I not King of</hi> Israel? and the rather, because himself seems to allude to This very saying of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abisai,</hi> when he said to <hi>Peter, Get thee behind me Satan: Thou savorest not the things of God, but men;</hi> and therefore art <hi>Satan; an Offence or Adversary to me.</hi> The very Phrase used by <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abishai, the Father of</hi> Jesse, <hi>or My substance.</hi> Doth not <hi>Solomon</hi> allude to This of <hi>Shimei</hi> also, when he saith, <hi>Hearken not</hi> (and <hi>Shimei</hi> is <hi>Hearken;) what thy servant saith, lest thou hear thy self curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Or accuse not a servant to his Master: and Thou knowest, that Thou also hast cursed others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have yet said nothing of the <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> (O what a Sea of Love!) under which Christ was <hi>Made</hi> also, to

               <hi>Fulfil</hi> it. Time would fail us, but to flie with the Bee, and suck Honey from every Flower.</p>
            <p>All the kinds of Sacrifice, seem hinted to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the Vision, sealing his Everlasting Covenant. Which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served his seed, and all the Elect, Gentiles also, as the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Dove,</hi> and the <hi>Young Pidgeon,</hi> whole and undivided, or unbroken, in the midst of the <hi>Heifer</hi> (Gods own Emblem of <hi>Aegypt, Moab, Babylon,</hi> or other Beasts, about his People;) the <hi>Ram,</hi> which in <hi>Daniel,</hi> is a Type of the <hi>Mede and Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Empire; and the <hi>Goat,</hi> in Him also, the <hi>Grecian</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, (or <hi>Aegeans,</hi> which with many persons, and places Thereabout, had their name from <hi>Goats:</hi> As we read in divers Authors:) or All men of the world, or Seed of the Serpent. That is the head and chief of Beasts, that so signally pressed, or oppressed, the poor <hi>Dove,</hi> which was also the Ensign of the <hi>Assyrian Banner</hi> (as we are taught, from <hi>Semiramis,</hi> a <hi>Dove,</hi> or fed by <hi>Doves:)</hi> whence the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> cryeth, <hi>Flee ye from the Dove, coming out of the North.</hi> Though it may be, from <hi>News brought by Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> As in Those Countries, To This day.

            <p>When All, or any of These, were <hi>Burnt Offerings,</hi> or <hi>Sin Offerings</hi> for the <hi>whole Church</hi> or <hi>Priest;</hi> They were All the Lords, consumed by Fire: as pledges that the persons of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, were guilty of cutting off, or perishing for their sins. But in particular <hi>Sin Offerings,</hi> or <hi>Trespass,</hi> (which were greater guilt and <hi>Shame,</hi> as the <hi>Heb</hi> sounds,) the <hi>Priest</hi> had His; and in <hi>Peace-Offerings,</hi> the Offerer had also His, part to eat: besides the <hi>Blood</hi> poured out, and the Fat, and <hi>Inwards,</hi> consumed by Fire, to the Lord. Which might not only be a Token of <hi>Their Peace with God;</hi> (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaks:) but also, that God accepted and pardoned Those, who were represented by such Offerings. Gods receiving, or eating them (as himself expresseth it) seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Emblem of his Turning them and their natures, into His: As we dayly do, to all we eat, and wel digest. Or that Christ (who was Typed out in All of them) was made <hi>All to All,</hi> or <hi>for All.</hi> As Not only a <hi>Lamb</hi> for the <hi>Lambs,</hi> in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51941:99"/>
the <hi>dayly Sacrifice;</hi> (in which, God had <hi>his Bread and flesh at morning, and Bread and flesh at Evening,</hi> as he allowed to <hi>Elijah,</hi> and other persons:) But a <hi>Goat</hi> also for the <hi>Goats.</hi> At the change of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the solemn <hi>Feasts:</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Feast of <hi>Atonement.</hi> About the end of the <hi>Year,</hi> or <hi>Fulness</hi> of <hi>Times;</hi> (as the Apostle speaketh:) which we shall consider a little more distinctly.</p>
            <p>As there is a measure of <hi>Syncerity,</hi> which the Scripture calls <hi>Integrity, Perfection,</hi> or <hi>Fulness</hi> of Heart, (as <hi>Calebs</hi> Heart <hi>filled after God,</hi> and <hi>Sardis Works were not filled up before God;</hi> And the Lord answered <hi>Abimelech, Thou didst it in the Perfection of thy Heart;)</hi> which yet is not Absolute <hi>Perfection:</hi> So there are such, or such, periods of Time, which the Scripture reckons <hi>Perfect,</hi> and calleth <hi>Fulness</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> or some kind of <hi>Eternity;</hi> which yet, are not such <hi>Absolutely;</hi> but to man, So Long, or so uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or <hi>Hidden,</hi> as the word intimates, which is used for <hi>Ever</hi> or <hi>Eternity.</hi> Seeing God hath so Hidden some Times and Seasons in his own Breast, that the Son himself saith, He <hi>knew them not.</hi> Which yet, some interpret, as That saying, <hi>I pray not for the World:</hi> as if he said, I do not now speak or manifest My knowing, owning, or praying for them, till its proper season. And there were such seasons also, or Revelation of <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Seasons:</hi> as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> And <hi>Blessed is He that Readeth</hi> That Book: Which is cleerer perhaps, for the great things of <hi>Doctrine, Worship,</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> also, than every eye seeth, at one or two readings. And may we not say with <hi>Job, Seeing Times are not Hidden from the Almighty, why do They that know Him, not see his Daies, or Times also?</hi> For, That is the sence in the Original, rather than as some read or comma the words, Thus, <hi>VVhy do they, that know him not, see his daies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Schools make <hi>Motion</hi> to begin from <hi>Rest,</hi> (as in Heb <hi>Resit,</hi> or <hi>Rest,</hi> is the <hi>Beginning</hi> of Creation, and all Motion;) So the Jews, and other old Nations, did begin to reckon <hi>Time,</hi> (which is the <hi>Measure of Motion,)</hi> from <hi>Night,</hi> in Heb <hi>Nihat, Rest:</hi> which is as proper to <hi>Night,</hi> as <hi>Motion is to Day. As</hi> our Saviour also speaketh, <hi>I must</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:51941:99"/>
               <hi>work</hi> (O happy necessity!) <hi>while it is Day; for the Night cometh, when No man can work.</hi> And again, <hi>Walk in the Light:</hi> and <hi>are there not Twelve hours in the Day?</hi> And so many also, they made in the Night. Observing perhaps, that the <hi>Moons mean Motion,</hi> was her own <hi>Diameter,</hi> Twelve times, to the <hi>Suns</hi> moving One of His: and so twenty four, for his two breadths (of Day and Nights Motion, round the Heavens:) which is also, the proportion which the Ancients made, and kept, between their <hi>Sun and Moon,</hi> in Metals, <hi>Gold and Silver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the Twelve sons of Darkness (as of <hi>Ishmael</hi> or <hi>Esau;)</hi> and the Twelve sons of <hi>Israel,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are called <hi>Children of Light;</hi> We glaunced before, in the twenty four Elders, and the Watches, or Watchers also. As in our Bodies are twelve Ribs, on the one side, and twelve on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; with such and such distinctions, and <hi>Vertebres.</hi> And in either <hi>Jaw,</hi> or Pallat (like the two <hi>Hemispheres</hi> of Day and Night) There are twelve <hi>Teeth,</hi> with their Watchers also, which some call <hi>Dogs.</hi> And the common meetings of our <hi>Jaws</hi> (and <hi>signal Pulses)</hi> are in many Languages cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Times,</hi> or <hi>Tempora,</hi> the <hi>Temples.</hi> As the Jews also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Teeth,</hi> by a word next akin to <hi>Years</hi> (and our <hi>Ears</hi> are neer our <hi>Temples:)</hi> growing up as <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Years,</hi> did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Creation; Changing All things, by chewing and devouring them, (as <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> did with the Poets:) and so Turning them into our own Natures. And the very Name of <hi>Year</hi> (as of <hi>Teeth</hi> also,) in Heb intimates <hi>Changing:</hi> and its Numeral Letters make up Three hundred fifty five, As there were Daies in their <hi>Lunar Year:</hi> and Three hundred sixty, in the <hi>Plural Regimen,</hi> as in their <hi>Solar Years,</hi> (as we touched before, at the great Change of Time, in the last Battel between <hi>David</hi> and the House of <hi>Saul.)</hi> And Their word for <hi>Year,</hi> hath a double <hi>Plural,</hi> both <hi>Feminine,</hi> and <hi>Masculine;</hi> as their <hi>Years</hi> were <hi>Lunar</hi> and <hi>Solar.</hi> And such periods of Exact meeting of <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> (after such Courses and Motions) make up such, or such, a <hi>Fulness of Time,</hi> or <hi>Perfection:</hi> which in Scripture Language may be called an <hi>Age,</hi> or <hi>Ay,</hi> or <hi>Ever;</hi> or the like Phrase; by which they express the <hi>World</hi> also
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51941:100"/>
(which is usual in many languages:) As, where some read, <hi>He hath set the World in our Heart:</hi> it is <hi>Eternity:</hi> or the same VVord, which is so Rendred, in very many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>And though it may be hard to determine what the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture meaneth by <hi>Fulnesse of Time,</hi> or <hi>Times:</hi> (which is so spoken, about our Saviour Time especially, as if it were the <hi>end of one World,</hi> and beginning of another. Or the end of that, which was to answer to the first <hi>Night</hi> of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, (or the Time before the <hi>Sun</hi> appeared in the World) and the beginning of <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Day;</hi> as we may often read in the new Testament:) yet, for some little <hi>Essay</hi> towards it; we may remember, that the Hebrew word for <hi>Seven</hi> (or <hi>Sevang,</hi> as some sound it; the <hi>English Saxon</hi> being much <hi>Hebrew;)</hi> is very neer a kin to That, which signifieth Fulnes; and their word for <hi>Ten,</hi> is also <hi>Riches;</hi> which turned back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, maketh their <hi>Rash</hi> (or <hi>wrech,</hi> or <hi>Rich,)</hi> or <hi>Rushing, wicked and unquiet man:</hi> and by a little changing of places, the same letters make a <hi>Goat,</hi> and a <hi>Devil</hi> also: to which there may be frequent allusions in Scripture; which we may touch again.</p>
            <p>Shall I add that <hi>All the Words,</hi> I now remember, in all the Bible, to expresse such a <hi>Fulnesse,</hi> or <hi>perfection of Time</hi> (as is stiled <hi>Age,</hi> or <hi>Ay,</hi> or <hi>Ever,</hi> or <hi>Eternity)</hi> in their very numeral Letters (if no more) include <hi>Seven</hi> or <hi>Ten;</hi> or some of their Powers; expressing <hi>Fulness,</hi> or <hi>Riches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be almost endlesse to shew how many Things, and Motions, in our Bodies, do consist, or depend, on some of these numbers, of <hi>Seven,</hi> or <hi>Ten</hi> which is visible, in our very Fingers and Toes; with their Nails, or Horns to be compared with the <hi>Ten</hi> Horns in <hi>Daniel,</hi> or the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> That I say nothing, of the <hi>Ten</hi> Horns of the Law, or the <hi>Ten Sephiroth,</hi> of which the Jews speak so much, in allusion to That of Horns, or Rayes, comming round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Lawgiver; As the Antients formed, <hi>Moses</hi> also, like the <hi>Sun,</hi> in his Rayes of Glory.</p>
            <p>I must not speak of the <hi>Seven</hi> Hours, Dayes, Weeks, Months and Years, the Antients observed in Conception
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51941:100"/>
and forming the Embryons Features: and its several Ages and Changes, with ebbing and flowing, coming and going, of Hair, and Nails, and Teeth, and many other things by <hi>Seven.</hi> Which is also the number of the <hi>True Ribs,</hi> on each side; as they distinguish them: and of the <hi>Vertebres,</hi> or <hi>Rackets</hi> of our <hi>Necks:</hi> as also they parted or paired out, our <hi>Nerves,</hi> by Sevens. As if, in our <hi>Brain</hi> also, or the <hi>spinal</hi> marrow; were the <hi>Beast,</hi> out of the <hi>Sea:</hi> or the <hi>Old Serpent,</hi> or <hi>Hydra,</hi> with Seven <hi>Heads</hi> also.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Chymists</hi> find seven Metals, in the bowels of the Earth below, answering to the seven <hi>Planets</hi> above; <hi>(the seal being stamped quite through, the Wax or Wafer,</hi> as the Jews observe; so that all the signatures are also seen below, which were made above:) so also, we have, our <hi>spleen,</hi> and <hi>Liver,</hi> and <hi>Gall,</hi> and <hi>Reins,</hi> and <hi>Bladder,</hi> and other Members (as <hi>Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Planets, with their <hi>Armor-bearers</hi> also, round the <hi>Sun,)</hi> as in our <hi>bowels</hi> about the <hi>stomack,</hi> or great Centre of Sun-like heat and fire; in That Lowest Region. As the very utmost Court of the <hi>Temple,</hi> had its <hi>Molten Sea</hi> (like the <hi>Ocean,</hi> or Waters under the Earth, with its ebbings and flowings, like the rowlings and yearnings of our <hi>Bowels;)</hi> and the <hi>Altar of burnt offerings,</hi> burning and devouring all. And the <hi>middle Court,</hi> or <hi>Temple,</hi> had the <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Incence</hi> and the seven <hi>Lamps,</hi> and the twelve <hi>Cakes:</hi> As our <hi>middle Region</hi> or <hi>Breast</hi> hath its <hi>Heart,</hi> or <hi>Altar of Incence</hi> also (compassed with its <hi>pericardium,</hi> or purss of <hi>Water,</hi> and the <hi>Air</hi> of the <hi>Lungs)</hi> with the twelve <hi>Ribs</hi> or <hi>sphers,</hi> or signs of Heaven. Seperate with a Veil or <hi>Firmament</hi> also from our <hi>Head,</hi> or Heavens above (or Waters above the <hi>Firmament,</hi> where are the first Ideahs or Originals of All below:) that I say nothing of the Mercy Seat of our Eye; and its Rainbow; representing the <hi>Throne of God</hi> (in the <hi>Holy of Holies)</hi> as we find it described, in divers places of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Is there not also some resemblance between the <hi>Northern</hi> parts of the Earth, and the Brain or Head? (As if the <hi>North</hi> were made to Rule; as may be hinted in divers Scriptures: for, <hi>Preferment cometh not from the East or West, or South:</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:51941:101"/>
And from <hi>North,</hi> the man comes, that Headeth Kingdoms in the Prophets:) and their likenesse to our <hi>Lungs</hi> also, may be considered with their <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Colds.</hi> Other parts are as Neck, Shoulders, Breast and Arms. The <hi>Midland Sea,</hi> as the <hi>Midriff:</hi> or it may be part of the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Heart,</hi> or <hi>Africa:</hi> and <hi>Libiah</hi> signifies the <hi>Lords Heart.</hi> As the form is. And <hi>America</hi> the back-parts: or the People a far off. The Great Sea below the continent, as the Waters under the Earth, or our Bowels, and their Rowlings and yearnings: the Chambers of the South, and as Waters returning in the South. <hi>Terra del fuogo</hi> the <hi>Hips,</hi> and <hi>Nova Guinea Loins. Mael strom,</hi> the Nose or Mouth.</p>
            <p>How by <hi>Eating all things,</hi> we turn them into our own Natures and spirits (as a shadow how all things return To God, as they come From him) we touched before: and may I add, that Christ gave his own flesh and blood, to be eaten by us, and to be ours and us? and the twelve Tribes, were presented in the twelve Cakes of shewbread (chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged every Sabboth day) as to be eaten by God or the Priest, and so to be turned into His Nature; as the Scripture also may intimate, in other places, besides our Saviours dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with <hi>Laodicea,</hi> in the Revelation. And some make <hi>Shaddai</hi> to be <hi>All devouring: and our God is a consuming fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We might happily measure times and seasons in the great World, and changes there of, much better then we now do; If we knew the exact Times of <hi>Circulation</hi> of our blood, and other humors of our bodies: and how long the <hi>Chylus</hi> stayeth in the stomack, or any other <hi>Receptacle,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be separate and circuled, for <hi>assimilation.</hi> What time in the <hi>Duodenum</hi> (there is somewhat in the very name:) <hi>Jejunum, Colon,</hi> or <hi>Ilia:</hi> Which we should consider often, as the shadow, that I say not measure, of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea. That I say nothing of the Infinite Bowels of God, which are hinted out in Scripture, by the many folds of our <hi>Ilia:</hi> six or seven times longer then Man. Nothing also of the <hi>Caecum,</hi> which may speak somewhat <hi>Hidden,</hi> as the Hebrew word for the <hi>World,</hi> or <hi>Age,</hi> or <hi>Ay,</hi> and <hi>Ever.</hi> Nor do I say the very Excrements return again, in Grass and Hearbs, which feed us, with the Beasts we eat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:51941:101"/>
Shall we come to the measures of <hi>Time</hi> (which is also the <hi>measure of Motion)</hi> in the Heavens? The two faithful Witnesses (as the Scriptures intimate, like our <hi>Eyes,</hi> in our Heads, or Heaven above: and some other things below, which so many Nations call by the name of <hi>Witnesses:</hi> to be compared with Scripture also, making such solemn Oaths, by putting the Hand under the Thigh:) the <hi>Sun and Moon,</hi> were set in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> not onely <hi>for Dayes and Years,</hi> but for <hi>Times and seasons.</hi> Which are all made, by Their motions, through an <hi>Oblique Zodiack;</hi> That <hi>crooked,</hi> or that <hi>crossing serpent:</hi> which in Hebrew hath almost the very same Letters and Numbers, with the word for Year. For, <hi>Shanah,</hi> is a Metathesis of <hi>Nahash;</hi> the Serpent, and the <hi>Ammonite:</hi> which may be compared with <hi>Sampson</hi> (the little Sun,) and Hercules.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Time</hi> began with <hi>Night</hi> before <hi>Day,</hi> so it may be, <hi>Winter</hi> was before <hi>Summer;</hi> as <hi>Seed time,</hi> before <hi>Harvest;</hi> as the Scripture may intimate in divers places. Evening and Morning, are for sowing Seed: and so, the former and the latter Rains, and the Harvest and Vintage, have their seasons. The <hi>Latter</hi> Works of God, are ever the <hi>Better,</hi> and his last <hi>Wine</hi> is best; and he will ever shew himself better and better, till all <hi>Time</hi> be perfected, into <hi>Eternity:</hi> and God be all in All.</p>
            <p>How the Antients might part their Day and Night into twelve hours a piece, we shew before. It may be compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with That of <hi>Moses. When the most high separated the Sons of Adam;</hi> and (as St <hi>Paul</hi> expresseth it) <hi>determined their Times appointed, and bounds of their Habitation:</hi> He did it, <hi>according to the Number of the Sons of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Thus the first twelve hours of Time (from the first Creation) might represent the twelve Months of the year; and the twelve great years, the World was to serve the four great Monarchies, or watchers and watches: (of which <hi>Daniel</hi> also speaketh, as of those, that gave out the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree (agreed by the <hi>Watchers)</hi> against <hi>Nebuchadnezar;</hi> when he became the <hi>Beast.</hi> As we There also, read of the Image, of the Beast (to be compared with the Revelation) of which
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51941:102"/>
which twelve years serving the four Monarchies (as also the Restitution, and Liberty, in the second Sabbath, or fourteenth Year) we first read, in the fourteenth of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jews had also, many other Divisions of Time, and Particles they called <hi>Clakin;</hi> As the <hi>English Saxons</hi> also, in their <hi>Clackings,</hi> or <hi>Clickings,</hi> of their <hi>Clocks,</hi> and Watches. But we now mainly consider their twelve hours of Day and Night: which so many other Nations also, have still observed. But in Scripture there is Half an hour, and silence in Heaven, about half an hour.</p>
            <p>And those Twelve hours are most signally parted into six and six; and each six halfed again, into the little Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Night also: which in the <hi>Roman</hi> times, and the New Testament, were Four also; as the great Watchers, or Animals: or Angels, of the four Quarters, of Heaven, <hi>or Corners of the Earth.</hi> Though some hints appeer also, as if the Old Jews had first but three Watches, in their Nights. But Nature teacheth us, to Halve and quarter things; and Thence are made the sweet <hi>Chords</hi> in <hi>Musick.</hi> For, a string of twelve inches (or any twelve parts) maketh a <hi>Diapason,</hi> to another of six, equally strained; and a <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente, Diatessaron, Epitrite,</hi> (a <hi>Fifth,</hi> a <hi>Fourth,</hi> a <hi>Third,)</hi> to others of 3, and 4, and 8, or 9. which are the usual <hi>Chords</hi> of Harmony.</p>
            <p>All These are in the 12. hours of <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night:</hi> and it may be, All <hi>measures;</hi> used by the <hi>Hebrews, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> or other Nations that we know.

            <p>And generally 12 in <hi>Silver</hi> made but One in <hi>Gold.</hi> As we found the <hi>Moon</hi> moved 12 of her <hi>Diameters,</hi> in 12 hours while the <hi>Sun</hi> moves but <hi>One</hi> of His.

            <p>And that we may also glance upon the Sacred Number of <hi>Seven:</hi> (As <hi>Six,</hi> was common to the World, and things and men thereof, as we touched in 666. and the Image set up in <hi>Dura</hi> (a Province of <hi>Babylon)</hi> made up of 6 in breadth, and 60 in heigth:) Let us suppose All Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the Evening <hi>Horizon,</hi> or Sun-setting: as we may imagine, though there was no Sun appearing till the fourth day. As also the great Sun of Righteousness ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not, till after the Night, or 12 hours, of the fourth Thousand Years: If we may so compare the six first daies of Creation with six thousand Years before the Great Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; As the Jews also teach us from a very old Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>From the Evening <hi>Horizon</hi> to the <hi>Nadir</hi> (or the middle of the Lower Hemisphere) there were Then, and so are still with Them, six hours Motion, of the <hi>Sun,</hi> or of the Earth, about the <hi>Sun.</hi> And Then, six hours more, to the Morning <hi>Horizon:</hi> and six more to the <hi>Zenith,</hi> or High Noon; and Thence, six more, to the setting <hi>Horizon</hi> again, whence Time first began. So also, the Flowing and Eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of the Sea, are by six hours apiece, in the open Ocean:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51941:104"/>
and in all Rivers, <hi>Ebb</hi> and <hi>Flood</hi> together, generally make up twelve hours. So that after every sixt hour, there is a <hi>Pauze,</hi> or <hi>Rest,</hi> as it seems; and Then, a <hi>Turning,</hi> as it were backward. For, from the <hi>setting,</hi> till <hi>Midnight,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> seems to go down, and Then to <hi>Turn</hi> up again: and so from the other points also. And before its <hi>Turn,</hi> it seems to <hi>Rest,</hi> and pauze; as all things do, before they <hi>Turn.</hi> So that the same word (or very neer) in Heb sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to <hi>Turn,</hi> and to <hi>Rest.</hi> As if This were still implied in That. And the <hi>Rest,</hi> or <hi>Sabbath</hi> of God, seemeth to speak some <hi>Turning inward,</hi> or <hi>Reflecting</hi> on himself, and his own Image, in all he hath done: in which his soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth, with unconceivable delight and joy. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the First of the following six hours, be as it were, wholly new, from all the six before it; yet the Pauze and Turn, seem to be made between the sixes, as it were by some other distinct Person or Body, that is watching at those Cardinal Points, and There Turning That which moveth. So that the <hi>Seventh,</hi> is (as it were) more <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Sacred,</hi> that is <hi>Separate</hi> (for, so the word <hi>Holy,</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies in Heb. and other Languages) distinct and separate from all the other six; which are profane, in comparison of the seventh, standing by himself, as wholly of another Nature. So that besides the twenty four Elders, there were four distinct Watchers (as we may call them) as the Sabbaths to the other four sixes. And every of the Four had six wings apiece (as we find in the Prophets also:) and their Great Work seemeth to be Keeping of Sabbath Daies. For, it was the Lords Day, when St. <hi>John</hi> saith, they ceased not, day and night (being to watch in Both) crying Holy, Holy, Holy, (which is also Thrice repeated in some Copies:) Though upon other daies, They have other imployment: As we see in that they spoke and did, at other times, in the Revelation. Yet if any will bring the Months from These four, with six wings apiece; as the Hours from the twenty four Elders, I do not oppose it: but compare them also, with the Watches with Four and sixes also, about the Temple in <hi>Solomons</hi> Time, but <hi>Davids</hi> Institution: the 24 from <hi>Noah;</hi> As the 14 from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:51941:104"/>
as we touched before. But I have yet said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, How every <hi>Circle</hi> is naturally parted into <hi>six</hi> equal parts, by its own <hi>Radius:</hi> and that <hi>Six</hi> equal <hi>Circles</hi> may touch it, and each other, in their <hi>Circumference;</hi> or it may be cut into six Triangles; or six Circles Touching one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with their Centres all in the Circumference of the seventh: as Children play with Compasses.</p>
            <p>And as every seventh <hi>Hour,</hi> was sacred, or separate, from all the former six Hours; so was also, every seventh <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Year;</hi> which was also <hi>Sabbatical:</hi> and so every Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth <hi>Month,</hi> which had the seven solemn Daies of the Great Feast of <hi>Tabernacles.</hi> And the Seventh Month from That also, had 7 daies of the <hi>Passeover:</hi> As the third from That also, the 7 daies of <hi>Pentecost.</hi> And I know not but This Harmony, between <hi>Hours,</hi> and <hi>Daies,</hi> and <hi>Months,</hi> and <hi>Years,</hi> may be intimated in That of the four <hi>Angels</hi> (as the four Watches or Watchers) loosed at <hi>Euphrates:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared for an <hi>Hour,</hi> a <hi>Day,</hi> a <hi>Month,</hi> and a <hi>Year:</hi> As we read in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Which yet some compare with the four great Commanders of the <hi>Turks,</hi> that brake out (neer <hi>Euphrates</hi> also) about the Year of Christ, 1300. (when the five <hi>Months</hi> of the <hi>First Woe,</hi> of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> in the Roman Empire, were ended:) about which time, Guns also came in use (at least in the Western parts;) as the <hi>Fire and Brimstone,</hi> out of the mouths of those Turkish <hi>Horsmen:</hi> which by that account should go down again before the Year, 1700.</p>
            <p>I must not so much as glance at all the Harmonies that might be easily found between <hi>Hours, Daies, Months,</hi> and <hi>Years,</hi> in relation to 6 or 7, and 10. or some of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. As 5 times 7 make 35, and 6 times 6 make 36. which may be found to equal Sun and Moons Motions, more than the usual Golden Number. And the 36<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Hour brings up the Sun of the second Day. And those two Numbers of 35 or 36. drawn into 10. bring up the Sun of the second Year also, both <hi>Lunar</hi> and <hi>Solar,</hi> among the Jews and other Nations. 7 times 7 make 49, and the 49 Hour begins the third Nights <hi>Rest</hi> (that good Chord in Musick) and the 49 Year brings in the Great <hi>Rest,</hi> or
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51941:105"/>
               <hi>Jubile.</hi> And 480. Hours, bring up the third <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or 21 Day. Which from 480, runs out through 490 and 500 Hour. And we see great things in Scripture, done in those Numbers. As the Temple built in the 480 Year from <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And <hi>Daniels</hi> Weeks make up 490 Years.</p>
            <p>144 Hours bring up the First <hi>Sabbath;</hi> which begins from That Hour. Which may be compared with That we read in the <hi>Revelat.</hi> of 12 drawn into 12, or <hi>squared.</hi> And of 12 times 12000, or 144000 (like the <hi>Clakins</hi> which the Jews find in 144 Hours:) called the <hi>First Fruits</hi> of the Earth; as the Hours of the First Week, were the <hi>First Fruits</hi> of <hi>Time;</hi> or of the <hi>World,</hi> before the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That also which the Revelation speaks of 666, as the number of the Beast; which so many have believed to be an Epocha of some great Change in the World; may be compared with the Changes of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and several <hi>Months,</hi> which both Ancient and Modern have observed. And 666 <hi>Hours</hi> bring us to high Noon of the fourth <hi>Sabbath</hi> or 28 Day. Which is the end of one <hi>Month,</hi> and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Moons Changes</hi> and <hi>Months,</hi> from Thence to the 700 Hour, in the 30 Day. Which I touch the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because That is the Number of the very Letters in the Hebrew <hi>Olam,</hi> which is both the <hi>World,</hi> and also <hi>Ever,</hi> or <hi>Eternity;</hi> or the <hi>Hidden</hi> Time of the Worlds Duration, or Great Change thereof: which it may be, still comes out in 666 Years; or at most 700. As the <hi>Moons</hi> Changes, are in so many <hi>Hours.</hi> And I know not any Nation or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Earth (as another <hi>Moon</hi> to the <hi>Moon;)</hi> that hath not felt great changes in That Revolution. And the very Phrase of <hi>Olam,</hi> or <hi>Hidden,</hi> may perhaps lead us to the <hi>Moons Hiding</hi> in her <hi>Change:</hi> whence she comes <hi>Alma;</hi> which in Heb is a Virgin, or an <hi>Hidden</hi> Beauty. As in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Languages, <hi>Alma Virgo, Alma Mater,</hi> and the like. To be compared also with the <hi>Wonder in Heaven, A Woman in the Sun, with the Moon at her Feet:</hi> Which we touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

               <hi>Moses</hi> maketh 70 Years a Mans <hi>Age,</hi> or His <hi>Fulness of Time,</hi> or <hi>Millo.</hi> And the Hebrew word to fill, is 70 or 71. in Numbers. And <hi>Davids</hi> 70. Years was the fourteenth 70.

When as <hi>Olam</hi> it self hath also a Plural, and is multiplied by many, in the Letter M: which is ever 40, and with <hi>jod</hi> 50 (as they used to multiply by 10 and by 50: As we see in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:) But M final, as they call it, is 600, as we see in the

            <p>And as <hi>Ad,</hi> addeth 4 to 70; So <hi>Netzach</hi> (another Hebrew word for Eternity,) doubleth <hi>Ad:</hi> and makes, in Numerals 148, which is Twice 74. And <hi>Dor,</hi> written fully in Heb. maketh 210, which is Thrice 70, the usual word for <hi>Age,</hi> or <hi>Generation:</hi> And, especially repeated, for Eternity also. When yet Both <hi>Dors</hi> make but 420 Years: or 60, of <hi>Daniels</hi> 70, <hi>Weeks</hi> or <hi>Sabbaths.</hi> Which is also ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great <hi>Ever.</hi> Yea, and That, multiplied by <hi>Ever</hi> also. For, One 7 times 7, or 49, in the Jubilee, is very often called Ever, and for Ever (as we saw before in the Servant for Ever, and otherwise:) How much more, when That Ever, is also multiplied by 10, and made 490.</p>

That God also did intend we should <hi>Multiply,</hi> somtimes, by adding Letters to a word, may be seen in the Plural Numerals, we read in Scripture: which are Ten times more than their Singulars, (and it may be, So were All <hi>Plurals:</hi> made by Jod (only in Regimen) which is 10; and by <hi>im,</hi> which is 50, at length:) As of <hi>Three,</hi> and <hi>Four,</hi> the <hi>Plurals</hi> are <hi>Thirty</hi> and <hi>Fourty.</hi> And by the way, it may be considered whether in the Second Command, it might not be read, <hi>Visiting Iniquity, for</hi> 30 <hi>or</hi> 40, <hi>Daies, or Months, or Years.</hi> Seeing 40, was the great Number in Punishing; Theirs also, in the Wilderness: where they stayed 40 Years, in 42 Mansions.

Which was the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year, or 49. a Number of <hi>Rest:</hi> as we found it in Hours, the beginning of the Third Nights Rest.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51941:107"/>
the very Hebrew <hi>Mot,</hi> which is <hi>Motion,</hi> or <hi>Mutation,</hi> is in Numbers 49. And every 3d. brought up a Change; as we found before in Night and Day, Rest and Motion; as in Leaps or Hopping; and in all our movings, One foot resteth, while the other moveth.</p>
            <p>Mot Turned is Tom; and <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>I may add also, that if M final be 600, in Hebrew words, we may find out many, making up the very Number of 666, of which we spake before; as the Number of <hi>Change</hi> in the <hi>Moon;</hi> and all other great Motions, and Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in all Generations.</p>
            <p>For the very word <hi>Sum</hi> (which is not only <hi>Eng,</hi> but <hi>Heb.</hi> is just 666. As if This, were the <hi>Summ</hi> of each Generation, or of every Age of the World; which is called <hi>Age</hi> also, in many Languages. And in <hi>Latine, Sum,</hi> is the great Verb of <hi>Being:</hi> As in Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

As we see, in That famous place, Thou shalt not call me <hi>Baali</hi> (my <hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>Master)</hi> but <hi>Ishi,</hi> my <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Husband.

            </p>
            <p>And among the <hi>Rabbins</hi> (or other <hi>Eastern</hi> Writers) <hi>Sum</hi> is not onely the <hi>Summ,</hi> but <hi>End,</hi> of all reckonings.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51941:108"/>
God <hi>shall</hi> give a Word (so it is in Heb) and Many shall be the Women Preachers.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Sophia</hi> (in Hebrew, a metathesis of <hi>Joseph)</hi> is with the Grecians <hi>Wisdome;</hi> so with them <hi>Foolishness,</hi> or <hi>Moria,</hi> is in Heb <hi>the Lords Teaching</hi> or <hi>Death:</hi> or Mountain of the Lord <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as his Name may be written, who was so notorious in the VVest, with <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the East, about the year 666.

As if <hi>man</hi> (an Hebrew word also) came from <hi>Mana,</hi> to <hi>Number.</hi> And <hi>Manath</hi> (or <hi>month)</hi> is reckoning, and 490. As if That Solemn Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 7 <hi>Sevenights</hi> (as we read in <hi>Daniels VVeeks)</hi> were some way That, which in Gods reckoning was The <hi>Number,</hi> or the <hi>Manath,</hi> or Month; and it may be (some way) in every month also.</p>
            <p>And in Hebrew, <hi>manim,</hi> or <hi>minae,</hi> Pounds, or <hi>mans</hi> (or if you will men) are 700: as <hi>mani, number;</hi> 100. And when <hi>Jacob</hi> complained that <hi>Laban</hi> had changed his wages so <hi>many</hi> times, it is <hi>manim,</hi> in Hebrew: as the English also use <hi>many;</hi> and for <hi>many</hi> also they use <hi>some;</hi> which is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew also; as we found before in <hi>sum,</hi> a sum, or end of number: and in numerals 666. as in Latine also <hi>Sexcenti</hi> for Many.</p>
            <p>Shall I add also that as <hi>money</hi> (or Monie) is plainly an Hebrew word, for <hi>Numbring</hi> [as with English] so also <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manins,</hi> which is <hi>Times,</hi> or <hi>seasons</hi> [as the word soundeth] for every thing, as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaketh; is but 7 added to 700.

               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:51941:108"/>
as if all <hi>seasons</hi> were made up of the number <hi>Seven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Hebrew Sum,</hi> is a kin to the Latine <hi>Sum,</hi> (and Turned backward, is their <hi>Mus:</hi> as <hi>Sumus</hi> also turned backward is still <hi>Sumus:</hi> as if all our <hi>being,</hi> and our <hi>summing</hi> also, were but <hi>mus,</hi> a <hi>mouse;</hi> and all our <hi>musing</hi> also, which is <hi>English,</hi> and many other languages;) so also both <hi>sums</hi> are very neer to the Greek <hi>soma,</hi> by which they expresse our <hi>body.</hi> And it may be, some will so render That phrase in the Revelation; <hi>For, it is the Number of a man:</hi> as if it were not onely of <hi>mans numbring,</hi> or of <hi>mans</hi> reaching, or bearing, or using: (as in Scripture often, the Rods <hi>of a man,</hi> and the <hi>Cords of a man,</hi> and the <hi>pen of a man,</hi> and the <hi>words of a man,</hi> and the <hi>way of a man,</hi> and the <hi>son of man,</hi> and <hi>Children of men; and to speak, or walk, as a man;</hi> and Temptations of a <hi>man,</hi> or <hi>common unto men:)</hi> But also some special Thing, in mans body, just of that Number. And what if it should be That, which makes him a <hi>man?</hi> and yet so much, and so oft, to degenerate, into a <hi>Beast?</hi> For, as <hi>man,</hi> in the <hi>Image of God,</hi> he was above <hi>all beasts,</hi> and made to Rule them all, with all his lusts and beastly Passions; as we shewed before, from Gods own words and great consult at mans Creation. <hi>But lust conceiving, brought forth sin: and sin, complete,</hi> or grown up, to be of age, <hi>brought forth Death;</hi> as we read in St. <hi>James:</hi> and in <hi>Peter</hi> also, <hi>that fleshly lusts, Fight against the spirit;</hi> and that it is very dangerous for any, <hi>that have once escaped the pollution of the world,</hi> which came in <hi>by lust; to return with the Dog to his vomit, or the sow to wallowing in the mire:</hi> in a word, to degenerate into a <hi>beast, or beastly nature.</hi> VVhich is very much by <hi>lust,</hi> and that which causeth <hi>lust,</hi> in our Bodies and Minds.

            <p>May I not add, that <hi>Shimshon,</hi> or Samson, or <hi>Hercules</hi> in Greek stories, signifies <hi>the Little Sun:</hi> (crossing the <hi>Crossing Serpent</hi> of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> and its 12 Signs; as the Labors of <hi>Hercules:</hi> where also the <hi>Hydra,</hi> or the <hi>Dragon;</hi> or <hi>Beast,</hi> and <hi>Serpent with 7 Heads:)</hi> and that it may be 666 or 700 in its numeral Letters also. Or How <hi>Samson Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed</hi> with <hi>Dallilah,</hi> till he was overcome by <hi>Lust</hi> also; that cut off his Hairs (as the Rayes of the Sun;) and at length put out his <hi>Eyes;</hi> or the <hi>Two Witnesses,</hi> in one Region: which have Two also in other places; called <hi>Testes,</hi> or <hi>Witnesses,</hi> by Many Nations.

the <hi>Moon,</hi> or <hi>Covering</hi> her, with his Robes and <hi>Throne</hi> of Glory: which they also called <hi>Kisse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And a <hi>Goat</hi> was offered so, for a Publique <hi>Sin Offering,</hi> at Every <hi>New Moon</hi> (which the Jews called also <hi>Chodesh,</hi> akin to <hi>Kodesh,</hi> Holy, or <hi>New:</hi> As also the <hi>Month</hi> following the <hi>New Moon:)</hi> And at All the <hi>Three Great solemn Feasts,</hi> at which All the <hi>Males,</hi> were to appear, under pain of <hi>Cutting off.</hi> Which we may call a great <hi>Arcanum</hi> of their Civil Government also. For by This, they did not only meet and Feast (as a badg of greatest Peace, or Union, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;) but also, They must then, appear, to All <hi>Suits</hi> or <hi>Actions:</hi> which might else fall Heavy enough on the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff of each Tribe or County.</p>
            <p>But as the feast of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> was the Greatest of the Three: so it had more solemn Attendants. A peculiar feast of <hi>Trumpets:</hi> especially, at the years of <hi>Release</hi> and <hi>Jubilies</hi> (which, now began at That <hi>end of the year:)</hi> and the great Day of <hi>Expiation,</hi> or <hi>Atoning</hi> or <hi>Covering:</hi> as the word <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> or <hi>Cover,</hi> signifies. And the Jews Tradition is, that Then, the very next Night, or thereabout, the great God beginneth to sit in Judgement: on all the dead of that year. Which they therefore attend, with great watchings, and Fastings, with other solemnities.</p>
            <p>But more to our present purpose, are the <hi>Goats,</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on That day: Double or Treble to the sin offering, or Goats, of any day of the year, before That. One of them also (the <hi>Scape Goat)</hi> was not onely carried out, without the Camp, as the <hi>great sin offering,</hi> for the people (whose blood was carried into the holy place, as we see in <hi>Aarons</hi> great Failor at his Sons Burning; beside the Epistle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews:) but it was also carried out, and sent by a <hi>Fit Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger,</hi> a great way off, into the <hi>Wildernesse:</hi> to go, as far as He would; abroad into <hi>All the World.</hi> So that he might visit All Goats in All Countries: For, he was let <hi>loose,</hi> to all the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> and <hi>all the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, it will be no great wonder, that All <hi>Nations,</hi> are so solemnly called, and invited, to the following <hi>feast of Tabernacles</hi> (represented by all the Fruits of the earth, Then gathered in) and that, under a great penalty, of <hi>botch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi>

               <hi>of Aegypt,</hi> or of wanting <hi>Rain,</hi> or <hi>Water</hi> also.

            </p>
            <p>Shall we now wonder, that more <hi>Rams</hi> and <hi>Goats</hi> and <hi>Bullocks,</hi> were accepted on his Holy Altar ('tis his own expression of <hi>Nebaioth,</hi> or <hi>Edom</hi> also:) in This Month, or Moon, then in any, or it may be All, of All the Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides?

            </p>
            <p>Is there not a strange Twisting of <hi>Bullocks, Rams</hi> and <hi>Goats</hi> together: As in the Tabernacle it self, with <hi>Rams skins dyed Red,</hi> and <hi>Goats hair?</hi> As they all met once, in the <hi>Ark,</hi> as an Emblem of our Bodies also, and its Three Regions, and beasts in it, as the Church.

            <p>We have seen the First of First fruits: <hi>the Barley sheaf,</hi> first <hi>Heaved up,</hi> on the Third day, after the passeover was slain; as an Emblem of His Resurrection, who was That <hi>Sire</hi> also. not onely a <hi>Goat</hi> (as before) but <hi>Barley</hi> also; the rough hairy bearded, Goatish kind of Seed: of which also before: and in <hi>Elijah, John the Baptist,</hi> and his rough Garments, and his <hi>Meen.</hi> Seeming so Austere.</p>
            <p>Yea and the <hi>first fruits</hi> also, the <hi>Biccurim: Elect of God;</hi> and the first born, of which we spake also at the <hi>Pentecost. But the promise is to you, and to yours, and to All, that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off: even as many as the Lord</hi> (not onely hath, but) <hi>shall call,</hi> through all Ages and Generations.</p>
            <p>Doth it not plainly lead us to the <hi>Feast of Tabernacles?</hi> For, Then, not onely They, and Their Children, but their <hi>strangers</hi> also: yea and all their Neighbours round them; yea <hi>All Nations,</hi> were not onely called, but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to that Feast of <hi>Tabernacles.</hi> As the Jews observe it to this day, for building their Booths abroad, in open ayr (as commanded;) not onely receiving, but inviting <hi>strangers</hi> to them. As we found also, in <hi>Zech.</hi> and divers Psalms and Prophets, (cited before;) with 31 of <hi>Devt</hi> &amp; 12 verse, to be compared with the 29 and 16 Chapters. And least their solemnMeeting at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> should be clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with contests, or suits of Law; there is added also, at
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51941:113"/>
Close of That Law of those Feasts, another <hi>Magnale impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii,</hi> (and their Politicks were such, that all Nations should say, they were wise, and had a wise God) appointing both <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Officers:</hi> which were both, distinct from their <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edrin,</hi> and <hi>King.</hi> As we found the Power, of making <hi>Laws, Judging,</hi> and <hi>Executing Law</hi> (or <hi>Governing by Law)</hi> to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, &amp; to be kept in Distinct Persons; as in <hi>Esay</hi> 33, &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places. And in <hi>All their Gates</hi> (or walled Towns) they must have <hi>Judges;</hi> more then One; and never lesse then Three. As they all note, on That of the Psalm, <hi>the Lord sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth among the Gods:</hi> which must be Three at least, they say; and rightly; for, their <hi>Plural</hi> is never lesse, or <hi>Fewer, then Three.</hi> And why then may not This, also note a <hi>Trinity of Persons</hi> in the God-head also: seeing <hi>Elohim,</hi> is <hi>Plural?</hi> and as, Their Judges, must be <hi>Three,</hi> at least: So their <hi>Church Meetings,</hi> must be of 10, at least. As they note also, from the 10 <hi>Searchers,</hi> called a <hi>Church,</hi> or Congregation: and many other waies. Yea, for Officers also, They had usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, Three Elders, and Seven Deacons: in their Synagogs. And never less than three that I find, There also, to be <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elders.</hi> As in all their Gates, <hi>Three</hi> Judges.</p>
            <p>And now seeing we may fix one Foot of our Compass, on the Feast of <hi>First Fruits</hi> at <hi>Pentecost,</hi> in the second of <hi>Acts:</hi> May it not be possible to stretch it out to the Certain time of the <hi>Feast of Tabernacles</hi> also? which must be, in the Fourth Month, after That. And if it be given in, from the Grace of <hi>God,</hi> upon the Prayers of all his people, <hi>with the supply of the spirit of Jesus of Nazareth:</hi> Why may it not be spoken also; or written, to some few? when we have found a Private Character, to expresse our Thoughts, more speedily, and secretly, then yet is Common? One of the many, greater things, our God is doing; and now happly bringing forth also: for as <hi>Babilon</hi> falls, so will Babling also, and <hi>stammering tongues.</hi> In the mean time, why may I not say, these few words more? That, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Changes,</hi> are yet to come, before that last, and great, and good change, in the last (Seventh) month; or <hi>End of the year:</hi> Or <hi>Feast of Tabernacles;</hi> at the great Harvest, or Vintage also; or <hi>In gathering of All Fruits of the Earth; or Restoring all things;</hi> As our Saviour speaks:
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:51941:113"/>
There are but <hi>Three New Moons;</hi> between the <hi>Pentecost,</hi> and Month of That Great <hi>Feast,</hi> which we now speak of. And one of the Three, was very probably, in That Great Change of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and its Polity, by the <hi>Romans.</hi> With <hi>Baalam, Cittim: But he shall perish My Ever,</hi> or <hi>to Ten (Adi,</hi> 12 times 7:) And <hi>Jacob shall destroy the Reliques of the City:</hi> and in <hi>Daniel, Tsiim Cittim. And the King shall Act his Will, by his own Reason</hi> (His common phrase, 8. 3. 11. 4. 16. 36.) and the very name of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi> may be hinted in the next word, ending in <hi>Romem,</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam. He shall not regard the desire of Women</hi> (to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the <hi>Doctrine of Daemons,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.) <hi>nor Any God: but shall Exalt himself above All (that is called God, or Worshiped,</hi> 2 Thes. 2.) <hi>But for God, he shall honor Mauzzim:</hi> (5 times in this chap. for a <hi>Fort,</hi> a <hi>Maze, Mews,</hi> or <hi>Muse:) a strange God.</hi> And the worst kind of <hi>Strangers.</hi> For, they were bid to love a stranger <hi>(Ger,</hi> and <hi>Hager)</hi> as <hi>Themselves</hi> or Angels: But <hi>Avoda zara, strange Service,</hi> is still forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Cursed.

               <hi>At the same time,</hi> which before is called <hi>the Time of the End:</hi> and in the verse before, he shall come to his <hi>End.</hi> And five times, this Chapter speaketh of <hi>End,</hi> and the <hi>End.</hi> In Heb. <hi>Kets</hi> or <hi>Kats,</hi> (and <hi>Katsa</hi> is <hi>Half, Dimidium Plus Toto:)</hi> the whole of any thing, or its <hi>Perfection.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also, as we noted in <hi>Tom Perfect,</hi> in numbers just 1000. Unto which also 666, is that sweet Chord in Musick, which they call a <hi>Fift;</hi> next to a <hi>Diapason:</hi> 2 thirds, as neer as may be, in whole numbers.</p>
            <p>The Hebrew word may also speak <hi>waking</hi> (as hinting a <hi>Resurrection;)</hi> and <hi>Summer:</hi> which was the End of their year, beginning with <hi>Winter:</hi> as before, All time began with <hi>Night,</hi> before <hi>Day.</hi> And that their Year ended at, or about, the great <hi>Feast of Tabernables,</hi> is cleer enough from many Scriptures.

And <hi>Abraham</hi> pursued the Four Monarchs to <hi>Dan,</hi> and brought back the Captivity of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> from <hi>Dan,</hi> which is also <hi>Judgment:</hi> and may hint that Great Judgment at the <hi>Katsyr,</hi> Harvest, or the End of <hi>Yeer,</hi> or of <hi>Jaar,</hi> that is a Month, or Yeer, or <hi>Flood</hi> also. For it may be added, that the Floods were dried up, and the Rain of Heaven restrained, at their Harvest. <hi>As</hi> we may find hinted in divers places, besides 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 17. and 2. 21. 10.</p>
            <p>But there may yet be somwhat more in it. For, <hi>As the Spirit is moving, or Hatching,</hi> (it being a participle Present in the Hebrew; noting a continued Act) <hi>upon the VVaters, of the first Creation:</hi> So it is also, still <hi>Dividing</hi> Them below, from Them <hi>Above, the Firmament:</hi> which is also called by a Name of <hi>VVaters</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>VVhere, are VVaters.</hi> And our Time, is <hi>Dropping of VVaters,</hi> from the Top of the Weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass (or <hi>Clepsydra)</hi> to the Bottom. And when All is Run out, the Hour Glass is Turned; and a New Hour, or Day, or Month, or Yeer, or Age begins: which you may call a New Generation; or if you will, a New World.</p>
            <p>We glanced at This before, when <hi>Elijah</hi> parted the Waters of <hi>Jordane;</hi> As before also, the same Waters were parted (and from <hi>Adam</hi> also:) As we read in <hi>Josuah,</hi> 3. 16. Where we are told that <hi>Jordan</hi> fills all its Banks in Harvest Time (as alluding to That we spake before:) And that the <hi>VVaters</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Numbers 665) <hi>Coming down from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, Rose up</hi> in a great Heap, or <hi>Bottle;</hi> (or such a Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the English call a <hi>Nod,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:) which came Far also From <hi>Adam</hi> (as some read, from the Jews marginal <hi>Keri)</hi> But in the Text, it is <hi>In Adam, the VVatcher</hi> (though some read it the City:) being the same word used by <hi>Daniel,</hi> in his Discourse of 7 <hi>Times, On Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> driven out, or poured out, by the Watcher. And again, the <hi>VVatchers</hi> in the same <hi>Daniel.</hi> Of which yet, we may speak again. As we hinted before also, How the Watchers stood at the quarters of Heaven, or Corners of the Earth, as it were to Turn the Glass, still, when it is Run. As also, the great Waters Ebbing and Flowing, six Hours apiece (in the Great Ocean) and Then Turned again, at the Seventh:
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51941:115"/>
which speaketh Both Rest, and Turning. Which is also noted in <hi>Joshua.</hi> First, <hi>the VVaters stood</hi> ('tis said) and Then, <hi>they Rose,</hi> or were Turned up, by the Watcher. And Those Running down to the Sea of the Plain, or the <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> (another pretty allusion) were cut off, or <hi>Curted</hi> (which is Hebrew) and <hi>Perfected:</hi> so that All the People (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in numerals 670) passed over before, or over against <hi>Jericho.</hi> Which as We touched before, signifies his <hi>Moon. As</hi> if it meant to teach us, How all Changings, and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brings, are between the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Moon;</hi> which as English Money, is from Numbring and Changing, as <hi>Man</hi> also: the Great Changer, and the Money Changer also. But take heed, he be not whipped out of the Temple, by our Saviour; Though by a scourge of smal Cords.</p>
            <p>So that the Moon and the Earth, are but the Two Round Glasses of the Klepsydra: the Weather Glass, or Hour Glass. And as One Fills, the other Empties. Whence the Tyde is Highest, Fullest, Just as the <hi>Moon</hi> comes to the Zenith, or Highest Point of Heaven, over such or such a Place, And <hi>As</hi> she goes down again, the Earth goes up, and drops its Tide back again. And why our Seas and Brains, and Reins (or Rains) are fullest, just at Emptiest Moon, we call it Full; will be no great wonder. Except haply we should imagine the Sun and the Earth are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Two Globes of the Hour Glass or <hi>Clepsydra;</hi> and the Moon the little Rundle, or the Firmament between them. Which seems more proper much to the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Sun and Moon. And yet some, with great appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Reason, make the Sun it self the Centre of All the Planets: And the Moon whirling about the Earth. Which we may touch again. And to This, of <hi>Moon,</hi> and <hi>Waters (Above the Firmament)</hi> Dropping Through; to make <hi>All Time;</hi> I might add the English Name of <hi>Showr,</hi> as if it were <hi>So Hour,</hi> or <hi>See Hour:</hi> But This also, is <hi>Hebrew.</hi>

            <p>Or shall we say, that After the Temple, God himself seemed to Turn his Face, <hi>Westward</hi> (As Christ on the Cross) and so, That was now, at his Right Hand, which before, at his Left: and That Now, before him, which was formerly, behind him.

God, or Christ on the Cross, was now Turned, quite contrary, to the Posture, He was in, before?

            <p>But in our little Body, we have Hot and Cold, Moist and Dry; Muscles, pulling up and down, drawing in and out: and yet, All Those, All other, contrarieties, make excellent <hi>Harmony.</hi> So, in His great Body, the Church, of his First Born, and the World also; much greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties (than we can well express) are reconciled, and accepted also, by Him, who hath purposed in himself to Reconcile All things, Even All things! To Himself: in, and by, and Through, our Blessed Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; and by the Blood of his Cross. Who is God, over All, Blessed for Ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to All, that are called to be Saints; or in Any place (for, it will be in All places,) <hi>call upon Jesus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth, Their Lord, and Ours;</hi> I am bold to say (because God hath said it, and written it also:) <hi>Let Him that stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, Take heed lest he fall. And there is No Temptation, on you, to you, but what is common to man: But God is Faithful,</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:51941:122"/>
               <hi>who will not suffer you, to be Tempted, above your ability; but with the Temptation, will also make a way to escape, that you may</hi> (not run away, but) <hi>be able, to Bear it</hi> (However God may bear it from you, or bear it with you, and upon you.) <hi>Wherefore,</hi> my <hi>Dearly Beloved, flee from Idolatry. I speak, as to wise men, Judg what I say.</hi> And How, comes in, This <hi>Wherefore?</hi> unless the <hi>Temptations to Idolatry,</hi> be of All, the Greatest, and most dangerous? And of All Idolatries, That of our own Fancy; or vain Imagination: that is, Image-making of our own Hearts; more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and more provoking God to <hi>Jealousie,</hi> than All other Idols: As we touched before in the second Command.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But who art Thou O man that judgest another, or settest at naught Thy Brother? If in any thing we differ, God shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal This also.</hi> Yet a little while, and we must <hi>stand before His Throne;</hi> who said, <hi>This is my Commandement,</hi> and yet again, <hi>My New Commandement; that you Love One another:</hi> (and Take Heed, you fall not out by the way:) <hi>and by This shall all men know, you are my Disciples; if you love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And it must be also, <hi>Even as He hath loved us. And by This, we have boldness and confidence</hi> to pray, and hope, and believe he heareth us, and loveth us, <hi>when we love one another.</hi> And to <hi>Brotherly kindness, Add Love. And that your Love abound and increase to One another, and to All men. To All men!</hi> Yea, <hi>and Honor All men. And the Time is coming, and already come</hi> (he said) <hi>that ye shall worship the Father, neither at This Mountain, nor at Jerusalem</hi> (but in every place) <hi>True Worshipers, shall Worship the Father, in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and in Truth; For the Father Seeketh such to worship him:</hi> and such he will Finde.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Thou that Hearest Prayer, unto Thee shall All Flesh come: and to Thee, shall the Vow be performed. Praise waiteth for Thee O God</hi> (who dost both possess, and inherit, All the Praises of Israel:) <hi>in silence.</hi> For, so the Phrase speaketh, and so the Jews read it. As, <hi>The Lord is in his Holy Place, let All Flesh be Silent:</hi> and again, <hi>Let All the Earth be Silent before him. Let my Prayer be directed as Incense; and the Lifting up of my Hands, as the Evening Minha,</hi> (of which again.) And <hi>In Thy Name, I will Lift up my Hands. And in</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:51941:123"/>
               <hi>His Name, Every Knee must bow.</hi> Which with Christians, was, As <hi>Lifting up Hands,</hi> with the Jews. Who, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Stood:</hi> and seldom <hi>Kneeled,</hi> or fell upon their Faces, or much Bowed; except very Creat and Good, or as they speak, <hi>Righteous men.</hi> But generally they <hi>Stood,</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <hi>Lifting up their Hands.</hi> And so, <hi>Paul</hi> also biddeth (though himself <hi>Kneeled</hi> on the sands: and Christ <hi>Kneeled,</hi> and fell flat in his Agony:) <hi>I will that men pray, Every where</hi> (or in All Places) <hi>Lifting up Pure Hands</hi> (as in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Pure Incense)</hi> or <hi>Holy hands, without wrath and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea and Christ also, <hi>lifted up his eyes to Heaven</hi> (as he bid us sav, <hi>Our Father in Heaven)</hi> though he said, and knew, <hi>the Father was in Him.</hi> And yet, when he lifted up his hand to swear, that it might appear, he owned none <hi>greater than himself,</hi> he sware by himself, <hi>that every knee should bow to Him.</hi> And yet (as the Apostle saith) this also must be, <hi>to the glory of God the Father:</hi> which is Reason enough, for granting all we can ask. <hi>For,</hi> (only <hi>For,) Thine is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power, and Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus in our Prophet <hi>Daniel, Lifting up of hands,</hi> was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of <hi>Swearing.</hi> And so, in that of <hi>Amalech,</hi> (a Branch of <hi>Esau,</hi> by a <hi>Concubine;)</hi> because his Hand against the Lords <hi>Kiss,</hi> or <hi>Throne</hi> (or covering of the <hi>Moon,) the Lords hand on his Throne, for War with Amalech, from Age to Age, Middor Dor:</hi> 448 (reaching to <hi>David:) And blotting, I will blot out the memorial of Amalech from under Heaven:</hi> Yet, but <hi>Under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!</hi> O how cautious, and how gracious God is, in his lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his heavy hand! <hi>David</hi> was as keen against <hi>Amalech,</hi> as any we finde; remembring how <hi>Saul</hi> was cut off (and that by an <hi>Amalekite)</hi> for sparing <hi>Amalech.</hi> Nor could <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> rest, till he had cut off <hi>Amalech</hi> (though we find Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of them in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time;) and yet the great end of all this, against <hi>Amalech</hi> also, is, <hi>That they may seek the Pace of the Lord:</hi> and <hi>that they may know, that thou JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH, art most High over all the earth.</hi> As we read, of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> also, in <hi>Psalm</hi> 83: which may Comment, on all those heavy Prayers, against <hi>Edom,</hi> and <hi>Moab,</hi> and <hi>Amalech,</hi> and all Gods Enemies also; not to destroy them <hi>for Ever,</hi>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:51941:123"/>
as some think; putting <hi>men</hi> in little letters. The Text is plain enough, <hi>That They may seek,</hi> and that <hi>They may know,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So God <hi>lifted up his Hand</hi> in the Wilderness, <hi>to swear in his Zeal</hi> (tis often cited) what? <hi>Not</hi> that they should not <hi>rest:</hi> But <hi>If, they enter into My rest!</hi> How cautious! Yet I may add, That as there was a Second Moneth for such as could not keep the <hi>Mood and Tense</hi> of the right <hi>Passover</hi> (and <hi>for such, The Lord be merciful, though they be not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the strictnes of the Sanctuary;</hi> as good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Lord heard, and accepted, and Healed:) So there was also a Second <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and a Third; and yet an <hi>Olam,</hi> or a <hi>New Moon.</hi> Yea, and after all the <hi>Changes</hi> of That year, there was a <hi>Sabbatical year</hi> also, and a <hi>Jubile;</hi> when All must rest, and come again into the possessions of their Fathers. Yea and the very <hi>standing still of Joshvahs Sun and moon</hi> (and over <hi>Gibeon</hi> also,) might intimate a <hi>Rest of Heaven;</hi> for some that had not kept a <hi>Rest</hi> (or <hi>Sabbath) on Earth.</hi> And if That, were just so many Sabbaths of years from the Creation, as there were <hi>Dayes</hi> in their <hi>Solar</hi> (or <hi>Lunar) year;</hi> Or just so many Jubilies from the Creation, as there be <hi>Weeks</hi> in a year: it may be some little Help to fix Chronology; which may be considered again.</p>
            <p>And That summ of the Law and Gospel too, the 20th of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> sheweth us, How, and Why, God made the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths for Man,</hi> and <hi>not Man for the Sabbath:</hi> As Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self glosseth on Those words. <hi>Moreover</hi> (and <hi>above all the Law,</hi> and Statutes also;) I <hi>gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and Them; That they might know, that I the Lord, am still sanctifying Them.</hi> For it is a <hi>Participle Present,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a <hi>continued Act.</hi> And again, (in the same Chapter) <hi>That you may know, that I am, the Lord your God.</hi> And There also, he often speaketh of <hi>Lifting up his Hand,</hi> to swear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; and of That very Oath, of not bringing them into <hi>Canaan;</hi> but addeth (many times) <hi>Neverthelefs my Eye spared them</hi> (and his <hi>Heart</hi> is better than his <hi>Eye) from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying them: nor did I make an end of them,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, and after All their own and Childrens <hi>Blaspheming</hi> of Him (That is the Word,) yet the sum of his Threatnings is, that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:51941:124"/>
He would bring them, into the <hi>Wilderness of the People, and There I will</hi> (speak kindly to them, in <hi>Hoseah,</hi> But Heer) <hi>Plead with them, as I pleaded with their Fathers, in the Wildernesse. And I will cause you to passe under the Rod, and bring you into the Bond of the Covenant: or Masoroth thereof.</hi> And then follow, some of the sweetest promises, in all the Bible: for True Gospel Repentance, and Remission of Sins.</p>
            <p>And This, after they had forfeited, that Good Land of Rest; and God took the Forfeiture, awhile; and drove them out: As <hi>Adam,</hi> out of Paradice. But Then, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Them, with <hi>Both Hands lifted up, to Blesse them.</hi> When he went about to swear against them, He lifted up but <hi>One Hand;</hi> and That also was pulled back again: But to Blesse them, he Lifted up <hi>Both Hands.</hi> As Christ also, in Healing and Blessing All about him, in severall places: to be added to <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 26. And the Priests came Out of the Temple, Lifting up Both Hands, and opening their fingers (as the <hi>Holy Windows,)</hi> Blessed Those might not come In. To which also, the Psalmist may allude in That, <hi>The Lord Blesse thee, Out of Zion; and send thee Help, Out of his Holy Place. Out</hi> of it, though thou be not In it: but As <hi>Jonah</hi> said, <hi>I am Cut off, yet I will Look towards his Holy Place.</hi> As <hi>Solomon</hi> also Prayed, for Those that should so <hi>look</hi> towards it. As we find also, Our Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> Looking towards it; from a Great Distance. And, That Saying, <hi>Send thee Help, Out,</hi> As it plainly intimates, They were not <hi>There,</hi> but <hi>Out,</hi> at Distance: So it may also allude, to the usuall name they gave the Temple <hi>Court;</hi> from <hi>Ezra: Help.</hi> As <hi>Eben-Ezer.</hi> And there was No Case so Bad, They say, But There, might <hi>Help</hi> be Had. And so, They called it <hi>Help. As a Present Help, in Time of Need.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was One thing more, We must observe, in <hi>Lifting up of Hands,</hi> and That is <hi>Numbering.</hi> In the very Name of <hi>Right</hi> Hand, <hi>Jamin: It shall Number, Order, and Prefer.</hi> And as <hi>Right-Hand Blessings,</hi> were the <hi>Greatest:</hi> So were their <hi>Right-Hand Numbers. At her Right Hand, Length of Dayes:</hi> As <hi>Riches and Honours</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:51941:124"/>
               <hi>at her Left.</hi> Which was called <hi>Smol,</hi> (as English <hi>Small,)</hi> in Comparison of the Right Hand <hi>Numbers:</hi> or other things. But <hi>smell,</hi> and <hi>smile,</hi> and <hi>similis,</hi> may come from their <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, So may the Latine <hi>Semel.</hi> While they reckoned <hi>All small Numbers, Once,</hi> on their <hi>Left Hand</hi> Fingers, and Joynts; As so many Places, for <hi>Unites, Tenths,</hi> and <hi>Hundreds:</hi> Greater Numbers had their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, at the <hi>Right Hand.</hi> Whence also they began to <hi>Write.</hi> As if That also, might allude to the sound of <hi>Right,</hi> in English: Coming, as All other motions, from the <hi>Right Hand, to the Left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But As Christ, Lifted up, Both his Hands, in Blessing his People; especially, at the <hi>Sun-setting,</hi> or <hi>Evening</hi> of the World, (which we may touch again) See <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 40. and 13. 13. and 24. 39. 40. 50. So Here, in <hi>Daniel, the Man in Linnen, Lifted up, Both his Hands: in Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and Numbering These Numbers. Yet, when the Time to be Numbred, grew Less, as it was in the <hi>Revelation;</hi> Then the Angel, Onely Lift up, <hi>One of his Hands:</hi> to Swear, and Number it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Sware, by Him, that Liveth for Ever.</hi> The Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation addeth (to This of <hi>Daniel,) and Made the Heaven, and Earth, and Seas,</hi> or Waters under the Earth: As all the three Regions, we noted before, in our Bodies also. And the Angel, preaching the <hi>Everlasting Gospel,</hi> in the Revelation, putteth so great an Emphasis, on That of <hi>Fountains of Waters,</hi> also, (besides all the sea:) As if it were One great Demonstration of an Insinite Power, in the Living God, to create a Fountain, or Fountains of <hi>Living Water.</hi> Of which also, to <hi>Hagar,</hi> at <hi>Beerlahairoi,</hi> where <hi>Isaak</hi> also first met his wife; (although it were <hi>Ishmaels</hi> well:) Our Saviour discourseth sweetly, to the Woman of <hi>Samaria.</hi> Adding also; <hi>If thou knewest the Gift of God, and who it is, that speaketh to thee,</hi> (and he speaketh, calleth, wooeth, weepeth over, Us also) <hi>Thou wouldst Ask, and</hi> He <hi>would give Thee, a Fountain of Living</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:51941:125"/>
               <hi>Waters, ever flowing to Eternal Life:</hi> For so, he saith his Waters were. It mindes me of the Psalmists saying, <hi>Who is still Turning</hi> (for it is a present and continued Act of Turning;) <hi>The very Flint,</hi> that great Magazine of Nature, <hi>into a Fountain of Waters.</hi> He that can do it, hath perhaps Dame Natures Key, to One of her richest Cabinets. And it may be, I may tell you, it is Doable. He that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands the vertue of This <hi>Vegetive Water,</hi> will not wonder the next words should be, <hi>Not unto us, Not unto us, but to Thy Name, be All the Glory.</hi> Shall I add also that <hi>Jeremy</hi> saith, <hi>Can All the Gods of the Gentiles give us Rain?</hi> Which is <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> As the <hi>Mother,</hi> to the Works of Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For a Time, Times, and Half.</hi> So it is rendred general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But <hi>Moed,</hi> (the word here used) and so also <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is <hi>Season,</hi> rather then <hi>Time.</hi> Some certain, fixed, or appointed <hi>season:</hi> from a word to Fix, or appoint some solemn Meeting, or the like appointment. And it may be, we can hardly render it Better, then by the usual Grammer Phrase of <hi>Mood and Tense,</hi> of Acting all the great Works of God. Whose Seasons are so reserved in his Own Breast (as Christ hinteth,) that Mans Labour is Great under the Sun, because he knoweth not his Seasons, or the <hi>Moeds,</hi> for All Actions: As we read in <hi>Salomons</hi> discourse of Time and Seasons; yet much more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>
            <p>For some little Essay towards This, Through the supply of the Spirit of Jesus, upon the Hearts and Prayers of His Children and Servants; (For who is sufficient for it?) Let us remember what was said, of <hi>Fulness</hi> and <hi>Rest,</hi> and <hi>Turn,</hi> or <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in the Number Seven. And how Scripture and Nature also, Teacheth us to part all wholes, as much as may be, into <hi>Halves;</hi> as we touched before, in <hi>Diapasons,</hi> and other Chords of Musick. And this Three and an Half is but just Half that Sacred Number of <hi>Seven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Word rendred <hi>Half,</hi> is fron <hi>Chatsa,</hi> to <hi>cut</hi> into parts, more or less. So that their <hi>Chatsa Slosh,</hi> is to <hi>Cut and Slash</hi> into Three parts; as <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>David, at Mahanaim; Gideon and Abimelech,</hi> at <hi>Sechem.</hi> And the <hi>Grecian</hi> Kingdom in <hi>Daniel,</hi> was cut or broken into Four parts; where yet the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51941:125"/>
same <hi>Verb,</hi> is used; But the Nown commonly speaketh <hi>Half,</hi> from <hi>Halaph to change:</hi> as if their great changes were by <hi>Halving</hi> things. So, <hi>The Heavens are Halved, but Thou changest not.</hi> Where also the Psalmist saith, <hi>O take me not away, in the midst of my dayes; Or Half thereof:</hi> as it saith, <hi>The wicked do not, fill up, Half their Daies.</hi> And in many other Scriptures, we read of <hi>Half,</hi> in the very same word, here used in <hi>Daniel,</hi> for <hi>Half</hi> a Time; or <hi>Half a Mood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there be, but 7 whole Notes, in a <hi>Diapason,</hi> though it be called an <hi>Eight;</hi> (yet, as the Last <hi>Head,</hi> in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> such an <hi>Eight,</hi> as is One of the <hi>Seven</hi> also;) is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by all; who make their different <hi>Cliffs,</hi> or <hi>Keys,</hi> or <hi>Moods,</hi> or <hi>Scales,</hi> in Musick, by their different placing That <hi>Half Note</hi> (which they still find in every four Notes,) and call a <hi>Fa Flat,</hi> or <hi>Falling,</hi> to a <hi>sharp,</hi> or Full. Till we have some other opportunity, to discuss the Reason of This, in Nature; we may remember, what was touched before, of the Number <hi>Four:</hi> which is the first of all <hi>square</hi> Numbers, and so the Measure of all the Rest: which are All made, and resolved, by 4 (as Cubes by 8;) which hath a Name in Hebrew, akin to <hi>squaring.</hi> This may be some reason, why Nature hath placed a Pauze before it: Or between the sacred Number of <hi>Three</hi> (which are All simple Numbers,) and <hi>Four,</hi> the First compound or <hi>square</hi> Number.</p>
            <p>Thus also, in the very First Numbers, (we have yet found in <hi>Nature;)</hi> the 12 <hi>Hours of Night,</hi> are So parted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 4 <hi>Threes,</hi> or <hi>Watches.</hi> The whole, being first <hi>Halved</hi> (as we spake before, in our Discourse of 6 and 7:) which maketh That, the Scripture often oalleth <hi>Midnight:</hi> of which First, at the Last great Plague of <hi>Egypt</hi> at <hi>Midnight:</hi> to be compared with That in <hi>Job,</hi> 34. 20. After he had said: <hi>If he draw in, his breath; All flesh expireth:</hi> which we touched before.</p>
            <p>And again, Each Half, was Halved, into <hi>Watches,</hi> which began at <hi>Night,</hi> as the <hi>Laments</hi> tell us, &amp; theGospel hath <hi>the</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Watch of the Night</hi> (whatever the Jews speak of 3:) So that after, Every 3 Hours, came the Watch; or <hi>Chatsa:</hi> with such a signal pauze, and difference, as <hi>Chimes,</hi> or
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:51941:126"/>
               <hi>Changes;</hi> now in some places, between the Watches: Which seem Then, of 3 Hours apiece; As each of the 4 sides, of that Great and <hi>square City,</hi> had also 3 <hi>Gates.</hi> If we may so again reflect on the Hebrew <hi>Shaars:</hi> whence it may be, the English <hi>Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re,</hi> and <hi>Shears,</hi> and <hi>Shire</hi> also.</p>
            <p>I add not, that <hi>Watches, and Catches</hi> also, might come from the Hebrew <hi>Chatsa.</hi> Which in This sence, is akin to their <hi>Kaets;</hi> to <hi>Watch</hi> or wake, out of sleep: which is also applied to God himself; the Great <hi>Watchman of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> And what if the <hi>Watchers,</hi> singing <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy;</hi> at every Watch; might allude to the Three Hours, in Each of them, as well, as to, the 3 Persons, in the Blessed Trinity? Though some ancient Copies, square the 3 also; and make it 9 times, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And seeing, All things, Here below, were but shadows of somwhat above, and shewed also, in the Mount; Why may not That <hi>Half Hours Rest, or-silence in Heaven,</hi> of which we read in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> be As the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to Half Hours (There being 7 Halves, in 3 and an Half;) As we found before, a <hi>Sabbath</hi> (both in <hi>Rest,</hi> and <hi>Turning)</hi> in every 7 <hi>Hours,</hi> and <hi>Daies,</hi> and <hi>Months,</hi> and Years also?</p>
            <p>Or it may be, the <hi>Cardinal Watches,</hi> were distinguished by their <hi>Songs</hi> (as the Temple <hi>Waits,</hi> or <hi>Trumpets:</hi> as <hi>David</hi> may allude, by, <hi>Rising at Midnight, to sing Praises</hi> &amp;c.) As the Others by <hi>Rest,</hi> or <hi>silence.</hi> Which we see, cleer enough, in 2 of them; at the <hi>Morning and Evening Incense:</hi> while the People stood without, Praying in <hi>silence</hi> (till the Priest came out and blessed them.) As we read in That of the Baptists Father, strucken <hi>Silent</hi> also: And in all the Jews, upon Those places, we touched before, in the Psalms and Prophets; <hi>The Lord is in his Holy Place, Let all the Earth be Silent: and the Lord is Risen, Let All flesh keep Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence before him.</hi> And I <hi>charge you, that you awake not my Love, till He please.</hi>

            <p>And as Every seventh Day, was Holy, from the first Creation (As we see, by divers things, in the Flood, and many Scriptures:) So, was Every seventh Honr, as we saw before, distinct or Holy (from the Six before it;) bringing in, some Great change, of Midnight, or Morning,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:51941:126"/>
or Noon, or Evening, whence All Time did first begin. And from That First beginning of Time, there were <hi>Three Daies and an half</hi> (or 4 Evenings, and Three Mornings,) before the <hi>Sun and Moon</hi> were seen in the Firmament. Which, they were not, till the fourth Day of Creation, as we read in the first of <hi>Genesis.</hi> So That, for the whole 3 <hi>Daies and an half</hi> (before That fourth Day) those 2 Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of Heaven, lay <hi>Dead,</hi> as it were; or, <hi>Asleep, in their Causes;</hi> as the Schools use to speak. And at the End, of Those 3 Daies, and an Half, there was a voyce, saying, <hi>Come up hither,</hi> and Be you placed in Heaven; As my 2 Faithful Witnesses: So long as These Heavens, and This Earth, shall Endure. And when These, are to pass away, and be renewed, Then also 2 other Witnesses (that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respond to These) shall lie as <hi>Dead,</hi> or <hi>asleep,</hi> 3 daies and an half; (As These did, at first;) till a voyce, place Them also in Heaven; Crying, <hi>Come up Hither.</hi> And Then, shall be, such a spiritual Earthquake, As at first a Temporal: that made the Rivers break out; and the Hills rise up, or Valleys sink down: of which we read in the 104 <hi>Psalm,</hi> and other Scriptures.</p>
            <p>We cannot wonder that <hi>Daniels</hi> 3 <hi>Times and an Half,</hi> should bid us look to That, or Those, set in Heaven, to make Times and Seasons, or <hi>Moeds</hi> also. And in <hi>Hours;</hi> That Number may Expresse the Duration of an <hi>Eclipse.</hi> As in the Gospels, we read of <hi>Darknesse, from the sixth Hour to the ninth:</hi> and Then it passed off, by Degrees, with divers Cries; of which again.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Dayes</hi> (besides the three First, before the Sun) it may be, the Proper Time of the Moons Hiding, under the Beams of the Sun; as Hours might be, under his Body: and so long, the <hi>Sun</hi> may be Hidden by <hi>Eclipse:</hi> Or the Moon, rather. And three <hi>Weeks,</hi> and an Half, make up the Time of Distance or Absence of Moon from the <hi>Suns Rayes.</hi> Or her Liberty, till she come under Them again: and so draw nigh to a Change. And it may be added, that Three Weeks and an half, bring us quite through 24 dayes, (as the 24 hours of each day:) to the very morning of the 25th: which may
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:51941:127"/>
be considerable, for other things, besides the square root of 666.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Years;</hi> Our <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh of causing the <hi>Daily Sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>Minha, to Cease in the midst of a Week.</hi> Which is generally taken, for three <hi>years and an half,</hi> (that is, half a week of years,) in which onr Saviour preached publiquely: and Then, by his Own Great offering of Himself, <hi>Once made,</hi> put an End, in <hi>right,</hi> to All other Sacrifice, and Offerings. <hi>Though</hi> they were in <hi>Fact,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, till the Temple was also beaten down; about 40 years, after our Saviours Death. And That very War Endured, just Three Years and an Half.</p>
            <p>But <hi>three Moeds, and an Half,</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> may speak <hi>Months,</hi> as well as <hi>Hours,</hi> or <hi>Dayes,</hi> or <hi>Weeks,</hi> or <hi>Yeares.</hi> Though in All, and Each of them, there may be some Correspondence; as we touched before. And when the <hi>Lights,</hi> (an Hebrew word from <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) were made at sirst; they were, for <hi>Dayes,</hi> and <hi>Years,</hi> and <hi>Moeds;</hi> which are therefore <hi>properly,</hi> Neither <hi>Dayes,</hi> nor <hi>Years;</hi> but distinct from Both. And as <hi>Dayes,</hi> and <hi>Years,</hi> in Scripture, are generally ascribed to the <hi>Sun;</hi> So are <hi>Moeds</hi> to the <hi>Moon.</hi> As, <hi>he appointed the Moon for Moeds,</hi> and <hi>the Sun knoweth his Bowing,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: <hi>or his going Down:</hi> in that Great Comment, on the whole Creation, (if rightly translated,) which we Cited but now; the 104. Psalm. And the very next verse hath <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>How also, Mans Seasons, or <hi>Moeds,</hi> are made by the <hi>Moon,</hi> in Him, (as in Heaven;) we may see, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the third and twelfth Chapters of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> with other places of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>David:</hi> speaking of his Months, and Hidden Times, or <hi>Allamim,</hi> or <hi>Allamuth;</hi> (As <hi>Paul</hi> also speaketh of our <hi>Life Hidden with Christ in God:)</hi> of which we read, in Other places, besides many verses of the 89 Psalm, as in Hebrew.</p>
            <p>And if we should render the Hebrew <hi>Moad,</hi> or <hi>Mognadh</hi> by <hi>Monach,</hi> (as in <hi>Almonack,)</hi> we might easily shew,

            <p>And if we consider, Three <hi>Months,</hi> in Generall; They are to the <hi>Year,</hi> as Three <hi>Hours</hi> to the <hi>Day,</hi> or <hi>Night:</hi> a <hi>Watch,</hi> or <hi>Season,</hi> as we call it, of <hi>Winter, Summer, Spring,</hi> or <hi>Autumn.</hi> Which are All it seems, Some how, in every Day also. As the very words of God, to <hi>Noah,</hi> may seem to intimate; saying, not only, that there should be, <hi>Such Seasons and Changes, VVhile the Earth endures;</hi> but also, that <hi>All Dayes of the Earth,</hi> should be, <hi>Those Seasons,</hi> or <hi>such Seasons.</hi> As the words in Hebrew, may be read: and we find it so, by daily Experience: that every Day, hath its Seasons, and its quarters, As the year also. And the Half Month, added to the Three, brings us through the second sabbath of Weeks, or 14 Weeks: As before, we found <hi>Abrahams</hi> Tenents, and Others, in <hi>Sodom,</hi> freed from the four Monarchs, or Monarchies, in the 14 year. And our <hi>Teeth,</hi> in Each <hi>Jaw,</hi> are 3 times 4, with 2. Watchers.</p>
            <p>But yet more especially; These <hi>Three Months, and an half,</hi> bring us from the <hi>Pentecost,</hi> and Sack of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> (That Great <hi>New Moon,</hi> or <hi>Change,</hi> beginning the Month, following <hi>That Feast,</hi> of Pentecost, as we hinted before;) to the very Time of that Last, and Great Feast, of <hi>Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> At the fifteenth Day of the Seventh Month: and so just 3 <hi>Months and an half,</hi> after the month of <hi>Pentecost;</hi> which was followed, by such a visible Change, of their <hi>Moon,</hi> or <hi>Olam;</hi> when the <hi>Romans</hi> fired their City: and so made That Full Moon. And That also, much about the middle of <hi>September;</hi> answering so much to their Seventh Month, and Feast of Tabernacles. At which Time also, their Release and <hi>Liberty,</hi> must begin again; as There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about it Ended.</p>
            <p>And that their Coming in, again; with the <hi>Fulness of the Gentiles also</hi> (promised to <hi>Ephraim</hi> as we saw before:) was to answer that <hi>Full Moon</hi> of the <hi>Full Month</hi> (that is the <hi>Seventh;)</hi> and Great Feast of all, the Feast of <hi>Tabernacles;</hi>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:51941:128"/>
Or <hi>In gathering All the Fruits of the Earth;</hi> may be cleer, not only from the very Reason, and Nature, of That Feast and Season; but also from many places of Scripture which do so compare them together.</p>
            <p>As the 102 Psalm (made as a Form of Prayer, <hi>for Him that is Afflicted, with his soul overwhelmed, and pouring out his sighing</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

And <hi>Psal.</hi> 75. <hi>I will judg Equities, when I receive</hi> (or come to) <hi>the Moed.</hi> The very same word, used here in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and in many Scriptures, for that Great solemnity of <hi>Tabernacles;</hi> which of all the Three <hi>Moads,</hi> was the <hi>Moad</hi> of <hi>Moads,</hi> Or the most solemn and Greatest of All. And then presently the Psalm addeth, <hi>So, or Then, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then shall also fear thy Name, and All Kings of the earth, thy Glory</hi> (as before in the 72 and divers other Psalms.) <hi>When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his Glory.

            <p>That which followeth, of <hi>shortning his Dayes,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

            <p>So the 126 Psalm, <hi>In the Lords Turning the Captivity of Zion, we are, or were, like Dreamers: Turn again our Captivity O Lord, as the streams in the South:</hi> (we touched it before:) <hi>They that sow in Tears, shall reap in Joy; He that</hi>

               <hi>went Weeping, and bearing precious Seed, shall come with singing, bringing his sheaves.</hi> Which is plainly of <hi>Harvest,</hi> and <hi>the Joy of Harvest:</hi> which we find also, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Esay,</hi> coupled with <hi>breaking his yoke, and staffe of his shoulder, and Rod of his Oppressor, As in the day of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian:</hi> so famous for the <hi>Barley Cake of Gideon,</hi> (as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to the <hi>First Fruits)</hi> and the <hi>Lamps in Earthen Pitchers:</hi> of which also Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> And it ended at <hi>Succoth,</hi> (or <hi>Tabernacles:) which were Taught, by Gideon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet Plainer, in <hi>Hoseah, There is an Harvest set for thee, O Judah, when I bring back the Captivity of my People.</hi> And again, <hi>I the Lord thy God from Egypt, will yet make thee to dwell in Tabernacles; As in the Solemn Feast, or Moed:</hi> of which also before, <hi>What will you do, in the Solemn Day of Moed?</hi> Or That Solemn Feast, which is also <hi>the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Day, or Solemn Feast,</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16, 15. 31. 10. <hi>Ps.</hi> 81. 3. <hi>Lament.</hi> 2. 7. with divers other places. And in <hi>Zephany, I will gather them that Moan,</hi> (it is Heb) <hi>The Solemn Moed: And at That Time, I will get them Fame and Praise, in Every Land, where they have been shamed; and at That Time, I will bring and gather you, and I will make you a Name and a Praise, among all people of the Earth, when I turn back your Captivity, before your Eyen saith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Last of <hi>Zechary,</hi> telleth us, that <hi>All nations that fought against Jerusalem, shall go up to worship the King, the Lord of Hosts, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.</hi> And again, <hi>the punishment of Egypt, and All Nations that come not up, to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.

Let my Prayer come like Ketu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; and the lifting up of my Hands, As the Evening Minha.</hi> And the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> cryed till <hi>Minha:</hi> Then, and not till Then, God shewed himself by the Prophet <hi>Elijah.</hi> Who was Then, As the Evening Star; Though in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> compared to the <hi>Morning Star,</hi> scattering the dark Clouds, and Nightbirds of <hi>Jesabels</hi> time; as we saw before, in the Fourth Church.</p>
            <p>And Then, <hi>Elijah</hi> Treadeth <hi>Carmel,</hi> (or <hi>Cramel) the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of God:</hi> (which from <hi>Esay</hi> 63, and other places, may lead us to That in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> Running out 1600 Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs; As before:) and putting his Face between his Knees, which we may come to understand; After seven Returns of his Servant, A little Cloud ariseth, Bigg enough to bring up another Flood: to End That Generation perhaps, As in <hi>Noahs</hi> Time.

To be compared with That in the <hi>Revel:</hi> and with <hi>Daniels Moed, Moads,</hi> and Half.</p>
            <p>Generally (through all the Scriptures) As the <hi>Morning</hi> hath its name from <hi>Seeking,</hi>

               </gap>; So the <hi>Evening,</hi> is the Time of <hi>Finding:</hi> And of <hi>Sweetning</hi> (as its name imports in Hebrew:) or Composing thoughts and <hi>Wrath,</hi> which in <hi>Heb</hi> is <hi>Passing;</hi> as at <hi>Evening.</hi> For, <hi>the Sun must not go down</hi> upon it: nor any Token of <hi>Curss Hang up,</hi> any longer than the Evening. So that God himself, and the Angels, did generally appear, in the <hi>Cool of the Day,</hi> or <hi>Evening-Tide;</hi> the <hi>Evening Sacrifice:</hi> The <hi>Time of Prayer,</hi> in the <hi>Acts;</hi> but the Time of the <hi>Angel</hi> to <hi>Cornelius, Daniel,</hi> with others.</p>
            <p>And it may be, That <hi>Evening season,</hi> may be called <hi>Moed</hi> also.

why was the Angels Sword still Naked? till a Command to sheath it upon <hi>Davids</hi> Sacrifice, at <hi>Moed;</hi> or the <hi>Evening Minha?</hi> the <hi>Dayes Moed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So in Gods proclaiming his <hi>Moads:</hi> with <hi>Sabbath,</hi> (which yet is often distinguished from the <hi>Moads:)</hi> comes the Daily <hi>Tamid</hi> and <hi>Minha.</hi> Like the Two Witnesses in the Temple; As the two Altars also; Like That at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and That also, below <hi>Jordan</hi> (as in the lowest Court, by the Molten Sea;) which is also called <hi>Ed,</hi> a <hi>Witness.</hi> As our Eyes in our Head, and the Eyes of Heaven also; the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> of which we must speak again.</p>
            <p>The first Command I have yet observed, for any such <hi>Ceremonial;</hi> was for their <hi>Evening Lights,</hi> or <hi>Incense:</hi> As Time also began with Evening before Morning. And so English also reckon by <hi>Nights</hi> (as the Jewes) rather than <hi>Mornings:</hi> a <hi>Sevennight,</hi> and a <hi>Fortnight.</hi> There is scarce any other thing commanded, but onely spoken: <hi>And the Lord said to Moses, Say This,</hi> and <hi>Say That.</hi> But for the <hi>Evening Lights,</hi> or <hi>Incense,</hi> or <hi>Minha,</hi> They are commanded. And So also, for giving Cities to the <hi>Levites:</hi> and Putting out Men (and Women also) that were Unclean, by the <hi>Dead, Issues,</hi> and <hi>Leprosie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such a <hi>Command</hi> or <hi>Appointment,</hi> in <hi>Hebr</hi> is called <hi>Moed;</hi> for <hi>Place,</hi> or <hi>Time,</hi> or <hi>Meeting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Grave,</hi> is called <hi>Beth Moed.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> complains, as if God were cruel, in not hearing Cryes, or Cryers, from <hi>Sheol,</hi> or <hi>Moed,</hi> to <hi>All Living.</hi> As our Saviour also: <hi>For, to Him They All Live, though they be Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> almost ever, called, <hi>The Hall of Moed.</hi> Most of all, for that Great <hi>Moed,</hi> of All the <hi>Moeds:</hi> which were Three in the Year.

And God sball also <hi>perswade Japhet to dwell in Those Tabernacles of Sem:</hi> that is, the Name of God himself: as Represent ing Him, in whom, God placed his Name for ever.

            <p>And the very <hi>Cities</hi> of <hi>Refuge,</hi> are called <hi>Meuds</hi> also: as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so often solemnly <hi>Appointed;</hi> by God, by <hi>Moses,</hi> by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suah.</hi> For the three <hi>Moads and Chatsa:</hi> On That side of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and on This.

            <p>As also, That all the six, were out of the 48 Cities, given to the <hi>Levites.</hi> As they had 48 Courses, in the Temple, 24 of <hi>Porters,</hi> and 24 of <hi>Singers.</hi> As the Standers also, had 24 Courses; and for <hi>Jerusalem</hi> 24000 (they say) as for <hi>Jericho</hi> 12000.

            <p>And being the 24 and last hour of that great Day, he began another of 24 more, and setled all the 24 Courses we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, in the Temple, But of All his Times, and Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Hour-glasse, <hi>Nods and Neods</hi> also; that is <hi>Wandrings and Bottles of water,</hi> in <hi>Characters,</hi> as God shall give to the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his people, so much wished and valued.</p>
            <p>In the mean time we may remember what a Rest, and turn, and change, we found every 7, hour in the Sun, and Moons dayly motion, from the Evening <hi>Horizon,</hi> to the <hi>Nadir,</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, <hi>Zenith,</hi> setting again. And as every 7 hour maketh such change in the day &amp; night, so doth every 7th day to the Moon, (the great <hi>Hebrew</hi> Moneh, that is <hi>Reckoner</hi> of Time;) and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very 7 Month, to the <hi>Earth</hi> under the <hi>Poles,</hi> or places, that are most remote from the Sun: who is hidden 6 moneths from them, but returneth in the 7, and abideth 6 others with them, and departeth again for 6 more: and so goeth and cometh year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as infinite wisedome hath appointed.</p>
            <p>And though there be a visible Change in the Moon, every 7 dayes, which we call <hi>Quarters;</hi> yet it is more signall in 14. made of 3 times 4 and an half, as we see in Full Moones, the <hi>Moeds of Passover and Tabernacles</hi> (that I speak not of <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost,)</hi> as an Emblem of that great <hi>Change,</hi> on the world, when having served the 4 <hi>Monarchies, Twelve great years,</hi> (as the 12 hours of Dark Night,) they shall be freed, and lightned again, in the 14. as we find in the 14 of <hi>Genesis.</hi> But by <hi>Abrahams</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his <hi>Enochs</hi> by Night, As the Watches, and as <hi>Jacob</hi> also par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted His Troops: And <hi>David</hi> His, to recover his Wives, and other Captives, after 3 dayes and a Night: <hi>and the two Spies of Jericho returned after</hi> 3 <hi>dayes and a Night.</hi> And the <hi>Witnesses</hi>

in the <hi>Revelation, and of Heaven, were not there, till Three dayes and a night,</hi> or on the <hi>4th. day, from the Creation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as 14 dayes make such a change in the <hi>Moon;</hi> so to the Earth also under the <hi>Poles,</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi> goeth and cometh in 14 Dayes, or half a Moneth, as the Sun in half a year: So that 2 Dayes in that Motion, are as a <hi>Month.</hi> The Moon moving 12 of her own <hi>Diameters,</hi> to the Suns moving One of his (as we touched before, in parting the <hi>Day and night into twelve hours apeece)</hi> And as we find 666 hours in the Monthly Courses of the Moon, so the word, for 2 Dayes in <hi>Hebrew,</hi>

            <p>And such darknings or lightnings of the <hi>Moons</hi> face, by the Sun, or the Earths by the <hi>Moon,</hi> in 14 dayes, may shadow out somewhat of the 14 years, we spake of but now; which might also be carryed much farther. For <hi>Jacob</hi> served 14 years for his 2 wives; the other 6 for Cattle. And <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was freed from the <hi>Assyrian,</hi> trodden down in the <hi>Holy Mountain,</hi> (as we read in the 14. of <hi>Esay,) in the</hi> 14 <hi>year of Hezekiah.</hi> who <hi>also broke the Serpent;</hi> and called it <hi>Nehustan,</hi> as a Type of Him that was to <hi>break the Serpents Head;</hi> to which <hi>Esay</hi> may allude in severall places, speaking of the <hi>Serpent;</hi> and the Child da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to grasp the Serpent; and to play upon his Hole or Den.

            <p>And <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had his great Vision of the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> in the 14 year, after the old City was smitten; and upon the 10th. day of the first Moneth, when the <hi>Paschall Lamb or Goat, was to be set apart,</hi> 3 dayes and an half before his Offering at the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, on the 14 day, at Evening.</p>

            <p>And so the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> 14, and 24 (as 24 of <hi>Matthew,)</hi> After all the Powers of Earth shaken, and the Kings of the Earth, upon the Earth; who yet shall be visited, even in the Pit also; as <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was in <hi>Babylon,</hi> Blinde; <hi>Until I visit him,</hi> saith the Lord, in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 32. with 27 and 29.

            </p>
            <p>And so, here also, in <hi>Esay,</hi> They shall be shut up, in <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> in <hi>the Pit;</hi> but after many dayes, <hi>they shall be visited,</hi> and <hi>Then the Moon shall be confounded, and the Sun ashamed, when the Lord of Hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, and before his Ancients, Glorioufly.</hi> As those glorious songs, in the two next Chapters: and the 27th, is of the <hi>Binding of Satan, (Leviathan,</hi> the <hi>Dragon,</hi> or the <hi>Crossing Serpent.)</hi> As the Primitive Church did generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it.

            </p>
            <p>We might Track it up to <hi>Moses</hi> also: as most things in all the Prophets. <hi>Then will the Lord be jealous for his Land,</hi> (his Land!) <hi>and pity his People:</hi> which <hi>Joel</hi> hath, from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Song:</hi> That is Gods, given to <hi>Moses and Joshua</hi> (more solemnly perhaps, than the Law it self) in the <hi>Tab.</hi> He will be <hi>jealous</hi> for them, and moove them to <hi>jealousie:</hi> and Then, <hi>he will be merciful to His Land;</hi> his Land!

            <p>And lest This, might seem less Durable, because from the flitting Tab: we may finde it also, among the secret Councels of God, hinted to <hi>Moses,</hi> at his private retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in one of his Three 40 dayes (as he lived Three 40 years) on Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> Though now placed in <hi>Leviticus</hi> 26. which may be the sum of the Law, and the Gospel also.

            <p>The Morning after was fixed, for Heaving up the <hi>Barley-sheaf:</hi> as Emblem of their Rising out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and our Lords <hi>Lifting up,</hi> on the Cross, and <hi>Rising</hi> also, from the Grave, on the 3d Morning, after his Death; as the

            <p>In <hi>Hesekiahs</hi> time, they began to clense the Temple (polluted by <hi>Ahaz;)</hi> on the first Day of the first Month; but they passed not the <hi>Porch,</hi> till the 8th Day; nor the House, till the 16th Day (the Time of this Barley-sheaf:) which was one of the Reasons why they could not keep the <hi>Passover,</hi> on the 14th of the First Month; as command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on pain of Cutting Off. But <hi>Hesekiah</hi> rose early, and called the Rulers of the Citie, and All, laid their hands on 7 Goats, for a <hi>Chate;</hi> and the Priests killed them, and with their Blood, made atonement, on the Altar, for All <hi>Israel,</hi> as the King commanded. And the King, and his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all the Congregation, made an Act of Parliament, for the <hi>Passover,</hi> on the 14th of the 2d Month; and then <hi>Hesekiah</hi> prayed, <hi>The good Lord Pardon,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>though not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Purity of the Sanctuary:</hi> or Lawes thereof: And the Lord hearkened to <hi>Hesekiah,</hi> and Healed the people. And the King spake comfortably to the Levites; and they kept the first 7 Dayes (as in the first Month;) and the whole Assembly took Counsel to keep other 7 Dayes; and they did so, with great gladness; as the like was not since <hi>Solomons</hi> 14 Dayes also. And the Priests, the Levites, rose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and the Praier came up, to his Holy Habitation, unto Heaven.</p>
            <p>Pentecost, the 50th Day, from the Sheaf of the 16th, as in <hi>Levitieus;</hi> But in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> from the <hi>Sickle;</hi> which was the Day before: and that, so strictly maintained, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Zadduces,</hi> as the Jewes may teach us; that from Thence, They cryed Thrice, <hi>On this Sabbath, Sabbath, Sabbath</hi> (or the morrow after the <hi>Passover</hi> slain, the 14th Evening:) <hi>with this Sickle, sickle, sickle;</hi> as we saw before; as a beginning to the 50 Dayes of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> Deut. 16. 9. <hi>When thou put test in, the Sickle.</hi>

            <p>In 50 full Dayes, there are 1200 Hours: to be compared with 12000 of a Tribe, The <hi>First-fruits to God and the Lamb,</hi> in the Revelation. And <hi>Moadim</hi> are just 1200: if <hi>Moed</hi> be 120 (as we saw before) and <hi>Moadim</hi> be 10 <hi>Moads,</hi> as it may be: For, the Hebrew <hi>Duall,</hi> is for Two; and their
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:51941:163"/>
Plural for 3 at least; as we saw in <hi>Elohim:</hi> and Plural numbers are generally 10 fold, to their Singulars; as we saw, 10, a Congregation: As the least plural Regimen, is made with <hi>Jod,</hi> that is 10, and <hi>Im</hi> may be 50, or 610: and through all the Bible, we see numberings by 10, and by 50; and the least Captain, of 10: As also the English yet observe in their old good <hi>Tithings,</hi> and <hi>Tithing</hi> men, with Headboroughs, and Constables of <hi>Hundreds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 7 Weeks, were but 49 Daies, as a foundation for <hi>Daniels</hi> 7 Weeks, of 490 Years: of which again. And though the <hi>Pentecost</hi> were the 50th, yet the <hi>Biccurim,</hi> or first Fruits of the Spirit <hi>(Acts</hi> 2d) came on the 3d Hour, of that 50th Day. So that we may begin the 50 Daies, or 1200 Hours, before the <hi>Barley sheaf.</hi> And sure, it must be 12 Hours at least, before that <hi>Morning;</hi> else we shall disturb the course of Nature; which began Time (as God doth All) with the Worst first; as <hi>Evening</hi> before <hi>Morning:</hi> and probably with <hi>Winter,</hi> before <hi>Summer:</hi> That is Sowing time, before <hi>Harvest;</hi> whose last end, ended the whole Year, and began another.</p>
            <p>If 1200 be added to 333, the <hi>Minha Passover,</hi> or to 335 or 6, the last Hour of the 14th Day; it makes 1533, or 1535, the number of <hi>Wrath and Fury,</hi> to be <hi>Passed over,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. 16: <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Othniel</hi> (with <hi>Achsa,</hi> Both akin to <hi>Caleb,)</hi> is to shew both the Time and Wonders of God, as the name may hint.

And then <hi>Eglon,</hi> the <hi>Calf</hi> of <hi>Moab</hi> (an Heifer of three Years old, <hi>Esay</hi> 15. 5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 48. 34. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 9.) cometh up, to minde them of their Golden <hi>Calf;</hi> while <hi>Moses</hi> was in the Mount, as many <hi>Daies</hi> from the Law, as now perhaps he had been <hi>Years</hi> in Heaven.

               <hi>Othniels</hi> 40, <hi>Ehud</hi> and <hi>Shamgars</hi> 80, make up 120 Years: the Great <hi>Moed</hi> for Man, as we saw before.

            <p>
               <hi>Barak and Deborahs</hi> 40, made them Rest, till about the end of the 10th Day. And Then, the Lamb is prepared, for the <hi>Passover:</hi> As being Then tyed up, by <hi>Midian,</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing them.</p>
            <p>And now, comes out <hi>Gideons Fleece,</hi> as alluding to That <hi>Lamb;</hi> and his <hi>Lamps</hi> also, in <hi>Earthen</hi> Pitchers (as St <hi>Paul</hi> remembers;) and the <hi>Barley Cake,</hi> rouling in a Dream; at the Middle Watch; or soon after Midnight.

            <p>There is more to be spoken of the Times of <hi>Sibboleth,</hi> and <hi>Shibboleth;</hi> and of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> or King Father; and of <hi>Sechem</hi> and <hi>Dinah,</hi> Judgement: and <hi>Jotham,</hi> the <hi>Orphan: If indeed you dealt kindely with my Father; for, he did deliver you;</hi> Then, &amp;c.

            <p>But the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> said, unto the Lord, (as <hi>Job</hi> saith, it is still meet to say, <hi>I have sinned,</hi> I will bear the Rod (till he turn, and have pity on me: For, He will will Turn again, and have pity on us: and <hi>Who is a God, as Thou art!</hi> that is, <hi>Micha!)

               <hi>And they put away the strange gods,</hi> from in, and <hi>among them;</hi> and <hi>served the Lord; And his soul was grieved, sor the Misery of Israel.</hi> It <hi>shortned</hi> his very <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Breath;</hi> as in us, when we would sigh, and cannot; O! how is our

            <p>Then <hi>Ammon</hi> encamped in <hi>Gilead</hi> (thestones of <hi>Witness)</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> at <hi>Mispa,</hi> the <hi>Watch;</hi> (they prayed, and also <hi>set the Watch:)</hi> and we shall come to <hi>Mahanaim.</hi> For, we are already at the times when <hi>Jacob</hi> said, The <hi>Lord Help me, and watch over me:</hi> and <hi>Laban</hi> also, <hi>God is my Witness,</hi> and <hi>These also:</hi> (for, there be Witnesses in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and They are All One; as on Earth, they agree in One:) And to what?

            <p>Now <hi>Jephta was a Mighty Valiant man, but the son of a common woman:</hi> which they call an <hi>Harlot</hi> (though the greatest <hi>Norman</hi> Princes came from <hi>Arlott;</hi> the Mother to That English word:) And <hi>Boaz</hi> also, that mighty man (of whom before in <hi>Ruth;</hi> the Jewes count him <hi>Ibsan</hi> the Judge:) was son to <hi>Rahab,</hi> the Harlot; as she is called: but the mother of Christ, in <hi>David,</hi> so, that it is almost impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible there should be 580 Years, from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to <hi>Solomon,</hi> or <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple: As that great man will have it, from <hi>Acts</hi> 13, with other Arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And God perswaded Japhet</hi> (or his <hi>Anagram,</hi> and Names<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake <hi>Jephta,)</hi> to dwell in the <hi>Tabernacles of Sem;</hi> and to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large</hi> them also (as the word hinteth) by freeing them from <hi>Lot</hi> (as <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 14) And he will also take away <hi>the Lot, from all Faces,</hi> As we found him speaking in <hi>Esay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jephta's</hi> 6 years (as 6 Hours of the 14th Day) bring us so near the <hi>Moed of Passover,</hi> that it seemeth possible, his very Daughter (How like <hi>Agamemnons,</hi> in the Poets?) may represent the Lamb (or young Kid) to be offered, in the 4th Day, from Hour 312, to 333.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Jephta,</hi> came so near That number of Hours, or Years from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that he sent <hi>Ammon</hi> word, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There is certainly some great matter in that of <hi>Jephta's Daughter.</hi> If she were <hi>Devoted, Cherem</hi> (as <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 28, 29.) she must Die: and could not be Redeemed.

            </p>
            <p>That Law, is very Terrible; if it intimate the <hi>Cursed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates:</hi> as it may do.

that we may believe those gracious words of Christ in <hi>Esay</hi> 56: making Them also <hi>Priests and Levites;</hi> as the word <hi>Leviim,</hi> or <hi>Lovim</hi> from <hi>Loveh</hi> (whence the English <hi>Love</hi> also) may plainly intimate. And in the Gospel also, he citeth the <hi>Prophets</hi> saying, <hi>My House shall be called, an House of Prayer; even to All Nations, and Gentiles.</hi> And for all the Threatnings of <hi>Cutting off,</hi> the Jewes will tell us, Few were ever so Cut off, by Heaven, and (and why Then from Heaven?) If they came in, and submitted to <hi>Stripes;</hi> which they say, prevented <hi>Cutting off,</hi> or <hi>Death by the Hand of Heaven;</hi> as they used to speak: Adding also a Third step, they called the <hi>Rebhels stroak:</hi> to which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> may seem to allude by <hi>Gifts for Rebbels also.</hi> And in another place, he saith, <hi>Let the Righteous scourge me:</hi> &amp;c. Even when he had deserved <hi>Cutting off.</hi> Or else, they might come in, with <hi>Burnt-Offerings:</hi> which they tell us, confessed (as the Bringer did <hi>over its Head,)</hi> that they had deserved, to be quite consumed, as That which they call <hi>Ole,</hi> or <hi>Whole</hi> (as English also:) to be considered with <hi>Olam,</hi> their <hi>Ole,</hi> or <hi>Whole</hi> also, as we touched before. And indeed, the very Face of the <hi>Moon</hi> it self, at the <hi>Full,</hi> may put us in minde of their <hi>Ole,</hi> or <hi>whole Burnt-Offering,</hi> set on fire, and flaming unto God.

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:51941:168"/>
Children, as some call them: who were yet delivered from That fiery Furnace, by One, (in the Kings eyes also, as <hi>Caiephas Prophecying;)</hi> like the <hi>Son of God.</hi> The <hi>Ram caught in the Thicket:</hi> which was offered up for <hi>Isaac.</hi> Yea, and for <hi>Ishmael</hi> also, it seems, by that gracious speech of God in <hi>Esay</hi> 62, <hi>They shall come up, with Acceptance, on my Holy Altar:</hi> And they flock, <hi>as Doves to the Windows.</hi> Which were yet Goats of <hi>Seir,</hi> and Rams of <hi>Ishmaels Kedar,</hi> and <hi>Nehaioth:</hi> as we saw before.</p>
            <p>Nay, the Case might be so secret, or so desperate, that they durst not bring any Offering at all. And <hi>David</hi> rightly observed, that God required No Burnt-Offering; and yet (though he had <hi>despised the Law,</hi> as is charged;) yet he found a way to be Accepted. So might others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that they might Hear, and learn to do, <hi>No more Presumptuously.</hi> As God graciously speaketh; Hinting, that <hi>Israel</hi> also, could do Once, or Sometimes, <hi>Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuously.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, when their <hi>Burnt-Offerings</hi> also, might not be <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted</hi> (as they tell of some, that wilfully brake the sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Day; or did Apostatize from their Religion; in which cases they speak, as if the Priest might not accept their <hi>Burnt-Offerings:)</hi> Yet, when things were most forlorne and desperate; There was a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> by God (as some inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret That <hi>Chate,</hi> for <hi>Kain,</hi> a <hi>Sin-Offering)</hi> brought, and laid at his <hi>very door.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For (besides That, wch we cited but now, <hi>for every one that erreth or is simple:)</hi> They had All a share, in the <hi>Daily Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or Tamid, with the Meat, and Drink-Offerings thereof:</hi> which were, as <hi>Peace-Offerings also.</hi> And there were Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique <hi>Peace-Offerings,</hi> for the whole Congregation; to be yearly offered. And in Publique Charge, They All had part; in <hi>Lambs,</hi> and <hi>Wood,</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>Oyl,</hi> or other things; yearly bought by the Holy <hi>Tribute-Money;</hi> Paid by every One, both Rich and Poor, <hi>for the Redemption of his soul also:</hi> As God himself expresseth it.</p>
            <p>And they had their commune <hi>Representatives,</hi> or <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> (men of the <hi>Station,</hi> as we touched before:) in which All persons were represented; as if All had been <hi>Present.</hi>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:51941:168"/>
And the Jewes say, There were 24000 of these <hi>Standers,</hi> for <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and 12000 for <hi>Jericho.</hi> Poor Cursed <hi>Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho!</hi> Which yet grew up to be the next to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> As the <hi>Moon</hi> (to the <hi>Sun,</hi> in Heaven:) As the Name may intimate.</p>
            <p>This great Burnt-Offering also, in the daily <hi>Tamid,</hi> had This great advantage over all others; That where, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or particular Cases, they often stayed long, in Guilt, or Fear, and Sorrow, till they could present their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; (which they seldom did, but at the 3 solemn <hi>Moeds)</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> This was every day, and Twice aday; so fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and constant, that Wherever, or However, they were Absent from God; Yet, He was still providing, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting, Their Sacrifice (in which They All had share of Charge, and Profit; as we saw before in that of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and divers other Scriptures:) Yea, an whole Burnt-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by God himself, in <hi>all things Ordered and sure.</hi> As <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> speaketh of his <hi>Holy things, and sure Mercies,</hi> in which, <hi>All Thirsters,</hi> do pertake (as we saw before:) As sure, as if They were All actually present, in Person, Laying on their own Hands; or confessing, their own secret sins, over its Head. As the men of the <hi>Station,</hi> many a time, for Those that were Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, Playing, or doing worse perhaps, at a great distance.</p>
            <p>And besides the <hi>Ole</hi> Burnt-Offering, there was Daily <hi>Minha,</hi> with <hi>Incense,</hi> for Strangers also: Or <hi>Aliens to Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> Being as old as <hi>Abels</hi> Offering, and renued by <hi>Noah;</hi> as a Seal to the great Covenant with all Mankinde: As we saw before, when the Lord smelt, that sweet favour of Rest, and said in his Heart (his Heart!) I will not strike Any Flesh, as I have done: &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And because the sweet <hi>Odours</hi> of this Incense, was to go forth, to so many, that could not see it, (as the Spouse may allude in the <hi>Canticles:)</hi> Therefore, before its offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, just with the Evening <hi>Minha,</hi> the Priests gave a great Blow, on a Vast Bell (or <hi>Migrepha)</hi> that sounded so loud they say, that All <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or round about, might Hear, and know, Their Incence, and their Interest, was then presenting to the Lord. And Then, the Standers hasted
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:51941:169"/>
to their private Charges also; being Trusted often for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers particular Persons, in their own private cases. And although they all stood silent without, and Praying, it seemed, while the Priest offered Incence; Yet Then, he came, with both Hands lifted up, and spread abroad, and his Fingers also, very wide they say, to represent the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Windows of the most Holy Place (though some deny it Light:) that so, the Blessing, might be more, and wider spread: on those without, abroad at distance. As we saw before, on That, <hi>The Lord bless thee, Out of Zion; and send thee Help, Out of his Holy Place.</hi> Out of it! although thou maiest not come into it: but at a great Distance; and it may be farther, than Those only kept out (in the Gentiles Court) by That Rayl, or Wall they called <hi>Chell,</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; as a Great Gulf, they might not Pass: as was seen before.</p>
            <p>I crave your Prayers, and Pardon, if in This, or ought, I go beyond my bounds, or purpose to express, when first I thought to glance on <hi>Jephta's</hi> Daughter, or Burnt-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Which before, we found so near the <hi>Minha</hi> of the <hi>Passover,</hi> that it might be akin, to a Type or Draught of that Great <hi>Sampler,</hi> which a Virgin, might haply shadow out, as well, or better than a Man.</p>
            <p>Was She than to shadow Him, or Her, (for, it was <hi>Israel</hi> also,) That God himself so solemnly <hi>devoted, to the Curss?</hi> as himself speaketh (even by that very word of <hi>Cherem,</hi> used in <hi>Leviticus</hi> 27. 28.) As we read in <hi>Esay,</hi> 42, and 43. And yet, <hi>Fear not O Jacob, for I have chosen thee; and I have Redeemed Thee:</hi> Though the Law be, that no <hi>Cherem</hi> (the very word there used,) may be <hi>Redeemed.</hi> But they are all <hi>Bahurim,</hi> &amp;c. As the words are, in the Hebrew of that 42. 22. As (from the 39th forward) cannot be too much considered.</p>
            <p>How Places, or Persons, forsaken, hated, abhorred, and Cursed; might be Blessed again; we saw before: from the Law, Psalms, and Prophets, in divers places. Shall I add That also; <hi>Cut off thy Hair O Jerusalem, and cast it away, Take up a Lamentation; For the Lord hath Abhorred and Rejected the Generation of his Wrath. Eth Dor Everatho.</hi> 1289.

just to <hi>Daniels</hi> 1290: to be compared with <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> I contended with them, and smote some of them; and <hi>Pluck'd off their Hair:</hi> a great Reproach. <hi>As Esay's Cheek,</hi> or Christs, to them that plucked off <hi>his Hair. And the Hired Rasor</hi> (for, they Hired <hi>Assyria,</hi> to come upon them; as the Prophets oft allude, to 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16.) to shave off, the <hi>Hair of their Heads, and the Hair of their Feet also:</hi> Yet a greater Reproach: As <hi>Ezekiels Hair, Chap.</hi> 5. But more yet to Women (as we may see in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 7.) who must have <hi>Power</hi> (or a <hi>Veil</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>over them:</hi> Even because of the <hi>Angels</hi> (of the Churches;) who judge their Reverence, by their Holy <hi>Meen;</hi> not Reaching to our Hearts (as God;) but by our Looks and Gestures. And their <hi>Hair,</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for a Covering, and Ornament; (though the <hi>Locusts</hi> also, had <hi>Hair, as Women:)</hi> and a Womans long Hair, is a Glory to Her; and <hi>if she will not be Covered,</hi> in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meetings, (where They sate apart, as yet, with the Jews; <hi>David alone, and his Wives alone; Nathan alone, and his Wives alone:) Let her be shaven.</hi> The great Reproach to that Sex. And so here, <hi>Cut off thy Hair,</hi> O <hi>Jerusalem!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But O! the Kindeness! and the Goodness! of the Heart of God! May not This Reproach also, give them an Hint, or Dore, of Hope and Comfort? And that, not onely, as <hi>Strip thee, and make thee Bare; and lay aside thine Ornaments, that I may yet know, what to do to Thee:</hi> But also, as the great Characters of <hi>Leprosie,</hi> were taken from the <hi>Hair,</hi> and colour of the <hi>Hair;</hi> So the means and Hope of Cure, were still by shaving off the Hair. <hi>The Priest shall shut him up,</hi> 7 <hi>Dayes</hi> (For, if her Father spit in her Face, shall she not Blush, 7 Daies?) And Then, if the Priest see any Hope, <hi>He shall be shaven;</hi> But yet not the <hi>skall. And Then,</hi> 7 <hi>Dayes more</hi> (As the Dove, in <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, which may measure us the Times, of the good waters in the Gospel also, and seasons thereof; as God shall please:) and Then, if it spread, he need not look for <hi>Hair;</hi> But if it spread not, and the Hair be Black, <hi>(as a Raven,</hi> in the <hi>Canticles; Anacreon,</hi> or other Greek Poets:) He is Healed. Yea, Though the Hair fall off; He is <hi>Bald,</hi> (or as <hi>Korah</hi> was) But, <hi>he is Clean.</hi> This in Skalls.</p>

               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:51941:170"/>
And the <hi>Leaper,</hi> to be cleansed, must shave off, All his Hair: and tarry 7 Daies, and then he must shave again, his Head, and Beard, and Eye-brows, and all his Hair; <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. 9. and Then, after Blood, and Oyl, upon his Ear, and Thumb, and Toe (in All the Three Regions of the Great little World:) He was cleansed, by the Priest. O, what work he had to do! for the Poorest man! that was Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean! and could not bring the offerings prescribed! And for every House, infected also; (Doth our God take care of <hi>Houses!</hi> and of <hi>Clay!</hi> that Cursed <hi>Adama!)</hi> The <hi>Hysop, Cedar-wood,</hi> and <hi>Scarlet</hi> (to the <hi>Hebrews;)</hi> and Two <hi>Birds,</hi> (in <hi>Heb.</hi> nere akin to <hi>Goats)</hi> One killed in <hi>Earth,</hi> over <hi>Water</hi> (as St <hi>Peter</hi> on <hi>Genesis,</hi> and <hi>Psalms,</hi> and 2d Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:) and the other, a Scape <hi>Bird,</hi> as the Scape Goat. And the Plants, and Trees, and Fishes, and Fowles, and Earth, and Water, and All, must Hear, and serve <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>Jezreel</hi> also: near, in Hebrew, to the <hi>Leaper</hi> (as the <hi>Seed) of God!</hi> There was also, an other shaving, for the <hi>Nazarite; when the Hair of his Separation is shaven;</hi> as we read in <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. immediately before the Solemn Blessing, prescribed. As if This, had some relation to the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi> or Separate person; after his coming in again: And the very word in <hi>Jeremy</hi> 7, 29, <hi>Nizrek,</hi> may allude to the Law of the <hi>Nazarite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet, there was more Hope, and Comfort, in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans shaving, than a Mans. For, if Her Lord, bid her shave off her Hair; it might be a sign, he meant to marry her. For, so the Law was: If thou lead Captivity Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, (as Christ hath done) and see a Woman, that thou lovest; <hi>She shall shave her Head, and pair her Nails:</hi> or <hi>Goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness,) Sipharnea.</hi> We saw it in <hi>Saphira:</hi> the <hi>Goat:</hi> as also <hi>Seir,</hi> is <hi>Hair,</hi> and a <hi>Goat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, the very Time, may be There Hinted perhaps (for, God is Infinite:) How long Christ must stay, for his poor Captive Spouse; before he may be Married to her: though she be prepared, and adorned (as <hi>Ester</hi> was,) in order for her going in, to the King. As the <hi>Lambs</hi> Bride in the <hi>Revelation)</hi> cometh down from Heaven: As if There All the Saints departed, were but <hi>perfuming</hi> and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:51941:170"/>
to be his Bride on Earth: and Reign on Earth: at the End of the <hi>Weeks.</hi> How Long?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou shalt bring her Home, to thine House</hi> (and the souls under the <hi>Altar cryed, How long Lord!) and she shall put off her Captive Weeds; and shall remain in thine House, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle her Father and her Mother</hi> (in their Enemies Land, they shall confess <hi>their Fathers sins:</hi> we saw it before:) A <hi>Full Month,</hi> or <hi>Moon</hi> of <hi>Dayes. And after That! Thou mayst be her Husband. And if afterwards she please thee not, Thou mayst leave her, to her own soul</hi> (which is the great thing, to be feared, of a Backsliding heart from Christ:) But <hi>thou mayst not sell her;</hi> because thou hast Humbled her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jacob</hi> also stayed with <hi>Laban,</hi> before he asked his Daughter, a full <hi>Month,</hi> or <hi>Moon</hi> of <hi>Dayes, Chodesh Jamim:</hi> but in the Law of <hi>Deut.</hi> it is <hi>Jerach Jamim.</hi> As also, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 13.</p>
            <p>May we not also compare That in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. <hi>Thy own wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness</hi> shall instruct thee; thy backslidings shall rebuke thee: See and know that it is an <hi>evil and a bitter thing that thou dost forsake the Lord</hi> (and yet more) <hi>Thy God!</hi> For, of old, I broke thy Yoke, and burst thy Bonds <hi>(Ezek.</hi> 16. and Epistle of <hi>Baruck:)</hi> I planted thee a Noble Vine; wholly, a Right seed!

               <hi>If a woman bear a son, she was Unclean</hi> 7 <hi>Dayes, as in her common separation</hi> [not observing which, cut off, and spued out, the very Heathens; <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. <hi>Esay</hi> 30. 22. <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 17.] and her son not Circumcised, till the 8th Day, and Then, she must remain 33 Daies [as the Moon 333 Hours:] and then she may eat the Holy things, and come into the Sanctuary, with two Turtles, or Pigeons [if she could not bring a Lamb:] which made them so dear, that the <hi>Sanedrin</hi> altered this Law [it seems:] and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour scourged the sellers of <hi>Doves</hi> also; which were brought by his Poor Blessed Mother.

            <p>We see how <hi>Idolatry,</hi> was followed with <hi>Adultery,</hi> (and Both from the same <hi>Bethlehem:)</hi> as in divers Scriptures.

him (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13;) and chosen <hi>David:</hi> who had also, 600 men with him; and parted also, as These 600, by 200 and 400, to recover <hi>Ziglag:</hi> and these 600, were kept up, for his Guard, we see; in his flying from <hi>Absalon.</hi> As also the <hi>Danites,</hi> that Sacked <hi>Laish,</hi> and set up Idolatry, were 600 men (as <hi>Shamgar</hi> slew 600 Philistines, with an Ox goad:) of which we may read in <hi>Hoseah;</hi> with other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. To be added to All before of 600, and 666.</p>
            <p>And as those things in the Wilderness, followed <hi>Israels</hi> Vow, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. So do These in <hi>Judges, Jephtae's</hi> Vow; and the peoples also, for putting away their strange gods. And as Serpents, seized on them There, so did <hi>Nahash,</hi> the <hi>Serpent,</hi> Here also: till he was swallowed up by <hi>Saul:</hi> as Death and Hell, must swallow up the Serpent also, in the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses</hi> was bid to make a <hi>Seraph;</hi> as the Serpents are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Seraphim;</hi> the word for <hi>Angels,</hi> in the 6th of <hi>Esay.</hi> But <hi>Moses</hi> made a <hi>Nahash of Nehust:</hi> a mighty Type of Christ, who only, can deliver us from the Serpent, as old as Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise; and the Dragon, and the Beast, and its Image also made by <hi>Aaron,</hi> or <hi>Micha,</hi> or <hi>Babel,</hi> or any other. And yet <hi>Hezekiah</hi> durst destroy That Brazen Serpent; and call it <hi>Nehustan,</hi> a little piece of Brass. So Dangerous, is a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, expedient, or requisite, Matter of Worship also, when it degenerates to Idolatry, or Superstition: As the sourest Vineger, from the quickest, Best, and sweetest Wine.</p>
            <p>There was a strange Fate (may we say?) that followed Those Serpents: which bit <hi>Jacobs</hi> Heel, so, that he Halted ever after: and their very next step was <hi>to Oboth, Pytho's</hi> or <hi>Pythons.</hi> As from the Serpent to the <hi>Devil.</hi> And so also, in <hi>Samuels</hi> time, They were bitten with the Serpent <hi>Nahash;</hi> and they murmur for <hi>Saul,</hi> which is <hi>Hell.

            <p>And then, comes One, of the sweetest places in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; <hi>Fear not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For, the Lord will not forsake his People, for his great Names sake; because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his People. Moreover, as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord! in ceasing to pray for you: but I will Teach you the good, and the Right way.

            </p>
            <p>There is yet much more, in That History of <hi>Nahash,</hi> of <hi>Ammon,</hi> of <hi>Lot,</hi> the Veyl, which must be separate, from the <hi>face of all people:</hi> As at first from <hi>Abraham</hi> (as we saw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from <hi>Esay,</hi> and divers places.) And now Here also, he would not onely cover their Eyes, but put them quite out: or at least their Right Eyes: and that also, must be, <hi>A Reproach for All Israel.</hi> Though This, was onely at <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besh-Gilead;</hi> the Reliques of that woful business at <hi>Gibeah:</hi> which did not onely cut off <hi>Benjamin,</hi> but <hi>Jabesh-Gilead</hi> also, by 12000 chosen men of <hi>Israel</hi> (as the <hi>first Fruits to God and the Lamb:)</hi> as we may see in <hi>Judges</hi> 21. Where also, both <hi>Gilead and Mispeh,</hi> lead us to the <hi>Watch,</hi> and Stones of <hi>Witness,</hi> we saw before, in <hi>Jacob</hi> their Father, and <hi>Laban:</hi> when <hi>Rachel</hi> was going to her long home, at <hi>Bethlehem Ephrata,</hi> with this <hi>Benjamin,</hi> the youngest of her sons: for whom she wept so much, and so long: because <hi>They were not. Joseph</hi> was not, and <hi>Ephraim</hi> was not, (see
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:51941:173"/>
1 Chron. 7. 21.) and now they Take <hi>Benjamin</hi> also: All these things are against her.</p>
            <p>And yet little <hi>Benjamin,</hi> that had so ruined <hi>Jabesh-Gile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad,</hi> must now save it, by <hi>Saul,</hi> the first King of that Tribe; coming up, because of <hi>Nahash,</hi> besieging <hi>Jabesh-Gilead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the men of <hi>Jabesh-Gilead</hi> said, <hi>Forbear us</hi> 7 <hi>Dayes; and if none can save us, we will come out to thee.</hi> Then came Messengers, to <hi>Gibeah of Saul;</hi> That very <hi>Gibeah,</hi> which had caused all the mischief, both to <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and <hi>Jabesh-Gilead</hi> also. Then the people wept; and <hi>Saul</hi> yearneth over their Tears: (so good it is, to go, or be, with a Mourning, weeping people of God: For, who can tell, but their tender Eyes, may affect, and soften, our hard Heart!) and Then, the <hi>Spirit of God came upon him;</hi> and remembring, that All the mischief came by hewing a woman into pieces: He now slayeth the Beast, and hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, into 12 pieces; and by Those, summons the 12 Tribes, as One man, with one consent, or as the Prophet speaks, with One <hi>Sechem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had now 300000 of <hi>Israel,</hi> and 30000 of <hi>Judah,</hi> (a bad Omen, that they should be so <hi>Divided:)</hi> and they must be Parted into 3 Bands, and by Night also; as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> his 300, and <hi>Gideon</hi> his 300, and <hi>Jacob</hi> his, at <hi>Mahana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,</hi> and <hi>Joshuah</hi> his, at <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> his, for <hi>Ziglag;</hi> and again, As <hi>Jacob</hi> at <hi>Mahanaim:</hi> and in the Morning Watch, as before, in the Red Sea, and <hi>Barak,</hi> or <hi>Gideon,</hi> against the Midnight <hi>Midianites;</hi> who though so near akin to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaak,</hi> and <hi>Moses;</hi> yet had been the Buyers of <hi>Joseph,</hi> in the Pit, and Sellers to <hi>Aegypt;</hi> so that <hi>Moses</hi> must not dye, before he had <hi>avenged God on Midian,</hi> and recovered such a spoyl, as possibly may help us to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber all the Times, and Numbers, in their Bondage ever after.</p>
            <p>Now is <hi>Nahash</hi> defeated, and his <hi>Ammonites</hi> scattered, so that two remained not together, while <hi>Israel</hi> was as One man: the onely way to destroy the <hi>Serpent,</hi> and to break his Head. And when also, They shall be, <hi>As a Beacon on an Hill,</hi> the Lord will Wait, that he may be Gracious to them; and Therefore be exalted! Therefore! That he
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:51941:174"/>
may have mercy on them; and on All that wait for him. For, the Lord is a God of judgement: Blessed are All They, that wait for him. As we read in the 30th of <hi>Esay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How <hi>Jabesh-Gilead</hi> remembred, and requited, This of <hi>Saul,</hi> even to his Dead body; we observed before: &amp; How <hi>David</hi> also blessed them for it, when he shewed the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God to the House of <hi>Saul, Dead Saul!</hi> And which is yet stranger; even to this very <hi>Nahash,</hi> or his Son, or Namesake, King of <hi>Ammon</hi> also: Till they so abused his Embassadors. An History that may be more considered.</p>
            <p>And the people said to <hi>Samuel, Who is he, that said, shall Saul Reign over us? Bring the men, that we may put them to death.</hi> But <hi>Saul</hi> said, <hi>There shall not a man, be put to death this day; for, to day, the Lord hath wrought salvation in Israel.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> also, in his sweet Return, after his Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his Kingdom; would not slay <hi>Cursing Shimei;</hi> because he knew, he was That day, <hi>King of Israel.</hi> As we saw before, with divers circumstances.</p>
            <p>Then said <hi>Samuel</hi> to the People, <hi>Come and let us go to Gilgal, and Renue the Kingdom, There:</hi> Even There; where God in <hi>Joshuah, Rouled away the shame of Israel.</hi> And now, They rouled away <hi>This shame</hi> also: of <hi>Nahash the Serpent;</hi> on All Israel. Though I add not here again, how Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision it self, was a Type, or Pledge, of their cutting off <hi>Nahash;</hi> or the Serpents Head, in every Age, and World, and Region also of the little World; as we saw before.</p>
            <p>How <hi>David,</hi> or any other of the Kings, cut off this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or <hi>Nahash</hi> also, (in that remarkable History, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.) we leave for another season: as God shall please. And though <hi>Solomon</hi> had but One War, as we saw before, with <hi>Hamath Zoba</hi> (the Wrath of an Army; or fighting Rage, or Fury:) Yet These also, as All within the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> became his Servants, or his Tributaries. Even to the River of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whence he married his Queen, as we saw before.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, I have little to add, to Those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Books lately written by English men also; of Both Temples; with That, of a very Learned man, before the

But I suppose Many, if not All the Numbers we have spoken of, may be in those Temples also; with the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and <hi>Noahs Ark;</hi> in proportion to a mans body, with its Three Regions also. 30 Cubits High, and 50 Broad, and 6 times as Long. 300 by 50, is 15000 (and the Waters prevailed 15 Cubits, Upwards:) and that by 30, is 450000, filled up with 8 Persons and Beasts, Unclean also; with their Food, and Ayre, and other requisites: of which again, as God shall help us.</p>
            <p>The Tabernacle, 30 long, and 10 broad; that is 300 (as the Ark;) and 10 high, 3000. And its Court, 100 long, and 50 broad, 5000. As we touched before, in the 5000, fed by our Saviour (as after by <hi>Peter)</hi> Ranked by 100 and 50.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, Double to the Tabernacle; 60 long, and 20 broad; but the Height (without,) generally Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Tabernacles; Equal to the <hi>Arks,</hi> 30 Cubits. So that its Length, was Double to its Height; and Treble to its Bredth. Yet the Most holy Place (though without, it seemed Equall, in height, to the other Temple,) was a perfect Cube, of 20 Cubits, every way. 400 by 20, 8000.</p>
            <p>The Holy, 20, 30, 40. That is, 600 by 40, Or 1200 by 20, just 24000: for its inward <hi>Area.</hi> But if the Walls, and Side-Chambers, were in This also, as afterwards; the length of the whole, may be just as the Court, of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle was, 100 Long, and 50 Broad.</p>
            <p>The second Temples height, 60, Double to the First; and its breadth 60, Treble to the first. But This, and <hi>Ezekiels</hi> (larger,) and <hi>Solomons</hi> also (as <hi>Josephus</hi> and others) on either side, had 12 Chambers in 3 Stories: All of them, were 5 Cubits high; and the lowest but 5 broad: but the Middle 6, and the Highest 7: the Inward Wall decreasing, in its Thickness Upwards, a Cubit in 5.</p>
            <p>And though <hi>Solomon</hi> made but Two Courts, and Both Square (about the Temple:) Yet in <hi>Jehosaphats</hi> time, we finde a <hi>New Court;</hi> or old one repaired and renewed: Yea, and so parted also, before the Captivity, that in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations,</hi>

            <p>For which also, the Circumference of This Court, will be just 1600 Cubits (as we read there of 1600 Furlongs:) just 2400 Grecian Feet. And <hi>Antonia,</hi> at North-west, 1200 more. But about them Both, but 2000 Cubits, 3000 Feet, 4000 Spans, 12000 Taps, or 48000 Digits.</p>
            <p>Each side of this Outer Court, had a fair Gate; and 4 constant Watchers: But <hi>Shushan,</hi> the Front, or the Kings Gate, being Eastward, had 2 <hi>Watchers</hi> more than the other Gates. And the Western side, next the City, had 3 little Gates, or Wickets more; with two Watchers apiece: in all, 24. As all the Courses of Priests, Levites, Singers and Porters, were 24; as we saw before.</p>
            <p>The Western side, of the Inward Court, had No Gate at all (it seems,) though in the Outer Court, More than its fellowes: besides that stately Causey, or <hi>Solomons going up to the House of God;</hi> between <hi>T'eyls,</hi> or <hi>Elms,</hi>

            <p>The South side of the Inward Court, had the Higher; and Lower, or Water-Gate, of <hi>Benjamin;</hi> and in His Tribe; directly opposite, to two other Gates, in the North: the Upper Gate, of the House, (being just against the Temple, to the North: where the Women sate, weeping for <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muz:)</hi>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:51941:175"/>
and the Gate of the Altar, which was just between it, and the Lower Gate, of <hi>Benjamin.</hi> But the Eastern side, here also, had the most stately Gate, or <hi>Jothams new Gate:</hi> or the <hi>High Gate,</hi> of Glory: For else, it was the <hi>Low Gate,</hi> for looking over it, from <hi>Olivet:</hi> at the Ashes of the Red Cow; or at the great Day of Atonement, with the Scape-<hi>Goat.</hi> The Gate of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> in the 2d Temple; leading up to the Front, and Porch, of the Holy Place.</p>
            <p>Which was very stately; but 10 Cubits, which added to the Temples 60, make it 70. The other side was, as the Temples breadth, 20. But in Height, the great <hi>Moed,</hi> just 120. which is Twice 60, the length of all the Temple; Thrice 40, the length of the House, before the Oracle; 4 times 30, the height of the House 6 times 20, its own; and the Temples breadth, as length and height also, to the Oracle: 10 times 12, or 12 times 10, its own length from East to West.</p>
            <p>Here stood the Mighty Pillars of Heaven and Earth (as the <hi>Psalms</hi> may allude) much rather than the Poets <hi>Atlas.</hi> Each, was 18 Cubits High, and 12 about, with a <hi>Coter,</hi> Crown, of Lilly-work, or <hi>Shushan</hi> (as before in <hi>Ester,</hi> and <hi>Susanna)</hi> of 4 Cubits; on the upper part of each Pillar; and a <hi>Chapter</hi> of 5 Cubits, on the Top of each; If 6, (for the Pillars concave,) Then, each is 12 about, and 14 to the Lilly-work, and 18 with it; and 24 in all.

            <p>How <hi>Gopher,</hi> and <hi>Copher</hi> of <hi>Sodom,</hi> helped to make the <hi>Ark;</hi> and <hi>Sittim</hi> wood the Tabernacle; with its Curtains of Seirs Goats, and Badgers-skins, and Rams of <hi>Ishmaels Kedar,</hi> and <hi>Nehaioth,</hi> with Incense of <hi>Arabia!</hi> How <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> helped <hi>Solomon,</hi> to build the Temple; with the Vines of <hi>Engedi,</hi> and Sea of <hi>Sodom</hi> There; with <hi>Tamar,</hi> or

the Palm-trees of cursed <hi>Jericho;</hi> so often called, the City of Palm-trees: And of <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> also, to enter, in the 10th Generation; we have spoken much before.</p>
            <p>But where are the poor <hi>Philistines?</hi> Or oldest Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of That Countrey? Nothing for their Landlord! God forbid! Even That God, who bade him Ask, and he should have, the Heathen, for His Inheritance, and the Utmost ends of the Earth, for His Possession. And, though All the Gentiles are called <hi>Gogim</hi> (as we touched before;) Yet that name, (as <hi>Barbara,</hi> to some place about the Red Sea, (before the Midland) whence <hi>Rha barbarae,</hi> as well as <hi>Rha Pontic;)</hi> was in a special maner, given to some wretched <hi>Gentiles,</hi> about the Sea of <hi>Sodom;</hi> as we may learn, by comparing <hi>Gen.</hi> 14, with <hi>Jos.</hi> 12. 23. Or to the Neighbours of the other Sea; which it seems, as Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to this day, were <hi>Gentiles,</hi> more than others. These were <hi>Philistines:</hi> who yet were from <hi>Caphtor,</hi> or but a Remnant of the old <hi>Caphtors;</hi> as we may read in <hi>Moses, Amos,</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Jeremy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How often did our Fathers (as St <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh to the Gentile <hi>Corinthians,)</hi> sojourn at <hi>Gerar?</hi> and other places of the <hi>Philistines?</hi> That I say nothing, of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> the just man, with a <hi>perfect Heart,</hi> as God himself granteth, in a Night-Vision, when he returned <hi>Sara,</hi> with Riches and Blessing, as before, from <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And a solemn Covenant made between them. Not onely <hi>Abimelech</hi> (Healed by <hi>Abrahams</hi> Prayer) but with <hi>Picol</hi> also, the <hi>Mouth of All;</hi> as saying <hi>Amen:</hi> to the Covenant, and the Blessing also. For, it may be observed, how God himself, to bring out a Great Blessing, will prepare the People, common People also, to desire and expect it; and then, to confirm it, by saying <hi>Amen.</hi> So that Christ himself, the Power and Wisdom of God, could do no great Work, till the People did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, believe, expect, or cry <hi>Amen.</hi> And indeed the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the common <hi>Law-Takers,</hi> are the great <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers!</hi> Receive the <hi>Instruction</hi> of thy <hi>Father,</hi> but the <hi>Law</hi> of thy <hi>Mother:</hi> As we touched before, in his Mothers bidding them Do, whatever He bade them; before he did Any Miracle. And now also, though at the Right Hand
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:51941:176"/>
of God; and so, hath Power, over All his Handy-works; (which he saith, we may command also; yea, and come to Do, as much, or more, than He then did:) Yet, That Hand of God, is too great, for Him to weild, as a man; and so, he pleaseth to Act to us; and not to Force us, but to Woo us: and he never Wears us, till he win us fairly, by his Woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us; as first by Power, he conquered us, from Death and Hell. And so, He hath None, till the Father, in Them, give them up to him: which is also called, Their giving up themselves. Till which, he Wooeth, or Weepeth; but unless the soul come to give it self, to him; He seeth that the Father, (for, He is the <hi>Son of man,</hi> or Every man) the Father, doth not give him such a soul: and so, the match is never made, but by consent of Both.</p>
            <p>But when once, his Thunders, or his Earthquakes, or his Fire, in the Bush, do make us startle so, as to say, <hi>I will now turn aside</hi> (from the Noise, and Dust, and Croud of the world,) <hi>to see this Great sight;</hi> and to Do it: Then, he quickly calleth to us, as to <hi>Moses,</hi> with a little <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (by which, they say, he made the World;) with a soft, still voice, and a meek, quiet spirit: he begins by Kindeness (he hath Art enough) to conquer All our fears, and froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, so much, as to begin to try, and then to mark, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and consider, All his dealing with us; Till we come to Hope, and then to Trust his Heart, and Fathers Heart, in Him: The work is done. And though, to try us, once or twice perhaps, he may put on a Mask, or Veil, or seem to frown; yet when, once we begin to know his Heart, we kiss him, when we Tremble, and with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence bow, and Pray, and long to see him, More, and more, and yet still more; and do not fear his worst: his Blackest Mask. His heart is good (O my want of words!) a thousand fold much Better, than we ever heard (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a Good Report;) or can, as yet, believe.</p>
            <p>When we so know him, we shall quickly know (if we follow on to know,) and see, and feel, he knoweth us; and knew us first, by Name. And now he will not leave us, till we break off speaking to him; as <hi>Abraham,</hi> in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for <hi>Sodom.</hi> The Oyl will never cease, while
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:51941:177"/>
we can Buy, or Begg, or Borrow Vessels to receive it.</p>
            <p>And it is yet plainer, that although God Bless us oft, alone, by Himself, yet he never Curseth men, without themselves, not onely to joyn with the envious One, but even pull, or force it, on themselves, and cry <hi>Amen,</hi> when others wash their hands: and say, Be it so, <hi>Let his Blood, be on us, and our Children also.</hi> Poor Children! of Wrath and Curse! before they heard or saw! (O that we could consider, what a Parents words may do, when we little think what we say! as before, we saw, in <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Laban,</hi> of <hi>Rachel.</hi> God did but, propose the Law it self, and bade <hi>Moses</hi> ask, if They would take it. They accepted: This Enacted, it a Law, to Them. And so its Curses: God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed them, but so, that They must say <hi>Amen,</hi> before they did, or could oblige, or hurt them. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. &amp; 30. 15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> God put them not, till They put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves There, in fear of Famine: As in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, and <hi>Isaaks.</hi> Onely <hi>Joseph</hi> was carried against his will: As <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> also, was thrust out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as a Type of them, that were to be thrust out Thence also: though they now cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Who made thee a Judge among us?</hi> But God exalted Both. And God never carryed them to <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Assyria,</hi> till they Hired, or called, those Rasors to shave them: and shewed them, their Treasures, or their Nakedness. So it was in <hi>Syria:</hi> So with <hi>Nahash the Serpent,</hi> (as in Paradice also:) till they Chose a King, and Then, God gave him! and set him Over them! But yet He also, even <hi>Saul him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> (or all the Sheols in the world) could never Curse them, till themselves consented to the Curse, and cryed, <hi>Amen.</hi> As we see in the famous case of <hi>Jonathan:</hi> Whom the People Blessed (and <hi>He shall be Blessed)</hi> though his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the King also, Cursed, with an Oath also.</p>
            <p>So was That Covenant with <hi>Abimelech,</hi> confirmed, both with <hi>Picol,</hi> the <hi>Mouth of All</hi> the people, and by an <hi>Oath</hi> also: Both with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaak,</hi> afterwards. And for the <hi>Land also, in which they sojourned</hi> (as <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 23.) Often, remembred in Scripture: And we should remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it, as often as we read <hi>Beersheba:</hi> the Well of <hi>Seven,</hi> and the <hi>Oath</hi> also: Madc at this Covenant with <hi>Philistines.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:51941:177"/>
And as <hi>David</hi> fulfilled that part also, of sojourning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Philistines</hi> (as the Ark had done before him:) So I doubt not, but he Blessed Them also; as <hi>Abraham and Isaak</hi> did, according to their Covenant <hi>(for the Land also,</hi> which God mentions so often; in which they sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;) and sware before <hi>Abimelech,</hi> both King and Father; with <hi>Picol</hi> also; at <hi>Beersheba:</hi> That famous Bound, of All the Land of Rest, and Hope, or Promise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blessed,</hi> and for ever, <hi>Blessed be my Rock; and Blessed be the God of my Rock;</hi> who delivereth me from the <hi>strivings of the People;</hi> and maketh me the Head of the Heathen. Strangers will submit themselves: As soon as they Hear, they will obey. For, <hi>He will speak the People under me,</hi> by his Holy Word; As the English singing Psalms, do rightly tune Tha tword, so often used by <hi>David.</hi> With his <hi>Gittits</hi> also.</p>
            <p>And his <hi>Mictam,</hi> of <hi>Aram Naharaim,</hi> and <hi>Zoba,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Cryeth, <hi>O Philistia! Triumph over me!</hi> Nor, do I know, that <hi>Solomon</hi> thought it any <hi>Solecism,</hi> or any scorn, or <hi>Irony,</hi> to set the <hi>Philistines,</hi> so near the very Top, of his <hi>Triumphant Arch,</hi> or Pillars, in the Holy Temple Porch.</p>
            <p>The Left hand Pillar, is called <hi>Boaz;</hi> as the Judge that married <hi>Ruth,</hi> a Root of <hi>Davids Jesse: Jachin</hi> is the Right.

            <p>And of <hi>Benjamin at Rimmon,</hi> just 400 men, were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to 400 Virgins; all the Reliques of poor <hi>Jabesh-Gilead:</hi> As of <hi>Davids</hi> 600, onely 400, could hold out, to recover his two Spouses, or Witnesses, of <hi>Ziglag.</hi> As <hi>Abrahams</hi> 400, or thereabout, to recover <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Sodom</hi> also; from <hi>Dan:</hi> whence, <hi>God will judge his People;</hi> and That Nation <hi>I will judge:</hi> but first, <hi>thy seed must serve,</hi> 400 Year.</p>
            <p>Of the other 200 <hi>Rimmons</hi> also, or of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> from <hi>Rimmon;</hi> there is more to be said: &amp; of Their Dance at <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh;</hi> which of all places, is there so exactly described, and compared, with <hi>Bethel, Sechem, and Lebonah.</hi> And to All before, of Those places, <hi>Josuah</hi> called all Israel to <hi>Sechem,</hi> and there made that solemn discourse in the 24th. And to <hi>Shiloh</hi> also (where <hi>Jacob</hi> placeth, the <hi>Gathering, of All the People:)</hi> and There he casteth 7 Lots, for the 7 Tribes, about the 7th Year (as very probable) from their entering <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan:</hi> as the Root, or, it may be, the Centre, of All Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Years and Jubilies.

            <p>And if that great Meeting at <hi>Shiloh,</hi> should be some few Years, after the 7th Year; yet it may be just 430 Years, before the Temple; As the 7th Year, was 430, before <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Reign. As if their setting up the Tabernacle, Then at <hi>Shiloh,</hi> were to be a Type of the Temple Raised up, just so long after it, as the Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was before the Law, or coming out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Which was 480 Years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Temple, founded in the 4th of <hi>Solomon:</hi> but not finished till the 7th after. Was it so many Daies, in Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as there will be Years, before the House of God finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the <hi>New Jerusalem?</hi> Of which again.</p>
            <p>The Feast of Dedication, in the 7th Month, of the 7th Year; a Type of that great Feast of Tabernacles; of which before: And of the Last and great Day of Unleavened Bread, on the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of the First Month; beginning from 480 Hours: As the Temple did, 480 Years, after <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this great Dedication, 120 Priests, sounded with Trumpets (which were never more than 120:) and when All agreed as One, in singing, <hi>He is Good, He is Good, and his Mercy dureth Ever.</hi> Then the Glory of God came down, and filled the House, so that the Priests could not tarry (and there was no need:) and Then, <hi>Solomon</hi> bowed, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>But will God indeed! dwel on Earth!</hi> See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. and the like at <hi>Jehosaphats Valley of Blessing,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 22.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Taking out 70 Years (of the City and Temple deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;) there remain just 420 Years, from That Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

            <p>420, Is 3 <hi>Moeds,</hi> and an Half; that is 3 times 120, and 60. As the 70 Years Captivity, was 3 times 20, and an Half. And 120, is 6 times 20, or 3 times 40. And the Great <hi>Moed</hi> for Man; as we saw before. The first of These 3, bring up <hi>Athaliah,</hi> (which signifies the <hi>Lords Time,</hi> or Time for the Lord:) 120 Years from the Dedication.

            </p>
            <p>And as Time devoureth All things, so did <hi>Athaliah</hi> (the Lords Time) destroy All the Seed Royal.

            <p>The other Half <hi>Moed,</hi> comes near that great Change of <hi>Israels Moon,</hi> after an hard siege, about 3 Years and Half, for slaying Those <hi>Witnesses</hi> also: beginning in the 7th of <hi>Hosea,</hi> (the same Name with the Prophet:) and Ending about the 7th of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> Or 777 Years from <hi>Aegypt:</hi> But Cxi (as the measuring Line, or <gap reason="foreign">

Even <hi>the Great Deep;</hi> or <hi>Abyss</hi> (which was the great thing to be feared; and the Spirit of God also, to kindle the Fire:) but in devouring the Deep, or the Devourer; it also devoured a Part of <hi>Israel,</hi> as the words may hint, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 4.

               <hi>zekiah; As Abraham</hi> freed his friends, and <hi>Sodom</hi> also, in the 14 year: and <hi>Joreph</hi> was freed in the 14th year (being then 30 years old, when he stood before <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> &amp; but 17, when he was sold; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 2. 41. 46.) we saw before. With many other things of 14: being the 2d Number, made of 3 whole Numbers, and an half; as 7, is the first.</p>
            <p>The next Half <hi>Moed,</hi> may carry <hi>Menasseh</hi> to <hi>Babilon;</hi> As a Type of <hi>Judahs</hi> Captivity, and Return also: As <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh</hi> returned; and <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was visited in <hi>Babylon</hi> it self; and <hi>Jeconia</hi> freed; and advanced above All the Princes with him. And How, after All, his horrid sins; <hi>Menasseh</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself, and Bowed, greatly, praying to His God! O the mans confidence! and to his Fathers God (a Blessed thing, to have a Fathers God!) and How, he heard, and Bowed down to Hear; we saw before. And though God brought him to his Throne again; (as also <hi>Nebuchadnezar:)</hi> Yet, the Blood he shed, is often brought, as a great Cause of the following Captivity. Yea, and That also, although <hi>Josiah</hi> was so good a King, and made so great a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet God sent him (even Him!) This Message. My <hi>Wrath shal be poured out on This Place: and shal not be quenched.</hi> Yet, it was so quenched, that from This also, a poor soul may learn, how to interpret, All Gods Frownings, and Threatnings, on it.</p>
            <p>So also the Prophet <hi>Zephany,</hi> concludeth his most ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Threatnings (in the time of <hi>Josiah.) I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn Moed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will undo them that afflict thee:</hi> (As to Abram, They that Curse Thee, shal be Cursed.) <hi>I will save Her that Halteth, and Gather Her that was driven out: and I will get them Praise and Fame in every Land where they are put to shame.

            <p>And as <hi>Assyria,</hi> was brought on <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> on <hi>Judah,</hi> like the Waters of the Great <hi>Flood;</hi> So, they must be Dryed up. <hi>I will Dry up her Sea, and make her Springs Dry:</hi> Which was, to the very Letter, fulfilled, by <hi>Cyrus;</hi> Turning away their great River, and cutting it out into as many Streams, as Dayes in the year: and so he brought in his Army, when and where, they little expected it; in a time of great Feasting and jollity; as we read in Heathen Authors.</p>
            <p>And so also, the same 51 Chapter of <hi>Jeremy</hi> (by that meek and quiet Prince, we saw before,) sent this Heavy Doom to <hi>Babylon: In their Heat,</hi> or Humming jollity, <hi>I will set (ashite,</hi> in Hebrew;) <hi>on their Feastings, I will make them Drunk:</hi> (So it is first said, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> Hardned his own heart; and then, that <hi>God hardned it:</hi> and so here, <hi>God will make them Drunk:)</hi> that They may Dance; and sleep a perpetual sleep; and not Wake: saith the Lord.

            <p>Which we see, fulfilled sadly; in the 5th of <hi>Daniel:</hi> When the Mans Fingers, writing on the Wall, made their King, &amp; all those Drunken Feasters, quake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble so, that <hi>the Kings Countenance</hi> (or Brightness) <hi>was changed; and his</hi> Thoughts <hi>pierced him</hi> so, that <hi>the joynts of his Loyns were loosed: and his Knees smote him,</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves also; that should have been otherwise imployed than in drinking Healths, or Carousing <hi>Prayses to the gods of Gold and Silver:</hi> as the words may intimate.</p>

and God accepteth our calling him Father: As a Childe calling <hi>Dappo;</hi> Though we know not why, the Childe so calleth Him; or whom it meaneth, by its words perhaps, but by its signs, and looks, or sighing; somwhat else.

And the King returned, <hi>Cause the men to cease, from Building the City;</hi> Or, that it be no more <hi>Built,</hi> till farther Order. So the work ceased, till the 2d of <hi>Darius.</hi> Then stood up <hi>Haggai,</hi> saying, Is it time for you to dwell in <hi>Cieled Houses, and This House lie waste?</hi> And again, Verse 9. <hi>Ye run, every man, unto his own House.</hi> This was the First of the 6th Month; and Then, They came, and wrought, in the 24th of that Month; but so slowly; that he spake again, on the 21st of the Seventh Monrh, the Last and Great Day of Tabernacles; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain on the 24th of the 9th Month: <hi>And now I pray consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:51941:189"/>
from this Day and Upward, from before a Stone was laid upon a Stone, in the Temple of the Lord: But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider now from This Day, and Upward, from the 24th of the 9th Month, from the Day the Foundation of the Lords Temple was Laid. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By which it seems plain enough, that They had leave to build the City, and had Will enough to Build it, and to <hi>Ciel their own Houses,</hi> rather, and much sooner, than the Lords. Which by <hi>Esayes</hi> words, was onely to be <hi>Founded</hi> by <hi>Cyrus;</hi> when <hi>Jerusalem</hi> should be Built. And so <hi>Ezra</hi> found it, plain enough; and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was told indeed, that the Remnant of the Captivity, were in great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reproach; and that the <hi>Wall of Ierusalem was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, and the Gates burnt with Fire.</hi> Which yet may seem some Later matter, then That Sack, in <hi>Zedekiah;</hi> which sure was known enough to <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> That he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not be told of That. But now, he heard some late, or New affliction, and Reproach, upon the Remnant, that had built the City, up again, after their Return. And when Himself came up, He did but onely <hi>Repair the Walls,</hi> and <hi>set up the Gates.</hi> And There also the men of <hi>Iericho,</hi> repaired next to the Very High Priest. Of so great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute was <hi>Iericho</hi> (the cursed City;) even in Those dayes, and Returning from <hi>Babylon</hi> also: being as the Iewes say, the 2d to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Or as the <hi>Moon</hi> (as it soundeth) to the <hi>Sun.</hi> Yea, some observe, that in the very <hi>Hebrew</hi> Letters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> there only wanteth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of All in <hi>Iericho,</hi> and <hi>Salem,</hi> its first Name.</p>
            <p>It may not, therefore, be said, but That <hi>Cyrus</hi> also, gave forth a <hi>Word, to Return, and Build Ierusalem;</hi> as we read in <hi>Daniels</hi> Weeks. Which were given out to Him, in the very first Year of <hi>Darius the Mede;</hi> which seemeth also the First of <hi>Cyrus the Persian</hi> (though not in <hi>Babylon:)</hi> and at the very beginning of his Prayer, <hi>the Word went out:</hi> as the Angel tells him, Verse 23. with the very same Phrase, in the 25th, <hi>From the Going sorth of the Word, to Return and Build Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Phrase <hi>Motsa,</hi> doth not onely note, the first <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out,</hi> of a Word or Thing, but a <hi>Continued Motion;</hi> and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:51941:189"/>
on, or growing up, or constant flowing; As, in a <hi>Spring of Water,</hi> Esay 58. the <hi>growing up of the Grass,</hi> Job 38. Or a <hi>Mine</hi> of silver, or other Mettal, <hi>Job</hi> 27. Or Sun-Rising, and going forward, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. Or the East it self, <hi>Psal.</hi> 75. And, <hi>His going, is prepared, as the Morning;</hi> (we found in <hi>Hoseah:)</hi> And his <hi>Goings forth, from Eternity, the Dayes of Old,</hi> in <hi>Micha.</hi> Where we still read, the same Phrase; and in many other places. So that Here, also, in <hi>Daniel,</hi> we may not tye it up to the <hi>First word of Cyrus,</hi> (or any other) to return or build: but to the <hi>Whole Matter</hi> (as <hi>Dabar</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, as well as a <hi>Word,</hi> or Command:) or full Process, and Progress of That Business; with All its full <hi>Execution</hi> (which is <hi>Motsa</hi> also;) the End, Issue, or finishing of a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as well as its first going out.</p>
            <p>So that if the Word, or Command of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> were in Doing, or delaying, very many Years; yet it was still so going forth, and going up, as the Sun from East to West. And so <hi>Cyrus</hi> may signifie in the Persian: or in Hebrew also; being a <hi>Vessel of Fire,</hi> as the sun is, or at least seemeth. And there is a famous Record of <hi>Cyrus</hi> seeing the Sun at his Beds Feet (as <hi>Joseph,</hi> and others perhaps, have seen it, as Bowing or coming towards:) And his Catching at it Thrice, was Thrice 10 Years they said, of his Reign. And the <hi>Sun</hi> also, was the Persian Armes or God.</p>
            <p>And the Prophet brings him up, from the East, like the Suns Rayes upon the Temple, and <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And though, the Sun stood still, for one whole Day, in <hi>Josuah;</hi> and went backward in <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> (So, that some that had fixed <hi>Nabonasses Era,</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> came to enquire of <hi>That VVonder,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 31.) yet it went forward again, and got ground perhaps, by staying: So did <hi>Cyrus</hi> also; For <hi>Darius</hi> did but Build, on <hi>Cyrus</hi> Foundation, and the Decree of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> So, that it may be said, of Him, as of <hi>Zerubbabel, His Hand began, and His Hand finished. And I will make thee a signet on my Hand also; for I have Chosen thee:</hi> As I threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Cast off thy Grand-Father; Though, <hi>a signet on my Right Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How long this City, or this Temple should be in Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by That Decree; may be very hard to determine,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:51941:190"/>
from the Scripture: which yet, must determine All great matters of Faith and Doctrine, and other things also, of great moment; before we can much rest, and be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in them. Which is One, of many things, I so much love, in the <hi>Chain of Scripture Chronology,</hi> by T. A. So in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious in clearing Scripture. which I am loath to leave, in This, or any thing else; in which we differ.</p>
            <p>But for This also by Scripture. That <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> (those two <hi>VVitnesses,)</hi> were now slain; or lay, as Dead, in That Captivity; and that <hi>Judah</hi> returned, but in Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; and newly Delivered: Is so clear, from <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. 10. that it needeth little other proof. And but of a <hi>Daughter, the Daughter of Zion;</hi> For, the <hi>Man-childe,</hi> was not yet Born; Though, <hi>before she Travelled,</hi> her last <hi>Thraws; she must bring forth a Man-childe also.</hi> As some of the Jewes cite, for the <hi>Messiah</hi> to be <hi>born before</hi> Their last Sack of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> though He lie hid, they say, in <hi>Rome;</hi> or other place.</p>
            <p>Now, when a Woman was delivered of a Daughter (as Here; where God, by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> delivered this Jewish Church, or woman:) she must stay, 80 Dayes, before she may eat the Holy things; or come into the Sanctuary: as we saw before. And that the longest Hiding of the <hi>Moon,</hi> is about 80 Hours, or at most 84; which is 3 Dayes and Half: when slowest motion: Or else, much shorter; but 40, or 42. As a Womans Daies also, for a Man-childe.</p>
            <p>But That also by degrees, of 7, and 33 Daies, for a Son (as 7, and 33 Hours in the <hi>Moon)</hi> and 14, and 66, for a Daughter: which is now, our Case in Hand. And so, from <hi>Cyrus</hi> Decree, to the Temple finished, in <hi>Darius Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasp:</hi> were at least 14 Years. First, 11, answering to the 11 first of the Captivity, from <hi>Johojachim,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was <hi>Daniels;</hi> or <hi>Jehojachin, Ezekiels;</hi> to <hi>Zedekiahs</hi> last, or 11 Year. And so many there were, from <hi>Cyrus</hi> Decree; to the 2d of <hi>Darius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Utmost Court of All Israel, about the Temple, which they called <hi>Chell,</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> was 11 Cubits Broad: and Then, 5 steps more (of 5 half Cubits; as the Woman came not up, till the Morning after the 14th Day:) into the <hi>VVomens Court;</hi> as they called it, in the 2d Temple: which we are now going here to Build, in its Times and Seasons.
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:51941:190"/>
So, it was not finished till the 6th Year of <hi>Darius,</hi> Ezra 6. 15. And there may be somwhat said, to End the 14 Years, sooner also: and yet So, that there may be 14 Years from <hi>Cyrus</hi> First, to <hi>Darius</hi> 2d. But However; from the first 14 Years, after <hi>Cyrus Decree,</hi> the next 66, will reach to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> sending <hi>Ezra,</hi> or <hi>Nehemiah. Darius</hi> Reigned 34, as some, but 36, as others; and <hi>Xerxes</hi> 21. <hi>Artabamus,</hi> not a Year. And the next, <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> in whose 7th <hi>Ezra,</hi> and 20th <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> went to <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> with those gracious Decrees we finde in them.</p>
            <p>And from the 7th of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> to our Saviours death, there were very near 490 Years. So that <hi>Ezra,</hi> might well live, within 400 Years of Christ: as we read in 2d <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras,</hi> 7. And if <hi>Daniels</hi> Half Week be, as some believe, to reach 3 Years and Half, below his Death: As its first Half, from his Baptism, to his Death; yet, it may very well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Temple finished, in 3 Years and an Half, after the 2d of <hi>Darius:</hi> Although <hi>Scaliger, Calvisius, Helvicus,</hi> and other Great men, begin the Weeks, or 490 Years, from the 2d of <hi>Darius Nothus.</hi> Whence also, to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Sack of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> there may be very near 490 Years; if they were to end with the City, and not with our Saviour; which I think more agreeable to Scripture and Reason, in many things, besides the Age of <hi>Ezra, Josuah, Zerubbabel;</hi> with All that saw Both Temples: as we see in <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. 12.</p>
            <p>And besides All for This before; and the great Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies between the Times in the Law, and the Gospel also; with the Temples, and the Cities: It may be remembred, that we found the Day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> to begin, just from 1536 Hours of the Year. For, 333, brought us, to the Evening <hi>Minha,</hi> of the 14th Day of the Month; or Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Passover:</hi> Which ended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> just in 336 Hours. 50 Dayes more, make up just 1200 Hours; coming to the Day of <hi>First-fruits,</hi> or <hi>Pentecost:</hi> 50 Daies from the <hi>Sickle</hi> (as we saw before:) and Therefore, it began just in 1536 Hour of the Year; which as we saw before, was to be Reckoned from their coming out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence, 480, brought us to <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple; 36 more to <hi>Solomons</hi> Death: and 390 more to the Cityes End and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:51941:191"/>
Temples. If we There begin the 70 Years Captivity; and Then add the 14, and 66, and 490, we last spake of, They make 1546. But beginning the Captivity Ten full Years before the End of the City and Temple, as before; we have than but just 1536: which is the very last Hour, before the Day of <hi>Pentecost:</hi> and so, those Years bring us just to the great <hi>Pentecost</hi> in the 2d of <hi>Acts,</hi> being the same Year of our Saviours Death and Resurrection, and Ascention also. So that, In This One Year, were All things fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that were before That <hi>Pentecost;</hi> from which, we are to Reckon, to the Feast of Tabernacles.</p>
            <p>And if Any yet, will bring the Captivity; or the 2d Temple, any lower; or begin <hi>Daniels VVeeks,</hi> at <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> going in the 20th Year, rather than <hi>Ezraes,</hi> in the 7th; There may yet be greater Harmony. For, although the 50th Day, or <hi>Pentecost,</hi> began from 1536 hours of the Year; Yet the Sun of that Day, rose not till 12 Hours after, As <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> came up 12 Years, after <hi>Ezra.</hi> This, was an <hi>Helper;</hi> as our <hi>Saviour;</hi> but <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> the <hi>Lords Comforter;</hi> as the Holy Ghost, coming in the Morning of the Day of <hi>Pentecost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there may be yet, somwhat more in it, to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed also, from the Scripture Numbers, or Measures of This Temple, and its Courts; which we shal therefore yet, a little more consider, with <hi>Herods</hi> also; as we did, that of <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However it was, in His first Temple, It is clear enough, there was at the Second, from <hi>Babylon,</hi> an <hi>Hill,</hi> an <hi>Hell,</hi> an <hi>Help;</hi> before the <hi>Altar, Porch,</hi> and <hi>House,</hi> or <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Most Holy</hi> Place, or <hi>Oracle.</hi> Which had All, their several Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and Degrees of Holiness; to which God himself seemeth to allude in divers Places: As in that; <hi>I wil bring them to my Holy Mountain:</hi> and Then, <hi>I will make them joyful in my House of Prayer.</hi> And, <hi>I will accept them on my Holy Altar.</hi> And, <hi>Send thee help, out of the Holy Place.</hi> And, <hi>An House of Prayer to All Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Walled <hi>Hill,</hi> a square of 2000 Cubits: the Distance of the Camp, from the Ark; <hi>Ios.</hi> 3. 4. and a Sabbath Daies journey, as we may learn from the old Chalde Paraphrase on <hi>Ruth.</hi> Each side being 500, may be compared with

               <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Sanctuary, 500 long, and 500 broad (as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs 50 Cubits about:) Taken out of 25000. Chap. 45. As 42, speaketh of 500 Reeds. I need not add, the Cubit was 2 Spans, or 6 Taps, of 24 Digits, as Hours in a Day.</p>
            <p>The Wall was generally 24, or 25 Cubits High: and the <hi>Gates</hi> 30. 15 Broad (but the Doors 20, 10:) Onely That at the <hi>East,</hi> was lower than the Rest, by 4 Cubits: That the Priest, might look over it, from <hi>Olivet,</hi> at the Red Cowes Ashes; or other Reasons before.</p>
            <p>The East Gate, in memorial of their Captivity, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance at <hi>Shushan,</hi> in <hi>Ester;</hi> had the Name and form of the City <hi>Shushan:</hi> by command some say, from the Persian King at <hi>Shushan,</hi> the Royal City, for about 34 Years, after This 2d Temple was Built. Which yet, was a more love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or Holy Prospect, than <hi>Solomons</hi> House for <hi>Chemosh,</hi> and <hi>Moloch,</hi> in <hi>Tophet,</hi> on the Right Hand also, from This Gate, to <hi>Olivet.</hi> But the whole Valley of the Dead bodies, and of the Ashes (in <hi>Tophet,</hi> and <hi>Gehinnon</hi> it self) must come in, to be Holy, as <hi>Jerusalem; A</hi> Gracious Promise in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> 31.</p>
            <p>The Gatehouse 12 Cubits: As <hi>Ezekiels</hi> also; a Reed of 6 Cubits without, and 6 within the Gate: in the 6th of the 40th Chap. And now we are come, to That, which (in our Saviours time also,) was called <hi>Solomons Porch:</hi> We found it Square; 400 Cubits: every side a Double Walk, of 30 Cubits Broad, and covered: with 3 Rows of white Marble Pillars, of 24 Cubits. And the South, or Right Hand walk, was Treble, with 4 Rows of Pillers: which <hi>Josephus</hi> calleth the <hi>Royal Stoe,</hi> or stateliest Walk, the Sun yet ever saw.

The Wall about This Hell, they called <hi>Sorg,</hi> or <hi>Surge,</hi> or <hi>Scurge:</hi> a common Wall, was <hi>Home.</hi> To this, they went up, by 14 steps, as <hi>Josephus;</hi> or 12, as the Talmud: Half Cubits. At every Gate (against the other Gates,) were Pillars, bidding strangers keep their distance, at their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril: As if Hell, were onely for <hi>Children of the Kingdom.</hi> Yet it had but low Walls of 3 Cubits; with <hi>Latices,</hi> for Children also, to look thorow.

            <p>Their Highest <hi>Sanedrin</hi> (in <hi>Gazit,</hi> over <hi>Hell,</hi> but joyning to the south of this court) were chofen from the <hi>Sanedrins</hi> of 23, (which were onely in Towns of 120 persons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, fit for Magistrates: as Those of 3, were for 10 such; as we saw before:) whereof, the Lowest 23, for <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> sate in the Gate <hi>Shushan;</hi> and the Higher, in This Gate of <hi>Nicanor.</hi> Unto which, they brought Appeals from That of <hi>Shushan</hi> (as from All Lower courts, to <hi>Shushan:)</hi> and, Here not Determined, They went to the Highest <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin</hi> in <hi>Gazit:</hi> Where yet, none might sit, that were very Old (least too Morose;) or had No children: For, they thought a Man could hardly be meek enough, to be a Judge, in such a court; till himself had <hi>Children.</hi> Psalm 103. 13.</p>
            <p>The Length of this court from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West,</hi> was 187 cubits (and its breadth, as the Womens, just 135:) equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parted by 3 Gates (as <hi>Josephus;</hi> and the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> had 3 Gates on a side) at the <hi>South,</hi> and <hi>North;</hi> but <hi>Nicanor</hi> onely at the <hi>East;</hi> and None at the <hi>West:</hi> as we saw before.

            <p>But we are now looking Forward, on the Times follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lng that Temple, and the 70 years captivity, from <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Shushan:</hi> As we saw the Jewes express it. And How <hi>Solomon</hi> called his spouse from North to south, and from East to West, in <hi>Shelomith</hi> and <hi>Lehana,</hi> we saw before! We might add <hi>Jonah</hi> (from <hi>Assyria:)</hi> For, so His <hi>Dove</hi> is called: and <hi>Susanna also:</hi> As alluding both to <hi>Susanna,</hi> freed by <hi>Daniel;</hi> and to the Jewes Return from <hi>Shushan:</hi> As they name the first Gate of the Temple.</p>
            <p>May I add, that <hi>Jonah</hi> (which we found in <hi>Hoseah</hi> also) is, in Hebrew Letters, but 71, As the very year of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from That <hi>Assyrian</hi> captivity: Which <hi>Jonah</hi> also might Typifie, as well as our Saviours Rising from the Dead. And <hi>Solomons Jonathi (my Jonah, my Dove,)</hi> maketh 476. As there were just so many years before him, from <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and after him, to Their Return from <hi>Babylon:</hi> and Building This 2d Temple in <hi>Darius Hystasp.</hi> Or from the End of his Buildings, to their First Return, in the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> And if we look Forward, there may be just 476 Years, from the City finished, in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> to our savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Death, or Baptism. As 490 from <hi>Ezras</hi> Coming, to his Death. And if <hi>Xerxes</hi> should prove to be Queen <hi>Esters</hi> Husband, as so many thought; there may be Thence, 476 Years, to our saviours Birth.</p>

And for That, of <hi>Ester</hi> also; and <hi>Susanna,</hi> at <hi>Sbushan;</hi> there may be a mistery in it, as the very Name imports, from <hi>Satar,</hi> to Hide, Whence <hi>Nister, Mister, Mistress, Ester,</hi> As we saw before.

            <p>But we may have clearer Arguments: Yea, and it may be, from the Temple Measures also. The Outer court of the Hill, was 500 cubits square; and so we may begin at any Gate. As that of <hi>Huldah,</hi> So they called it: as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the Prophetess (in good <hi>Josiahs</hi> Time, so near the Captivity:) who also was Buried in <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Any, but the House of <hi>David.</hi> And it may be, from <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And though the length of the Outer Court, between <hi>Shushan</hi> and <hi>Coponius,</hi> were but 500 Cubits; As 500 Years from its first founding, to <hi>Herods</hi> Taking <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> Yet if we measure all the steps to the <hi>Porch</hi> Floor, 22 Cubits Higher that <hi>Shushan,</hi> as we saw before: We may come to the very Year of This in <hi>Herod.</hi> Who having lost his great <hi>Mark Antony</hi> (whose Name remained in <hi>Antonia,</hi> the great Tower at the Temples <hi>North-west)</hi> from the great Battel at <hi>Actium,</hi> he was now to make new Friends with <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus;</hi> to whom he consecrated his New <hi>Samaria,</hi> by the name of <hi>Sebaste,</hi> or <hi>Augusta,</hi> about his 14th year; and Then begins his great <hi>Cesarea,</hi> in his 16th Year; and in his 17th meets <hi>Augustus</hi> coming to those parts. And that the Jews might tell no Tales, or to atone the blood of their Great <hi>Sanedrin,</hi> whom he had slain, All but the President <hi>Hillel,</hi> and Vice-President <hi>Shammai</hi> (the onely man that plainly Voted against him before he was King, for killing <hi>Ezekias,</hi> &amp;c.) He promiseth to build the Temple New: and so he did, in 7 or 8 years space (as many years, before our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Birth;) and so we come to <hi>Coponius:</hi> who was Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Horse, when <hi>Cyrenius</hi> was Governour of <hi>Syria</hi> (as we may learn from <hi>Josephus;)</hi> and afterwards, <hi>Coponius</hi> was also Governour of <hi>Judea,</hi> in our Saviours Time.

            <p>Entering <hi>Shushan,</hi> the first 14 Cubits, through the Gate and Pillars (as the first 14 Dayes, of the first Month, to the Passover; or 2d Sabbath; and the first 14 Dayes, of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in Childe-bed, of a Daughter; as the Jewish Church was now Delivered of the <hi>Daughter of Sion;)</hi> Brought them to <hi>Solomons Porch:</hi> And so, the first 14 years from <hi>Shushan,</hi> brought up the Prophets <hi>Haggai and Zechary;</hi> with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, ere long, from <hi>Darius Hystasp:</hi> to build the Temple on <hi>Cyrus</hi> Words; but <hi>Solomons</hi> Works: as we may finde in <hi>Josephus</hi> (adding the <hi>City</hi> also, to <hi>Cyrus</hi> Graunt, though
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:51941:196"/>
               <hi>Ezra</hi> speak but of the <hi>Temple;)</hi> Telling us also, that This East side (repaired after by <hi>Agrippa)</hi> was 400 Cubits Long, of fair white Stones, of 20 Cubits Long, and 6 Broad (or High) of <hi>Solomons Work;</hi> and Thence called <hi>Solomons Porch:</hi> and <hi>Shushan</hi> the Kings Gate. Though the Jewes say, Both were Helped by <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Measures, which they Both, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, as much as they could.</p>
            <p>And for the distance of These Courts, we may consider that the Royal Galleries Walks, were above 60 Cubits Broad, with their Pillars. And although That south <hi>Piazzo,</hi> were Broader than the Rest, yet to make up good Proportions, between the outer square of 500, and the Courts within This; whose very Area made 333 Cubits (as we saw before) besides their Walls: we need not doubt Their Truth, who limit the space, between these Courts, by 66 cubits.</p>
            <p>And 66 Hours (besides all we saw before in the Course of the <hi>Moon;)</hi> bring us to the <hi>Noon</hi> of the 3d Day (as we are going to the 3d Wall:) and added, to the 14 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they want but 4, of 84, the great Number we saw, of 3 Days and Half; for Hiding of the Witnesses: As the <hi>Sun and Moon,</hi> did not appear, till 3 Dayes and an Half, after the Creation; the 84th Hour, or Morning of the 4th Day. And 84 Dayes, make up just 3 Months, or 12 whole Weeks.</p>
            <p>And when the Womans first 14 Dayes were over, for her Daughter; yet, she must tarry, 66 more; before she might come out, (of the <hi>Gentile,</hi> or Unclean Court) to Any Holy Place of <hi>Israel. As,</hi> for a Manchilde, 40 Dayes; <hi>As Israels</hi> 40 years, in the Wilderness: (for <hi>Israel my son, my First born.)</hi> And the very Day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> or <hi>Biccurim,</hi> the <hi>First-fruits</hi> of Holyness to God, Closed the 65th, and broughtin the 66th Day of the Year.</p>
            <p>So, the 66th year, after the Temple so begun, in <hi>Darius Hystasp:</hi> or 80, from That of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> brings up <hi>Ezra,</hi> in the 7th of <hi>Artaxerxes Long:</hi> As <hi>Josephus</hi> and so many others.</p>
            <p>And that there were just 490 Years, from This 7th of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> to our Saviours Death, is so cleared by the Great <hi>Capellus,</hi> and divers others; that <hi>Helvi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

yeeldeth, they were <hi>praecise</hi> 490 Years; although he begin them rather, from the next <hi>Darius,</hi> to the Roman Sack. which yet is due to the Infinite Wisdom of God; so order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the 70 Weeks, may either End with the Temple (from the 2d of <hi>Darius Noth:)</hi> Or with our Saviour, the True Temple; from the 7th of <hi>Artaxerxes:</hi> where I rather fix; for all the Harmonies, we have, and are to see.</p>
            <p>And that from <hi>Cyrus</hi> taking <hi>Babylon,</hi> to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> 7th there were just 80 Years, is so cleared by the Old <hi>Canon,</hi> and Eclipses also, recorded by divers, of those times, (as we may see in <hi>Lansbergius Vranometry, and Chronology;</hi> with the great <hi>Petavius,</hi> though so great an Enemy to <hi>Scaliger,</hi> who must not Dye, for all his faults:) that I yet know not what may be said against it. The main difference in <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicus,</hi> or any I remember, being, in giving <hi>Cyrus</hi> Only 3 years (as <hi>Daniel</hi> nameth 3; and yet, it may be 3 times 3, before <hi>Babylon:)</hi> when as, his very Works and Wars, may shew us divers more; as <hi>Lively,</hi> and others Evince, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had not <hi>Ptolomies Canon,</hi> as now published; such a Pillar of Times, next the Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>Daniel</hi> also might be led to <hi>Ezraes</hi> Times, with <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> I might cite his Naming <hi>Ezra,</hi> in That, some read, <hi>They shall be Helped with a little Help:</hi> Or <hi>Ezra.</hi> But if That, rather speak of the Times after <hi>Ezra;</hi> yet his very words of <hi>Returning to build Jerusalem (Asib</hi> and <hi>Tasib)</hi> may be found in <hi>Eliasib</hi> (God shall return) begining to build, or repair the sheep-gate, as his proper cure: Being High Priest. As <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the Old Gate; and next, the men of <hi>Gibeon,</hi> cursed <hi>Gibeon;</hi> and of <hi>Mispa,</hi> to the Throne of the Governour: Which may be more considered; with 1000 cubits, between the <hi>Dung-Gate,</hi> built by <hi>Malchiah,</hi> the <hi>Lord the King,</hi> and the <hi>Valley-Gate,</hi> Repaired by <hi>Hannun,</hi> He that is <hi>Gracious;</hi> which may give us the <hi>Site</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> with many other things, of those Times.</p>
            <p>And that the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> also spake of those Times, and of their Returning to Build, is plain, by comparing his words, with the <hi>Dedication</hi> of the Wall; when they Sought for All the Levites, to purifie themselves and the People, and the Gates, and the Walls also (as <hi>Neh.</hi> 12:)
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:51941:197"/>
when All the Princes were upon the Wall, and parted to the <hi>Dung-gate, on the Right Hand,</hi> when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> himself <hi>(the Lords Comforter)</hi> went After the other company, that were sent to the <hi>Left Hand:</hi> when also, they came sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Gilgal</hi> (where he <hi>rouled away the shame of Israel,</hi> by Circumcising them that were <hi>Baptised</hi> already, to <hi>Moses</hi> also, in the <hi>Cloud, and in the Sea;</hi> Through which, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers passed</hi> (as St <hi>Paul,</hi> to the Gentile <hi>Corinthians;</hi> to be considered by them that deny Baptism to Children:) and from strong Death <hi>(Azmaveth)</hi> and <hi>Netopheti;</hi> which yet I render not <hi>My Patients in Tophet,</hi> though it be near that sound in Hebrew.

            <p>But again to the <hi>Temple-Courts</hi> (which may yet lead us to the City also, ere long, I hope; and the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> That perfect <hi>Cube,</hi> As the Most Holy Oracle, of which again) The Suburbs of the Holy Courts were called <hi>Hell</hi> (for so, in Proper names, the English use to sound the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Heth,</hi> by H:) and so, <gap reason="foreign">

special, concerned in <hi>Circumcision</hi> (though it might be done by Others;) and yet more, in that of <hi>Atonement:</hi> which yet, concerned All <hi>Israel</hi> also: And so, the same Court, of 187 Cubits (coming up just to the Day of <hi>Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)</hi> was for the Priests, and the People also; that were Clean men of <hi>Israel;</hi> standing in the same Court, about the Altar (as we saw before) with little Rails. And the <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> also, came within the Rails; and so did All, that laid their Hands upon their Sacrifice. And though Only the Elders, and Watchers, said those words, in the <hi>Revelation, Thou hast Redeemed us by thy Blood; and hast made us Kings and Priests to God; and we shall Reign upon the Earth!</hi> Yet they said it, As the 24 Orders of <hi>Standers, for All Saints:</hi> for so, 'tis said, <hi>They had Viols full of Odours</hi> (to the <hi>Lamb</hi> also) <hi>the Prayers of Saints.</hi> And at <hi>Solomons</hi> great <hi>Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in the 7th Month also; we found the Cloud, so fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all the House, that <hi>the Priests could not enter,</hi> but stood without, among the Common-people; as if Then, there should not be, or need, Any such Dictinction, as there yet must be observed w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I must not omit One more Harmony of Numbers, and in These Courts also: And that is, the famous Number 666, with All its Parts; but especially 333, its Half; and Half the Moons Course from the Sun; or <hi>Full Moon;</hi> Or Hour of the <hi>Minha Passover,</hi> 333 of the Year. And All the Courts of <hi>Israel,</hi> made up just 333 Cubits, from East to West: as we saw before, in the Chell, before 135 of the Womens, and 187 of the Priests and People: All con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Full Moon; and Passover, of 333: Just Half 666, which is but 3 times 3 lesse than 135 by 5, the steps up to it! and 5 times 135, make just 675.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut if we begin at the bottom of Those 333 Cubits,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:51941:202"/>
where the first steps began: if those were 12, as Some say: Then 333 by 12 (as the Full Moons, and Changes in every Year,) want onely 4 of 4000.</p>
            <p>But the 12 are but Half Cubits, or 6 Wholes; and 333 by 6, make 1998, which want but two, of 2000. And <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi> an Eye-witness, reckons 14 steps, of Half Cubits; or 7 whole; which may be more sutable, to all we saw before, of 7 and 14. And so 333, by 14 Halves, or 7 wholes, are just, 3 times 666, and an Half: or 2331. Which in Hours, bring us into the 98th Day: and 98 Daies, make just 3 Months, and an Half: So that This, may be the 3 <hi>Moeds,</hi> and Half, for the <hi>Witnesses.</hi> If God so please, to help us reckon it.</p>
            <p>The rather also, because with All, we found, of 7 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; we saw it, the very first Number, that was made of 3 and an Half, in whole Numbers: and now, by these ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Measures, of the <hi>Temple-Courts,</hi> we are come to a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, made of 7, and of 3 and an Half: Which may contain the <hi>Fates</hi> (as they speak,) of the <hi>Jewish State or Church;</hi> or if you will, of <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Judah;</hi> or of <hi>Israel and Judah:</hi> that is indeed both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile:</hi> (For we saw before, that <hi>Ephraim</hi> must make the <hi>Fulness of the Gentiles:)</hi> Or what ever other two Witnesses we may finde, to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, by the <hi>Sun and Moons</hi> Times of 666. So that 3 of These, and an half, or 7 times 333; or 3 Months, or <hi>Moeds</hi> and Half; may bring us to the End of all the Numbers, yet fixed, in the Prophets, and the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the rather also, because we finde the <hi>Sun and Moons</hi> 333 and 666, so Signal in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (as the Sun to his <hi>Moon</hi> or <hi>Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We saw before, that <hi>Enoch</hi> lived just as many Years, as there are Daies in a Year: and that from Him, 666 Years, come very near the <hi>Flood;</hi> and that there wanted but 3 times 3, of 4 times 333, which is 1665, in 1656, the Year of the Flood. And from the <hi>Flood,</hi> as many years, as <hi>Enoch</hi> lived, bring us to the Promise; made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> near about 3 <hi>Moeds,</hi> of Gods fixing, before the <hi>Flood:</hi> for, Three times 120, make 360; 3 And an Half, make 420;
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:51941:203"/>
3 of these, 1260 in the <hi>Revelation:</hi> written 30 years after the <hi>Sack;</hi> or begining of <hi>Daniels</hi> 1290: which is just 3 times 430: 45 more, make up <hi>Daniels</hi> 1335. The very Number of his Fellow-Witnesses, or Princes; in Hebrew letters, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (1335) the Noble Princes: <hi>As</hi> the <hi>Fruitful Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> (as <hi>Jacob</hi> said to <hi>Joseph;)</hi> or coming from <hi>Perat,</hi> or <hi>Euphrates,</hi> found in <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 3. and <hi>Ester</hi> 1. 3. and 6. 9.</p>
            <p>1335, Are but 3 more than Twice 666, or 4 times 333; which come to the Evening <hi>Minha</hi> of the Passover, but want 3 Hours (which <hi>Daniel</hi> supplies,) to the End of the 14 th Day: the Day of the Lords <hi>Passover,</hi> and Passing away of Wrath; as the 2d Sabbath also; and 14 Days of the Woman for a Daughter: and the Moon returneth to them at the Poles, in 14 days: And <hi>Paul</hi> was freed from his storm, in the 14th day, &amp; went up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or Heaven, in the 14th Year. And <hi>Abrams Lot and Sodom</hi> were freed, in the 14th year: and <hi>Joseph</hi> was Born in the 14th year of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Freed in the 14th year of his Own Bondage. As <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in the 14th year of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> And 1335 is 35 within the 14th Hundred Year.</p>
            <p>Again, 1335, is but 45, above 1290; that is, 3 times 430. First from the <hi>Promise,</hi> to their coming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> 430, and 45 more, to <hi>Calebs</hi> settling in <hi>Canaan</hi> with <hi>Josuah</hi> (the two Witnesses;) as <hi>Jos.</hi> 14. 10. Twice more 430, or 860 (making up 1335,) bring us to the last Siege of <hi>Jerusalem in Zedekiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Daniel</hi> is a Captive, bemoaning those <hi>Desolations;</hi> as he often calleth them, in Chap. 9. 2. 17. 18. <hi>Perpetual Desolations,</hi> Psal. 73. 79. 80. Threatned (as before,) <hi>Levit.</hi> 26! And now, the <hi>Daily Sacrifice was taken away, and the Place of his Sanctuary, Thrown down;</hi> which was not so, or at least, so much, by <hi>Epiphanes:</hi> who Polluted it, but did not <hi>Throw it down;</hi> as now it was, by the <hi>Chaldeans;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the <hi>Romans.</hi> So that, <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh of Both These great <hi>Desolations,</hi> rather than that Little Short one by <hi>Antiochus:</hi> who yet might be a Type of the great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, or <hi>Antikeimenos;</hi> who was to defile and profane the Temple, Rather than cast it Down. As First the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> did, and Then the <hi>Romans;</hi> or the Jewes themselves,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:51941:203"/>
and their Factions; While the Roman Eagles and Armies, overflowed them also, with a <hi>Wing of Abominations, making desolate;</hi> as <hi>Daniel,</hi> and our Saviour speak of those Times.</p>
            <p>And yet, I suppose, the Days of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> might be Types, or Shadows of the Years of this Desolation also: Seeing besides the days specified in <hi>Daniel,</hi> the word for <hi>He stamped on them</hi> (the Stars of Heaven, as the <hi>Dragon</hi> did, against the Jewish Woman, or <hi>Jacobs</hi> Wife, with <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi> Crown of 12 Stars, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is above 1300, as his Numbers; First 1290, and then 1335.</p>
            <p>Yea, and 2300 Days, in the 8th Chapter; Though so many Natural days, of <hi>Evening and Morning,</hi> as the Phrase is; Yet must be <hi>shut up, or Sealed, for Many Dayes, or Years;</hi> as we saw before.</p>
            <p>This was in the Third year of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> and 31 years from <hi>Zedekiah:</hi> For, in 37th of <hi>Jeconiah, Evilmerodach</hi> was King; but reigned only Two years, in <hi>Berosus:</hi> So that the 3d of the next King, <hi>(Belshasher;)</hi> was but 31 years, from <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> Though 41; or 42, from <hi>Jeconiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daniel,</hi> is Then at <hi>Shushan</hi> (where our Temple Courts and Numbers doe begin:) And There, about the Midst of the sad Desolations both on <hi>Israel and Judah,</hi> He heareth One Saint asking of <hi>Palmoni,</hi> the <hi>Wonderful Numberer</hi> (as the <hi>Wonderful Councellor,</hi> Esay 9:) How long, the Vision of the <hi>Tamid, and Transgression shaming,</hi> or <hi>making desolate; to give both the Sanctuary and the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Beginning with This great Desolation, of the 70 years Captivity (in which He Then was;) and taking 31 years (of that Captivity, to the Time they were speaking;) out of 2331, the Number which we found before (of the Holy Courts, or 333, by 14 steps, or 7 whole days or Cubits;) there remaineth just 2300. As another Argument, we are not wholly out in pitching on That Number, as the Temple
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:51941:204"/>
measures lead us. As if those Holy Courts must be <hi>Trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Down,</hi> as many years, as there were steps, so multiplyed, on them. Which answer also to the 7 Days of the Week.</p>
            <p>And yet 2331 came short of 2400. As if all these Deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, should be shorter than the Hours of a Great Day: if we allow 100 Years for every Hour, which is not far from <hi>Moses</hi> reckoning, <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. Where the <hi>Day</hi> (as God also made it,) is distinct from <hi>Night,</hi> or <hi>Watches by Night.</hi> Yet if the whole Day, be but 1000 years; Then 2331, is as the Morning of the 3d Day: in which he will revive them; in <hi>Hoseah: After Two dayes;</hi> of which the Hebrew let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters make 666, as we saw before in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>The first 666, ended just, in the End of their Temple and City, by the <hi>Romans.</hi> That is, Twice 70, to <hi>Ezra,</hi> in the 7th of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> (as we saw before;) and 7 times 70, Thence, to our Saviours Death; and Half 70, Thence, to the year, in which it was Sacked. After a War of 3 Years and half; as answering to the 3 years and half, of Christs publick Preaching, after his Baptism: and his 3 Days and Half, from his Passover, to his Resurrection: or 3 Hours and Half, Eclips, and Suffering upon the Cross: As the 3 Days, or Years and Half, of the Witnesses in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> which we found also shadowed in the 3 days and half, of the two Witnesses, hidden by <hi>Rahab;</hi> or Those, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by <hi>Abraham,</hi> or by <hi>David,</hi> after <hi>Ziglag;</hi> and other things before.</p>
            <p>How the Flood came about 666 years after <hi>Enoch,</hi> we saw before. We may add <hi>Noah,</hi> born 666, after <hi>Mahaleel,</hi> and 666 before <hi>Eber,</hi> the Father of the Hebrews, and of Time, or <hi>Ever,</hi> as we saw before. 666 Years from the Flood, bring us to the Night of <hi>Israel in Aegypt,</hi> after <hi>Josephs</hi> Death: And as many, from the Promise, to <hi>Gideons</hi> famous Victory over <hi>Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, Zeba and Salmunna,</hi> so often spoken of, in Scripture.</p>
