            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue chosen a Text which is the sum of the Bible. For al Scri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pture runneth vpon Christ like the title of a booke, <note place="margin">Reu. 1. 8.</note> because Christ is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and the end of mans saluation, therefore hee is figured in the law, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde in the Prophets, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in the Gospell. Some places point to his Diuinity, some to his humanity, some to his kingdome, some to his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18042:4"/>
Priesthoode, some to his Prophecy, some to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, some to his birth, some to his life, some to his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, some to his passion, some to his resurrection; some to his Ascention, some to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, all point vnto the Sauiour like Iohn Baptiste, <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 29.</note> when hee sayde, <hi>This is the Lambe of God, which taketh away the sinnes of the world.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore learne Christ, and learne all. Now to teach vs how we shoulde heare, and how wee should loue, and how wee should feare, &amp; how we should beleeue, &amp; how we should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ, that we may know when wee haue learned him. The Apostle saith, <hi>Put ye on the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18042:4"/>
Lorde Iesus Christ:</hi> as though this worde did containe all our duties vnto Christ, <hi>To put him on,</hi> (which seemes to bee the leuell of this phrase, if you mark how it commeth in, for before Paul saith, <hi>Cast away the workes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">vers. 12.</note> 
               <hi>of darknes, and put on the Armour of light.</hi> Then hee nameth the workes of darkenes, which wee shoulde cast off: viz. gluttony, drunkennes, strife, enuy, cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, <note place="margin">vers. 13.</note> wantonnes, after hee nameth the armour of light, <note place="margin">vers. 14.</note> which we shoulde put on, and calleth it by the name of the giuer, <hi>The Lorde Iesus Christ.</hi> In sted of gluttony, and dronkennesse, and strife, and enuy, and chambering, and wantonnesse, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18042:5"/>
patches of the deuill, wherewith man clotheth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <note place="margin">Psal. 109. 18.</note> as with a garment. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle giueth him another gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which hee calleth <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> He doth not oppose ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to vice, as one would thinke when hee had said, Cast off gluttonie, he should haue said, Put on sobriety, when hee had said, Cast off wantonnes, hee shoulde haue saide, Put on continency, when he had said, Cast off enuy, hee should haue said, Put on loue, but in steade of all vertues, hee commendeth the example of Christ for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vertue, and opposeth it to euerie vice, as if he should say, Hee which thinketh onely to follow Christ, needeth not bee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18042:5"/>
lead by the hande from vertue to vertue, but his example will teach him what hee shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and what hee shal flee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then all preceptes in the world. Therefore this is the best thought in euery action for a man to think, what Christ would do, which was made not onely redemption and saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to saue vs, but wisedom and <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 30. Mat. 11. 29. Mar. 10. 21.</note> example to guide vs. Therfore he saith, <hi>Learne of mee, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low mee,</hi> as though we shoulde thinke before wee speake, whether hee woulde speake so, and consider before we doe whether hee woulde doe so, and doe all by his example as the scholler writeth by his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, or else we do not learne of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18042:6"/>
him, but of our selues, and then wee goe awry, like a childe which scribleth without a rule. If thou resoluest to speak &amp; doe no otherwise then Christ wold speake and doe himselfe, thou shalt bee sure to doe all thinges well, because thou followest a straight patterne. Therefore stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy what this meaneth. <hi>To put on Christ.</hi> It is a straunge speeche, <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 4.</note> and a straunge Garment, they which cannot tell like Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus, what Christ meaneth when he sayth, that we must be borne againe, cannot tell what Paul meaneth, when he sayth, <hi>Put on Christ:</hi> as if one man shoulde put on another. I think many heere may goe to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, as the Apostles went to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18042:6"/>
Christ, and aske, What is the <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 9. Gal. 3. 27.</note> parable? This phrase is read in none but Paul, which hath writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most of Iustification by Christ: &amp; therefore he vseth all phrases to expresse how wee should applye Christ vnto vs, and in no tearmes he hath she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed it more liuely then in thys phrase, <hi>Put on Christ.</hi> For it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth that Christe doeth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs like a Garment, and defende vs like an armoure. Hee hideth our vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 7.</note> with his righteousnesse, he couereth our disobedience with his obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, hee shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our death with his death, that the wrath of God cannot find vs, iudgement cannot spye vs, the curse cannot see vs, for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18042:7"/>
the garment which couereth &amp; hideth vs. But as Iaakob got <note place="margin">Gen. 37. 29.</note> the blessing in the name and apparell of Esau his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: so in the name and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of Christ our elder brother, we receiue the blessing, and are receued into fauour like Christ himselfe. For God saith not, This is my beloued Sonne which pleaseth mee, but <hi>In whome I am pleased:</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">Mar. 3. 17.</note> that not onely Christ pleaseth God, but we please God in Christ, <hi>For Christ is our head.</hi> Therefore as one looking in the face of a man, doth like <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 3. Ephe. 5. 23.</note> him straight, if he like his face: so God beholding vs in the face of Christ, doeth loue vs straight, because the face doth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18042:7"/>
please him: But Christ is not our head, vnles we be his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: Christ is not out Garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, vnles we put him on: as Christ did put on our garment, when he cloathed himselfe with our flesh, &amp; toke our infirmities, &amp; bore our curse: So we must put on his garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that is, his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, his merites, and his death, which is as strange a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture to vs, as our flesh was to him, &amp; much adoe we haue to <note place="margin">Reue. 3. 4.</note> put it on, &amp; when it is on, there is greate cunning to weare it cleanly &amp; comely, from soyling and renting that such a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous garment be not taken from <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 11.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18042:8"/>
because they weare it not: as those which will say when the Lord shal come to iudgement. <hi>We haue seene thee in our streetes,</hi>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18042:8"/>
not put him on: for thoughe they had seene his person, and hearde of his vertues, yet they had not faith to apply his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, his merits, his death and his righteousnesse vnto them, without which no man can put on Christ nor weare him. Faith is the hand which putteth him on. Faith taketh first his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes &amp; couereth hir vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, then she taketh his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and couereth hir dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, then she taketh his patience, &amp; couereth hir impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency, then shee taketh his temperance, and couereth hir intemperancy, then she taketh his continency, and couereth her incontinency, then she ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his constancy, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth her inconstancy, then shee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18042:9"/>
taketh his faith, &amp; couereth hir diffidence, then she taketh his humility, and couereth her pride, then she taketh his loue, and couereth her rancor. And so taketh one roabe after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and tricketh her selfe vntil she haue put on Iesus Christe, that is, vntill she appeare in the sight of God, like Iesus Christ, clothed with his merits &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: that God hath no power to be angrie with her, because she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth so like his Sonne. This is to put on Iesus Christ, as you shal see more liuely, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue taken a view of the garment, for we are to speak of Christ the Garment, &amp; of our putting it on. There bee many fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of apparell, but they are too light, or too heauy, or too

sad, or too course, or too stale, and all weare out. At last the Apostle founde a fashion, that surpasseth them all: it is neuer out of fashion, meete for all seasons, fitte for all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and such a profitable weed, that the more it is worn, the fresher it is. What fashion haue you seene comparable to this? Is it not like the clothes of Dauids ambassadors, which <note place="margin">2.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18042:13"/>
before the serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t came: so if we put on Christ, wee are clothed with his obedience, wherby our wickednesse is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered: we are clothed with his merits, whereby our sinnes are forgiuen: we are clothed with his death, whereby our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is released: wee are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with his spirite, whereby our heartes are mollified and sanctified, and renued till wee resemble Christ himselfe. This is the Apostles meaning, to put on Christ, as it is vnfolded in <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12. Where hee brigns <note place="margin">Col. 3. 12.</note> forth all the robes of Christ, and sortes them, &amp; saith, put on mercy, put on meeknes, put on <note place="margin">vers. 30.</note> humilitie, put on patience, put on loue, all which before hee

called <hi>the new man.</hi> So that to put on Christ, is to put on the new man with all his vertues, vntill wee be renued to the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Christ, which is like a new man amongst men. They which labour to bee righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and yet belieue that Christes righteousnesse shall saue them, haue put on Christ as Paule woulde haue them. Wee are not taught to put on Aungels, nor Saintes, nor the virgin Mary, nor Paule himself to couer our sinnes with their righteousnesse, as the Papistes doe, but wee are commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to put on Christ, &amp; couer our sinnes with his riygteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The body hath many Garments, but the soule hath
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18042:14"/>
one Garment. Euery cloute will couer our sores, but the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest silke will not couer our sinnes. Therfore when we seem braue to others, wee seeme foule to God, because his eie is vppon our sinnes, which lye naked, when all the rest is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, vntill we put on Christ, and then wee heare that voice, <hi>Thy sinnes are couered.</hi> And then <note place="margin">Math. 9. 2. Psal. 32. 1.</note> we haue that blessing: <hi>Blessed is the man whose sinne is couered.</hi> So wee are clothed and blessed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Yet this Garment is out of request, too roughe for some, too graue for others, too base for others. And therefore in steade of putting on Christ, they put him off, in sted of wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming him, they discharge
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18042:14"/>
him, like the Gadarens, that <note place="margin">Luk. 8. 37: Math. 8. 34.</note> they may keepe theyr swine, that is, their beastly pleasures, which hee would cast into the <note place="margin">Math. 27. 35.</note> sea: These are like the foolish souldiours which shoulde haue made Christ their Garment, and they cast lots vpon his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and diuided them, and so spoiled them. So doe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists deale with this Garment, they say it is not fit for them, &amp; therefore they break it &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle it, and peece it with rags of their owne inuentions: they say it is too light, and not able to beare off the stormes of death, and heate of hell, and therefore choose rather to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues Garmentes of theyr me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, and theyr masses, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18042:15"/>
their penance, and their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, and their pilgrimages: like Adam and Eue, which made them selues coats of fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaues, <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 7. and 21.</note> which God destroyed againe, to shew that when men haue patched al their leaues of masses, of pardons, of pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, and satisfactions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet they will not couer their nakednes, nor keep of the heate of Gods wrath, but are like the curtall skitrs of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids <note place="margin">2.

               <hi>vs righteousnesse:</hi> that is,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18042:16"/>
Christes righreousnesse, must bee our Garment, or else wee shall bee ashamed when our righteousnes doth not reache to couer our nakednesse, but stil some part will peepe bare vntil hee cast his righteousnesse vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it, and then all is couered. <note place="margin">Sam. 17. 40.</note> As Dauid needed no other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour against the Gyant, then a sling: so we need no other gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against sinne then Christ. There wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth nothing but this to put it on.</p>
            <p>Now let vs see howe to put this Garment on. Many sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble about it, like children which had neede of one to put on their clothes. Some put on Christ as a cloake, which han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vppon their shoulders, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18042:16"/>
couereth them when they goe abrode to be seene of men: they can cast on the cloke of holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; seeme for a while as holy as the best, but so soone as they come home, the cloake goeth of, and the man is as hee was, whose vizarde was better then his face. Thus hypocrites put on Christ, as many retaine vnto noble men, not to doe them any seruice, but to haue their countenance. Many put on Christ like a hat, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth off to euerie one which meetes them: so euery temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which meets the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, makes them forget what they hearde, what they promised, what they resolued, &amp; change their way, as though they had not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18042:17"/>
repented at all. So the common people like your selues, put on Christ, they are zealous so long as they are in the Church, and beate their breastes, and cast vp <note place="margin">Luke. 18. 11.</note> their eyes, like the Publican, when they heare a sentence which moues them, as though they wold do no more against that saying while they liue. But the next busines putteth all out of minde, till they come to the Church againe. Some put on Christ as a gloue, which coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth but the hand, so they put on the face of Christ, or the tong of Christ, but their hands worke, and their feete walke as they did before. So many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Religion put on Christ, which call but for disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18042:17"/>
and reformation, that they might get a name of zeale and sinceritie, to couer some fault, which they would not be suspected of. Thus euerie man woulde couer himselfe with Christe, but they haue not the skill, or they haue not the will to put him on. What will you doe then? Though the Garment be neuer so good yet it is not good to them that do not weare it. For what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite haue wee of the garmentes which wee neuer weare, they neither keepe vs from heat nor colde. Therefore Paul doth not bring you a Garment to laye by you for the mothes, but he bids you put it on. Heere is the cunning now in putting it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18042:18"/>
on. If Paul had taught vs this, then you would hearken vnto him. Well, you shall heare what Paul saith to the putting of it on. First (saith Paul) you must <hi>cast away the workes of darkenes, und then put on the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of light.</hi> First you must <note place="margin">vers. 12.</note> put off, and then put on: As the Eagles feathers will not lie with any other feathers, but consume them, which lie with them: So the Wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will not weare with fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy garmentes, but scornes like the Arke, that Dagon shoulde stand by it. If any man may <note place="margin">1. Sam. 5. 8.</note> not weare womens apparel for lightnesse, may hee weare the <note place="margin">Deut. 22. 5.</note> diuells apparell, and cloath himselfe with pride, with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueteousnes,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18042:18"/>
with enuy, with hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, with vncleannes, and when he is like the diuell sit at Gods table? No man saith <note place="margin">Mat. 2. 21.</note> Christ, patcheth a new peece to an olde garment, &amp; wilt thou patch an olde peece to a newe <note place="margin">Leuit. 19. 19.</note> garment? God forbad his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to weare linsey wolsey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was a sign of inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but this is inconstancy it selfe. Hee doeth not put on <note place="margin">Reu: 3. 15. Ioh. 19. 23.</note> Christ, but putteth off Christ, and putteth on Belial, which fashions himselfe to God and the worlde too. As Christs coat was without seame, so they must bee without staine, that weare it. For when a man put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on faire clothes, hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himselfe faire too, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoideth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18042:19"/>
euery foule thing, least it should foule his clothes: So must hee which putteth on Christ, for the finest garment is soonest stayned. Therefore when thou hast put on this Garment, thou must washe thy selfe, and pick thy way, and choose thy workes, and handle nothing that is foule for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thy clothes, that is, thou must not thinke as thou didst, nor speake as thou diddest, nor liue as thou didst, but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thou hast changed thy maister, and serue him with whom thou art bound. For if God &amp; the diuell could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree <note place="margin">Iud. 9.</note> vpon Moses body, for one to haue one part, and the other another part, but God would
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18042:19"/>
haue all. Much lesse will God agree that the diuel shuld haue part of the soule, which would not yeeld him part of the body. Thus haue you hearde what you must put off: nowe heare how Christ must bee put on. As the Angel taught Iohn to <note place="margin">Reu. 10. 9.</note> reade the booke when hee bad him eate it: So we must put on Christ, as if wee did eate him, not as the Papists doe in their Masse, but as the meate is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the substance of the body, and goeth through eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of man: So Christ &amp; his worde should goe from part to part, from eare to heart, from heart to mouth, from mouth to hand, till wee be of one nature with them, that they bee the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18042:20"/>
very substance of our thoughts &amp; speeches, and actions, as the meate is of our bodies. This is to eate Christ and his word, or els wee doe not eate them, but chew them, and when our tast is satisfied, spue them out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Thus wee must put on Christ, for the word signifyeth so to put him on, as if thou wouldest put him in, that hee <note place="margin">Ephe. 3. 30.</note> may bee one with thee, and thou with him, as it were in a body toherher. As hee hath put on all our infirmities, so we must put on all his graces, not halfe on, but all on, and claspe him to vs, and girde him about vs, and weare him euen as wee weare our skinne, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way about vs. Then there shall
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18042:20"/>
be no neede of wiers, nor curls, nor periwigges, the husbandes shall not force to racke theyr rentes nor inhance their fines, nor sell their landes, to decke <note place="margin">2. King. 2. 13.</note> their wiues. But as the poore mantle of Eliah seemed better to Elisha then all the robes of Salomon, so the wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall seeme better then all the flants of vanity, and put euery fashion out of fashion, which is not modest and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like it selfe. If you will knowe farther howe to put on Christ, you shall see how your text will Catechise you (in three names of God) Lorde, Iesus, Christ. The Apostle seemeth to spell out the way vnto vs, how wee should wear this garment. First
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18042:21"/>
we must put him on as Lorde, then we must put him on as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus: Lastly, we must put him on as Christ. Thou must put him on as Lord, that is, thy ruler to command thee, and thy Tutor to gouerne thee, thy maister to direct thee, thou must bee no mans seruant but his, take no <note place="margin">Act. 4. 19.</note> mans part against him, but say with the Apostle, <hi>Whether is it meete to obey God or you?</hi> Thou must put him on as Iesus, that is, thy Sauiour, in whom thou trustest, thy protector on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou dependest, thy redeemer in whom thou belieuest. Thou must not looke for thy saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Iosua hath the likê name, but not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God nor to that end.</note> from Angell, nor Saint, nor any thing beside him. For the name of Iesus signifyeth a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18042:21"/>
and is giuen to none but him, and he is not onely called the Sauiour, but the saluation, in the song of Simeon, to shew <note place="margin">Luke. 1. 69.</note> that hee is the onely Sauiour, for there may bee many Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, <note place="margin">Iud. 3. 9.</note> but there can bee but one saluation: as there may bee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tortures, and yet but one death. Therefore when hee is called the saluation, it imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there is no Sauiour beside him. Thou must put him on as Christe, that is, a Kinge to rule, a Prophet to <note place="margin">Luke. 3. 33</note> teach, a Priest to praye, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and pacify the wrath of <note place="margin">Act. 3. 22.</note> God for thee. For this name <note place="margin">Heb. 8. 3,</note> Christ doth signifye that hee <note place="margin">Mat. 1. 16.</note> was annointed a King, a Priest and a Prophet: for man, a king <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 8.</note>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:18042:22"/>
to rule him, a Priest to offer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for him, a Prophet to teach him, so that hee putteth on Christ as Lord, which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipeth none but him. He put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on Christ as Iesus which beleeueth in none but him, and hee putteth on Christ as Christ which worshippeth none but <note place="margin">Cal. 3. 27.</note> him, beleeueth in none but him and heareth none but him. You put on Christe first, when you are baptised: then you were sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and consecrated to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: so soone as you came into the worlde, you vowed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the worlde, and follow God: howe many haue put on Christ so, and since haue put him off againe, which haue broken the first promise that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18042:22"/>
they made, &amp; were neuer <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 3.</note> faithfull to God since. You put on Christ againe, when you are called and sanctifyed, that is, <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 22.</note> when you cast off the old man, which is corrupt with the lusts of the flesh, the pride of life, &amp; the cares of this world, and put on the new man, which is rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate in righteousnes &amp; holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to the image of Christ, or likenes of Adam in his innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for to put on the new man, is to become a new man, as if thou were borne againe and conceiued of the holy Ghost. <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 2. Iob. 29. 14.</note> Of this Iob speaketh when hee sayth, <hi>I put on iustice, and it coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth mee.</hi> You put on Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, when you receiue his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">1.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18042:23"/>
of his body and bloud, that is, the merits of his obedience &amp; passion by faith, which heareth him, as if hee did see him, and seeth him, as if shee did feele him, and feeleth him, as if shee did tast him, and tasteth him as if she did digest him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ is become yours, and dwelleth in you, and feedeth you with his grace to eternall life, as the bread and wine sustaineth the life present, Lastly, when you haue put on Christe in these three sortes, which is your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this world, after you <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 21. 1.

Thus haue you hearde what is meant by putting on Christ, first to cloth our selues with righteousnes and holines like Christ, and then because our owne righteousnesse is too short to couer our armes, and legges, and thighs of sinne, but still some bare place will peere out and shame vs in the sight of God: therefore we must bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Christs garments, as Iacob <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 15.</note> did his brothers, and couer our selues with his righteousnesse, that is, beleeue that his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes shall supplie our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnes, and his sufferings shall stand for our sufferings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee came to fulfill the lawe, and beare the curse, &amp; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his Father for vs, that all
