         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>He that would clear himſelf from any Charge, muſt be ſure to take into his Anſwer the Matter of that Charge, or he ſhuffles with his Adverſary, and maketh no allowable Defence for himſelf.

               <p>I charged him at the Entrance into my former Book, with having anſwer'd his own knottieſt Queſtions in our Name, with the moſt weak and impertinent Returns he could well invent; and in many Pages there was not ſo much as a Quotation to be ſeen (a Practice to be det<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Next I charged him with having given ſome Anſwers, we could acknowledge ours, joyned to their proper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereas the Queſtion was not, whether Murder was a Sin; but whether the <hi>Jews</hi> thought <hi>that</hi> Murder, by the Scripture: if they did, give us an Inſtance; if they did not, then I have the End of my Alluſion, to wit, If the Scriptures are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſufficient in <hi>T. H</hi>'s Account, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> were not convinced by them of Murder; neither ought the Light within to be reputed inſufficient, becauſe Men were not convinced of their Unbelief in Chriſt by it. I will anſwer him in ſetting down his own Words to me:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36351:18"/>
                  <hi>O Impious Man!</hi> ſayes he: <hi>The Defect was not in the Scriptures, but in themſelves, in not attending what was therein delivered, wherein Murder is peremptorily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</hi> Right; But, <hi>O Impious Man!</hi> ſay I, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was not in the Light, but themſelves, in not atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, whereby Murder is alſo forbidden. How much more ſufficient now, <hi>T. H.</hi> is the Scripture then the Light? Vain Shuffler!</p>
               <p>But this is not all his Perverſion; for he further infers in my Name, <hi>That the Scriptures did rather countenance and juſtifie, then condemn them in that Fact,</hi> Dial. 3. p. 13. Which, <hi>Reader,</hi> in plain Terms, is as much as to ſay, becauſe the Scriptures do not <hi>ſo effectually</hi> diſcover evil Conceptions as the <hi>Light within</hi>; therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>rather countenance and juſtifie them</hi>: Monſtrous Baſeneſs! The Truth is, were his Endeavours againſt us but well weighed of all that ſee them, there were lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle need of our Labour in his Diſcovery, or our own Defence. But that which aggravates his Sin, is the hard Words he gives me after all; I know not why, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to cover his own Guilt, or make his credulous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der think me as hateful as he would have me.</p>

Why then did ſacred Penmen give ſuch full Account thereof?</hi> As if it were one and the ſame Thing for me to ſay, the Penning of that Hiſtory is to <hi>No</hi> Purpoſe, and to ſay, <hi>It is not to</hi> T.

Is this the Way to prove the Inſufficiency of the Light within, that ſends all People to the Light within for a ſufficient Account, which ſayes Dr. <hi>Henry Moor</hi> of <hi>Cambridge, ſpoke in and reproved</hi> Adam <hi>for his Lapſe from God,</hi> Philoſoph.

               <p>However it be, this lies at <hi>T H</hi>'s Door, that becauſe I ſaid, his Inſtance of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Writing <hi>was nothing to his Purpoſe,</hi> he makes me to conclude, <hi>They were writ

                  <p>Very well; Thou haſt granted, <hi>that in the Word was Life, and that Life the Light of men,</hi> as Joh. 1.4. on which I grounded my Argument; and that the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> there mentioned, are one with the <hi>Word</hi> (or of its own Being) conſequently <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>ſufficient to Salvation.</hi> But that ſuch a Concluſion reacheth not the Terms of the Queſtion, to wit, the <hi>Common Light in Men</hi>; which thou denyeſt to be one with the <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> and therefore Inſufficient to Salvation. Upon this I thus argue; for the bringing of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie to an Iſſue.</p>
                  <p>If the Light of men, <hi>John</hi> 1.4. be the Light of <hi>All</hi> men, then is it a Light <hi>common</hi> to all men. Thou muſt deny one of theſe two, either that Light of Men is the Light of all Men; or, that the Light of <hi>All</hi> men is <hi>common</hi> to all men; The latter I ſhould think in

Tenderneſs and ſober Enquiry, I ſhall endeavour to take away all Occaſion of Stumbling, by this ſhort and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſrious Account of our Belief.</p>
                  <p>'Tis granted, that Chriſt, who is God over all, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever, is a <hi>diſtinct</hi> Being (though not <hi>at a Diſtance</hi>) from the Saints; Otherwiſe, it would be all one indeed to ay, as thou, <hi>T. H.</hi> wickedly concludeſt, p. 30. from thy own Invention of Man's being the Seed, which is God, that it is all one, whether we call <hi>God</hi> by the Name of <hi>W. Penn</hi> or call <hi>W. Penn God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi>; a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Abſurdity indeed, as thou ſayeth! But then, what art thou that madeſt it? Next, we never ſaid, that Chriſt was not as well <hi>without</hi> us, as <hi>within</hi> us; for we cannot comprehend him, but are comprehended of him: We never ſet any Limitations to Chriſt's Preſence; they are the falſe and hateful Inferences of our Enemies; And let the Reader beware, that he be not abuſed by them. For the Word <hi>Perſon</hi> (as thou uſeſt it, in telling us of <hi>Chriſt, God-man,</hi> a diſtinct Perſon without thee) it is no Scripture-Phraſe; for in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>We do receive and believe the <hi>Scriptures</hi> given forth by Holy Men of God, as they were moved of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>and that they are profitable for Doctrine, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, and for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs</hi>; yet ſince they are Writings relating to the things of God, no man can

                  <p>Further, The New Covenant Times are Times of Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Scriptures, by the pouring out of the Spirit, therefore Peoples regard ſhould be to the inward Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Leadings of the Holy Spirit. The <hi>Law</hi> outward was <hi>a Rule</hi> to the <hi>Jew,</hi> though not eminently unto them (for the Lord gave them alſo of his good Spirit; &amp; what for, if not to rule them?) But the <hi>Law of the Spirit of Life</hi> promiſed to be reveal'd within, under the New &amp; Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, was certainly to be the <hi>Rule</hi> under that Covenant, being a time for the more immediate Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forth of Spirit and Life. We do not ſay that every one hath hereunto attained: But we affirm, that God hath given a meaſure of his Spirit unto Men &amp; Women, that they might receive the pretious Promiſes, unto w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we direct them for that End.

                  <p>Nor is it to be doubted, but that <hi>Paul</hi> and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> lived up to the outward Law (that is the inward Law outwarly declared) by the Law of the Spirit of Life, which was the Rule of their Obedience: Yet can any infer, that the outward Law and not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was the <hi>Rule</hi> of their ſo living?

the Name, and not into the Nature of the Spirit</hi>? Can a Man baptize into Spirit and into Life, <hi>without Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Life</hi>? God did convert, reconcile, baptize, beget and build up Thouſands to himſelf by them; unto whom the VVord of Reconciliation was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and who were Embaſſadors in Chriſt's ſtead. Now, as for <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> what <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I may ſay of his Commiſſion, It was not behind any of the reſt; yet he denies <hi>Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> to be any Part of it, and is as plainly rejected of him, in Point of Inſtitution, as any Thing in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So that either <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> is none of Chriſt's Inſtitutions; or elſe <hi>Paul</hi> had no Commiſſion to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Chriſt's Inſtitutions, which were ſtrange. <hi>T.

How canſt thou tell, whether a man uſing Chriſt's Words to <hi>Peter,</hi> to a loving Diſſwader of him from Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that onely intends his Good, is well or ill done? The Scripture is no Rule for our diſcerning aright

this caſe; nor is it his Duty, in caſe he be in the right, becauſe Chriſt's words are there recorded, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be thereto prompted, of the ſame Power: Yet if he ſay ſo, and be reproved by any; 'tis and muſt be granted that there is an Example which ſhuts the Mouthes, or ſhould do, of all who reſpect the Scripture; which is our caſe with thee. Well, but Chriſt had no Provocation by <hi>Peter</hi>'s words, but the Spirit that lurkt in them, which ſavour'd not the Work of God then doing; To reliſh the like caſe aright there muſt be the ſame Spirit; which <hi>T.

Well, <hi>T. Hicks</hi>! God will plead our Cauſe againſt the Malignity of thy Slanderous Spirit: No Juſtice, no Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could ever have led thee to this monſtrous pitch of Abuſe: thou ſheweſt how glad thou art to bedirt us, by making other Folks <hi>Lyes</hi> thy <hi>Charges,</hi> and then inſiſting on them with as much Confidence, as if thou wert infallibly aſſured of every jot. But we have ſome cauſe to ſuſpect thee more then ever; thy Tale wears ſo many Dreſſes: One while it is, <hi>Thou mayſt burn thy Bible, and write as good an one thy ſelf,</hi> Contin. p. 5. Another while, <hi>We may burn our Bible, and make as good an one our ſelf,</hi> Dial. 3. pag. 3. And laſt of all, it is to go thus, <hi>If the Bible were burnt, as good an one might be writ,</hi> ibid. p. 86. Now, T. H. anſwer; thou that pretendeſt to ſuch punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, which of theſe are we to take? The <hi>firſt</hi> is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:36351:60"/>
unlikely, becauſe what ever we think we could do, to be ſure thou canſt not think that a <hi>Quaker</hi> ſhould have ſo good an Opinion of an <hi>Anabaptiſt Woman, as that ſhe could write another Bible as good as this,</hi> that we are ſure underſtands not this. If we muſt take thee in thy <hi>ſecond</hi> Account, then the Woman is out in her firſt Story: If in the <hi>laſt</hi> Relation of this <hi>Fiction,</hi> then it concerns the <hi>Quakers</hi> no more then the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> For ſuppoſe the World were under one Emperor, and he ſo <hi>impious</hi> as to enjoyn the burning of all the Bibles, and all were burnt; I hope they are not ſo <hi>irreligious</hi> as to limit God's Power, who is Almighty, that he could not furniſh us with one as good as this, eſpecially, ſince <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would elſe, as you muſt hold be without a Rule: for I would have thee take notice <hi>T. H.</hi> that thou haſt ſo materially varied in thy Charge, that now it is not, whether, if the Bible were burnt, any Man could make as good an one; but whether if it were by ſuch Impiety burnt, <hi>as good an one might not be writ,</hi> which words are general. Here, T. H. to give the—his due, thou haſt helpt thy <hi>Fiend Quaker,</hi> by bringing him in, ſaying, what T. H. unleſs he would queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God's Omnipotency, dare not deny.</p>
               <p>But to conclude, either theſe Miſtakes proceed from the firſt Authors, or from T. H. If from the <hi>firſt Authors,</hi> why ſhould they be credited at all, who ſhow ſuch incertainty? if from <hi>T.

            <p>WE expect to hear what the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> in and about <hi>London</hi> will ſay (as being <hi>appeal'd to</hi>) concerning their Brother <hi>Thomas Hick</hi>'s Proceeding in his <hi>Three Dialogues,</hi> and whether they approve thereof, or of ſuch <hi>Play-Books,</hi> or <hi>Romances about Religion,</hi> yea or nay; for they are highly concerned to give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to be plain to the World herein, <hi>as they tender the Glory of God, and Reputation of Religion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>NOw, if you the Teachers and Elders, &amp;c. among the <hi>Baptized People,</hi> do not publickly clear your ſelves of <hi>Thomas Hicks,</hi> and theſe his unjuſt Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt us; and hereafter he further perſiſts therein. VVe may take it for granted, that you own his VVork; and may juſtly deal with him, and purſue him, not only as <hi>Tho. Hicks,</hi> but as the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> great Champion, peculiar Agent, or Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative. But if you ingenuouſly clear your ſelves of him and his Corrupt, Perverſe VVork, then his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Miſcarriages will be chargeable only upon <hi>T. Hicks</hi> himſelf, and you will appear to the VVorld, ſo far clear thereof; and approve your ſelves the more honeſt and ſincere towards, God, Truth and Religion.</p>
