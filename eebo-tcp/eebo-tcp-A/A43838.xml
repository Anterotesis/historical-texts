            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103392:3"/>
and to the Weſtward of the Meridian of <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> three hundred thirty and one Leagues. This Evening and the Night following we lay off and on: <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 27th inſtant, in the morning, we ſtood in with the Land, and coaſted the Shoar to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Ankering at Nights, and ſending our Boat out a Mornings, till we came into the lat. of 31 deg. but found no good harbour that way. On <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 30th inſtant, we tacked, and ſtood North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: and on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the ſecond of <hi>September,</hi> we came to an Anchor in five fathoms at the mouth of a very large opening of three Leagues wide, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, in the lat. of 32 deg. 30 min. and ſent our Boat to ſound the Channel. On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the third, we entered the Harbour, and found that it was the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> and was but four Leagues or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts N. E. from <hi>Port Royal,</hi> which by the <hi>Spanyards</hi> is called St. <hi>Ellens:</hi> within Land, both Rivers meet in one. We ſpent ſome time to ſound the Chanels both without and within, and to ſearch the Rivers in ſeveral branches, and to view the Land. On <hi>Saturday</hi> the fifth of <hi>September,</hi> two <hi>Indians</hi> came on Board us from the N. E. ſhoar, whom we entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courteouſly, and afterwards ſet them on ſhoar. On <hi>Sunday</hi> the ſixth, ſeveral <hi>Indians</hi> came on Board us, and ſaid they were of St. <hi>Ellens;</hi> being very bold and familiar; ſpeaking many <hi>Spaniſh</hi> words, as, <hi>Cappitan, Commarado,</hi> and <hi>Adues.</hi> They know the uſe of Guns, and are as little ſtartled at the firing of a Peece of Ordnance, as he that hath been uſed to them many years: they told us the neareſt <hi>Spanyards</hi> were at St. <hi>Auguſtins,</hi> and ſeveral of them had been there, which as they ſaid was but ten days journey; and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103392:3"/>
that the <hi>Spanyards</hi> uſed to come to them at Saint <hi>Ellens,</hi> ſometimes in Canoa's within Land, at other times in ſmall Veſſels by Sea, which the <hi>Indians</hi> deſcribe to have but two Maſts. They invited us to come to St. <hi>Ellens</hi> with our Ship, which they told us we might do within Land. <hi>Munday</hi> the 14 <hi>September,</hi> our Long-Boat went with twelve hands within Land to St. <hi>Ellens.</hi> On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 16th, came five <hi>Indians</hi> on board us; one of them pointing to another, ſaid, he was the Grandy Captain of <hi>Ediſtow:</hi> whereupon we took eſpecial notice of him, and entertained him accordingly, giving him ſeveral Beads, &amp; other trade that pleaſed him well: He invited us to bring up our Ship into a branch on the N. E. ſide, and told us of one Captain <hi>Franciſco,</hi> and four more Engliſh that were in his cuſtody on ſhoar; whereupon we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſtore of all Trade, as Beads, Hoes, Hatchets and Bills, &amp;c. and ſaid, he ſhould have all thoſe things if he would bring the Engliſh on board us; which he promiſed ſhould be done the next day. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we wrote a few lines to the ſaid <hi>Engliſh,</hi> fearing it to be a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> deluſion to entrap us. In the dark of the ſame Evening came a Canoa with nine or ten <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> in her with their Bowes and Arrows, and were cloſe on board before we did diſcern them: We ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, but they made us no anſwer, which increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our jealouſie: So we commanded them on board, and diſarmed them, detaining two of them priſoners, and ſending away the reſt to fetch the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> which if they brought, they ſhould have theirs again. At length they delivered us a Note written with a coal, which ſeemed the more to continue our jealouſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in all this time we had no news of our long-boat
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103392:4"/>
from St. <hi>Ellens,</hi> which we feared was ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Spanyards.</hi> But to ſatisfie us that there were <hi>Engliſh</hi> on ſhoar, they ſent us one man on board about twelve of the clock in the Night who related to us the truth of the matter, and told us they were caſt away ſome four or five leagues to the North-ward of the place we then rode, on the 24th of <hi>July</hi> paſt, being thirteen perſons that came on ſhoar, whereof three of them were kill'd by the <hi>Indians.</hi> On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 17th of <hi>September</hi> the Long-boat returned from St. <hi>Ellens,</hi> which preſently we ſent on ſhoar to fetch the other <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> delivering us three more; and coming abroad them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, we delivered them their two men. Then we demanded of the chief Commander where the reſt of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> were: he anſwered, Five were carried to St. <hi>Ellens,</hi> three were killed by the <hi>Stonohs,</hi> and the other man we ſhould have within two dayes. We replyed to him again, That we would keep him and two more of his chief men, till we had our <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were yet living; and promiſed them their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, with ſatisfaction for bringing us the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Now to return to the buſineſſe of our Deſign; the entertainment we had at S. <hi>Ellens</hi> put us in great fear of the <hi>Indians</hi> treachery; for we obſerved their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual gathering together, and at laſt began with ſtern-look'd countenances to ſpeak roughly to us, and came to ſearch our mens Bandileers and Pockets; yet inviting us to ſtay that night with them: but we made a ſudden retreat to our Boat, which cauſed the <hi>Indian</hi> King to be in a great rage, ſpeaking loud and angry to his men; the drift of which diſcourſe we underſtood not. That which we noted there, was a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103392:4"/>
fair houſe builded in the ſhape of a Dove-houſe, round, two hundred foot at leaſt, compleatly cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Palmeta</hi>-leaves, the wal-plate being twelve foot high, or thereabouts, &amp; within lodging Rooms and Forms; two pillars at the entrance of a high Seat above all the reſt: Alſo another houſe like a Sentinel-houſe, floored ten foot high with planks, faſtned with Spikes and Nayls, ſtanding upon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Poſts, with ſeveral other ſmall houſes round about. Alſo we ſaw many planks, to the quantity of three thouſand foot or thereabouts, with other Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſquared, and a Croſs before the great houſe. Likewiſe we ſaw the Ruines of an old Fort, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing more than half an acre of land within the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which we ſuppoſed to be <hi>Charls</hi>'s Fort, built, and ſo called by the <hi>French</hi> in 1562, &amp;c. On <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, September</hi> 21. one Engliſh youth was brought from St. <hi>Ellens</hi> aboard us by an <hi>Indian,</hi> who inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us that there were four more of their company at St. <hi>Ellens,</hi> but he could not tell whether the <hi>Indians</hi> would let them come to us: For ſaith he, Our Men told me, that they had lately ſeen a Frier and two <hi>Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> more at St. <hi>Ellens,</hi> who told them they would ſend Soldiers ſuddenly to fetch them away. This day we ſayled up the River with our Ship to go through to St. <hi>Ellens.</hi> On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 22 inſtant, three <hi>Indians</hi> came on board; one of them we ſent with a Letter to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners there. On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 23d. we ſent out Boat and Men to ſound the Chanel, and finde out the moſt likely way to St. <hi>Ellens</hi> with our Ship by <hi>Combeheh.</hi> In the mean time came many Canoa's aboard us with Corn, Pumpions, and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon, Deer-skins, and a ſort of ſweet-wood. One
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103392:5"/>
of our men looking into an <hi>Indian</hi> basket, found a piece of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Rusk: it being new, we demanded of the <hi>Indian</hi> where he had it; who ſaid, Of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi> In the interim, while we were talking, came a Canoa with four <hi>Indians</hi> from St. <hi>Ellens,</hi> one ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and holding a paper in a cleft ſtick; they told us they had brought it from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain at St. <hi>Ellens.</hi> We demanded how many <hi>Spaniards</hi> were come thither; who ſaid, Seven, and one <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-man:</hi> We received their Letter writ in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> but none of us could read it: We detained two of the chiefeſt <hi>Indians,</hi> one of them being the Kings Son of S. <hi>Ellens,</hi> and that kept one of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other two we ſent away with a Letter to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> wherein we gave him to underſtand, that we underſtood not his letter; and told the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> when they brought the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they ſhould have their men again, with ſatisfaction for their pains. On <hi>Thurſday,</hi> 24 inſtant, we ſayling further up the River to go through, at laſt came to a place of freſh water, and Anchored there, ſending our Boat aſhoar with a Guard to get water. Towards night came the firſt <hi>Indian</hi> that we ſent to St. <hi>Ellens</hi> with a letter to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who brought us another letter from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and an Anſwer of ours from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> writ in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> letter. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſent us a quarter of Veniſon, and a quarter of Pork, with a Complement, That he was ſorry he had no more for us at that time. We returned him thanks, and ſent him a Jug of Brandy; and withal, that we were ſorry we underſtood not his letter. This night about twelve of the Clock we had a moſt violent guſt of winde, but of no long
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103392:5"/>
continuance. On <hi>Friday</hi> 25 <hi>September,</hi> we weighed, and returned down the River ſix leagues, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, becauſe we perceived the <hi>Indians</hi> had gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves in a Body from all parts thereabouts, and moved as the Ship did: and being informed by an <hi>Indian,</hi> that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would be there the next day; we took in Fire-wood, and continued there that night, at which time one of our <hi>Indian</hi> Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers made his eſcape by leaping over-board in the dark. On <hi>Saturday</hi> the 26. we weighed, and ſtood down to the Harbours mouth, and ſtayed there till <hi>Monday</hi> the 28. In all which time came no one to us, though we ſtay'd in expectation of their coming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; therefore put out to Sea, concluding their intentions not to be good. Being out of the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> we directed our courſe S. W. four leagues or thereabouts for <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> to ſound the Chanel without from the poynts of the Harbour outwards; for we had ſounded the Harbour within from the points inward when our Boat was at St. <hi>Ellens:</hi> And now being athwart the Harbours mouth, we ſent our Boat with the Mate and others, who found the N. E. and E. N. E. ſide of the opening of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> to be Sholes and Breakers to the middle of the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and three leagues or thereabouts into the Sea, from the ſide aforeſaid, is unſafe to meddle with: but the S. W. and W. ſide we found all bold ſteering in N. N. W. two or three miles from the S. W. ſhoar, ſayling directed with the S. W. head-land of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of <hi>Port-Royal:</hi> the ſaid head-land is bluft, and ſeems ſteep, as though the trees hung over the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But you muſt note, that if you keep ſo far from the S. W. ſide, that you ſtand in N. N. W. with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103392:6"/>
the bluft head aforeſaid, you ſhall go over the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skirt of the E. N. E. ſholing, and ſhall have but three or four fathom for the ſpace of one league or thereabouts, and then you ſhall have ſix and ſeven fathoms all the way in: But if you borrow more on the S. W. ſide, till you have brought the S. W. head of the Entry to bear N. N. E. you ſhall have a fair large Chanel of ſix, ſeven, and eight fathoms all the way in, and then five, ſix, ſeven and eight fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms within the Harbour, keeping the Chanel, and ſtanding over to the Northward: we ſuppoſed that it flows here as at the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> becauſe they are but four leagues aſunder, and flows S. E. and N. W. ſeven foot and half, and ſometimes eight foot perpendicular: the Mouth of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> lyes in 32 deg. 20 min. lat. Now as concerning the entrance of the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> lat. 32 deg. 30 min. or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, you ſhall ſee a range of Breakers right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the opening, two or three leagues off the S. W. Point; which you muſt leave to the Northward, and ſteer in with the ſaid S. W. Point, giving a range of Breakers that runs from the ſaid Point a ſmall birth, and you ſhall have two, three, and four fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms at low water; and when you come one mile from the Point aforeſaid, ſteer over directly to the N. E. Point, and you ſhall have ſix or ſeven fathom all the way. VVithin the <hi>N. W.</hi> Point is good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choring: you ſhall have five fathoms fair aboard the ſhoar: and you ſhall have five, ſix, ſeven, and eight fathoms, ſayling all along upon the River, ten leagues, and a large turning Chanel: It flows here <hi>S. E.</hi> and <hi>N. W.</hi> ſeven foot and a half, and eight foot at common Tydes. The River <hi>Grandy,</hi> or as the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:103392:6"/>
call it <hi>Ediſtow,</hi> lyes ſix leagues or thereabouts from the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> and ſeems to be a very fair o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening: but becauſe the chief <hi>Indian</hi> of that Place was on board us, and the Countrey all in Arms, we not knowing how the winde might croſſe us, it was not thought fit to ſtay there: But ſome of thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> that had lived there, being Priſoners, ſay, that it is a very fair and goodly River, branching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral branches, and deep, and is freſh water at low Tide within two leagues of the Mouth; it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us as we paſſed by, a good entrance large and wide, lat. 32 deg. 40 min. in or thereabouts. Now our underſtanding of the Land of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> River <hi>Jordan,</hi> River <hi>Grandie,</hi> or <hi>Ediſtow,</hi> is as followeth: The Lands are laden with large tall Oaks, VValnut and Bayes, except facing on the Sea, it is moſt Pines tall and good: The Land generally, except where the Pines grow, is a good Soyl, covered with black Mold, in ſome places a foot, in ſome places half a foot, and in other places leſſe, with Clay under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath mixed with Sand; and we think may produce any thing as well as moſt part of the Indies that we have ſeen. The <hi>Indians</hi> plant in the worſt Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot cut down the Timber in the beſt, and yet have plenty of Corn, Pumpions, Water-Mellons, Musk-mellons: although the Land be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-grown with weeds through their lazineſſe, yet they have two or three crops of Corn a year, as the <hi>Indians</hi> themſelves inform us. The Country abounds with Grapes, large Figs, and Peaches; the Woods with Deer, Conies, Turkeys, Quails, Curlues, Plovers, Teile, Herons; and as the <hi>Indians</hi> ſay, in Winter, with Swans, Geeſe, Cranes, Duck
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103392:7"/>
and Mallard, and innumerable of other water-Fowls, whoſe names we know not, which lie in the Rivers, Marſhes, and on the Sands: Oyſters in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, with great ſtore of Muſcles; A ſort of fair Crabs, and a round Shel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>fiſh called <hi>Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>feet;</hi> The Rivers ſtored plentifully with Fiſh that we ſaw play and leap. There are great Marſhes, but moſt as far as we ſaw little worth, except for a Root that grows in them the <hi>Indians</hi> make good Bread of. The Land we ſuppoſe is healthful; for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were caſt away on that Coaſt in <hi>July</hi> laſt, were there moſt part of that time of year that is ſickly in <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> and notwithſtanding hard uſage, and lying on the ground naked, yet had their perfect healths all the time. The Natives are very healthful; we ſaw many very Aged amongſt them. The Ayr is clear and ſweet, the Countrey very pleaſant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: And we could wiſh, that all they that want a happy ſettlement, of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, were well tranſported thither, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>FRom <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 29th of <hi>September,</hi> to <hi>Friday</hi> the ſecond of <hi>October,</hi> we ranged along the ſhoar from the lat. 32 deg. 20 min. to the lat. 33 deg. 11 min. but could diſcern no Entrance for our Ship, after we had paſſed to the Northwards of 32 deg. 40 min. On <hi>Saturday</hi> the third inſtant, a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtorm came up, the winde between the North and the Eaſt; which Eaſterly windes and fowl wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continued till <hi>Monday</hi> the 12th. By reaſon of which ſtorms and fowl weather, we were forced to get off to Sea to ſecure our ſelves and ſhip, and were horſed by reaſon of a ſtrong Current, almoſt to Cape <hi>Hatteraſſe</hi> in lat. 35 deg. 30 min. On <hi>Monday</hi> the 12th aforeſaid we came to an Anchor in ſeven fathom at <hi>Cape Fair-Road,</hi> and took the Meridian-Altitude of the Sun, and were in the lat. 33 deg. 43 min. the winde continuing ſtill Eaſterly, and fowl weather till <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 15th inſtant; and on <hi>Friday</hi> the 16th, the winde being at <hi>N.

On <hi>Saturday</hi> the 17th, we went down to the Cape to ſee the Engliſh Cattel, but could not finde them, though we rounded the Cape: And having an <hi>Indian</hi> Guide with us, here we rode till the 24th inſtant; the winde being againſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103392:8"/>
us, we could not go up the River with our Ship; in which time we went on ſhoar, and viewed the land of thoſe quarters. On <hi>Saturday</hi> we weighed, and ſayled up the River ſome four leagues or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts. <hi>Sunday</hi> the 25th, we weighed again, and tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the River, it being calm, and got up ſome fourteen leagues from the Harbours mouth, where we mored our Ship. On <hi>Monday</hi> the 26 <hi>October,</hi> we went down with the Yoal to <hi>Necoes,</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and viewed the Land there. On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 27th, we rowed up the main River with our long-Boat and twelve men, ſome ten leagues or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts. On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 28th, we rowed up about eight or nine leagues more. <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 29th was foul weather, of much rain and winde, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us to make Huts, and lye ſtill. <hi>Friday</hi> the 30th, we proceeded up the main River, ſeven or eight leagues. <hi>Saturday</hi> the 31, we got up three or four leagues more, and came to a Tree that lay athwart the River: but becauſe our Proviſions were neer ſpent, we proceeded no further, but returned down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the remainder of that day; and on <hi>Monday</hi> the ſecond of <hi>November,</hi> we came aboard our Ship. <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the third, we lay ſtill to refreſh ourſelves. On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 4th, we went five or ſix leagues up the River to ſearch a branch that ran out of the main River towards the <hi>N. W.</hi> In which branch we went up five or ſix leagues: not liking the Land, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned on board that night about midnight, and called that place <hi>Swampy-branch. Thurſday</hi> the fifth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, we ſtaid aboard; on <hi>Friday</hi> the 6th we went up <hi>Greens</hi> River, the mouth of it being againſt the place we rode with our Ship. On <hi>Saturday</hi> the 7th, we
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103392:8"/>
proceeded up the ſaid River ſome fourteen or fifteen leagues in all, and found that it ended in ſeveral ſmall branches; the Land for the moſt part being marſhy and ſwamps, we returned towards our ſhip, and got aboard in the night: <hi>Sunday</hi> the 8th inſtant we lay ſtill, and on <hi>Monday</hi> the 9th we went again up the main River, being well provided with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and all things neceſſary, and proceeded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards till <hi>Thurſday</hi> noon 12th inſtant, at which time we came to a place where two Iſlands were in the middle of the River, and by reaſon of the crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the <hi>River</hi> at that place, ſeveral Trees lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart both branches, which ſtopped up the paſſage of each branch, that we could proceed no further with our Boat; but we went up the River ſide by land ſome three or four miles, and found the River to enlarge it ſelf: So we returned, leaving it as far as we could ſee up a long reach running N. E. we judging our ſelves from the Rivers mouth North near fifty leagues; we returned, viewing the Land on both ſides the River, and found as good tracts of land, dry, well wooded, pleaſant and delightful as we have ſeen any where in the world, with great burthen of Graſſe on it, the land being very level, with ſteep banks on both ſides the River, and in ſome places very high, the woods ſtor'd with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Deer and Turkies every where; we never going on ſhoar, but ſaw of each alſo Partridges great ſtore, Cranes abundance, Comes, which we ſaw in ſeveral places; we heard ſeveral Wolves howling in the woods, and ſaw where they had torn a Deer in pieces. Alſo in the River we ſaw great ſtore of Ducks, T<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ile, VVidgeon, and in the woods great flocks of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103392:9"/>
Parrakeeto's; the Timber that the woods afford for the moſt part conſiſting of Oaks of four or five ſorts, all differing in leaves, but all bearing Akorns very good: we meaſured many of the Oaks in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which we found to be in bigneſſe ſome tvvo, ſome three, and others almoſt four fathoms; in height, before you come to boughs or limbs, forty, fifty, ſixty foot, and ſome more, and thoſe Oaks very common in the upper parts of both Rivers; Alſo a very tall large Tree of great bigneſſe, which ſome do call <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the right name we know not, growing in Swamps. Likewiſe Walnut, Birch, Beech, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Aſh, Bay, Willough, Alder and Holly; and in the lowermoſt parts innumerable of Pines, tall and good for boards or maſts, growing for the moſt part in barren ſandy ground, but in ſome places up the River in good ground, being mixed amongſt Oaks and other Timber. We ſaw ſeveral Mulberry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, multitudes of Grape-Vines, and ſome Grapes which we did eat of. VVe found a very large and good tract of Land on the N. W. ſide of the River, thin of Timber, except here and there a very great Oak, and full of Graſſe, commonly as high as a mans middle, and in many places to his ſhoulders, where we ſaw many Deer and Turkies; alſo one Deer with very large horns, and great in body, therefore called it <hi>Stag-Park<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> it being a very pleaſant and delightful place, we travelled in it ſeveral miles, but ſaw no end thereof. So we returned to our Boat, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded down the River, and came to another place ſome twenty five leagues from the Rivers mouth on the ſame ſide, where we found a place no leſſe delightful than the former<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as far as we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103392:9"/>
could judge, both Tracts came into one. This low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er place we called <hi>Rocky-point,</hi> becauſe we found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rocks and Stones of ſeveral bigneſſe upon the Land, which is not common. We ſent our Boat down the River before us; our ſelves travelling by Land many miles, were ſo much taken with the pleaſantneſſe of the Land, that travelling into the woods ſo far, we could not recover our Boat and company that night. On <hi>Sunday</hi> the morrow follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we got to our Boat, and on <hi>Monday</hi> the 16th of <hi>November,</hi> we proceeded down to a place on the Eaſt-ſide of the River ſome twenty three leagues from the Harbours mouth, which we call'd <hi>Turkie-Quarters,</hi> becauſe we killed ſeveral Turkies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. VVe viewed the Land there, and found ſome tracts of good Land, and high, facing upon the River about one mile inward, but backwards ſome two miles all Pine-land, but good paſture-ground: we returned to our Boat, and proceeded down ſome two or three leagues, where we had formerly view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and found it a tract of as good Land as any we have ſeen, with as good Timber on it. The banks of the River being high, therefore we called it <hi>High-Land Point.</hi> Having viewed that, we proceeded down the River, going on ſhoar in ſeveral places on both ſides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it being generally large Marſhes, and many of them dry, that they may more fitly be called Medows: the wood-land againſt them is for the moſt part Pine, and in ſome places as barren as ever we ſaw Land, but in other places good Paſture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ground, And on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 17th inſtant, we got aboard our Ship, riding againſt the mouth of <hi>Green</hi>'s River, where our men are providing wood, and fitting the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103392:10"/>
Ship for the Sea: In the interim, we took ſome view of the Land on both ſides of the River there, finding ſome good Land, but more bad, and the beſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to that above. <hi>Friday</hi> the 20th inſtant was foul weather, yet in the Afternoon we weighed, and went down the River ſome two leagues, and came to Anchor againſt the mouth of <hi>Hilton</hi>'s River, and took ſome view of the Land there on both ſides, which appeared to us much like unto that at <hi>Green</hi>'s River. <hi>Monday</hi> 23. we went with our Long-boat well victualled and manned up <hi>Hilton</hi>'s River; and when we came three leagues or thereabouts up the ſaid River, we found this and <hi>Green</hi>'s River to come into one, and ſo continued for four or five leagues, which cauſeth a great Iſland betwixt them. We proceeded ſtill up the River, till they parted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, keeping up <hi>Hilton</hi>'s River on the Lar-board ſide, and followed the ſaid River five or ſix leagues further, where we found another large branch of <hi>Green</hi>'s River to come into <hi>Hilton</hi>'s, which maketh another great Iſland. On the Star-board ſide going up, we proceeded ſtil up the River ſome four leagues, and returned, taking a view of the Land on both ſides, and now judge our ſelves to be from our ſhip ſome eighteen leagues <hi>W.</hi> and by <hi>W.</hi> One league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this place came four <hi>Indians</hi> in a Canoa to us, and ſold us ſeveral baskets of Akorns, which we ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for, and ſo left them; but one of them follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us on the ſhoar ſome two or three miles, till he came on the top of a high bank, facing on the <hi>River,</hi> we rowing underneath it, the ſaid <hi>Indian</hi> ſhot an Arrow at us, which miſſed one of our men very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, and ſtuck in the upper edge of the Boat, which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103392:10"/>
broke in pieces, leaving the head behind. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we preſently made to the ſhoar, and went all up the bank except four to guide the Boat; we ſearched for the <hi>Indian,</hi> but could not finde him: At laſt we heard ſome ſing further in the Woods, which we thought had been as a Chalenge to us to come and fight them. We went towards them with all ſpeed, but before we came in ſight of them, we heard two Guns go off from our Boat, whereupon we retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all ſpeed to ſecure our Boat and Men: when we came to them, we found all well, &amp; demanded the reaſon of their firing the Guns: they told us that an <hi>Indian</hi> came creeping on the Bank as they thought to ſhoot at them, therefore ſhot at him a great diſtance with Swan-ſhot, but thought they did him no hurt, for they ſaw him run way. Preſently after our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Boat, while we were thus talking, came two <hi>Indians</hi> to us with their Bows and Arrows, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Bonny, Bonny:</hi> we took their Bows and Arrows from them, and gave them Beads, to their content. Then we led them by the hand to the Boat, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them the Arrow-head ſticking in her ſide, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to them the buſineſſe; which when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, both of them manifeſted much ſorrow, and made us underſtand by ſignes, that they knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it: ſo we let them go, and marked a Tree on the top of the bank, calling the place <hi>Mount-Skerry.</hi> We looked up the River as far as we could diſcern, and ſaw that it widened it ſelf, and came running directly down the Countrey: So we return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and viewed the Land on both ſides the River, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the banks ſteep in ſome places, but very high in others. The banks ſides are generally Clay, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103392:11"/>
as ſome of our company doth affirm, ſome Marle. The Land and Timber up this River is no way inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the beſt in the other, which we call the main River: So far as we diſcovered, this ſeems as fair, if not fairer than the former, and we think runs further into the Countrey, becauſe there is a ſtrong Current comes down, and a great deal more drift-wood. But to return to the buſineſs of the Land and Timber: We ſaw ſeveral plats of Ground cleared by the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> after their weak manner, compaſſed round with great Timber-Trees; which they are no ways able to fall, and ſo keep the Sun from their Corn-fields very much; yet nevertheleſſe we ſaw as large Corn-ſtalks or bigger, than we have ſeen any where elſe: So we proceeded down the River, till we found the Canoa the <hi>Indian</hi> was in who ſhot at us. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we went on ſhoar, and cut the ſame in pieces: the <hi>Indians</hi> perceiving us coming towards them, run away. We went to his Hut, and pulled it down, brake his pots, platters, and ſpoons, tore his Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins and Mats in pieces, and took away a basket of Akorns: So we proceeded down the River two leagues, or thereabouts, and came to another place of <hi>Indians,</hi> bought Akorns and ſome Corn of them, and went downwards two leagues more: at laſt we eſpied an <hi>Indian</hi> peeping over a high bank: we held up a Gun at him; and calling to him, ſaid, <hi>Skerry:</hi> preſently ſeveral <hi>Indians</hi> appeared to us, making great ſignes of friendſhip, ſaying, <hi>Bonny, Bonny,</hi> and running before us, endeavouring to perſwade us to come on ſhoar; but we anſwered them with ſtern countenances, and ſaid, <hi>Skerry,</hi> taking up our guns, and threatning to ſhoot at them; but they cryed ſtill
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103392:11"/>
               <hi>Bonny, Bonny:</hi> And when they ſaw they could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, nor perſwade us to come on ſhoar, two of them came off to us in a Canoa, one padling with a great Cane, the other with his hand; they came to us, and laid hold of our Boat, ſweating and blowing, and told us it was <hi>Bonny</hi> on ſhoar, and at laſt perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us to go aſhoar with them. As ſoon as we land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeveral <hi>Indians,</hi> to the number of near forty luſty men, came to us, all in a great ſweat, and told us <hi>Bonny:</hi> we ſhewed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them the Arrow-head in the Boats-ſide, and a piece of the Canoa which we had cut in pieces: the chief man of them made a large Speech, and threw Beads into our Boat, which is a ſigne of great love and friendſhip; and made us to underſtand, when he heard of the Affront which we had received, it cauſed him to cry: and now he and his men were come to make peace with us, making ſignes to us that they would tye his Arms, and cut off his head that had done us that abuſe; and for a further teſtimony of their love and good will towards us, they preſented to us two very handſom propet young <hi>Indian</hi> women, the talleſt that we have ſeen in this Countrey; which we ſuppoſed to be the Kings Daughters, or perſons of ſome great account amongſt them. Theſe young women were ready to come into our Boat; one of them crouding in, was hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to go out again. We preſented to the King a Hatchet and ſeveral Beads, alſo Beads to the young women and to the chief men, and to the reſt of the <hi>Indians,</hi> as far as our Beads would go: they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us in four days to come on board our Ship, and ſo departed from us. When we left the place, which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103392:12"/>
was preſently, we called it <hi>Mount-Bonny,</hi> becauſe we had there concluded a firm Peace. Proceeding down the River two or three leagues further, we came to a place where were nine or ten Canoa's all together; we went aſhoar there, and found ſeveral <hi>Indians,</hi> but moſt of them were the ſame which had made Peace with us before: We made little ſtay there, but went directly down the River, and came to our Ship before day. <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 26th of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> the winde being at South, we could not go down to the Rivers mouth: but on <hi>Friday</hi> the 27th, we weighed at the mouth of <hi>Hilton</hi>'s River, and got down one league towards the Harbours mouth. On <hi>Sunday</hi> the 29th, we got down to <hi>Crane-Iſland,</hi> which is four leagues or thereabouts above the Entrance of the Harbours mouth. Now on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the firſt of <hi>December,</hi> we made a purchaſe of the River and land of <hi>Cape-Fair,</hi> of <hi>Wattcooſa,</hi> and ſuch other <hi>Indians</hi> as appeared to us to be the chief of thoſe parts: they brought us ſtore of Freſh-fiſh aboard, as Mullets, Shads, and other very good Fiſh: this River is all Freſh-water fit to drink. Some eight leagues within the mouth, the Tide runs up about thirty five leagues, but ſtops and riſeth a great deal farther up; it flowes at the Harbours mouth S. E. and N. W. ſix foot as Neap-Tides, and eight foot at Spring-Tides: the Chanel on the Eaſter-ſide by the <hi>Cape-ſhoar</hi> is the beſt, and lyes cloſe aboard the <hi>Cape-land,</hi> being three fathoms at High-water, in the ſhalloweſt place in the Chanel juſt at the Entrance; but as ſoon as you are paſt that place half a Cables length inward, you ſhall have ſix or ſeven fathoms, a fair turning Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel into the River, and ſo continuing four or five
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103392:12"/>
leagues upwards; afterwards the Chanel is more difficult in ſome places ſix or ſeven fathoms, four or five, and in other places but nine or ten foot, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially where the River is broad. When the River comes to part, and grows narrow, there is all Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel from ſide to ſide in moſt places; in ſome places you ſhall have five, ſix, or ſeven fathoms, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally two or three, Sand and Oaze. We viewed the Cape-land, and judged it to be little worth, the Woods of it ſhrubby and low, the Land ſandy and barren; in ſome places Graſs and Ruſhes, and in other places nothing but clear ſand: a place fitter to ſtarve Cattel in our judgement, then to keep them alive; yet the <hi>Indians,</hi> as we underſtand, keep the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cattle down there, and ſuffer them not to go off the ſaid Cape, as we ſuppoſe, becauſe the Countrey-<hi>Indians</hi> ſhall have to part with them, and as we think, are fallen out about them, who ſhall have the greateſt ſhare. They brought aboard our Ship very good and fat Beef ſeveral times, which they could afford very reaſonable; alſo fat and very large Swine, good cheap penny-worths: but they may thank their friends of <hi>New-England,</hi> who brought their Hogs to ſo fair a Market. Some of the <hi>Indians</hi> brought very good Salt aboard us, and made ſignes, pointing to both ſides of the Rivers mouth, that there was great ſtore thereabouts. We ſaw up the River ſeveral good places for the ſetting up of Corn or Saw-mills. In that time as our buſineſſe called us up and down the River and Branches, we kill'd of wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowl, four Swans, ten Geeſe, twenty nine Cranes, ten Turkies, forty Duck and Mallard, three dozen of Parrakeeto's, and ſix or ſeven dozen of other ſmall Fowls, as Curlues and Plovers, &amp;c.</p>

VVHereas there was a Writing left in a Poſt at the Point of <hi>Cape-Fair</hi> River, by thoſe <hi>New-England</hi>-men that left Cattel with the <hi>Indians</hi> there, the Contents whereof tended not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the diſparagement of the Land about the ſaid River, but alſo to the great diſcouragement of all thoſe that ſhould hereafter come into thoſe Parts to ſettle: In Anſwer to that ſcandalous writing, We whoſe names are under-written do affirm, That we have ſeen facing on both ſides of the River, and branches of <hi>Cape-Fair</hi> aforeſaid, as good Land, and as well Timbred, as any we have ſeen in any other part of the world, ſufficient to accommodate thouſands of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, lying commodiouſly by the ſaid River.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the 4th of <hi>December,</hi> the winde being fair, we put out to Sea, bound for <hi>Barbadoes;</hi> and on the 6th day of <hi>January,</hi> 1663/4, we came to Anchor in <hi>Carliſle</hi>-Bay; and after ſeveral known apparent dangers both by Sea and Land, have now brought us all in ſafety to our long-wiſh'd-for and much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Port, to render an Accompt of our Diſcovery, the verity of which we aver.</p>
