            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116085:4"/>
                  <hi>Sherezer,</hi> and <hi>Regem-melech,</hi> and their men, to ſpeak to the Prieſt, and to know of him, and of the Prophets whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould weep in the fifth moneth, as they had done theſe 70. yeers; this was the caſe propounded; now becauſe my ſubject matter this day muſt very much relate unto this caſe, give me leave a little to open it to you; The Jewes after it had pleaſed God to bring upon them the <hi>Babylonian</hi> captivitie, did ſet apart foure dayes every yeer, which they kept as ſolemne dayes of humiliation, one of them was in the fifth moneth, another was in the ſeventh moneth, another was in the tenth moneth, and another was in the fourth moneth, upon theſe occaſions: In the tenth moneth did <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Army, firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguer <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as you'l finde it in the 25. Chapter of the ſecond book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> that day that <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> Army firſt ſat downe before the Citie, did they keep <note place="margin">2 Kings 25. 1.</note> a faſting day all thoſe 70. yeers: In the fourth moneth of the yeere following, they broke into the Citie and took <note place="margin">2 Kings 25. 3. Verſ. 8. Verſ. 25.</note> it, the day that the Citie was taken, did they keep as a ſolemn faſting day; In the fifth moneth <hi>Nebuzaradan</hi> came and burnt the Temple; the day that the Temple was burnt, did they alſo keep as a faſting day; In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth moneth <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ahikam,</hi> was kill'd, murder'd by <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and all the reſt that were left, were ſcatter'd into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that day likewiſe did they keep as a faſting day; and theſe foure dayes they kept three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten yeers; Now the Temple being built againe, at leaſt in a good forwardneſſe, they ſend to know whether the faſt of the fifth moneth ſhould continue; concerning the other faſts they make no mention of them, probably conceiving that the occaſion of thoſe faſts did continue ſtill; but they would know whether the Lord would not have them lay aſide the faſt of the fifth moneth, which was kept in reference to the Temple, becauſe the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116085:4"/>
was now built, or in a great forwardneſſe; this caſe of conſcience was ſent, ſome think, by the Jewes that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd ſtill in <hi>Babylon,</hi> that they ſent <hi>Sherezer</hi> and <hi>Regem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi> and the reſt of them, as their Embaſſadors; others thinke they were ſent from all the Jewes, that were return'd from their Captivity, but by whom ſoever the meſſage was ſent, this was the caſe that I have read to you; Now the Prophet comes to anſwer this caſe, and in the anſwer hee takes notice of all the foure dayes of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, though they mention but one of them, becauſe they all hung upon one hinge, and the anſwer of the Prophet to this caſe, ſo much of it as is contained in this Chapter is a meere ſlighting of the caſe propounded; and there are two things wherein the Prophet expreſſes the Lords contempt of their Embaſſage, one,</p>
               <p>That the Lord tooke no notice of any ſuch thing; Did you faſt to me? (ſaith he) you ſpeake of dayes of faſting, <note place="margin">1.</note> that you have kept 70. yeers, did you faſt to mee? Did I either appoint them? or doe I accept them? or have you carried them as you ſhould doe? the meaning is, you play the hypocrites with mee, you would make a great deale adoe about a ſolemne Embaſſage, to have a caſe of conſcience determin'd, which is firſt, but a ceremony at the beſt, and beſides it is a ceremony of your own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and in it you have howled and mourned for your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, but never tooke notice of your ſinnes, that have cauſed thoſe judgements to come upon you; you faſted ſometimes, and feaſted ſometimes, but when you have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, you faſted not to me, &amp; when you did eate and drink, you did eate and drinke to your ſelves, and not to mee; that is the firſt, a ſlighting of it, as a keeping a coile about a trifle, when there were greater matters concerned them which they regarded not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:116085:5"/>
The ſecond branch of the Prophets anſwer containes <note place="margin">2.</note> the true reaſon why all this faſting of theirs was thus ſlighted by God that is laid downe, Firſt,</p>
               <p>More generally in the 6. Verſe, wherein the Prophet <note place="margin">1.</note> gives them a ſound and a ſharpe reproof, you have wept and mourned, but ſhould not you rather have took notice of the words, which the Lord did ſend by the Prophets? <hi>ſhould ye not heare the words that the Prophets cried in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, when Ieruſalem was inhabited, and the Cities thereof round about her?</hi> there you might have learned the true way, but that you have no whit regarded; you cry for your afflictions, but you are not one whit ſenſible of thoſe ſinnes that have cauſed theſe judgements upon you: That is the generall, then ſecondly,</p>
               <p>Hee proceeds more particularly to open this Ulcer of <note place="margin">2.</note> their hypocriſie, and three things there are which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members them of, Firſt,</p>
               <p>The Lord remembers them of the counſell that had been given them and their Fathers, how to remove the <note place="margin">1.</note> plagues that lay upon them, (ſaith hee) Thus ſpeaks the Lord of hoſts (in the 9. Verſe) execute true judgement, and juſtice, ſhew mercy and compaſſion every man to his brother, oppreſſe not the widow, the fatherleſſe, nor the ſtranger, let none of you imagine evill againſt his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his heart: this was the counſell which of old was given, how the ruine of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; the exerciſe of juſtice, and the exerciſe of mercy; indeed the Prophet there inſtances onely in two Table duties, but I thinke the reaſon is, becauſe the Jewes were alwayes very exact in matters of Gods worſhip, ſave onely when they fell into Idolatry, and they bore them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much upon the duties of the firſt Table; and it is Gods ordinary practiſe when hee would diſcover the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie

               <p>What by hardneſſe, or hardning; Hardning in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall <note place="margin">2.</note> ſignification of it, is nothing but the withdrawing of moyſture form any ſubſtance, whereby the parts come to bee condenſed and made ſtiffe, ſo as not to yeeld to the touch; <hi>Durum eſt quod non cedit tactui,</hi> that that will not receive any impreſſion that is hard: this in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſenſe; but in a morall and ſpirituall ſenſe, to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the heart is nothing but to have the will reſolutely and unchangeably ſet upon any purpoſe, not to be taken off from their enterpriſe by any meanes that can bee uſed to change them, that is to harden the heart; and in the Scripture it is ſometimes taken in a good ſenſe, a mans heart may be harden'd in a very gratious manner, ſo <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiels</hi>

               <p>That there is a graduall, and partiall hardneſs of heart, you may ſee it in Chriſts own Diſciples, who being new Creatures had a heart of fleſh in them, and yet it is ſaid of them, in <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 52.

I am to ſhew you, that hardening the heart againſt God, is a certain forerunner of deſtruction; I doe not mean it of that naturall hardneſſe, that wee all bring into the world, nor of that acquired hardneſſe, that is found in every man, who hath but lived a while upon earth, nor of that partiall or graduall hardneſſe, that is in the beſt of Gods people, much leſſe of that felt, bewailed, bemoaned hardneſſe, that is look'd upon as a heavy judgement, by them that lye under it; though all theſe are ſinnes, yet theſe are not the ſinnes of my Text; but my Text meanes it of the choſen, voluntary, elected hardneſſe, the Totall hardneſſe, the Raigning hardneſſe, when men doe obſtinately, and willingly ſtrengthen, and make firme their hearts in their ſinfull wayes againſt God, and then God in his righteous judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curres, and ſaith bee it ſo: when men doe thus harden their hearts againſt God, be it a Family, be it a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, be it one, or be they many, this hardening the heart againſt God, is a certaine forerunner of utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; Now you underſtand what the Leſſon is, that <note place="margin">The Doctrine proved.</note> I am to handle, and Firſt, I ſhall make it good, and plainly demonſtrate the truth of it, out of the Scripture; and for the proofe turn to three or foure Texts, the one is that knowne ſignall Text in <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 1. read it carefully; Hee <hi>that being often admoniſhed, or reproved, hardens his neck; there is</hi> my very Doctrine, that after admonitions hardens his neck; what of him? <hi>Shall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly bee deſtroyed, and that without remedy;</hi> weigh all thoſe words; Firſt,</p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:116085:11"/>
Chriſt ſaith the ſame in <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 40. that this was the reaſon, why all the miracles that he had wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and all the Sermons that he had preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, did them no good, becauſe their hearts were harden'd: it is like a peece of ſtone, put into a bottles mouth, though you put it into the bottome of a well, no water gets into it, the ſtopple keeps all out; the ſinne of hardneſſe of heart keeps the ſoule from receiving any good, it is like unto the harlot that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes of, or rather like them that goe in to the harlot, that none of them ever turne to take hold of the wayes of life; ſo that becauſe it is a ſinne, that is open Rebellion againſt God, and it is a ſinne that in the nature of it, rejecteth all the meanes that might make reconciliation with God, what can bee expected; but the heart that goes on to harden it ſelfe muſt needs run into utter ruine.</p>
               <p>I have one thing more before I come to the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that is to diſcover how this ſinne of hardneſſe of heart may be known, the properties of it, that every ſoule may bee able, when it comes to the Application, to give a right judgement of its owne condition; and here I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you remember, that I doe not come to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hardneſſe of heart in generall, there is no living man upon earth, but his heart is harden'd; there is no child of God living, but his heart is harden'd, all the ſinfull motions and inclinations that are found in us, they are all the fruits of hardneſſe of heart; all that rebellion that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of in the ſeventh to the <hi>Romans,</hi> a law in the members rebelling againſt the law of the mind, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of him captive, it is all the fruit of hardneſſe of heart but all hardneſſe is not the hardneſſe of my Text; all <note place="margin">How this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may be found.</note> hardneſſe of heart is not deſtructive hardneſſe, is not rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hardneſſe; hardneſſe felt, hardneſſe bemoaned, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

lamented and ſtriven againſt is ſoftneſſe in Gods eſteeme; and is ſo farre from being a forerunner of ruine, that it is an evidence of ſalvation; but it is this deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damning hardneſſe of heart, that I would enquire the properties of, and ſet them before you out of the word of God: and there are ſix things that I have thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby this deſtroying damning hardneſſe of heart doth manifeſt it ſelfe, Firſt,</p>
               <p>Take that which is moſt uſuall in the Scripture, the <note place="margin">1.</note> Lord ordinarily expreſſes this devilliſh hardneſs of heart, <note place="margin">Such an hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned heart is frequently compared to an untamed Bullock. Deut. 9. 19. 32. 15. Jer. 31. 18. 2 Chron. 36. 13. Nehem. 9. 29. Pſal. 75. 5. Jer. 7. 26. 17. 23. Exod. 32. 9. 33. 35. Which compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon affords two evidences. If it can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it will not be yoked.</note> by the compariſon of an untamed heifer, of a bullock that refuſes to carry the yoke, to draw, or to plow; very often in the booke of God doth the Lord deſcribe this hardned ſinner by the compariſon of an untamed heifer, in reference to the yoke: Now in an untamed heifer, there are theſe two things remarkable to my purpoſe: the one is,</p>
               <p>That if it be poſſible, it will throw off the yoke that you would put upon it, turning away the neck, rinching the ſhoulder, uſing its ſtrength, and all that it hath, to keepe the yoke that it may not come upon the neck of it: or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</p>
               <p>If you doe get the yoke over the neck, and compell it to be under the yoke, then it pines away, frets and fumes, and bellows, and takes on, but worke it will not; juſt thus is this harden'd heart, God hath two yokes; The one is, <note place="margin">2 If by force the yoke bee put upon it, it will fret and pine away but not worke.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The yoke of his Commandements, which hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands every ſoule to take upon its ſelfe, this yoke, this hardned wretch throwes away with indignation, that you may ſay of a harden'd heart in reference to the yoke of obedience, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaks of the Vnicorne, in the 39. of <hi>Iob,</hi> Canſt thou intreat him to carry thy yoke and to plow thy ground? can thy faire words perſwade him to doe it?
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:116085:12"/>
(ſaith hee) ſo doe you thinke any allurements for God, ſhall make this wretched man carry the yoke of Gods Commandements? no, hee throwes them off, what God would have him doe he will not doe, but then God hath another yoke, that this creature cannot keep off: and that is,</p>
               <p>The yoke of correction, the yoke of judgement, and when the Lord puts that yoke upon him, then hee pines away, frets, ſwelters himſelfe, and as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> expreſſes it, in the 24. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> You ſhall not weep, that is, you ſhall not weep with any godly ſorrow, but ye ſhall <note place="margin">Ezek. 24. 23.</note> pine away in your iniquities: and the Lord expreſses it in the 51. of <hi>Iſaiah:</hi> Thy ſonnes do faint (in the 20. verſe) they are like a Bull caught in a net, full of the fury of the Lord, there thy ſonnes are fallen, I have yoked them, they would not carry my yoke of obedience, but I have yok'd them with judgement; and how are they under it? there they lie like a Bull in a net, full of the fury of the Lord, yelling and roaring: thus the harden'd heart is like an untamed heifer, the yoke of Gods commandements it will not carry, and the yoke of judgements though it muſt carry, yet it doth not profit by them, but onely pines away by diſcontent under them; This firſt note of a harden'd heart I give onely for your memories ſake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the matter of it will come in the things that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And ſecondly, another property of this harden'd heart that my Text ſpeaks of, is,</p>
               <p>That it is an inſenſible heart; <hi>Nabals</hi> heart is ſaid to be <note place="margin">2.</note> like a ſtone, ſenſible of nothing, though all belonging to <note place="margin">A hard heart is an unſenſible heart.</note> him was like to come to ruine; <hi>Nabals</hi> heart had no ſenſe of any thing, ſo is this wretch, this wretched creature I am ſpeaking of, let Gods wrath bee threatned to him, though hee lie under it, hee feeles it not; let his owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116085:12"/>
be open'd, he is not ſenſible of it, let heaven ſhake over him, let the earth ſhake under him, let his eſtate ſhake, let his houſe quake, nothing moves him, let death bee ready to ſhake him, hell ready to devoure him, hee apprehends nothing, hee is like the drunkard that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes of in the 23. of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> that lies aſleep <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 34, 35.</note> upon the top of a maſt, <hi>they have beaten mee,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but I did not feele it,</hi> they have wounded me, but I did not know it; nothing that the Lord doth to them, or that his word ſaith to them, makes them ſenſible of any thing, a harden'd heart is an inſenſible heart; that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther property of it: Thirdly, this harden'd heart of my Text,</p>
               <p>Is an impenitent heart indeed, the hardneſs of heart is <note place="margin">3.</note> but an aggravation of impenitence, but he is reſolutely <note place="margin">A hard heart is an impenitent heart.</note> an impenitent perſon, hee is one that goes on in the wayes of ſinne, and will not bee tooke off from the wayes of ſinne; A harden'd heart, you may truely ſay of it, it is a Rock to God, but it is wax to the Devill; it is inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the requeſts of God, but it is moſt yeelding to the allurements of the Devill; Gods ſeed will not grow in this rock, but the Devils ſeed growes beſt of all there; they obey not the truth but willingly obey unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they are ſtones to God, but wax to the Devill; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to harden the heart, and to goe on reſolutely in a way of ſinning againſt God, is al one, take it as the Apoſtle expreſſes it in the ſecond of the <hi>Romans,</hi> thus, (ſaith hee) <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>after thy hardnes and heart that cannot repent:</hi> a reſolute hearted man is like a Blackmore, that cannot change his skin; like a Leopard that cannot change her ſpots: it is ſet and bent to goe on in the wayes of ſinne; that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther property: Fourthly,</p>
               <p>This harden'd heart doth not onely go<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Another property of this hardned wretch is, that they make but a mocke and ſcorne either of the ſinnes that <note place="margin">5.</note> they walke in, or of any judgements, or plagues that may <note place="margin">A hard heart ſlights and ſcornes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.

to his ſonnes in law as one that mock'd: they jeered him, and they thought hee jeered them, they are like the <note place="margin">Matth. 7. 4.</note> Swine that our Saviour ſpeakes of, throw a pearle before them, they will tread it under their feet; they make a ſcorne of them, tell them of their offences againſt God, and of the ruine of their ſoules, they are like Leviathan that the ſpirit of God ſpeakes of, in the 41. of <hi>Iob</hi> come <note place="margin">Job 41. 24. 27.</note> upon him with ſpeares and ſwords, they are but as ſtubble to him, and ſtrawes, hee laughs at them, he ſaies, Aha, like the horſe in the middle of the battle, neighes and laughs at the danger; ſo when a heart goes on in a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened <note place="margin">Deut. 29. 19.</note> way it makes a jeſt, and a ſcorne of all the evils you can threaten againſt him, hee ſaith, Tuſh, I ſhall have peace though I adde drunkenneſſe to thirſt, theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are nothing, this wind ſhakes not my corne; and I'le adde but one more, and that is,</p>
               <p>When the heart goes on in this deſtructive way, it doth <note place="margin">6.</note> oppoſe and ſet againſt all thoſe as enemies who would <note place="margin">A hard heart: oppoſeth and ſets againſt them as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who would ſtop them in their wicked wayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Exod. 10. 28.</note> ſtop them in their way; and when once the ſoule is come to that paſſe, then in truth is Satan ſet upon his throne, then they are the Devils cuſhion, or his pillow; and this the harden'd heart ordinarily doth, you may ſee it in <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtill followed him from God, and hee could not be rid of him, then he gave him this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>come no more to mee,</hi> I'le hang you the next time you come, ſee my face no more, if ever thou commeſt to mee againe with theſe meſſages, thou ſhalt die for it; and ſo likewiſe <hi>Amaziah,</hi> you may read of him in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. when he was fallen into the ſinne of Idolatry, God <note place="margin">2 Chron. 25. 16.</note> ſent a Prophet to him to admoniſh him; <hi>Forbeare</hi> (ſaith the King to him) <hi>who made you of the Kings Councell? hold your tongue, elſe you'l be ſmitten,</hi> then ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, by this I know that God meanes to deſtroy thee;

               <p>Take the judgements or corrections of God, that are upon thee to breake thee; a good ſhower and a plough <note place="margin">3.</note> together helpes notably to breake the clods in the fields; Bleſſed is the man whom God chaſtiſeth, and teacheth; when God followes thee with corrections, conſider of them, ſay thus, God viſits <hi>mee,</hi> my <hi>family,</hi> my <hi>wife,</hi> my <hi>ſtate,</hi> my <hi>ſoule,</hi> my <hi>children, &amp;c.</hi> I am never from under the rod, what is the matter?

               <p>Above all I commend the ſweet way of cure, by the diſſolving of it; and that is onely by faith in the blood of <note place="margin">How to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it.</note> Jeſus Chriſt, lay hold upon Chriſt by faith: I know not how true it is, but ſome ſay, the blood of a Goat will in

time diſſolve an adamant, but certainly there is a ſlaine Goate, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe blood is able to diſſolve the heart that is like an Adamant; Chriſts blood will turne a heart of ſtone into a heart of fleſh; you ſee it in the Jewes, thoſe hard hearted wretches, that when they were put in choice, whether they would have Chriſt, or <hi>Barabbas,</hi> ſpared <hi>Barabbas</hi> and crucified Jeſus; yet theſe hard hearted ſinners when they come to heare from <note place="margin">Acts 2.</note>
