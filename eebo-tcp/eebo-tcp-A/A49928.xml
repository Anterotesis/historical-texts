            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable
CHARLES,
Earl of DORSET and MIDDLESEX,
One of the Gentlemen of His
MAJESTIES
BED-CHAMBER, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WIth an Assurance I hope becoming the justice of
my Cause I lay this Tragedy at you Lordships
Feet, not as a common persecution but as an
Offering suitable to your Virtue, and worthy of the Greatness of
your Name. There are some Subjects that require but half
the strength of a great Poet, but when <hi>Greece</hi> or old <hi>Rome</hi>
come in play, the Nature Wit and Vigour of foremost <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spear,</hi>
the Iudgment and Force of <hi>Johnson,</hi> with all his bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
Mastery from the Ancients, will scarce suffice for so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
a Grapple. The Poet must elevate his Fancy with the
mightiest Imagination, he must run back so many hundred Years,
take a just Prospect of the Spirit of those Times without the
least thought of ours; for if his Eye should swerve so low, his
<pb facs="tcp:100349:3"/>
Muse will grow giddy with the Vastness of the Distance, fall at
once, and for ever lose the Majesty of the first Design. He
that will pretend to be a Critick of such a Work must not have
a Grain of <hi>Cecilius,</hi> he must be <hi>Longin</hi> throughout or nothing,
where even the nicest best Remarks must pass but for Allay to
the Imperial Fury of this old Roman Gold. There must be no
Dross through the whole Mass, the Furnace must be justly heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Bullion stamp'd with an unerring band. In such a
Writing there must be Greatness of Thought without Bombast,
Remoteness without Monstrousness, Virtue arm'd with Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
not in Iron Bodies, Solid Wit without modern Affectation,
Smoothness without Gloss, Speaking out without cracking the
Voice or straining the Lungs. In short my Lord he that will
write as he ought on so Noble an Occasion must write like you.
But I fear there are few that know how to Coppy after so great
an Original as your Lordship, because there is scarce one genius
Extant of your own Size, that can follow you <hi>passibus aequis,</hi>
that has the Felicity and Mastery of the old Poets, or can half
match the thought fulness of your Soul. How far short I am
cast of such inimitable Excellence, I must with shame my Lord
confess I am but too too sensible. Nature 'tis believed (if I am
not flattered and do not flatter my self) has not been niggardly
to me in the Portion of a Genius, tho I have been so far from
improving it, that I am half affraid I have lost of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
It behoves me then for the future to look about me to see
whether I am a Lagg in the Race, to look up to your Lordship
and strain upon the track of so fair a Glory. I must acknowledge
however I have behav'd my self in drawing, nothing ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
it self to my Fancy with that solid pleasure as <hi>Brutus</hi> did
in sacrificing his Sons. Before I read <hi>Machivel</hi>'s Notes upon
the place, I concluded it the greatest Action that was ever seen
<pb facs="tcp:100349:3"/>
throughout all Ages on the greatest Occasion. For my own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,
I though I never painted any Man so to the Life before

            <p>No doubt that divine Poet imagined it might be too great for
any People but his own, perhaps I have found it so, but <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
Catiline</hi> met no better fate as his Motto from <hi>Horace</hi>
tells us.</p>
            <q>—His non plebecula gandet &amp;c.</q>
            <p>Nay <hi>Shakespear's Brutus</hi> with much adoe beat himself into
the heads of a blockish Age, so knotty were the Oaks he had to
deal with. For my own Opinion, in spite of all the Obstacles my
Modesty could raise, I could not help inserting a Vaunt in the
Title page, Coeloque, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>And having gain'd the List that he design'd,</l>
               <l>Bold as the Billows driving with the Wind,</l>
               <l>He loos'd the Muse that wing'd his free-born Mind.</l>
            </q>
            <p>On this I arm'd and resolv'd not the be stirr'd with the little
Exceptions of a sparkish Generation, that have an Antipathy to
Thought, But alas how frail are our best resolves in our own
Concerns. I show'd no passion outward, but whether through an
Over-Conceit of the Work, or because perhaps there was indeed
some Merit, the Fire burnt inward, and I was troubled for my
dumb Play, like a Father for his dead Child. 'Tis enough that I have
eas'd my heart by this Dedication of your Lordship. I comfort
my self too whatever our partial Youth alledge, your Lordship
<pb facs="tcp:100349:4"/>
will find something in in worth your Observation; which with
my fature Diligence, Resolution to Study, Devotion to Vertue,
and your Lordships Service, may render me not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
the Protection of your Lordship.</p>

                     <p>Pr'ythee, let's talk no more on't Look, here's Lord <hi>Brutus:</hi>
Come, come, we'll divert ourselves; For 'tis but just, that we

with the impertinence of a Fool. Pr'y thee, Brutus, what's

                     <p>Yes, yes; and I heard of the wager that was lay'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, among you whoring Lords at the Siege of <hi>Ardea;</hi>
Ha, Boy! about your handsome Wives:</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Brut.</speaker>
                     <p>How you bounc'd from the Board, took Horse, and
rode like madmen, to find the gentle <hi>Lucrece</hi> at <hi>Collatia:</hi> but
how found her? why, working with her Maids at midnight.
Was not this monstrous, and quite out of the fashion? Fine stuff
indeed, for a Lady of Honor, when her Husband was out of the
way, to sit weaving, and pinking, and pricking of <hi>Arras?</hi> Now,
by this light, my Lord, your Wife made better use of her Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cushion.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <speaker>Brut.</speaker>
                     <p>Why should she not, when all the Royal Nurses do the
same? What? what, my Lord, did you not find 'em at it? when
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100349:8"/>
you came from <hi>Collatia</hi> to <hi>Rome. Lartius,</hi> your Wife; and
yours <hi>Flaminius?</hi> with <hi>Tullia</hi>'s Boys, turning the Cristals up,
dashing the Windows, and the Fates defying? Now, by the
Gods, I think 'twas Civil in you, discreetly done, Sirs, not to
interrupt 'em. But for your Wife, <hi>Fabritius,</hi> I'll be sworn for
her, she would not keep 'em company.</p>

                     <speaker>Fab.</speaker>
                     <p>No marry would she not; she hates Debauches: How
have I heard her rail at <hi>Terentia,</hi> and tell her next her heart
upon the qualms, that drinking Wine so late and tipling Spirits,
would be the death of her?</p>

                     <speaker>Brut.</speaker>
                     <p>Why thus then. To morrow <hi>Tullia</hi> goes to the Camp;
and I being Master of the Houshold, have command to sweep the
Court of all its Furniture, and send it packing to the Wars:
Pandars, Sycophants, upstart Rogues; fine Knaves and surly
Rascals; Flatterers, easie, supple, cringing, passing, smiling
Villains: all, all to the Wars.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Brut.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, is it not a Plot? a Plot upon your Selves, your
Persons, Families, and your Relations; even to your Wives,
Mothers, Sisters, all your Kindred: For Whores too are included,
Setters too, and Whore-procurers; Bag and Baggage; all, all
to the Wars. All hence, all Rubbish, Lumber out; and not a
Baud be left behind, to put you in hope of hatching Whores
hereafter.</p>

Spoken by Mr. Barrey.</head>
            <l>NO cringing Sirs, the Poets Champion I,</l>
            <l>Have sworn to stand, and ev'ry Iudge defie;</l>
            <l>But why each Bullying critick shou'd I name</l>
            <l>A Iugde, whose only business is to damne.</l>
            <l>While you your Arbitrary fist advance</l>
            <l>At Wit, and dust it like a boor of <hi>France</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who without show of reason or pretence</l>
            <l>Condemn a man to dye for speaking sence.</l>
            <l>How ere we term'd you once the wise the strong</l>
            <l>Know we have born your impotence too long.</l>
            <l>You that above your Sires presume to soare,</l>
            <l>And are but copies dawb'd in Minuture.</l>
            <l>You that have nothing right in heart nor tongue</l>
            <l>But only to be resolute in wrong.</l>
            <l>Who sence affect with such an Aukward Ayre</l>
            <l>As if a <hi>Frenchman</hi> should become severe,</l>
            <l>Or an <hi>Italian</hi> make his Wife a jest</l>
            <l>Like <hi>Spaniards</hi> pleasant, or like <hi>Dutchmen</hi> drest.</l>
            <l>That rank the noblest Poets with the vile</l>
            <l>And look your selves in a <hi>Plebeian</hi> stile.</l>
            <l>But with an Oath.—</l>
            <l>False as your Wit and Iudgment now I swear</l>
            <l>By the known Maiden heads of each Theater</l>
            <l>Nay by my own; The Poets shall not stand,</l>
            <l>Like Shrove-tide Cocks, the Palt of every hand.</l>
            <l>Let not the purblind Critick's sentence pass</l>
            <l>That shoots the Poet through anopick glass,</l>
            <l>No peals of ill plac'd praise from galleries come</l>
            <l>Nor punk below to clap or hiss presume</l>
            <l>Let her not cackle at the fops that flout her</l>
            <l>Nor clukk the Squires that use to pipp about her,</l>
            <l>No full blown block head bloated like an Ox</l>
            <l>Traverse the pit with-dam <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:100349:42"/>
Know then for Ev'ry misdemeanor here</l>
            <l>I'll be more stabbing, sharp, and more severe,</l>
            <l>Then the Fell-she that on her Keeper comes</l>
            <l>Who in his drink, last night laid wast her Roomes,</l>
            <l>Thundred her China, damn'd her quality,</l>
            <l>Her glasses broke, and tore her, Point Venie;</l>
            <l>That drag'd her by the hair, and broke her head,</l>
            <l>A Chamber Lion, but a lamb in bed.</l>
            <l>Like her I'le teez you for your midnight storming</l>
            <l>For your all talking, and your noe performing.</l>
            <l>You that with monstrous Iudgment force the Stage</l>
            <l>You fribling, fumbling Keepers of the Age.</l>
