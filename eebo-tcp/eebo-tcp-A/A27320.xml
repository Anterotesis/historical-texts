            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But this <hi>Play</hi> for which I humbly beg Your Graces Protection, needs it in a more peculiar manner, it having drawn down Legions upon its head, for its Loyalty — <hi>what, to Name us cryes one, tis most abominable, unheard of daring cryes another — she deserves to be swing'd cryes a third;</hi> as if twere all a Libel, a scandal impossible to be provd, or that their Rogueries were of so old a Date their Reign were past remembrance or History; when they take such zealous care to renew it daily to our memories: And I am satisfied, that they that will justifie the best of these Traytors, deserves the fate of the worst, and most manifestly declare to the World by it, they wou'd be at the <hi>Old Game</hi> their fore-Fathers played with so good success, yet if there be any honest loyal man alied to any here nam'd, I heartily beg his Pardon for any offensive Truth I have spoken, and 'tis a wonderful thing that amongst so Numerous a Flock they will not allow of one mangy Sheep; not one Rogue in the whole Generation of the Association. <hi>Ignoramus the 1</hi>st <hi>and the 2</hi>d.</p>

Yet these were those that impudently Tug'd for Empire, and Prophan'd that Illustrious Throne and Court, so due then, and possest now (through the infinite Mercies of God to this bleeding Nation) by the best of Monarchs; a Monarch, who had yet the divine goodness to Pardon even his worst of Enemies what was past; Nay, out of his Vast and God-like Clemency, did more than Heaven it self can do, put it out of his Power by <hi>an Act of Oblivion,</hi> to punish the unparalell'd Injuries done His Sacred Person, and the rest of the Royal Family: How great his Patience has been since, I leave to all the World to judge: but

            <l>High for the Royal <hi>Cause</hi> in Cavelier;</l>

            <l>So far you drew me in, but faith I'le be</l>
            <l>Reveng'd on you for thus debauching me,</l>
            <l>Some of your pious Cheats I'le open lay,</l>
            <l>That lead your <hi>Ignoramus</hi> Flock astray:</l>
            <l>For since I cannot fight, I will not faile</l>
            <l>To exercise my Tallent; that's to raile:</l>
            <l>Yee Race of Hypocrites, whose Cloak of Zeal</l>
            <l>Covers the Knave that cants for Common Weale,</l>
            <l>All Laws the Church and State to ruine brings,</l>
            <l>And impudently set a Rule on Kings</l>
            <l>Ruine, destroy, all's good that you decree</l>
            <l>By your Infallible Presbitery.</l>
            <l>Prosperous at first, in ills you grow so vain,</l>
            <l>You thought to Play the <hi>Old Game</hi> ore again,</l>
            <l>And thus the cheat was put upon the Nation,</l>
            <l>First with long Parliaments, next Reformation:</l>
            <l>And now you hop'd to make a new invasion,</l>
            <l>And when you can't prevaile by open force,</l>
            <l>To cunning tickling tricks you have recourse,</l>
            <l>And raise Sedition forth without remorse.</l>

            </l>
            <l>Rail'd foolishly for Loyalty and Laws;</l>
            <l>But when the Saints had put them to a stand,</l>
            <l>We left them Loyalty and took their Land:</l>
            <l>Yea, and the Pious work of Reformation</l>
            <l>Rewarded was with Plunder, Sequestration;</l>
            <l>Thus can't the faithfull, nay, they'r so uncivill</l>

            <l>When this is all th' Exception they can make,</l>
            <l>They damn us for our glorious Masters sake.</l>

            <l>Our small Religion sure can do no harm,</l>
