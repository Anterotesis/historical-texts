            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

one, more than any Book or Men ever did, or can do? As is manifest in the daily Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences and Occasions in the outward life.

wit, Divine and Spiritual, which Reason cannot immediately reach unto by its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending: but as a Man having the Natural Exercise of his Senses, can use his Reason in Natural Things that are sensible; so he who hath the use of his Spiritual Senses, can use the same Reason in Spiritual Things, to wit, in a subservient and subordinate way.</p>

                  <head>To the Loving and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reader.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>SInce It pleased the Lord to give me some knowledg by experience, what True Prayer is; after that I was turned with many others to his Marvelous Light, to believe and walk in it, wherein the deep things of God are seen and opened. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny true and fresh, and living openings have arisen in me concerning Prayer, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, use, ends, and manner of it, and how true and right Prayer is, and ought to be acceptably performed; how the Spirit of God assists and helps his Servants and Children to Pray; how he works not only upon their wills and affections, to quicken and excite them, and make them fruitful with good and holy desires, in the art, or exercise of Prayer; but also how he works upon the Understanding, and all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Powers, to enlighten them, and give to Man a true and real sense and</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95820:14"/>
                     <hi>understanding of his wants, or of the wants of others, for whom he prayeth, and also of the Love, Mercy, Bounty, and Compassion of the Lord, and the readiness and nearness of his helping hand to supply all his and their wants abundantly. When the Inward and Spiritual Eye is opened by the Lord, to see the Well of Living Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where the thirsty Soul may drink: And also to see the Lords Table that is richly spread, where it may eat abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and be refreshed, and bless and praise the Name of the Lord, for all his great and rich Mercies and Blessings. And if the Spirit of the Lord did not enlighten the Understanding and Mind of Man, to teach him what to seek and pray for, but only did warm, and heat Mens affections, all this would be but a blind Devotion, which all true Protestants cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Heavenly and Sacred Fire, that God sends down into the Hearts of his People, is not a dark obscure Fire, but shining and enlightening, and hath Light</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95820:14"/>
                     <hi>as well as Heat in it. The Spirit of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Supplication, is not only a Spirit of Love, but a Spirit of Wisdom and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And though there is a kind of Prayer, that may be, and oft is, without Words either expressed or conceived in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; because there is a degree of Understanding in Man, that transcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all Words: I mean such Words as we commonly use, which are the signs of things signified by them, as</hi> Aristotle <hi>defineth Words:</hi> Verba sunt signarerum. <hi>i. e.</hi> Words are the signs of things. <hi>In which high degree of Understanding, the Spirit and Mind of Man, reacheth to the Divine and Heavenly things themselves, without these words, where the things are words themselves; or where the words and things are not distinct: But the thing is its own word, and the word that signifieth it as the thing it self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> Aristotle <hi>so much admired for his worldly Wisdom and Philosophy as it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, knew not this Mystery, nor yet do his</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95820:15"/>
                     <hi>followers. Notwithstanding of which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lord who is Infinitely Bountiful and Gracious unto men, doth not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten and shine upon this highest part of Man's Understanding; but also causeth his Light and Spirit of Wisdom and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to descend to the lowest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree thereof, even to his Reason and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination (for the very Imagination of man is said in Scripture to be wrought upon by the Spirit of God; see</hi> Isa. 26. 3. <hi>That which is Translated in, and according to the</hi> Hebrew, <hi>signifieth Imagination.) See also,</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 18. Keep this for ever in the Imagination of the Thoughts, <hi>&amp;c. Which inferiour and lower Powers of man's Soul, cannot reach to Divine things, without the signes of Words: Therefore it pleaseth God to work upon the Understandings of Men, so as to make them fruitful to bring forth good and pertinent Words of Truth, as well as upon their minds and affections, to bring forth the fruits of Holy and Spiritual desires: Wherefore the Apostle Prayed to the Lord,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95820:15"/>
                     <hi>that God would establish the true Believers in him,</hi> in every good word and work. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Whence I conclude, that good words are as real a Fruit of the Spirit, as good works or desires; and these good words must not be borrowed words from the mouths or lines of others made ready to our Hands, but must spring from the inward fruitfulness of our own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, as the spirit of the Lord doth water them, and make them fruitful after a Heavenly sort. For it is not the Corn that lyeth upon the ground, though ever so abundantly, which hath grown in another Land or Country, that denominates the Ground where it lyeth, to be fruitful; but that is only a fruitful Ground which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth from within it self, as it is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by the Heavenly Rains and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, the like Corn, or any other Grain that is good and profitable. And therefore it is not the abundance even of Scripture Words, which a man receives into his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, or bare natural Understanding, that simply makes his Mind and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95820:16"/>
                     <hi>fruitful unto God, but the inward sense and mystery of Scripture words must be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in him by the Spirit of the Lord, and then the Understanding of a man, by the help of the Scripture words, being inwardly and spiritually opened by the Holy Spirit, brings forth, as it were, as so many Seeds a plentiful Harvest, where the good Ground of the good and honest Heart, yieldeth its fruit, some Thirty, some Sixty, and some an Hundred Fold; and alwaies with some increase: So that although Scripture words have a most excellent service and use to the Children of God, and their minds and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings are made fruitful, with the Spiritual knowledg and opening of them by the Spirit of the Lord: As the ground or soil is with seed sown in it; yet the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is not confined to the strict and precise number of scripture words; but yieldeth an increase of other words from the same spirit, and of the same tendency and signification: As the seed that is sown, yeildeth more Grains than what was sown. These and such like openings in great plenty,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95820:16"/>
                     <hi>to the praise of God, have livingly sprung up in me as concerning Prayer, time after time, and have at the present writing been livingly brought to my remembrance, with an addition of many more, which here I present to all Friendly and Loving Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to whose hands this may come for a general service; where I have handled and treated of things, I hope soberly and fairly, in the spirit of Love and Meekness, not naming any Persons or Parties by way of reflection to provoke them to anger or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; only with some Fervency. But yet in true Love I have reproved and argued against those who pretend to Pray by the Spirit without a set Form, and yet deny the spirits Immediate Teachings and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. And tho I aim against Reading set Forms of Prayer, so as to make that Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Prayer it self; yet I am not simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against Reading of Prayers, which have in any measure proceeded from the spirit of God in the Ages past.</hi>

Also we are to Pray for the Church of God in general, that God may build her up more and more, preserve and defend her, multiply his Graces, and pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon her, and upon her Members, in their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive places; and especially for those who have a publick Ministry in the Church, that he may more and more qualifie them for so great a work, and open an Effectual Door unto them; and that it may please the Lord to increase the number of Faithful Labourers to work and labour in his Vine-yard. And lastly we are to pray for Kings, and all in Authority, that God may incline their Hearts to do good and just things in the Earth, that we may live a quiet and a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95820:18"/>

                     <head>
                        <hi>Q.</hi> What are the things which we are to Pray for as to our selves? Are they only Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, and such as belong to the Soul? or are they Temporal things also; such as Riches, or encrease of Corn, Wine and Oyl, or Health? If one be in Sickness and Liberty, if one be in in Prison? And if it be not lawful to pray for Riches, or great plenty of Worldly and Temporal Things? May we not at lest pray for our necessary Provision, as Food and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Christ taught his Disciples saying, <hi>Give us this day our daily Bread.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> As for Riches or great Plenty of Worldly and Temporal Things, we find no Precept nor Example to commend it as a lawful Thing unto us to Pray for, in all the Scripture; nor indeed are they to be sought for (altho when it pleaseth God to bestow them, in blessing Mens sober and lawful Callings and Employments, they are to be received with Thanksgiving: and God is to be Praved unto, that he may give those who have them a Heart to use them to his Glory; and that they may be as Faithful Stewards of them, especially
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95820:19"/>
to Minister unto others who are in necessity) for many Tentations and Snares do follow Worldly Riches, next as to Temporal or Wordly Necessities, as Food and Raiment, or Health in time of Sickness, and Liberty in case of Bondage or Imprisonment; and other such like things: I do not say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to pray for them, providing it be with a due submission to the Will of God, who knows best what is good for us. So that sometimes Sickness, and sometimes Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment is best for us, and other Worldly afflictions, Tryals and Exercises of our Faith, and we stand in need of them, and they are sent to us from God for some good end and purpose: and therefore we should mainly desire that all these things may be Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied unto us, and the end and purpose of God in doing us good, may be fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in all of them. But I do not find it commanded any where in Scripture, or laid upon us as a necessary duty, to pray for any Temporal or Worldly Thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever: for Christ did not teach or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Disciples to seek, or be careful what they should Eat or Drink, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be Cloathed; but (said he) <hi>Seek first the Kingdom of God and the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereof, and all these things shall be added</hi>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95820:19"/>
                        <hi>unto you:</hi> So here is a promise that God will give us these things, although we do not ask for them. And he said further, <hi>The Gentiles seek after these things;</hi> importing, that even to pray unto God for Temporal Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, was but a part of the Gentiles Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which was but low and weak in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Christian Religion, which leads further to ask Spiritual and Heavenly Things, and little or nothing to mind Worldly or Temporal. And Christ said unto them further, <hi>For your Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth that ye have need of all these things,</hi> Matth. 6. 31, 32, 33. Hereby signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, that if we did not seek them they would be given us, because we have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident and tender Father, that regardeth us and all our Necessities, even as the Fathers of our Flesh provided for us, and gave us things we wanted, when we neither did nor could ask them, as in the time of our Infancy; and as to these words which Christ taught his Disciples to pray, saying, <hi>Give us this day our daily Bread.</hi> That cannot be proved that that Bread was the Natural Bread, that the Natural and Outward Body wanteth. And <hi>Ierome,</hi> one of the Fathers, so called, who lived above twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago, did read or translate the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95820:20"/>
words, <hi>Give us this Day our Super substantial Bread;</hi> the which Translation, many, called Learned Men, say; the <hi>Greek</hi> will bear. But passing the Translation, it is very unlikely and improbable, that it can be meant of Natural Bread, which is but a Temporal and Corruptible thing; for it is the first Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition in that Prayer, in relation to our selves (the three former Petitions relating especially unto God) and it is placed in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before that Petition, wherein he taught them to Pray for <hi>Forgiveness of Sins;</hi> and the next following, <hi>That we be not led into Tentation, but that God would deliver us from Evil</hi> (or the evil one (to wit the Devil.) Now the matter of the two last Petitions being Spiritual things, how unprobable is it that Christ would teach them to seek first a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral thing, such as the Outward and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Bread is, before those Spiritual things; when at the same time he bids them <hi>Seek first the Kingdom of God and the Righteousness thereof:</hi> which comprehends all Spiritual things.</p>

as if we were to inform the Lord that we want them; or as if he did not know that we wanted those things before we pray unto him; for he knoweth most perfectly all our wants, even the most Inward and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, before we pray unto him, from whose all-seeing Eye nothing can be hid, whether past, present, or to come: But the great cause why the Lord will have us to pray unto him for Spiritual things, is, that thereby our desires are enlarged the more after them; our love is excited unto them, and all the Graces and Vertues, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Gifts of Gods Holy Spirit in us, are thereby quickened and <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>et on work in true Prayer; all which tend to our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and promoting us in the same. And seeing the substance of Prayer consists in the Souls desire after God, so as to be joined and united unto him, and be refreshed with his Love and Divine Influences of his Life; and to partake more abundantly of his Spirit; and to taste and feed upon his living Word, which is the same to the Soul that Bread and Meat, and Drink, o<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> any most comfortable thing is unto the Body; and that the Souls desire after those Heavenly and Divine Enjoyments, is enlarged in and by true Prayer: this, as it were, both gives
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95820:21"/>
and encreases the Souls appetite after God, and prepares the Soul for the enjoyment of him, by raising it on high, above all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things and the desires thereof; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <hi>Damascen</hi> and <hi>Augustine</hi> did well describe Prayer to be the ascent or lifting up of the mind unto God. Now the Souls Appetite after God, and the Divine things of his Kingdom, is as necessary to it as Hunger and Thirst is unto the Body: for as the Bodily Hunger and Thirst, 1. Makes the Nourishment which the Body receiveth, comfortable and pleasant unto it. And 2. It is a sign of Bodily Health in ordinary Cases. And 3. It causeth a good Digestion, so that the Body is the better and the more Nourished; even so it is as to the Souls Appetite and Desire after God, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshings that come from his Heavenly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, the which in Scripture is called a <hi>Hunger and Thirst,</hi> as Christ said, <hi>Blessed are they that Hunger and Thirst after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> &amp;c. And said <hi>David, My Soul thirsteth for God,</hi> Psal. 42. 2. The Soul which thus hungers and thirsts after God, and the enjoyment of him, when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth this enjoyment in any measure. Oh! How sweet and comfortable it is to the hungry Soul, but the full Soul even
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95820:21"/>
loaths the Hony-comb, whereas to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Soul every bitter thing is sweet; yea, even the Judgments and Chastnings of the Spirit of the Lord, which are sent unto the Soul, as it hath need of them, are sweet and precious unto it. 2. The Spiritual Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Thirst of the Soul, is alwaies a sign of the Souls Health and prosperous Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And 3. The Inward and Spiritual Food and Nourishment that the Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth, even that Living Bread and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Life, which cometh down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, doth the more nourish up the Soul unto Eternal Life, and causeth it to grow the more up into the Heavenly Image and Similitude of God and Christ; in all Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Righteousness, and Spiritual Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Glory, and also in Spiritual Might and Strength; and likewise in Wisdom and Counsel, and Knowledg and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. The more that the Souls De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires are enlarged after God, so the more the Soul desireth the more it feedeth upon the Bread of Life; which Bread is Christ the living Word; and the more it feedeth the more it groweth, and is nourished up unto his Heavenly and Divine Image: and the more it is nourished and groweth, the more again it desireth after God. And
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95820:22"/>
besides, In the true desire of the Soul after God and Christ, there is a true attractive Vertue, so to speak, which draweth or sucketh the Water of Life out of the Wells of Salvation, <hi>Isa.</hi> 12. 3. And both draweth Life from Christ (the Fountain of it) into the Soul, and draweth the Soul after Christ: Even as the desire that we have after the Air, causeth us to suck or draw it in to the inward parts of the Body: and as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants desire after the Mothers Milk, causeth it to suck and draw at the Breast, thus the Souls desire after God and Christ, draweth in a sweet and Heavenly Divine Breathing of his blessed Spirit, which it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain breatheth forth in Holy Breathings of Prayers and Thanksgivings: and those Souls, whose desires are living and fresh after God, as new born Babes (as the Scripture saith) <hi>They desire the sincere Milk of the Word that they may grow thereby.</hi> And thus it may appear why we should pray rather and mostly, if not only and altogether for Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Heavenly, then for Carnal and Earthly Things; because the desire of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Heavenly Things, doth purifie and sanctifie the Soul, and raiseth it up after them, and maketh the Soul like unto them; yea, transformeth into the nature
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95820:22"/>
and likeness of them; for Love and Desire have a wonderful transforming power in them, whether Natural or Spiritual. And therefore the love of Heavenly and Spri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Things, makes the Soul Heavenly and Spiritual; the love of God in the Soul, makes it Godly and God-like, and the love of Christ makes it Christ-like, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble him in his manifold Graces and Vertues: but the love and desire of Earthly and Worldly Things, makes not the Soul Heavenly and Spiritual, but rather Earthly and Worldly; and therefore they are little or nothing to be desired, in comparison of those Heavenly and Spiritual Things.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Prayer is either Private or Publick, as also it is either Mental or Vocal. Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Prayer is the Cry of the Heart unto or after God, as it is said, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>Their Heart cryed unto the Lord.</hi> And as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 26. 9. said, <hi>With my Soul have I desired thee in the Night, yea, with my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within me will I seek thee early.</hi> Again, Mental Prayer may be either with words conceived in the Heart, but not expressed with the Mouth and Lips, as that of the <hi>Psalms</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Commune with your own Heart</hi>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:95820:23"/>
                        <hi>upon your Bed:</hi> Or as the old Latine hath it, <hi>Speak in your Hearts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and be still.</hi> And such kind of Mental Prayer was that which <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant used, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 45. <hi>And</hi> (said he) <hi>before I had done speaking in my Heart,</hi> &amp;c. As also that of <hi>Moses</hi> in the Red Sea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>And the Lord said unto</hi> Moses, <hi>wherefore eryest thou unto me.</hi> But we read not that any words of Prayer were expressed by <hi>Moses</hi> at that time; or that (to wit, Mental Prayer) may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all words, so much as conceived in the mind, in a deep silence of all words, such as that in the <hi>Psalms</hi> 62. 1. Where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hebrew it is, <hi>Truly my Soul is silent unto God.</hi> For seeing the substance of Prayer consisteth in the Souls desire after God, and that desire may be in the Soul without words, so much as conceived; even as a natural desire after Meat or Drink, may be in us without words, therefore there is a Praver that may be in the Heart or Spirit of Man, without words, so much as inwardly conceived; the which Prayer is oft times the most effectual and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, for it may remain continually in the Soul, without any intermission, as it doth in every good man; by which Prayer he doth pray continually, or without ceasing,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95820:23"/>
as the Scripture requireth; for the Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire after God, may remain a constant and perpetual thing, by which it continually prefleth after God, as the stone continually inclineth to the center; or as the Needle of the Compass, that is well touched with the Load-stone, and hath drunk in, or received the magnetical virtue thereof, continually pointeth Northward; and if it be at any time diverted by any violent motion, it ceaseth not until it hath arrived at its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer station: And thus it is with the soul that is effectually touched with Gods living Arm and Power, that its desire is continually after him; and that desire causeth in it a continual motion towards him, and to his holy and blessed will to know and perform it. Vocal Prayer is that which is made unto God, both with the Heart and Mouth, in words audibly uttered or expressed. And betwixt Mental and Vocal Prayer, there is a mixt sort, where the words are not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly expressed to the hearing of others, but yet come up from the Heart into the Mouth, where they are secretly or silently whispered, such as the Prayer of <hi>Hannah</hi> was, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 12, 13. <hi>And it came to pass as she continued praying before the Lord, that</hi> Eli <hi>marked her Mouth. Now</hi> Hannah <hi>she</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Upon some solemn or extraordinary occasions it may be used, as if such a wicked Law should be made that no man should pray unto God, as in the case of <hi>Daniel,</hi> cap. 7. Where it was decreed that none should ask any thing for thirty daies, but of the King; <hi>Daniel</hi> found himself the more concerned to bear a testimony against such a Law or Decree, that even his private Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er came under the observation of his accusers, so that he could not satisfie himself with meer inward and mental Prayer, which none of them could observe. And it seemeth it had been <hi>Daniel</hi>'s custom formerly so to do, he living among Idolaters, that so he might more abundantly bear a Testimony against their false Worship, and for the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the True and Living God. Again, 2. Vocal Prayer in private may be the more freely used, when any hath the opportunity of some remote or retired place, where none are within the reach of hearing them; for sometimes the earnestness and pressure of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in their earnest wrestling with the Lord,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95820:24"/>
may provoke, and constrain some to use Vocal Prayer, and sometimes the using of it, helps them that are weak, to excite and make them more servent and lively; but it is to be used with great wariness and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when used in private, to take away all occasion of Ostentation or Hypocrisie, which is too incident to many, who pray, or cry out their private Prayers, of purpose that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may hear them; as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> did of old, whose Hypocrisie Christ sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; and he taught his Disciples the best manner to perform their private Devotions <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>But thou, when thou Prayest, enter into thy Closet, and when thou hast shut thy Door, Pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thee openly.</hi> Now as this Closet, or secret Chamber, may partly be understood to be outward, when men have the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity thereof, or any outward place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement; yet because it oft falleth out to good Christians, that they have no Closet, or outward Place of Retirement, many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oft confined to a Prison, where they must alwaies be in Company with others, and sometimes with bad People: In that case the Lords Servants have the Closet of their Hearts to retire into, at all times, where
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95820:25"/>
they may freely pray unto the Lord in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret: and here also they must be careful to shut their Door, to wit, the Door of their Heart, whereby shut out and exclude all i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and wandering Thoughts and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yea all thoughts even of their Lawful occasions, that their hearts and thoughts may be wholly exercised for that space of time, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lord, as he shall be pleased to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist them.</p>

                        <hi>Q</hi> Is it not requisite and necessary that every true Christian set apart some time every day, in a Solemn way for Meditation and Private Prayer (as well as that some time is set apart once or twice every Week by a company of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians for publick Worship) where opportunity can be had?</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> That some part of our time is to be set apart for private Prayer and Meditation, and waiting upon God, as well as for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayer and Worship, or any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious performance, is most clear from the practise and example of the Servants of God, both in the <hi>Old and New Testament;</hi> for not only the Prophets of old, under the old <hi>Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> used frequent times of retirement to give themselves in a Solemn and peculiar way, to waiting upon God, Meditation, and Prayer; as did <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:95820:25"/>
                        <hi>David, Elijah, Daniel,</hi> &amp;c. But Christ himself used such Solemn times, and so did the Apostles. As concerning Christ, it is said, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>And when he had sent the Multitudes away, he went up into a Mountain apart to Pray: And when the Evening was come, he was there alone.</hi> And a little before his Passion, or outward suffering, at the place called <hi>Gethsemane, Matth.</hi> 26. 36. he retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Disciples, and Prayed alone at three several times, saying, <hi>O my Father if it be possible let this Cup pass from me! Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> Next as for the Apostles, we find in the <hi>Acts,</hi> cap. 10. 9. <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>went up upon the House (in some upper Chamber) to Pray about the Sixth Hour.</hi> Which according to the Jewish Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Hours, was the middle of the Day. And no doubt <hi>Peter</hi> made it his frequent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise to retire himself thus unto Prayer. And <hi>Paul</hi> after his Conversion (lodging at the House of <hi>Iudas)</hi> was exercised in Prayer, when <hi>Ananias</hi> was sent to him; at which time he had a Vision of <hi>Ananias</hi> his coming; as <hi>Peter</hi> had of the Vessel coming down from Heaven, as he was at Prayer in private, in the House of <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Tanner:</hi> Thus we see how the Lord did bless and countenance such solemn private exercises of Prayer, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95820:26"/>
his Servants. And no doubt the same was the practise of the other Apostles, and servent Christians of those times: But as to any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited time for Prayer, we find no Precept in the Scripture for Christians, or those who live in Gospel Times. Under the Law, Morning and Evening Sacrifices were to be offered up, which no doubt were accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Prayer by the Faithful. <hi>David</hi> said, Morning and Evening, and Mid-day, he would call upon the Lord, yea, Seven times a Day; and <hi>Daniel</hi> used Thrice in the Day to pray unto the Lord. And surely the Devotion and Fervent Zeal of Christians, should be no less in Gospel Times, than was theirs under the Law; but rather more and more frequently exercised: Although Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are not under any tye or command gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in general; as to the number of times, how oft to be retired out of all worldly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions; to give themselves solemnly to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er every day; that and many other things being wholly left to the direction and guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Holy Spirit, which as it teacheth all true Christians what and how to Pray; so no doubt it sheweth also the times when; which times are frequent even of the Holy Spirit, his moving of the Souls and Hearts of true and tender Christians, who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95820:26"/>
acquainted with the movings and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the same. And if by outward occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions such true and tender Christians may be diverted, or hindred by some inevitable lets or hindrances, as to the outward; as oft fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out that they cannot have either conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of time or place to be so frequently retired, in the outward posture of Prayer; they will, and ought to take care to supply it another way; that every day (at least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, if not outwardly) they have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent times to be retired into the Closet of their Hearts (the Door of their Hearts being shut) and there in secret to Pray unto the Lord, laying aside all wordly thoughts for that time. Nor is it safe to neglect this exercise, or lay it aside upon the pretence of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and continual sort of Prayer, which consists in the Soul's desire after God, and may well be without all words, so much as inwardly conceived; for no doubt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles had this constant sort of Prayer, that consists in a manner wholly (or for the most part) in the will, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and affections of the Soul, which keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Hearts continually in a godly and spiritual frame; but notwithstanding of this, they used also frequent Solemn times of that other kind of Prayer, which exerciseth not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95820:27"/>
only the will and affections, but the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing also, whereby they spoke unto God, at least in their Hearts, words of Prayer which some call discursive Prayer, or the Prayer of Meditation, the which is frequently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be performed by every true and good Christian, for the strengthening and encreasing the Prayer of the will and desire which ought to be a continual thing, and without the said discursive Prayer used at least in the Heart, and that frequently the prayer or desire of the will groweth flat and dull, yea languisheth and is ready to die, and be extinguished, unless it be helped and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted with discursive Prayer and Meditation, in the frequent exercise of it: For discursive Prayer when duly and rightly performed, exciteth and stirreth up the Prayer of desire, even as the blowing of the Bellows, makes the Fire to burn the better, and raiseth it into a bright and burning Flame. And the Prayer of desire, which is principally lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the will and affections, is like the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual motion of the heart, in the body of a living man, which must be preserved, and assisted with Eating and Drinking, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward Labours and Exercises of the Body, without which the inward motion of the Heart would soon fail, and he extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95820:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nor is it sufficient for any to excuse their not using this kind of Prayer, by speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God in their Hearts, upon a pretence of not being called or moved thereunto by the Holy Spirit; for whoever do not find themselves frequently called and moved to such a Divine and Heavenly Exercise, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding necessary to every true Christian, it is too manifest an evidence that they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and earthly; also that they have quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Spirit, and resisted the same, and that they are got into a false liberty of their flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will, out from under the Yoak and Cross of Christ, whereas all such who keep under his blessed Yoak and Cross, to crucifie self, and all the thoughts and desires thereof, are kept in a living, tender, and sensible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Soul and Heart, and these feel the callings and movings of the Holy Spirit, to be frequent in them, to Prayer, Meditation, giving of Thanks, and all other necessary Duties, and such continually watch unto Prayer, and are still waiting for the Spirit's gentle and soft breathings, and the more they wait for them the more they find them, and have experience of them.</p>

                        <hi>A.</hi> It is somewhat hard and difficult to express the manner of the Spirits helping us to pray in words; for all the Operations of the Spirit, are better and more clearly felt and perceived in the Souls of them, who wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness them, than they can be uttered or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in words. And it is very hard to express the manner of the natural Operations of a man; as how he seeth, heareth, smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, tasteth and feeleth, or how he speaketh, and how the words arise from his mind and heart, until they come to his mouth; and how the Mouth, Tongue and Lips, do ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them: And if these natural Operations, whereof we have daily experience, are so hard to be explained (as to the manner of them; how much more hard and difficult are they, which are Spiritual and Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95820:28"/>
to be clearly explained and expressed in Words, unless the Lord give an ability in a good measure?

                     <p>And now to the Question, I Answer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and positively thus; that the Soul and its powers, are not wholly and altogether passive, and meerly receptive, or recipients in this case (as Water-conduits, or Wax and Clay in respect of the Seal) but partly passive, and partly active; as the Earth is in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of its Fruits and Vegetables; or as the Womb of the Mother is in bringing forth of her Children, for both the Earth and the Woman, are active as well as passive, in the production of their respective Births, and bring them forth from the Seeds which they have received.

And hence it is that dead and fruitlesssouls in Scripture, which are empty of good Fruits, are compared to dry and barren Trees, and also to barren Ground, as the good and honest Heart in the Parable, is compared to good Ground, which brought forth some an Hundred Fold, and some Sixty, and some Thirty. And said <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist to the Pharisees, <hi>Bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance; for now the Ax is laid to the Root of the Tree, every Tree therefore that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewed down and cast into the Fire.</hi> Now true Prayer is one of these good Works and Fruits, which the Souls of the Faithful bring forth unto God the Husband-man, as a natural Tree bringeth forth its natural Fruit, from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of activity in its own Nature, as it is assisted and helped by the influences of the Heavens, and especially the heat and warmth of the Sun, and the Heavenly Dews and Rains. And certainly the Prayers of the Prophets and other Holy Men and Women recorded in the Scripture, were of this sort; God moved and wrought upon their Souls, and the powers and faculties thereof, from the highest to the lowest, and caused them all to concur, and made them fruitful to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95820:29"/>
bring forth Holy Prayers and Praises unto God: And thus was it also with them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their Preaching and Writing the Holy Scriptures, in doing of which they were not bare passive Instruments; but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly active, and partly passive for most part at least, as is demonstrable from the variety of stile, and different manner of expression used by the Writers and Pen-men of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, the Holy Spirit acting upon them, according to the diversity of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, as well as spiritual Capacities, and gifts whether natural or acquired wherewith they were endued. So that as the Fruits of the Earth, with their beautiful forms and shapes, and diversity of Colours, proceed not from the Earth alone, nor from the Sun and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens alone, but from both acting partly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and as the Child which the Mother brings forth, in the comely and beautiful linements and proportion of its form, is not the Mothers Child alone, but the Fathers also. So all true Preaching and Praying, which proceeds from the Spirit of God: and also true and right Meditation and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, or any other true spiritual and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Performances, is a Birth of two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, whereof the Faithful Soul is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and God by the working of his Spirit
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95820:30"/>
is the Father: And therefore it is that all Faithful Souls in Scripture, are called the Spouse of the Lord, and the Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Christ's Wife; because as the Wife bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth true and lawful Children to her Husband lawfully begot of him; so the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul brings forth as it were Spiritual Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto God and Christ (whose Father God is) by the working of his Holy Spirit: And these Spiritual Children are good Words and Works which the Soul brings forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, by the help of his Holy Spirit. And therefore all such Preaching, and Praying, and Thanksgiving, which proceed not from the Spirit of God in its inward workings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul: And also, all kind of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or any other performance or work, that is offered up unto God, without the said inward working of the Holy Spirit, is but a spurious and bastard-brood, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore be received and accepted of the Lord, who only accepteth what is of his own begetting in the Soul. For what man will accept of a Bastard as if it were his own Child?</p>
                     <p>Now in this doth appear both the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Love of God, that he hath made the Soul an active as well as passive Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to joyn and co-operate with him in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95820:30"/>
his work and service, and in all what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of it. And that there are none of the powers or abilities of the Soul or Faculties of it, from the lowest to the highest; but they may be actively imployed in some part of his service, as the Imagination, the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Reason and Understanding of Man, and its institutive Faculty, which being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and made alive in man, through the Work of Regeneration, can see and behold God, as he doth reveal and discover himself to his Children, many times without all words, so much as inwardly conceived, or remembred, though all times it pleaseth God to make use of Words, and through them, as through the Lattess, to show himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul; as also, God maketh use of the Will, Love and Affections of his People, in the day of his power, making them a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling People, giving them not only to think and understand what his good and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and holy will is, but also to will and to do it. For thus the Faculties and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Soul, which God hath given it, are most nobly and excellently exercised, when they are exercised in his service imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and attain to their noblest and best end; and herein is the Wisdom and Love of God also manifest, that the Soul being
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95820:31"/>
thus made active with all its powers, abilities, and faculties, in the works and service of God, as co-works with him; the Soul it self is the more delighted, and hath the more joy and pleasure in those works, when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecteth on them, and considereth them, as having a share in them, as the Mother hath in the Children whom she hath conceived and brought forth; for as it is natural to all Mothers to love their own Children whom they have conceived and born, and suffered for, so is it also natural to the Soul to love its works which it hath wrought in God, and take delight or pleasure in them, as God doth in his; and as the Mother loveth her own Children whom she hath conceived and born, and travelled in great pangs to bring forth into the World, more than she loveth any other Children whom she hath not born, although these other may be more beautified, so the Soul loveth and delighteth most in those works which it bringeth forth (as the fruit of its Womb) through the assistance of God's Holy Spirit, and it is well allowed of the Lord so to do, provided it be with due moderation, for this is a part of our own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, even to rejoyce in good works, which the Lord hath enabled us to perform, but the praise is wholly and alone to be given
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95820:31"/>
unto the Lord for them all, for he it is who hath given to the Soul its being, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and every ability both Natural and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, so as without him it could not do any thing that is good, neither Spiritual nor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. They, are therefore greatly mistaken who think (as some foolishly and idly have done, and Printed it against us) that because we plead for the Spirits Immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Teaching, and Immediate assistance to help us in attaining the true knowledg of God, in right and true Meditations, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Prayers, Thanksgivings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That therefore we lay aside not only the use of the Scripture, and other outward means and helps, but also the whole use of our Reason and Understanding as men, and of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faculties and abilities of our Souls, and become as so many dead and unactive Truncks, Stocks or Stones, or as if we did judg that the Divine Revelations, Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Motions of God's Holy Spirit, helping us to know and understand Divine things, to Meditate, to Preach, and Pray, and give Thanks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did pass through us, as a Sound passeth through a hollow Cave, or as Water through a bare Conduit. These and such like absurd consequences, are but the idle and foolish dreams of mens vain
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95820:32"/>
imaginations, who (as it too much appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) have never had any experience of, or acquaintance with the operations of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit in their own Hearts. Know then that we do believe, know and witness it to be Truth, that when God's Holy Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spireth us immediately, and moveth us to Preach, or Pray, or give Thanks, as it did Holy Men of God of old, and Holy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men also, even Daughters as well as Sons, and Maid-servants, as well as Men-servants, and so doth at this day; the said Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit worketh upon our Understandings and Reasons, as we are Men and reasonable Creatures, and upon all the powers and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of our Souls, according to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral capacities, and the Graces and Spiritual Gifts we have received from God, and all that is in us of parts, whether natural or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, or supernatural, and maketh them serviceable to us, and active in the work and service of God, more or less as he pleaseth. And thus when we pray or give thanks in Words, as we receive these words from the Lord (when the Prayer and Thanksgiving is purely and rightly performed) so they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so spring up in us from the fruitfulness of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and those parts and graces which God hath given us, and our Hearts
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95820:32"/>
and Souls, and Spirits, are the Mothers that bring them forth, and the good matter and purposes whereof they declare, together with the good life, vertue, and force or energy that is in them, or doth accompany them. Hence true and right Prayer in Scripture is called <hi>A pouring out of the Soul and Heart,</hi> so that somewhat of the very inward strength, vertue and power of the Soul and Heart of man, yea of his Spirit, or what is most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and excellent in him goeth forth in words, whether of Preaching or Praying, or giving of Thanks, as he is truly and fervently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in the same, by the moving and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling of the Holy Ghost (according to which <hi>David (Psal.</hi> 103. 1.) stirred up not only his Soul to praise the Lord, <hi>but all that was within him</hi> [note] <hi>to bless his Holy Name.)</hi> Which tender and sensible hearers, whose Souls and Hearts God hath quickned and made alive, are well sensible of, and can and do well distinguish betwixt a dead and a living, or a barren and fruitful Ministry, whether in Preaching or Prayer. <hi>Habet enim nescio quid latentis energiae viva vox, &amp; transmiss<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

How much more is it apparent in words and speeches that are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, which come both from the Heart livingly touched, and affected with the sense of the things whereof the words declare, and also from the Spirit of the Lord? Hence it is said, <hi>that Christ spoke as one having autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and not as the Scribes;</hi> and the Apostles Preaching was with power and the Holy Ghost, and so no doubt was their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

cannot believe, nor are we convinced in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science?</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> To read set forms of Prayer out of a Book, whether in private or publick, and call that reading, Prayer, is any part of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Worship, or true and real Prayer, but rather one of the many Inventions and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Men since the Apostacy, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from the true Faith did enter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong (those called) Christians, who retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Name, but losed the power and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the true ancient and primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. For surely if it had been any part of Gospel Worship, Christ or the Apostles would have mentioned it, and the Scripture would have born record of it, as they do of all the parts of Gospel Worship and true Christian Religion: And if it had been the Will of God, that such a way of Worship should have been used in the true Church as a common Liturgy or set Form of Prayers, it would have been used in the Apostles days; for none were so fit to have given forth such forms of Prayers, after Christ his Ascension, and giving of the Holy Ghost, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were, who were so abundantly reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the Holy Spirit. But neither the Apostles, nor their immediate Successors ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made or used any such set Forms of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95820:34"/>
read Prayers. Nothing of this kind was known in the Church, either in <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> or <hi>Tertullian</hi> his time, who lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Two Hundred Years after Christ; for <hi>Tertullian</hi> telleth plainly the manner how Christians Prayed in his time, <hi>Ex pertore sue Monitore, per Spiritum Sanctum.</hi> i. e. <hi>From the Heart without a Monitor</hi> (or any thing outwardly to teach them) <hi>and by the Holy Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But Secondly, They who plead for using read set Prayers in the Church, do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg they were not in use nor practised in the Apostles days, nor in the days of their immediate Successors; for they grant that in those early and primitive times, they who prayed in the Church as the mouth of the whole Congregation, were assisted and guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Holy Spirit, and that their Words both of Prayer and singing Psalms, were by immediate Inspiration. So that it is as clear as the Noon-day, that when these Divine Gifts of Praying and Singing by the Spirit were lost, and the Holy Spirit himself (the Author and Fountain of those Gifts) was in great measure departed from, the invention of reading ser Forms of Prayer took place. The first Instance that I find of Peoples being put to use a composed or set Form of Prayer
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95820:34"/>
made by another, was that Form of Prayer which <hi>Constantine</hi> the great composed, and gave to his Soldiers to say, but yet they were not to read it, but get it by Heart; and we must consider that <hi>Constantine</hi> himself, at this time, was but a young Christian, and the purity of Spiritual Worship began to decline apace even in his daies, and most of his Souldiers were Heathens and no Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; so that what they did was no president to us. But neither in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time, nor a considerable space thereafter do I find, that any made or composed Prayers before-hand, were used in the Church. It seemeth the Third Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> about the year after the Birth of Christ, 397. did first ordain Set Forms of Prayer in the Church, to prevent or hinder mens uttering any thing, either ignorantly or rashly that might be contrary to the Doctrine then received. And to say the truth, it is altogether unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that men should use extemporary words of Prayer, who do not know the leading and assistance of God's Holy Spirit to direct them in the words and matter they utter, for it cannot be expected, but that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they will speak amiss, and deviate or wander into impertinent expressions, or words contrary to Truth, whose Hearts
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95820:35"/>
and Tongues are not guided by the Spirit of Truth, even as a Ship, if she be let loose to Sail without a Pilot, or one to rule the Helm, cannot but go astray, and of two I have alwaies judged it the least inconvenience, since God gave me a right understanding what Prayer is, rather to use a Set Form of sound words, than to allow or permit men (without a reproof) to presume to speak words of Prayer unto God, of their own extemporary conceiving, without the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and direction of the Holy Spirit, and who do not so much as pretend unto it, as many do not. As for those who are against the using of Set Forms of Prayer, upon a pretence of Praying by the help of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and yet plainly deny and vigorously oppose all Immediate Inspiration and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, since the Apostles daies, I cannot see how they can clear or rid themselves of a contradiction, and of being guilty of an horrid Impostor and Cheat; for when they argue with such as are for Set Forms of Prayer, they seem to be altogether for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Spirit, and make it the main Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against Set Forms of Prayer, that they quench, and limit the Spirit, but when they argue with these who are indeed for Praying by the Spirit, and who do affirm,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95820:35"/>
that the Spirit of God is to be kept unto in Prayer, and not to be limitted neither as to a Set Form of words formerly made and composed by others, nor as to a set time, when man or men please, to begin or end; nor as to the persons who may or do Pray in Assemblies. Here these are as great limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Spirit as any, for they can, and do Pray when they will, and how long they will, begin and end when they will, which doth evince, that they have not a regard to the Spirits time and season of moving them to Pray, otherwise they would silently wait for it, seeing few (if any) upon Earth, are so replenished with the Spirit, as to be ready upon all occasions, and at all times to Pray vocally, or in words by the Spirit as the Mouth of the Assembly of the People unto God; and to be sure, as no Prophecy came of Old in the will of man, so no motion of the Spirit cometh now in the will of men, and men cannot use the Spirit or its help, either to Preach or Pray, as they use a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral habit of Writing, or Singing, or Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a Musical Instrument, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits they can use at any time, according to their natural will and pleasure, because they have the command over them, and are, as it were, Masters of those natural habits and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95820:36"/>
Arts. But it were the highest presumption, for any man to think that he hath the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Spirit, to use it when, and where, and how he pleaseth: For the best of men, are and ought to be the servants or Ministers of the Spirit, as <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apostles were; and therefore the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit did command, lead and order them in all their Services, and so it did all other true and faithful Ministers, who were therefore to attend unto it, and wait the seasons of the Spirits movings, as those who at the Pool waited for the stirring of the waters by the Angel, and therefore true Christians and Ministers are bid, <hi>Watch unto Prayer.</hi> And said Christ unto the Apostles, <hi>Wait for the Promise of the Father, which ye have heard of me,</hi> Acts 1. 4. Again, If those men were for the true liberty of Praving by the Spirit, they would suffer; yea, not only suffer, but encourage any other in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to Pray vocally; or in words by the Spirit as well as they, according to the practise of the ancient and primitive Church, when the gift of Praying and Singing by the Inspiration of the Spirit did remain, but no such thing is permitted by these Men, who will suffer none but themselves, and such as they give power unto, to use vocal
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95820:36"/>
Prayer in their Assemblies, as if these Men because forsooth, they are Masters of a few Natural Arts, or at least called so, were Masters of the Spirit, and that holy and blessed Spirit of Truth, must speak in none but whom they please and give leave unto; yea, the Holy Spirit of God must be silent in his Children and Servants at their will and command. These and many other instances, which could be given, do evince, that these men, though they pretend to pray by the Spirit, are as great strangers unto it, for most part, and unto true pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Spirit, as they who have no such pretence; and they who have no such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as to pray by the Spirit, in respect of conceiving and uttering the words of Prayer, are an hundred fold more ingenious and more commendable, on that account, for their plainness and ingenuity; who, as they have not that Divine Gift of Praying in words by the Spirit, so do not pretend unto it, but simply and plainly speak it out, that they have it not; which is a great deal more honestly done than those do who have it not, and yet pretend to it, and that pretence deceives simple People, as if their Prayers were by the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they conceive them <hi>ex tempore,</hi> though
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95820:37"/>
the raw indigested matter of their Prayers, and unsound expressions as they often use, as well as the great deadness and want of life, that doth accompany their Prayers, for the most part, sufficiently demonstrate they are not from the Spirit of God. But that which adds to the cheat and imposture, to make it the greater, is, that some, yea, many or them have got an Art, by affected Eloquence, or some new invented Phrases, followed with a mighty seeming Zeal and Fervency of Spirit, to play upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Natural Affections and Passions, and excite them at their pleasure, which the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant People for want of a Spiritual Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, do imagine to be the real work and effect of Gods Holy Spirit, when for most part, it is nothing else but the animal and natural Passions in the Hearers, excited either by Art in the Speakers, or at least by the same or like Passions in them, who speak both in their Preachings and Prayings, for like stirreth up and begetteth its like, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Poet, <hi>Si vis me flere dolendum est primum ipsitibi,</hi> i. e. If thou wilt have me weep, thou must first weep thy self before me. And though I am far from condemning any true tenderness and contrition of Heart, or inward meltings of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95820:37"/>
the Soul, which are caused by the real working of the Holy Spirit, which may have its visible Effects, even the shedding of Tears in him that Preacheth or Prayeth; and that more or less abundantly: yet the hypocritical show and affection of such a thing, without the reality thereof, is loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and abominable; and as great a Transgression against the Law of Heaven; as false and counterfeit Money or Coin is against any Earthly Law: And yet such hypocritical Tears and Flashes of fained De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, kindled up by Sparks of their own raising, abounding among too many of that Tribe and Generation, as if they were the effects of Gods Holy Spirit, when alass it is far the contrary. But to such as have any measure of Sobriety and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity among them, I propose this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion to be answered in plainness and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity by them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. How can they pretend to pray by the Spirit in words, and yet they deny all immediate Inspiration and Revelation; which alone guided and assisted those who prayed by the Spirit in words, recorded in the Holy Scriptures?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By what Rule or Touchstone do they know when they are assisted and helped
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95820:38"/>
by the Spirtt to pray in words, and when not, seeing they deny the Holy Spirit, as he doth inwardly reveal himself in Mens Hearts, to be the rule in any case?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When they are not moved by the Holy Spirit, and that they do not find themselves so moved as to pray in words, whether in that case, seeing they will needs pray, as well when they want the Spirits help, as when they have it, and that they plead: Natural Men, who have not the Spirit of God, may be true Ministers of Christ, and may and ought lawfully to Preach and Pray, if they have an outward Call, from them; they should not rather use the set Forms of Prayer, than their own bare invention and wandring imagination: for here their great Argument against set Forms of Prayer, hath no place, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the limiting or stinting the Spirit of God; because he who prayeth in words without the Spirit, whether by a Book or <hi>ex tempore</hi> without a Book, is in one and the same case, if none of them pray by the Spirit, for he who hath not the Spirit, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said to limit or stint it. But to this I know they will reply, that natural and unconverted men, though they have not the Grace of the Holy Spirit to sanctifie
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95820:38"/>
and saye them, yet they have a Gift of Preaching and Praying by the Spirit, that may be useful and edifying to the Church, they have <hi>Gratia gratis data</hi> (as they call it) but not <hi>Gratia gratum faciens,</hi> i. e. Grace freely given them, but not Grace rendring them acceptable unto God; and for this they give the instance or Example of <hi>Balaam.</hi> To this I answer, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction used so much of <hi>Gratia gratis data,</hi> and <hi>Gratia gratium faciens,</hi> hath not any warrant from Scripture, but is borrowed in express words from popish School-men and Jesuits, whom at other times they call <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs, Come out of the bottomless Pit.</hi> And as for <hi>Balaam,</hi> it was somewhat an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary case, whereby God shewed his mighty Power that he had over his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to cause him to Prophecy good things concerning <hi>Israel,</hi> contrary to his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; and to bless instead of cursing them: but an extraordinary Example is not to be made a Rule or President unto us. And indeed they have but a sad pattern of him, whom rather they follow and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate for most part, in loving and taking the wages of Unrighteousness, then in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying or speaking by the Spirit of God, as he did, at these few extraordinary times.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95820:39"/>
And though he prophesied some words by the Spirit, yet we do not read that ever God made him the Mouth of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, to pray by the Spirit, which is the present case. And besides, though he Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied twice or thrice by the Spirit of God, which was extorted from him, contrary to his own evil mind and inclination; yet he was no true Prophet of God, but beareth the infamous mark of a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to this day; and we do not read that ever any one Soul was converted to God by his Prophecying or Ministry. God can command the Devils, if he please, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to Christ, as some of them did of old, which yet is no president for wicked men, in whom the Devil rules, to Preach and Pray in the Church. Now, whereas they say, Men may have a Gift of Prayer to use it in the Church, from the Spirit of God, and yet be not sanctified by the Spirit. I ask them, Is it such a Gift as can secure them from speaking impertinent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound words, contrary to the truth: if yea, then they have an infallible Gift, which seeing they will not grant unto themselves, no more will they unto these others. And if it cannot secure them from unsound and impertinent words, but leaves them at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

as much to use unfound words as sound; and that the corruption of their Hearts, who are but meer Natural Men, will soon cast the Ballance, and byass them rather to use the unsound words than the sound. Is it not more safe in that case, at least the less inconveniency of the two, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be tied and limited to use 2 form of sound words, then that their corrupt and unrenewed Hearts. However, so much they imagine it is to be helped with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified Gift, of an abused Eloquence, should be left at liberty to speak unto God, and utter before him whatever it pleaseth. But if we shall search to the bottom, what this Spiritual common Gift of the Spirit is, we shall find it to be no other but some meer Natural Gift of Memory, Elocution, and a ready or quick Fancy and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which many Heathenish Idolatrous Priests have had as much as any of them; improved with some acquired Arts of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, Logick and Rhetorick, and words of Scripture abused and misapplied by them: and that which crowns all, some more than ordinary degree of confidence; that when they are thus furnished, and can or do Preach and Pray by those meer natural and artificial helps at best, to call them and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95820:40"/>
baptize them into the name of a Spiritual Gift, or the Spirits help and assistance. But leaving these men, and their <hi>ex tempore</hi> praying without the Spirit, which thus far I found my very Soul and Spirit concerned to discover, in true love and compassion, to their abused and betrayed Hearers and Followers; and to them also if they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. I shall return to plead a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the true and right manner of praying in words by the Spirit, as he is pleased to give assistance, both in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and utterance, without any set Form, either read out of a Book, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated from the Memory without a Book. Because,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This way of Praying doth alone and only answer to the liberty of the Spirit, which is free, even the Holy Spirit of Truth, and neither will nor can be limitted, and who seek to limit him, he departs from them, in so far and remaineth still in his own freedom, altho such who seek to limit the Spirit by using Set Forms, may and do quench the Spirit, as unto themselves. But they think there is no limitting, or quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or grieving of the Spirit in the case, because they believe there is no such gift in the Church remaining since the primitive
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95820:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
times, as to be helped by the Spirit to Pray in words, either in the conceiving or utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. They grant indeed so far the help and assistance of the Spirit, and acknowledg it altogether necessary to Pray acceptably unto God, that the Holy Spirit stir up our desires and affections, and excite in us his own Graces, and the doing of this, as they say, is a sufficient helping of us by the Spirit, as well when a set Form of Prayer is used as otherwise. But why do they believe there is no such gift remaining in the true Church, seeing they generally confess it was in the Church, both in the Apostles daies, and some considerable time since. They say it ceased with the ceasing of the gift of Tongues and Miracles; but what ground have they for this? That is a bad Argument, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some of these Gifts which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and less necessary, did cease or discontinue, that therefore this allo did cease with those other. And seeing they do not profess to have the Spirit or Gift of Discerning, whereby to know, whether this Gift be in the Church or no. How do they know but some have it? And as they say, the Spirit is ceased in respect to help us to pray in words; so others do as confidently say, to wit, the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95820:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is ceased in all other respects, and there is no need of it, either to help us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive words of Prayer, or excite our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but that man by his free will, helped by the Scriptures, without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate help of the Spirit, can pray suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, both with good Words and fervent Affections. And yet even these will say, they are helped by the Grace of the Spirit, to wit, mediately and remotely, by means of the Spirit. Again, Why do they limit and stint the help and operation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, only to the Will and Affections, and to exciting the Graces of the Spirit in us. Doth not the Spirit operate upon the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, as well and as nearly, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and closely, as upon the Will and Affections? Are there not intellectual Graces and Gifts of the Spirit, to wit, such as properly belong to and are seated in the Understanding, as well as such that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Will? Do not we read in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as well of the Spirit of Wisdom and Knowledg, Counsel, Understanding, as of the Spirit of Love and Meekness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if they will grant that there are such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Graces, that belong to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as well as others that belong to the Will; shall not these intellectual Graces,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95820:41"/>
be made fruitful by the Spirit and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, in whom they reside and are placed, as well as these other in the Will. Again, Will they not grant that the Spirit helpeth us to conceive Words, at least in Meditation? Or will they confine us to see <note place="margin">☞</note> Forms of Meditation, as well as of vocal Prayer? I suppose not, seeing no such set Forms are yet extant: and they themselves take liberty to their Meditations upon reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious matters, and preach to the People these said Meditations; and yet I suppose they will reckon at times, the Spirit help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to conceive these Meditations, which cannot be conceived without words. And further, The words of these set Forms of Prayer, whence came they? Had the Spirit no influence upon the Understandings of those Men, who conceived them to help and assist them in those Conceptions? If they say nay, they will render the set Forms of Prayer of small value; what the People in that respect. But if they say the Spirit did help them to form these Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of the words of their set Prayers, then such a Gift is not ceased in the true Church, for it was in these men, who pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and conceived those Prayers; it may as well be in men now to conceive other words of Prayer. But</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:95820:42"/>
4. Praying by a set Form, not only tendeth to limit and stint the Spirit and quench it, in regard of its operations, but also it tendeth to make the Understanding, and divers other Faculties and Abilities, or Powers of our Souls, and the intellectual Graces and Vertues seated and planted in them, altogether barren and unfruitful, in respect of Prayer, which yet ought to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the Understanding, as much as any other thing; as <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>I will pray with the Spirit, I will pray with the Understanding also.</hi> For if the Understanding be limited to a set Form of Words, then there is no room nor place, nor liberty left for it to bring forth Prayer in any other Forms, the which seemeth verily as absurd to me: As who would limit the Earth to bring forth only such a limited and determined number of Forms of Vegetables, Flowers and Fruits; and not only so, but to limit her as to length, breadth, and depth of each Form, which we know is an impossible thing: for the Forms of all living and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, must have liberty to spring out from their respective Seeds, Principles, and Causes; otherwise they will not grow but wither and die: And as the Forms of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables must not be limited and stinted to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95820:42"/>
such peculiar Figures and Dimensions, much less the Forms of Animals, and yet far less the Forms and Figures of Mens Bodies and Faces. For among all the many millions of Mankind, that have been or are upon the Earth, never were any two found, but did more or less, differ in outward Form and Figure, in the Face or Countenance. And surely as differing as Mens Bodies and Faces are; so much, or rather more, do the Thoughts or Conceptions of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding differ; and to limit them all to one Form of inward conceptions of Words, is as vain as to stint and determine all Men to have one and the same Form of Visage or Countenance. And he who would go about to limit the Figure of the Childs Body and Face, in the Mothers Womb, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shape and form than God and Nature hath designed to have, would do amiss, and be occasion of causing the Womb to miscarry, and render it barren, rather than any way to help it. I know it is answered by some, that the fruitfulness of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, may show it self in other Exercises and Performances, whereas man also may use his Gifts freely, as in Preaching, Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Conference, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But why not in Prayer, as well as in these other for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strict;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95820:43"/>
yea, and to hinder and stop the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the Understanding, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Graces seated therein; in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect is of a tendency to stop its fruitfulness; and render it barren in other respects. A Woman that is with Child; and hath twins in her Womb, that is hard for to make her miscarry in the one, but she will miscarry also in the other; and he that seeks to kill one of the Twins in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Belly, shall be in hazard to kill the other also. But why should the one be killed or choaked more than the other? Or why should the Divine Begettings of Gods Holy Spirit in the Understanding of the Soul, as also in its Reason and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be strangled, more than these in the Will and Affections, feeing they have both one Father, which is God, as they have one Mother, which is the Soul. And also seeing what is begot by the Spirit of the Lord, in the Will and Desires, or Affections of the Soul, hath a great dependency what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got by the same Spirit, in the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Reason. For the Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, they love him as reasonable Creatures; and on reasonable accounts, and for reasonable causes; yea, they have the best and greatest reasons for to love him;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95820:43"/>
and those reasons are presented to the Soul by the Holy Spirit in the Understanding and reasonable Faculty. And it is generally acknowledged, that the Will and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do commonly follow the dictates and suggestions of the Understanding, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Thoughts of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether good or bad, do most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the Soul, the Will and Affections, with the Desires thereof, do imbrace what is presented, whether it be a true and real good, or only seeming and apparent. So that the Wills and Affections of all Men, are swayed by the strongest Dictates, which raise and spring up from their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and intellectual Faculties, whether true or false: And thus either Wisdom or Folly ruleth the Wills of all Men, with their Desires and Affections, and consequently all their Actions. All good Men are led by wise and good Counsels, which the Holy Spirit begets in them; and all bad and evil men, are led by foolish and evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels. And hence it is, that every good man is a wise man, and every wise man, who is truly so, is a good man, and every bad or evil man, is a fool, and is called so in Scripture, and all sin and wickedness is folly, and the real effect and fruit of it;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95820:44"/>
Seeing therefore all good inclinations, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Affections in the will of Man, Rise from good and wise Counsels in the Understanding and Reason of Man, we must needs say that the Holy Spirit doth operate in both Understanding and Will; and begets those good and wise Meditations and Conceptions of Truth, in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, before the good Inclinations and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which afterwards he begetteth and causeth to arise in the Will. But these good and wise Meditations and Counsels, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without words, at least inwardly spoke or conceived in the Reason, or rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Understanding of Man. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit of God doth no less help and assist the Understanding or Reason of Man; to conceive good Words, then it doth help the Will to conceive good Desires and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. It is therefore a great mistake and error of judgment, in those who think, that the Spirit of God doth only excite or beget in his Children, good Desires and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but doth not suggest unto them, or help them to conceive good words of Meditation, and that as well to pray and give thanks as to preach. And seeing Preachers are not stinted to set Forms of words in Preaching, why should they be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95820:44"/>
any more stinted to set forms in Praying, I cannot understand, for the Spirit of God is as near and ready to assist in the one as in the other; And if it be said that men Preach not <hi>ex tempore,</hi> but by study and long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation, and therefore they are in less danger to utter or express unsound and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent words in their deliberate and long premeditated Sermons, than in their extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Prayers. To this I Answer, 1. It is found by frequent experience; that even in those long studied and premeditated Sermons many men have uttered very impertinent and unsound, yea, false and hurtful words and expressions, for it is not much or long time to study or premeditate a Discourse that maketh it good or soundp; seeing they who err in their understandings; and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or drunk in wrong and false Doctrines and Principles of Religion, and wrong and false Traditional Glosses and Interpretations of Scripture, may Preach very unsound and erronious Sermons, altho they have taken a long time to study and prepare them. 2. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former Reply, If men shall study before-hand their Prayers as well as their Sermons, then they are in no greater danger to speak impertinent and unsound words in Prayer than in Preaching, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95820:45"/>
they are less obnoxious to such a danger, because in Prayer men commonly do not meddle with matters of controversie, or disputable points of Doctrine, as indeed it is not proper. 3. He who preacheth or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the true and real assistance of the Holy Spirit as he keepeth faithfully and carefully unto the same, altho what he doth either Preach or Pray proceedeth from premeditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It being impossible that the mouth can utter any thing, but the heart or mind of man, must first conceive it, which is a true and real kind of premeditation, yet he need eth not any long time for the said premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For when his heart and Soul is once well prepared and fitted to be the instrument of the Spirit, whether in Preaching or Pray ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (The which preparation of the Heart, at times, may require a considerable season, longer or shorter, as the man is more or less grown up in Vertue and Holiness) i<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the least space of time imaginable, as in moment or instant, when it pleaseth the Lord to assist the understanding by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influences of his Spirit, it can be and <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> is made fruitful to bring forth, and conceive as many solid and living Meditations <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Truth, as may sufficiently yield matter. <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> discourse, in true and sound and living words
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95820:45"/>
for divers hours. But if the Spirit should not suggest so much matter of discourse, in so short a space as a moment or instant; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as much as to furnish the Speaker with two or three Sentences, or perhaps but one Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence at first, before that one Sentence be well spoke, further matter may and doth oft arise from openings of life in the understanding of the Speaker to speak more, and so continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly still new matter may be and oft is afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to continue his speech longer or shorter, as it pleaseth the Lord to require, or as in the wisdom of God a service is seen or felt. And indeed various and manifold, as well as wonderful are the waies of the Lord towards his Servants, whose mouthes he doth open either in Preaching or Praying in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of his People. For sometimes as one waiteth upon the Lord in pure silence, and in holy fear and reverence, his heart at the present time being empty of all thoughts or meditations, in respect of any particular sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or matter of discourse, and not having one particular Subject more than another in his view, but his mind and Conscience singly exercised towards God, suddenly, and as in the twinkling of an eye a particular subject is presented unto him, or the opening of some particular place of Scripture (and here the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95820:46"/>
Lord chuseth his Text for him, and ground of his discourse; or if it be to Pray, the matter of his Prayer) and his heart that was empty before of thoughts, as to these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is now filled with living thoughts and meditations concerning them, being made fruitful to bring them forth by the showre or Rain of the Divine influence of the Holy Spirit, in a moment or twinkling of an eye. And at other times the case is otherwise, as a little at first given, and then a little more, as it pleaseth the Lord to order, and as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition either of the Speakers or Hearers doth require it; as even in natural conceptions of natural things, those men, who have a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful understanding, and a quick and ready invention, upon any fit occasion, how sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and as in a moment will plenty of good and pertinent matter arise in them to discourse of. If in a Lawyer to discourse of the Laws; if in a Physician to discourse of Physick, or in a Phylosopher to discourse of Moral or Natural subjects of Phylosophy, the which extemporary and ready discourses, when they come from a mans heart, and the real fruitfulness of his understanding, have alwaies more acceptance, and authority with the intelligent and discerning Hearers, than long studied or premeditated Speeches, which
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95820:46"/>
according to the Proverb, <hi>Smell of the Lamp,</hi> and have more of Art than of Nature in them, and more of Form than Substance. And extemporary discourses that flow and spring freely from the fruitfulness of a man's understanding, and the noble and generous parts or faculties of a well composed and clear mind, are like fresh waters that have newly streamed from the living Spring or Fountain of them, that on that very account are more sweet and pleasant than discourses long since premeditated and treasured up in the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which through their oldness, contract a certain tincture, and lose of their freshness and sweetness of savour, even as water long kept in a Cistern. And if these extempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry discourses of Natural things, flowing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a natural fruitfulness of man's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, have more acceptance and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the judicious Hearers, than long studied Sermons, dressed up with paint of Art, how much more are those extempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Speeches to be valued, and how much greater authority have they, and true and real acceptance with all discerning Hearers, whether in Preaching or Praying, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the rich and fruitful Soil of a good and honest heart, abundantly watered and made fruitful with the descendings of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95820:47"/>
venly Showres and Rains of Gods holy and blessed Spirit.</p>
                     <p>And if it be yet again Replyed, That the limitting or confining of him that prayeth to a Set Form, doth not hinder the fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his understanding, for his mind and understanding is still at liberty to have as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and as various good and holy Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and conceptions of thoughts and words, as is possible for him to contain or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; only he is outwardly limited to those forms, as to his Tongue and Mouth, whereas his mind and understanding doth remain free to abound in the greatest variety of good and holy thoughts and meditations: For the people who hear, they may also abound in these good thoughts and meditations, who notwithstanding do not open a mouth in the Assembly, either to Preach or Pray.</p>
                     <p>To this I Answer, As there are many good thoughts and meditations which God giveth unto men, for their own particular comfort and profiting, such as these which the people have who do not speak; so there are also many which God giveth for the comfort and profiting of others, and especially of the Church. And these ought not to be suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but uttered and brought forth in the Lord's leading and ordering, according to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95820:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his appointed time and season. And if the Lord move and require a man to bring forth these good things out of the good Treasure of his heart, as certainly at one time or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will so move and require, where these good things are given to the man, not for himself alone, but also for others. Is it not a plain limitting and confining the Spirit and mind of a man, not to give him liberty either in Preaching or Prayer, to bringforth what the Lord has put in his mind for that very purpose? Is not this like the hindring the Child to come out of the Mothers Belly, when its appointed time is come, and to make her Womb its Grave, then which what can be imagined more cruel? But</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There is this great hurt and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to limit and confine both Speakers and Hearers to Set Forms of Prayer, the one to Speak and Read them, the others to Hear them, that it cannot be supposed, that those Set and stinted Prayers will either alwaies, or at most times suit and agree with the present states and conditions of the people. The Scripture saith, <hi>That words spoken in season, are like pictures of Gold in Apples of Silver.</hi> And concerning <hi>Isaiah,</hi> it was said, <hi>That the Lord had given him a Word in Season to the weary Soul.</hi> And indeed a word spoken
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95820:48"/>
in season, whether it be in Preaching or Praying how sweet and comfortable it is? Now these Set Forms of Prayer being to be used accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Calendar, such Prayers on such a day, and others on other daies, as the Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, or order of the Service requireth: Can these Forms be alwaies, or for most part sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to the peoples states and conditions, unless it could be supposed, that the inward states and conditions of mens Souls and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris should regularly vary, according to the Seasons and Daies of the year, which were most absurd to think or imagin. Or how do these Set Forms of Prayer, which tell us daily what to Pray for, agree with <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 28. <hi>The Spirit also helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we should Pray for as we ought.</hi> And if it be said, That most of those Set Forms are conceived in such general words, that they may suit or agree with all the various states and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the peoples Souls. To this I Answer, To suit or agree with them in a general way is one thing, and to suit them in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular cases and circumstances is another. And besides, it is not upon the bare words of Prayer so much that relieveth and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Souls of people, as the life that goeth along in words that are uttered from the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95820:48"/>
heart of the Speaker, as God giveth him a sense of the various and several states and conditions of the Hearers, according to which sense of their various States, he is furnished both with sutable words, and a sutable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and measure of life to accompany them, wherewith to minister in Prayer, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the faint and weak desires of the Hearers many times are enlarged and strengthened. But it can never be supposed, that he who only reads a Set Form of Prayer out of a Book, according to the order of the Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, or repeats it from his memory, can Pray with either such fit and sutable matter of words, or can minister that sutable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and measure of life, that the Hearers require and stand in need of, for where the words are not seasonable, life will not join with them, to make them effectual and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Hearers. I know it will be hard for these who have not the inward experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the workings of the Divine Life and Spirit in their own Souls, to believe or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, how the Speaker, who is assisted to Preach, or pray with the Spirit of God, can have a distinct and clear feeling of the several states and conditions of the people, and in that sense and feeling be enabled by the same Spirit, who gave this sense to him, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95820:49"/>
to them all that which is seasonable, both for matter and life. However this is abundantly known and witnessed to those who have an inward experience of life, and its workings in themselves to be a truth; for as in the natural body, one member hath a sence of its fellow members, and the more noble that one member be, its sence of the other members is the more universal, full and comprehensive: Even so is it in the Body of Christ, which is his Church; and how can it be otherwise, when as the Scripture saith, <hi>All the single hearted, and upright minded Professors of Christ are of one heart and soul,</hi> as expressing a greater unity and sympathy, or fellow feeling, than that of the body; as if to be of one Soul, were more than to be of one Body; for if the parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy have a sence one of another, much more the powers and faculties of the Soul have a discerning and sympathy one with another.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And lastly, To add no more here (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho many more reasons might be brought) against the using of Set Forms of Prayer, the whole Superstructure dependeth upon a false and wrong bottom or foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> an Opinion, that immediate Inspiration and Revelation is ceased or discontinued in the Church, and in and among true Christians, as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95820:49"/>
well as false; for I dare say, If they who are so zealous for using Set Forms of Prayer, did but believe that Immediate Inspiration and Revelation did remain in the true Church of God, and in and among true Christians, this would presently end the dispute, and determine the Controversie betwixt them and us, for when Immediate Inspiration and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation was in the Church, as in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles daies, and for some considerable time thereafter, they readily grant, that men then prayed and sung Psalms <hi>ex tempore</hi> without Book, by the Spirit; and therefore if they did now believe that such a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is restored and restoring again, and was never altogether lost among true Christians, although much impaired and diminished by reason of the general Apostacy and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of darkness that was over the greatest part of those called Christians, they would lay aside their Set Forms, and wait for this Divine Gift. But it were too long and unseasonable a labour in this place, to prove that Immediate Revelation and Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration doth remain in and among all true Christians, I shall therefore refer the Readers to what our Friends have writ on that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and particularly to two Treatises of mine.

impartial people, laying aside all prejudice, to weigh and consider, upon what slender and weak Arguments that Opinion is built, which saith, <hi>That Immediate Inspiration and Revelation is ceased in and among all true Christians.</hi> And above all, I recommend them to the Light of Christ Jesus, and the manifestation of his holy Spirit of Truth, in every one of their hearts and Consciences, that bears witness to every necessary Truth, as they hearken to it, and with their minds turned to the said Light, and Spirit of Truth, to read and <hi>search the Scriptures</hi> diligently, in that very respect as the Noble <hi>Bereans</hi> did of old, and the Lord give them understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that and all other necessary things. I shall now proceed to Answer the most or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Objections, that seem to have most weight for using Set Forms of Prayer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Church or in private.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> From their using Set Forms of Prayer and Blessing under the Law, to argue for the use of them under the Gospel, will not hold good, for not only Sacrifices, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Beasts, but many other things were both commanded, and allowed under the Law, which are not under the Gospel. And although <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and many others in those daies had great plenty of the Spirit; yet for the sake of the people, who general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were weak and rude, they were to go along with them, in those Rudiments. No doubt <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets saw to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and end of those Shadows and Figures,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95820:51"/>
and knew well enough that the blood of Bulls and Goats could not wash or purifie the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and yet because of the general dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of the Law, which was to continue until the fulness of time, wherein Christ should be revealed, they were to remain in the practise of these things, which were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to be abolished. And though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, some Forms of Prayer and Blessing the People were to be used, yet they were but few, and very short, and such as did proceed from the Spirit of God, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and words of such Forms seem to carry in them some extraordinary Majesty or Glory, and to have some deep and profound signification and force with them more than ordinary, as we know, some Scripture words and sentences have more than others, as that Spirit is felt from whom originally they came. And though all the Scripture words did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Holy Spirit, yet some have proceeded from a greater measure of it, and more depth of the Divine Wisdom, and hold forth somewhat of more Majesty, and deep inward sense and mysterie, and are commonly accompanied with a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Spirit, when they are used either in Reading or hearing them Read, or in Meditation, and may be also used at this
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95820:51"/>
day in Prayer, as the same Spirit doth move any of his Servants thereunto, either in part or in whole. But we do not find that even under the Law, or at any time before, the Lord did limit and confine his People, or Servants to such a precise number of Set Forms of Prayer, and made unlawful unto them, to use any others when they prayed in publick, or that any one was ever forbid to whom God had given any spiritual gift (of uttering words either of Prayer, or of a Psalm or Song <hi>ex tempore,</hi> by the help and moving of the Spirit) to make use of it. But on the contrary, we find that many prayed <hi>ex tempore</hi> by the inspiration of the Spirit, what the Lord did give them, or put into their mouthes of words, both in private and publick, as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s prayer at the Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Temple; also <hi>Esdras</hi>'s Prayer, Chap. 9. and the Levites Prayer, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. and <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prayer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. and for private Prayers, <hi>David</hi>'s Prayers in the Psalms, and <hi>Asaphs,</hi> also <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk</hi> their Prayers with many others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, are clear instances; and before the Law, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> their Prayers. Nor do we find that ever a Book of Prayers, containing so many Prayers in number, to be said or read in order, was ever
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95820:52"/>
made in the Church by any of the Prophets as Prayer, or as any part of Worship in the Law. For though divers excellent forms of Prayers are recorded in Scripture, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Books, yet they were not appointed by the Lord to be read or used in so many words; without adding or diminishing, as Prayers. But they were read in the Congregation as other parts of Scripture, pattly for informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and partly to excite the Spirit and gift of Prayer in the Hearers. Excepting only some very few short forms as above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, which did not hinder or stop the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Spirit of Prayer to express it self <hi>ex tempore</hi> in any other words. And those few Forms they used as Prayers and Blessings, we do not find they read them out of a Book; when they prayed them, but spoke them from their hearts, where they were livingly, as it were, Writ and Recorded. And tho the words of these short Forms were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly conceived, and in that respect were old or ancient, yet as they uttered or pronounced them in a fresh and living sense of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and power, which never waxeth old; this gave them alwaies a new luster, and put a new Savour of life in them, and made them, as it were, alwaies new to them. And thus it is at this day, with the Servants
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95820:52"/>
of the Lord, whom he hath endued with a Spirit of Prayer, who when they Pray (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in private or in publick) do frequently find and feel Scripture words of Prayer, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly conceived and uttered by the Servants of the Lord, as <hi>Moses, David, &amp;c.</hi> to arise in them from a fresh and living sense of the Word of Life, to speak them forth in Prayer, and this without any limitation of the Spirit of Prayer, but coming freely in the liberty of the Spirit, and also of Heart, Soul and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; and the liberty of the Spirit of Prayer, as also of the Heart and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him that Prayeth is manifest; in this, that it is the free choice of the Spirit what words of Scripture to make use of, and to bring into the Remembrance of him that Speaketh, who doth not also limit or confine the Man's Understanding only to those Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Words; but giveth him liberty to make use of any others that freely arise or spring up in him, in unity with the life, as it is opened in him, as a Fountain or Well of Living Water.</p>

time with a measure of the Spirit, yet it was but small in respect of what was to follow: And we must remember, that as yet the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of the Law remained in force; and if <hi>Moses</hi> prescribed unto the People under the Law some short (but of a very excellent composure) Forms of Prayer and Blessing without limiting them only to these; well might Christ teach his Disciples this short form of Prayer, which is of a most excellent and wonderful composure; in regard of its plainness and simplicity, and yet most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive, in respect of the largeness and fulness of matter expressed in so few Words; a most worthy Pattern of all our Prayers, and of all that we can ask or desire; for it is a sum of all the Prayers that ever was or can be made by any of the Servants of God, and whatever is lawsul to be prayed for, is most easily reducible to some of the Petitions of the said Prayer; and though it hath great plainness and simplicity of Words, yet great depth of matter, and may be compared to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, which had not only the outer Court, but the Holy place within it; and within the Holy place, the most Holy, or Holy of Holies: For beside the Letter and Words of it which answer to the outer Curt, it hath a Holy inward Sense or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95820:53"/>
which none can reach or come into, but who are made a Royal Priest-hood unto God; as none were to enter into the Holy place, but such as were Priests under the Law. And although many Christians have reached to the inward Sense of the whole Prayer in great part, yet who can say he has reached to the full depth of it, and most inward Pith or Marrow thereof, which is as the Holy of Holies? It is a Question if any ever reached into the most inward Sense and Understanding of it, but Christ Jesus himself who spoke and uttered it, in whom dwelt all fulness and riches of Wisdom and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, who is our High Priest, made high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Heavens, and all the Angels that dwell in them. But,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Christ did not limit them only to this Form of Prayer, nor did he give them a Book of Forms of Prayer, or any other Forms that we read of but this only, which therefore was rather to be a Pattern and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample unto them, according to which they were to Pray, than tye or confine them to the precise number of the Words of it, as is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>After this manner therefore</hi> (said he) <hi>Pray ye.</hi> And although <hi>Luke</hi> (11. 2.) hath it, <hi>When yee Pray, say, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. Yet <hi>Luke</hi> may be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95820:54"/>
by <hi>Matthew,</hi> as one place of Scripture is oft expounded by another. So that <hi>Luke</hi> may very well be understood according to <hi>Matthew</hi> his words, thus, <hi>When ye Pray, say,</hi> (viz, after this manner) <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. Nor can this one only short Form of Prayer be a sufficient argument to make a large Book of Forms of Prayer, and impose them by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint upon Christians: For either this one Form of Prayer taught by Christ was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Apostles without any other, or it was not; if sufficient for them, why not also for all other Christians? And yet I know not any sort of these called Christians who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine themselves only to it; or are willing so to do, but think it needful to express their Prayers frequently in other Words; for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and change of Words (when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the same) doth help to stir up and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in men the more Fervent Affections. But if that one only Form was not sufficient to the Apostles, it is clear that Christ did not intend by teaching them that Form, to give them or their Successors an intire System or Scheme of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> but as is already said, to be a Pattern or Example unto them, and also to afford unto them matter of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, as the Holy Spirit should open the deep and comprehensive Sense of it unto
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95820:54"/>
them; so that by a due and serious, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate Meditation upon all the parts and words of it, by the help of the Spirit they might be stirred up unto Prayer, their hearts being lifted up unto God upon the Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on every part of it, by saying <hi>Amen</hi> thereunto, or expressing the inward desire and prayer of their hearts in the same or more words, as the Holy Spirit should be pleased to enable and assist them. And though I cannot, and dare not recommend it to be read or said as a Prayer twice or thrice every day, in a dead formal customary way, as too many do, nor can I limit any to the strict and precise number of words in it to pray by, without using any more or, less words, lest thereby I should seem to limit the Holy Spirit who is most free in all his Workings. Yet I can and do freely thus far recommend it, even unto all Christians, as well great as small, as a most worthy subject of their frequent Meditation, which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord will not be wanting to incline them unto, and assist them in. And how often in the Day, Week, Month, or Year they are to Meditare upon it, or how long their Minds and Hearts are to dwell upon the Thoughts and Meditations of it, or any other places of Holy Scripture, no outward
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95820:55"/>
rule can be given, but must all be left to the free ordering and leading of the Spirit, which I certainly believe as it is regarded and mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will be found very frequent. For it is a great part of the Spirits Work and Office to bring the Scripture words, and especially the words of Christ to our remembrance, and the more useful and necessary any words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are unto us; no doubt the Holy Spirit that Faithful Remembrancer, will bring them to our Minds, the more frequently and seasonable: And I know no words in all the Scripture that are more necessary and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto us to be remembred, and often me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated upon, than those very words contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this excellent Form of Prayer taught by Christ. And indeed, not only these few Words of Prayer taught the Apostles by Christ, but any other words of Prayer, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Recorded in Scripture, or that are Writ and Recorded any where else, that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a true Breathing and Spring of Life, in these who first conceived and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them in word or writing, may be and are of great service. So that Forms and words of Prayer which proceed in the least measure from the Spirit of Prayer, we are not against, but for, and our Souls have oft been greatly refreshed and quickned by them,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95820:55"/>
and the Spirit of Prayer, yea true Prayer and Supplication hath oft been excited in us, at the reading or hearing read such Prayers, as are frequently to be found not only in the Scriptures, but in the Books of true Martyrs, and Witnesses of Jesus: What precious Words of Prayer have oft dropped from them? althongh but a little of those is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded; and it might be wished more of these precious words of Prayer or Thanksgiving, and other Testimonies that came from the Spirit of God in them, which flowed from them had been preserved if it had been the will of God. How oft when we hear, or read, or call to mind these precious Words of Prayer, or some part of them, that any Servant or Hand-maid of the Lord has ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, either at the Hour of their Death, or any other time by the Spirit of the Lord, which we find upon record in true History? How oft I say, and how purely doth Life spring in us, and bear its Living Witness, to the Original and Fountain of those Prayers, out of which they have proceeded, even the Pure and Holy Spirit of God and Christ? And what pure inward, living, powerful and comfortable Touches of the same Spirit have we felt at such times, confirming our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and Spiritual Unity with those dear
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95820:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and precious Servants of the Lord. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I say, we are not against Words or Fruits of Prayer (for all Words have a Form) that have at any time come, or do and may come from the Spirit, but are very much for them as fit and proper Subjects of Meditation and Occasions (as the Spirit of the Lord is pleased to concurr) to excite the Grace of Prayer in us thereby, or any other Divine Grace and Gift, as doth oft come to pass. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so all such Prayers are excellent patterns and examples unto us of Prayer; but yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not set them up to be read or heard, as our Prayers, so as to tye and confine our selves, or others, to the precise number of the words contained in them. Not can we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that the bare reading or repeating the Words, are a Prayer, as many do ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine, for all true Vocal Prayer comes from the Heart, as it is moved and wrought upon by the Holy Spirit, and the Words of Prayer simply considered, are not properly the Prayer (otherwise every one that hath and useth the words should pray those Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which is far otherwise) but the words are but the signs and expressions of the Prayer which was in those who first conceived them, and are called Prayer only by a Figure or Metonymie of the Sign for the thing signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95820:56"/>
And whereas it is objected by some, <hi>that these Forms of Prayer, as they are good and fit patterns of our Prayers, so they may be used by us as Prayers, even as some Weights and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, which are kept as Standards to make other Weights by, may be used themselves, as Weights and Measures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I answer, the comparison and example in this case is most unequal; those Weights and Measures being but dead things, whether they be Standards, or those which are made by them. But all true Prayer is a living thing, and must have a living Form of its own, and cannot borrow the Form of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even as a Rose, or Tulip, or Lilly, or any other Flower or Vegetable, or Fruit of the Earth, as it springs up out of the Ground, must have its own proper living Form and Figure; and though it may be like to other things of its kind, yet it is distinct from them, and may, yea and doth alwaies more or less vary from them in form and shape, or figure and quantity (as well as Colour, and Taste, and Smell (at least as to the degree) and no art or device of Man can bring forth an Herb or Fruit of the Earth precisely of the same quantity and shape, with any other of the same kind: And so it is as to true Prayer in great part; and although one Prayer may be
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95820:57"/>
like another as to the words, and may have the same words when the Prayer is short, as containing perhaps one or two Sentences, yet in this case the one Prayer doth not borrow the words of the other Prayer, but both the Prayers have their own proper form, that naturally spring from that Divine Life, and inward Sense and Understanding in the Soul from whence they come. As it was in those Prayers of Christ a little before his Passion, when he prayed three times, saying the same Words; which instance some bring for using a constant set form of Prayer; for who will, or dare say, but that those few Words thrice uttered by him, did immediately spring from Life in him, and not from a bare remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Words formerly spoken. And besides, the time being so short betwixt those three Prayers, they may be said to be as well one as three, the frame and bent of his heart remaining the same the whole time, and the desire of his heart being still one and the same, and after one thing, to wit, <hi>That the will of his Father might be done;</hi> when his Prayer was rather a breathing forth of his earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire after one only thing, and consisted at this time more in the will and affection, than in the Understanding (though it was in and with great Understanding also) then that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95820:57"/>
Discursive Prayer, where the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Reason is much exercised; the which sort of Breathings, after one thing expressed in one or two Sentences, and sometimes in one or two Words, yea sometimes but one only Word, as to say, <hi>Father</hi> (according to <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6.) is commonly called the Prayer of Aspiration, and by others Ejaculatory Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and by others the Prayer of the Will; which differs much from that other kind of Prayer which is Discursive, where the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and Reason is much exercised, and the Mind is filled with many Thoughts and Words of Prayer inwardly conceived, and the desires of the Soul are excited after divers things: In which case its almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that at several times a man can pray the same words without adding or diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if he speak from his Heart and not from a bare Remembrance. For even in Natural Discourse upon any Natural Subject, a man that speaks from his Heart and the inward Fruitfulness of his Understanding, he will va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in expression, though the subject of his Discourse be the same. And therefore to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue for the using a constant set Form of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, from the Prayer of Aspiration, which hath but one Sentence or Word in it many times, to Discursive Prayer which hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95820:58"/>
many, holds not good, and is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and unequal as who would say, when the Child cryeth unto the Father twice or thrice every day, <hi>Father give me Bread,</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the same words; that therefore in all the Child's Discourse at any time to his Father, in answering his Father any question, or ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other thing of him, and using many arguments to prevail with him that he may obtain it, he should still use one and the same Form of Speech. We find by daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that in Converse and Society of men with men, they do not bind themselves to the same Forms of Speech, as they discourse and talk one to another; and if they did, it would make their Converse very barren and unfruitful, and would look very odd, and import in him that alwaies used these same words on the same subjects of Discourse, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther want of Understanding and Judgment, or some pedantick affectation: Although in all intercourse of Speech, there are some short Forms that are constantly and commonly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: And if two Men should preach on the same Text, and have the same subject of Discourse, if they should both use the same Form of Words in kind and number, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out addition or diminition, it would be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally concluded, that the one had stoln his
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95820:58"/>
Discourse from the other, or at least borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and not conceived it from his own Mind and Understanding. For as much as one Man's Child differs from another in Form and Figure of Body; as much or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more, doth the birth of his Mind and Understanding, in conceiving and uttering the matter of his Discourse differ from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Children of one and the same Father and Mother (though ever so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) do considerably differ one from another in Form and Figure, especially of the Face: So every Man's Speech or Discourse, whether in Preaching or Praying, will somewhat differ one time from another, if he bring it from his Heart and Understanding, and not from his bare Memory, although the stile and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of expression may be much the same. And commonly those Men whose Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings are naturally more pertinent and fruitful, when they Speak or Write on the same Matter or Subject, the Forms of their Speech or Writing do most differ, and so it may in Prayer; whereas other Men whose Understandings are not so Fruitful in Words, but they may be as Fruitful, and sometimes more Fruitful in Good and Holy Affections, when they Preach or Pray the Forms of their Words and Speech, may seem to be well
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95820:59"/>
near the same, though alwaies there will be some difference, as much as one Child who is very like to his Brother, doth differ from him, or as one Apple may be like another of the same Tree, and yet when narrowly considered, do still differ. And here these last Mens Prayer, whose Hearts and Wills are more fruitful in Holy Affections than their Understandings are, in great variety of Words and Eloquent Expressions, may, and oft do Pray with more Life, and Authority or Power, than the other; because the main strength and force of Prayer, consisteth in the good and holy Will and Affections. But in this and all other things, as every one hath his proper gift, one so, and another other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, so he is to exercise it, and not to limit or confine one another, but give liberty to each other in the Holy Spirit of Truth, and growing up together in God's Heavenly Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as lovely Plants and Flowers, each one having their proper Shapes, Forms, and Fruit, all of a sweet and pleasant smell and taste, and of a lovely Beauty, and all useful and profitable one to another, and to the Church of God in general, without any envy or grudging, but rejoycing in the manifold and various Graces and Gifts of God freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon all, and all growing and spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95820:59"/>
from the same Holy Root and Ground. And now these two main Objections being Answered at length (which did require the opening or explaining of divers things which may be of service to some) I shall proceed to answer some others, wherein I may be more brief.</p>

But he who can read a Prayer, if his Heart and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were as well, and as much exercised in Divine and Spiritual things, as in Earthly and Temporal, and had as great a love to them, and delight in them, would soon find himself furnished with Words <hi>ex tempore,</hi> whereby to express the desires of his heart to God: And indeed in true and real Love, there is for most part an admirable Force or Virtue to make a man Eloquent, both to praise the thing he loveth most, and also to find out Reasons and Arguments, wherewith to perswade to the obtaining it. He who lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Woman and greatly desireth to have her to be his Wife, he needeth not go to a Book and steal or borrow an Oration or Form of Discourse to speak unto her, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to perswade her; and if he did, it would but coldly come from him; and if she did know it (as a very small measure of good
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95820:60"/>
discerning cannot but discover it) that it was a borrowed Speech, she would not perhaps accept it, nor answer it. But the natural and simple words that flow from the love of his Heart, would most prevail and have the greatest force. It is not Eloquence or Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Speech, that God requires or regards, the profit and service of it is unto men, and not unto God. It stirreth up mens Affections to make them the more servent; but doth not more prevail with God, than more sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and mean words; yet God will have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man to use his own Gift, and it is but want of Love to Divine and Heavenly things, and want of exercise in improving and stiring up the Gifts which God hath given them, that makes them think extemporary prayer by the help of the Spirit, to be so hard and difficult. Why may not Men find Words and Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as ready and easie, wherewith to seek a thing of God by the help of his Spirit, as they find them wherewith to seek a thing from Men, which few or none do in borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Forms of Speech composed by another, unless it be to some King or great Person, that some who are feeble minded and want courage, make their address, by borrowed Words, or by something writ on a Paper, or by some other they get to speak for them?
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95820:61"/>
But none of all these things is necessary in this case; for God invites the weakest and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to call upon him, as well as the strongest, and the meanest words, where the Heart is sincere are accepted of him; yea, suppose the words were broken and imperfect, and not according to the <hi>Grammar</hi> of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, they may be used (at least) in private. And as for publick Prayer in the audience of an Assembly or Congregation; these whom God calleth to such an Employment or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he will no doubt sufficiently qualifie and furnish them, for he who made the mouth, can easily put words in it. As when <hi>Moses</hi> excused his being sent to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for his want of Eloquence. The Lord said unto him, <hi>Who hath made man's Mouth? or who maketh the Dumb, or Deaf, or the Seeing, or the Blind? Have not I the Lord? Now therefore, go and I will be with thy Mouth, and teach thee what thou shall sav.</hi> Ex. 4. 11. And tho the Lord sent <hi>Aaron</hi> to assist him, who was naturally more Eloquent; yet God also put Words in <hi>Moses</hi> his Mouth, as well as in the Mouth of <hi>Aaron.</hi> And when <hi>Moses</hi> Prayed unto God in the Mount, that <hi>Israel</hi> might prevail over <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek,</hi> we do not read that <hi>Moses</hi> borrowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words from <hi>Aaron,</hi> or that <hi>Aaron</hi> put any words into his mouth; only <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi>
                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:95820:61"/>
helped to hold up his Hands. And surely <hi>Moses</hi> in his Prayer here, used not any Form of Prayer borrowed from <hi>Aaron,</hi> or any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy else; altho some from this passage [and <hi>Moses</hi> his being less Eloquent than <hi>Aaron]</hi> have argued for using set Forms of Prayer. But we cannot find it in Scripture, that <hi>Moses</hi> stood with a <hi>Book of Common Prayer</hi> in his Hand, and Read or Prayed out of it upon the Mountain, but that he had in his Hand a Rod.</p>

And it is hard and uncharitable to judge that all they who read or hear set Forms of Prayer (in private and publick) and seldom or never use Extemporary Prayer, are altogether void of true Devotion, and never Pray by the Spirit, because they alwaies (or for the most part) Pray by the Book.</head>

But if People confound these so differing things, and set up the bare reading, or hearing what is read in the place or room of true Prayer, as if they were true Prayer it self, they may provoke the Lord to with-draw that concurrance and assistance of his Spirit, from reading and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95820:62"/>
those words, however so good, yea tho Scripture words, and altogether blast, and make ineffectual and unprofitable those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, which otherwise and in themselves considered, are lawful and profitable. For the Lord who is a God of order, he will not have the nature of things confounded but keeped distinct: He will not have a thing judged or esteemed to be what it is not, or above what it is; the tendency of which in this very case, is down-right Superstition and Idolatry; as to judg that to be Prayer and Divine Worship, which is no such thing; for whatever is not true Prayer and Divine Worship, and yet is called so, and really so judged and esteemed, is false and a sort of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry. For I know no midst betwixt true Divine Worship, and Idolatry under that head of Worship, seeing all pretended Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship is either true or false; and if false, it is a sort or kind of Idolatry. Now it deserves to be well examined and considered, whether the putting reading, and hearing read set Forms of Prayer, either in publick or private, in so high a place as many put them (if not most or all who use them) hath not provoked the Lord to deny that concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and assistance of his Spirit unto those exercises, which otherwise he might and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95820:63"/>
would give, especially when those read Prayers do altogether exclude those real Prayers, which come from the Spirit of God, as he enables the Speakers to conceive and bring them forth in words, without any set Form. And why is it that many sensible and tender Souls feel no Vertue in many or most of those read Prayers, and on the contrary feel great deadness and heavyness, and great weights and burdens in hearing them? which hath occasioned many to with draw, and seek where to find a People, where true and living Prayer and Praises are to be found, which effectually reach to the Soul, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their Souls and Hearts along to join with them. For neither is it true Prayer to hear the words of him that prayeth most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the Spirit of God, but where the Heart and Soul joineth and goeth along by the moving of the same Spirit both in Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Hearers, that is true Prayer: Again, if People should not so far mis-place those things, as to judg reading, and hearing read Prayers to be Prayers, or any part of Divine Worship; yet if they lean too much on them, and rely more upon them than they should, and have more an eye and regard unto them than unto the Spirit of God; this also will make their reading and hearing, or any other
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95820:63"/>
exercise ineffectual unto them, and altogeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unprofitable.</p>
                     <p>But Secoudly, I shall neither be so hard nor uncharitable (but am very far from it) as to judg that all they who hear or read set Forms of Prayer in private and publick, and seldom or never use Extemporary Prayer by the help of the Spirit, giving them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or express words of Prayer, are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther void of true Devotion, and never Pray by the Spirit: For my Charity is so large and free in that respect, that I believe among all People, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> as well as <hi>Christians,</hi> and many of those called <hi>Heathens,</hi> if they do believe in one only God, and are Faithful to what they know, they are at times visited with gentle breathings of the Spirit of God, which helps them truly to Pray unto him, with desires and affections, and true breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Soul after him. It is one thing what the Lord doth by high and soveraign acts of his wonderful Mercy and Condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Children of Men; and another what he doth to them, upon terms of their doing what he only requires of them, and is pleased with, in them.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95820:64"/>
be as good Canonical Scripture, as any of the Prayers of <hi>David,</hi> or of other Holy men, and their Psalms recorded in Scripture; which were absurd to affirm.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> These words of Prayer which come truly from the Spirit of God, helping and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting the Speakers to conceive and express them, are no doubt real Divine Testimonies of God's Spirit, Light and Life, according to their measure; but to compare or equal them to Scripture (as we do not) so to infer it is unequal. For if all the Divine Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which originally did livingly and purely proceed and spring from the Spirit of God, hadbeen writ, and aded to the Scripture, the bulk or volumn of it had been too great; yea many Volumns would not have contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and it had been impossible for men to have read them all. Therefore God hath Wisely and Graciously ordered it by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, that a part of these many Testimonies which have come from his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit should be left upon record, and preserved to all future Generations, which were writ by some of the most Eminent of his Holy Prophets and Apostles, and which have been unquestionably received in all Ages among the best sort of Christians, who have had a true discerning, to favour these Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95820:64"/>
and Testimonies, and that what hath been so writ, should be generally received as unquestionable Testimonies and Oracles of God's Holy Spirit, and acknowledged as a publick Standard, Rule and Touch-stoue, whereby to judg and examine all Doctrines and Principles of Religion held forth by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Now it was altogether necessary that this publick Standard and Touch-stone of all Doctrines and Principles of Religion, should not be too large and voluminous, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious and easie to be read over, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently searched and examined in a short time, to find how the Doctrines and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Preached by others, did agree, or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with them, as the Spirit of the Lord should give an Understanding, and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to receive or reject them. And God in his Infinite Wisdom hath seen fit that the Writings of the ancient Prophets, Apostles and Evangelists, should only be this publick and universal outward Standard, as having some peculiar excellency in them of plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and briefness, and comprehending much matter in few words, and writ from a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and larger measure of the Divine Wisdom, to which no writings or words since uttered, are comparable in equality, or in the service they were designed for. And more might
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95820:65"/>
be said as to this matter, to show the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Scriptures above all other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings or words, the Scriptures being generally received and believed, and that worthily, to be pure and infallible Testimonies of Truth, without any mixture of humane weakness, error or mistake, as they were originally writ and continue at this day; as to the main, and giving sufficient evidence and witness to necessary Truths, which we are not bound to believe equally concerning any other writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as being wholly and throughout Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and therefore may take leave to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion them, and accordingly as we find them to agree or disagree with the said publick Standard of the Scriptures Testimony to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or reject them, in part or in whole. And admitting or granting that many Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Good and Holy Men, their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Praying and Writing, should wholly agree to the Scriptures Testimony, and that they have also proceeded from a measure of the same Spirit, purely and without all mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet they are not to be made equal with that which by the Appointment of God, and general consent of Christians, is made the publick Standard of Truth: As in respect of an outward Testimony, for in all Cities and Corporations the publick Standard of Weights
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95820:65"/>
and Measures is of greater and more Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than any others however so just and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to them. And this Objection hath no more force or weight against Preaching and Praying by Divine Inspiration now, than it had Two or Three Hundred Years after the Birth of Christ, when it is generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the gift of Preaching and Praying by the Immediate Inspiration of the Spirit, did remain in the Church, and yet their words were not held equal to the Scripture in that day. And tho we may not add our Words and Testimonies (the purest of them) to be any part of Scripture, yet we dare not be so Presumptuous as to say, there never was, nor ever shall be more Scripture, than what we have at present; for it is probable more of equal Authority with what we have, hath been, but is lost, and possibly some judged <hi>Apocryphal;</hi> by one sort may be of equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and value with God, and other good men, with other parts of Scripture that are acknowledged. Neither are all Christians yet agreed upon the number of the Books of Scripture, but it sufficeth that so much is generally agreed upon, as is sufficient to be a publick Standard. And lastly this Objection can be equally retorted upon the makers of it: For they do hold, <hi>That all the Words in</hi>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:95820:66"/>
                        <hi>their Set Forms of Prayer, are either plain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Scripture Words, or deduced and deducea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from them, by just and necessary consequence of Truth, and what is so deduced, are the real Commands and of Oracles God;</hi> as they (or at lest as most of them) say; as in the example of Infant Baptism, which they hold to be a command of God, consequently a Divine Oracle, and yet they confess it is no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in Scripture, but only by consequence deduced from it; the which notwithstanding is justly denyed by many to be any firm or sure consequence of Scripture. And if none of their set Forms of Prayer have come original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no not in the least measure from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in those who Penned them, it seemeth a great derogation to those Prayers, and to render them of small value with the People; therefore such who use this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against us, should take heed lest they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from their own Prayers, and so fall under the censure of their own Brethren. But perhaps some will acknowledg, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit helped those who Penned these set Forms of Prayer, not only by exciting or moving their affections, but also by working upon their Understandings, and make them fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to conceive the matter or words of these Prayers, but not Immediately, or by an Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Divine Inspiration, as the Spirit wrought
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95820:66"/>
in <hi>David</hi> and others who preached and prayed by Immediate Inspiration, so as to make no use of their judgment and reason, to find out the matter, or chuse the words they expressed. To this I answer, that <hi>David,</hi> or any other of the Prophets and Apostles, when they were Immediately Inspired to Preach, or Pray, or Write, made no use of their Judgment and Reason, or other Faculties and Abilities of their Souls; or that the Spirit of God which wrought in them, made no use of them, but as meer passive Subjects and Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pients, is a thing commonly alledged by those men, but no where proved, either from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Words of Scripture, nor from any just and necessary consequence therefrom. Yea the contrary is manifest from Scripture, that the Spirit of God wrought upon, and used the Understanding and Rational Faculties, and Abilities of the Prophets and Apostles, not as meer passive Instruments alwaies, or most frequently, but made them fruitful to work, and co-operate with him; as <hi>Paul,</hi> who Preached and Prayed by Immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration (as they do confess) said, <hi>That he had laboured more abundantly than the other Apostles:</hi> which was not a meer bodily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, but a travelling or labouring in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit more especially, wherein his Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95820:67"/>
and rational Faculties were concerned, as well as his Will and Affections, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so clearly implied in his following words, <hi>Yet not I, but the Grace of God with me.</hi> So that it was not he alone, nor the Grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but the Grace of God co-working with him, that caused this earnest and servent la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Soul. Nor is there any more reason to say, that the Understandings and Reasons of the Prophets and Apostles when they spoke by Immediate Revelation, were wholly passive, than to say, their Wills and Affections were wholly passive, or their Mouths and Tongues when they spoke. And the diversity of Stile in the Pen-men of the Scriptures (which varieth not only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the natural gifts and parts (wherewith they were more or less endued) but also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Education and Acquired Parts) doth sufficiently show, they were not altogether passive. The stiles and manner of expression used by <hi>Isaiah, Paul</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> clearly show their Education, differing from the homely stile of <hi>Amos</hi> a Country-man, who said, <hi>He was no Prophet, nor the Son of a Prophet. Paul</hi> said he could Pray not only with the Spirit, but with the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: meaning certainly that his Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might be active and fruitful, both to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95820:67"/>
and others also. It's true, the same <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of a case, wherein the Spirit Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but the Understanding is unfruitful, as it happened at times when a man was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired and moved by the Holy Spirit, that he spake in an unknown Tongue, as appeareth from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 13. Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown Tongue, pray that he may interpret. And in this case it is like, that as the Soul's Understanding was unfruitful, so it was unactive, and was used only by the Spirit, as a passive Instrument like a Pen in the Hand of a ready Writer: As when the outward Ear of a man receiveth the Voice of a strange Language, which he doth not understand. There are other cases also, wherein the Understanding and Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Faculties of man may be laid aside, and not used by the Spirit of God, when he Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Inspireth him; as when the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most noble Faculty of a Man's Soul or Mind is excited, and wholly imployed and exercised by the Spirit, which by some is called the Spirit of the Mind, by others the Visual or Intentive Faculty of the Soul, which seeth God as he is pleased to reveal himself; and whereby a man hath a sense or percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine or Spiritual things, without any use or exercise of his Understanding,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95820:68"/>
Reason or Imagination, as in a Spiritual Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and extasie. But for most part the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and Reason was used and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, yea and the Memory also, by the Prophets and Apostles, so as to remember what they had read or heard, and seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to apply it to the present occasion, when they spoke or writ by Immediate Revelation or Inspiration. For Immediate Revelation or Inspiration doth not exclude the use of means whether inward or outward, it only implyeth a most near and close, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate conjunction and union of the Spirits Operation with the Soul in the use of means, as well as when they are not so used: And <hi>Solomon,</hi> who is generally acknowledged to have writ both the Books of the <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> and <hi>Proverbs,</hi> by Divine Immediate Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Revelation; yet he saith, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>He sought to find out acceptable words,</hi> &amp;c. So that the Spirit of God made use of that Faculty or Ability of his Soul (which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Logicians Invention) as well as his Judgment; not that he had any trouble or difficulty to find out those acceptable words, but the Spirit making his Understanding Fruitful with plenty of matter, and seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and suitable Words, he freely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble or disquiet of his mind, used such acceptable words.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This is altogether denyed; for first, the Spirit of God in one can never be thought to stint the same Spirit, or limit the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof in another, or many, because the Spirit is the same in both, and doth ever accord and agree with it self in all its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and what it moveth the Speaker to Speak, it moveth and inclineth the Hearers to consider, and where true Unity is witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with one inward voice and cry of their Hearts, they speak the same things unto God, their Hearts at every Sentence, saying <hi>Amen,</hi> to what they feel and perceive to come from the Spirit of God in them who speak. Nor doth it hinder the understanding and attention of the Hearers, in being exercised towards the Spirit's workings and openings in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: For many, yea and most times, what the Spirit speaks through one, doth excite the understandings of the Hearers into more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, so that they have more opened and revealed unto them by the Spirit, than what
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95820:69"/>
the Speakers words did import; as oft also the like falleth out in Discoursing upon a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural subject, where the words do signifie more to some Hearer, than they do to the Speaker himself, exciting clearer and fuller notions or ideas of Truth in him: And thus even natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral arts have been perfected, when the first Inventers had but some small beginnings; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by those beginnings have been excited to find out more perfect things; as the bringing of the first words of a Sentence to a man's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory which he hath forgot, doth oft excite his Memory to remember the whole Sentence. Nor is the Mind of Man so strait or narrow, but it can well enough attend to what another Man sayeth in Preaching or Prayer, and also to what God inwardly doth suggest, or reveal unto him: And the liberty of the Hearers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings and Spirits is manifest in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that after one has Prayed in words, if the same Spirit reveal any thing to be spoken in Preaching or Prayer by any of the Hearers, he is free to do it without giving any offence, which was the order prescribed by <hi>Paul,</hi> to the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>

But again, either these set Forms of Prayer are few or many; if few, they cannot give a large understanding to the People, if many, they cannot be well remembred by them, and if they were as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as would fill many Volumns, they cannot give so great occasion to edifie and inform the understanding, as these Prayers which proceed <hi>ex tempore,</hi> by the Inspiration of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Holy men, which must needs be many more, and containing much more matter, than the greatest Book of ever so many set Forms of Prayer can. For on this account it is as I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon, why men are not tyed to set Forms of Preaching, but are allowed freely to exercise their gift, because that is more edifying to the People, than set Forms to Preach by would be unto them. And the same reason is as
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95820:70"/>
good concerning Praying as Preaching. And tho words of <hi>ex tempore</hi> Prayer without the Spirit, pass away as an empty transient sound, yet by and with the help of the Spirit both in speakers and hearers, they take impression both upon the understanding and memory of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are made tender and sensible: And tho all or most of the words spoke be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, yet if they have that good effect to open the understanding, and work holy Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the Souls of People, it is sufficient to edification: For where a thing is well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, a man needs not concern his memory much about it: As he who understandeth the reasons and grounds of rules and precepts of Art, he can practise the things belonging to that Art better with his understanding, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking on those rules, then he who only hath the rules of Art in his memory, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth not the reasons and grounds of those rules. Nor can these forms be so edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as extemporary Prayer by the true Spirit of God, because they cannot so universally in all particulars reach to the various states and conditions of Peoples Souls. And to say that all the various states of Peoples Souls, if there were a thousand of them, are comprehended under the words of those general set forms doth not satisfie. For as on the one account set forms
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95820:70"/>
are too few, and strait or narrow to reach all particular states, and seasonable times; so if generals can serve, these set forms commonly used are too many; because one only set form of Prayer contained in a few words may in general reach to all Peoples states, and surely none doth or can better do that, than the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which Christ taught his Disciples. And if men deny that they have any assistance of the Spirit to help them to conceive these set forms of Prayer which they use, were it not better to collect together forms of Prayer out of the Old and New Testament, putting all these words and sentences together which are most to the same purpose, or if belonging to several purposes that have some fit connexion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and so the words of their Prayer would be pure Scripture words, without any mixture of the words of man's Wisdom, which are oft times very unsound.</p>

the least, and as for these who most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly pray contrary one to another, they are such, who do not pretend or lay claim to pray by Divine Immediate Inspiration. But if both sides should lay claim thereunto, and yet contradict one another in their Preaching or Praying, it only proveth that the men are faulty, sometimes on the one side, and sometimes on the other, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they may be faulty and wrong on both sides, but the Principle remaineth still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable: nor hath this Objection more weight now than in the daies of the true Prophets of old, against whom the false Prophets both Preached and Prayed, and pretended to be also Divinely and Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately Inspired, as well as the true. And lastly, This Objection can be well enough retorted, for they who pray by Set Forms, may pray contrary one to the other. The Greek and Latine Churches had both Set Forms of Prayer, and prayed one against another, as well as preached, when that great Zeal and Schism came to be between them. And how many Preach against one another, who pretend to Scripture and good Reason, and also to good Literature, which yet is no just reflection on any of these three things, but only on the Men or Persons, who abuse them.</p>

For when the Heart and Affection is earnestly and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously bent and moved to desire one only thing, it may be expressed in one Sentence, and as oft as that Affection is renewed, the expression of it in the same Sentence, as it freely ariseth in the Heart, may be renewed also: but men find it not so in Discursive Prayer, or other Discursive Exercises. As when men at this day commonly write Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles one to another, they retain some little common Forms of Salutation, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and end of their Epistles, which are commodious and not thought strange not

disliked. But if a Man, yea, if a School-boy at School, should alwaies write to his Father or Kindred, the same words through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, without any alteration, they would say he were a fool and void of understanding, to be so barren as to have no new matter in his Epistles, even when daily occasion is given.</p>

And tho it be the Heart that God mainly requireth and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95820:72"/>
yet he commandeth us to love and serve him, with our whole man, which is our reasonable service; and we are to love him with all our Understanding, as well as Heart, as the Scripture saith, and the best and most fruitful part of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; and all the Gifts belonging to it, our Judgment, Reason, and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, may and ought to be employed in his Service, and in this particular Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Praver, as Holy Men of old, who used their Understanding and Reason, and such Elocution also and variety of Expressions, as God had given them: and so ought every Man to do, as the Spirit of the Lord leads him, and works upon him; and those Gifts he has given him without affection or stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and straining beyond his measure. And tho we find no affected or artificial Eloquence in Words of Man's Wisdom, which is carnal and from below, yet a true Eloquence and excellency of Speech is to be found in many places of Scripture, both in the Preachings and Prayers of the Lords Servants that stand on Record, far surpassing all the Eloquence that either the Masters or Disciples of that artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Eloquence, so much admired in the World, ever arrived or ever can arrive at, meerly as such. And likewise the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

may be retorted, in respect of using any words at all in Prayer, whether <hi>extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi> or by Set Forms, because to speak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly God is not moved by any words, and hath need of them, who knoweth all oue most secret Thoughts and Desires without words.

                     <head>12. Many who pretend to pray by the Spirit, and have used, or do as yet use <hi>ex tempore</hi> Prayer, discover many weaknesses in those Prayers, as vain Repetitions, impertinent Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, light and airy Phrases, and unsound Matter and Expressions, to the causing many People to abhor the Sacrifices, rather than to be piously and religiously affected with those Prayers. And seeing few, if any have a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Gift of Praying <hi>ex tempore,</hi> with words conceived by the help of the Spirit; and that yet publick Prayers in Congregations and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies of People are necessary; is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to use Set Forms of Prayer in sound Words, then to adventure on <hi>ex tempore</hi> Prayer without the Spirit.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> As for all these weaknesses, which Men have discovered or may discover in <hi>ex tempore</hi> Praying, they reflect, as is said, upon the Men, but not upon the Principle. And when most of these Weaknesses have appeared, it is in Men, who pray without any pretence unto immediate Inspiration of the Spirit, or belief that they have it: and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95820:74"/>
such Men, I confess, should lay aside their <hi>ex tempore</hi> Praying, and wait upon the Spirit of God, to receive help from him to pray, first believing that it is to be received, as it is waited for. And these also who pretend to pray by the Spirit, and yet do nothing so, but are meerly guided by their floating and airy Fancies and Imaginations, should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist from such a practice, and come with si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence both outward and inward, and in the same wait for the true Spirit of Prayer to help their infirmities, whether with Sighs and Groans that cannot be expressed, or with distinct and audible expressions. But surely, these who indeed pray by the Spirit, keeping close and chastly to the same throughout, from first to last, bewray none of these Weaknesses; and though they may use Repetitions, yet if the Spirit move to use them, and that there be any vertue or savour of Life in them, they are not vain but profitable, and like the warbling Notes, repeated Sounds of a skilful Musician, in a musical Descant, which rendred the method more sweet and pleasing; and such serious, grave, and weighty Repetitions we find oft in the <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David.</hi> And these also who use Set Forms of Prayer, have need that they use not vain Repetitions; for some
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95820:75"/>
who have heard these Set Forms, have been as much disgusted and offended with the many Repetitions they find there, as others with those elsewhere. Now it may at times happen, that a man may be partly assisted and helped by the Holy Spirit to conceive words of Prayer, and good and servent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and yet through Humane Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, may discover some frailty in his Prayer, who yet is not altogether to be rejected or discouraged. But great care ought to be had by all, who make mention of the Name of the Lord, that they bring forth nothing but that which is pure and without mixture, even a pure Offering and Sacrifice unto the Lord, who is pure. And suppose few or none, in many places or Congregations, have the Spiritual Gift of praying <hi>ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,</hi> by the Spirit helping them to conceive the words of Prayer, yet there is no need of praying by a Set Form; for if the Principle and Doctrine of Truth, were once received and believed, that God giveth his assistance by his Spirit to all who desire it, and whom he thinks worthy of it, or fit to bestow it on, for the edification of others, to pray <hi>ex tempore,</hi> with words truly edifying, quickening and refreshing, as People did but wait a little time in sincerity for such a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95820:75"/>
Gift, it would be given to a sufficient number of them, and until it be given it is better to pray with affection of Heart, though without all words, and wait in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence for a further gift and measure of the Spirit, then to be rash or hasty to pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit, either <hi>ex tempore</hi> or in a Set Form. And to help the weaknesses of many who cannot bear well long, or much si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, such as are serious and best affected, as they find a freedom and liberty in the Lord, may read unto the People, or unto their Families, the Holy Scriptures, which was an ancient custom in the Primitive Church; but that Reading is not to be used as Prayer or Worship, but only as a mean to excite Prayer and good Affections and Defires in them, as it pleaseth the Lord to concur and give his Blessing unto the same, and also for Information and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                     <p>What is there said all along in this Treatise of Praying by the Spirit, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conceive the words of Prayer, is also to be understood of Singing and Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing God with a <hi>Psalm;</hi> and the Reasons and Arguments drawn from Scripture for the one serve equally for the other; for all Singing and Praising with a <hi>Psalm</hi> or
