            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>'TIS a Maxim of Prudence given by
ſome of the Nicer Deſcribers of the
Bounds of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> That it ought to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
between a total Neglect and a full and
juſt Requital. To ſtrike off <hi>all</hi> Scores is, they
ſay, as uncivil as to diſcharge <hi>none,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
whit as diſingenuous not to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> as not
to <hi>acknowledge</hi> an Obligation.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, 'tis one of the proper Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of my little Fortune to be neceſſarily
caſt upon this Meaſure. I am got too far in
your <hi>Accounts</hi> to be able to requite to the full;
ſome part of them I muſt ever leave <hi>uncroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi>
as a ſtanding <hi>Hold</hi> upon me; and tho my
<hi>Gratitude</hi> it ſelf be never ſo ſtrong and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
yet the moſt forward Inſtance of it can
riſe no higher than an <hi>Acknowledgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as this is the utmoſt I can do, ſo of
doing this too I have ſo few Capacities and
Opportunities, that I am the leſs willing to
let go any that offer themſelves; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
has given a ſpeedier Iſſue to my Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
<pb facs="tcp:94628:3"/>
whether I ought to Addreſs theſe
Diſcourſes to your Patronage or no, which
perhaps without the Formality of a <hi>Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
would of right belong to you, as falling
within your Diſtrict, and as being the Fruits
of that Retirement which by your <hi>Free</hi> Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
I enjoy.</p>
            <p>As an Acknowledgment therefore of this
and your other conſtant Favours, I preſume
to put theſe Diſcourſes into your Hands,
which I hope will be able to do both <hi>You</hi> and
<hi>Me</hi> that Juſtice, as to convince the World,
that as you proceeded by generous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Here commend to thy ſerious Peruſal a Set of
Select Diſcourſes upon the <hi>Beatitudes,</hi> which
were at firſt undertaken, and are now publiſh'd
for the Publick Benefit of all well-diſpoſed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
The Subjects themſelves are as Great and
Noble as any perhaps that occur in all Practical
Divinity, being the Prime and Capital <hi>Aphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſms</hi>
of our Saviour's excellent Sermon upon the
Mount, and containing the Fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of all Chriſt's Practical Inſtructions, and
of a true Chriſtian <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we may ſee (what the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſo
much deſired) the true <hi>Living Idea</hi> of Vertue
and Goodneſs; nay more, what 'tis to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
an <hi>Interiour</hi> Chriſtian, a Chriſtian indeed.
And I heartily wiſh that thoſe whoſe Orthodoxy
is chiefly employed in giving out <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Signs</hi>
of Converſion and Saintſhip, wherein their end
ſeems rather to be the diſtinction of a Party, than
any real Promotion of Godlineſs, would chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to dreſs their Interiour by this <hi>Glaſs,</hi> and
afterwards try it by this <hi>Meaſure.</hi> For here they
will find that Real Chriſtianity conſiſts in Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Spirit, Humility, Self-denyal, Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Meekneſs, Mercifulneſs, Purity of Heart,
<pb facs="tcp:94628:4"/>
Peaceableneſs, and ſuch like inward Diſpoſitions
of Soul, and not in a few outward Formalities,
Sighs and Groans, Looks and Poſtures, Words
and Phraſes, and ſuch other affected Badges of a
fond Diſtinction.</p>
            <p>And as the Subjects themſelves are Great and
Noble, ſo I hope theſe Diſcourſes will be found in
ſome meaſure to riſe up to their Dignity. I am
ſure there has been no care wanting on my part
to make them worthy of their Subjects, to which
I have endeavoured to do the utmoſt Justice. But
however I may fail of that, yet I hope the Reader
will not be altogether diſappointed of his Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or repent of his Labour, but will find here
ſufficient Entertainment both for his <hi>Speculation,</hi>
and for his <hi>Devotion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may perhaps be a Surprize to ſome to ſee me
appear again ſo ſoon in publick. To this, if there
needs any Apology, that which I ſhall offer is, That
if theſe Diſcourſes be not worthy of publick View,
then 'tis not fit they ſhould ever be ſent abroad;
but if they be, I cannot underſtand how they can
be publiſhed too ſoon. The Truth is, conſidering
the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of Life, I have been
lately very much of Opinion, That a Man can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
live too faſt, (the Heathen will tell you <hi>Never
faſt enough</hi>) nor make too much haſte to do
good; eſpecially when a Man's Sphere is ſuch, that
he has but <hi>Few</hi> ways and Opportunities of doing
it, which by Experience I am all convinc'd to be
my Caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94628:4"/>
I am afraid (wherever the fault lies) that it
will not be my Happineſs to be able to do that good
where I am, which I might have done in ſome
other Station. Which makes me the more frequent
in <hi>Publick,</hi> that I may ſupply this Defect by the
Service of my <hi>Pen,</hi> having ſome reaſon to hope
that my Diſcourſes will meet with better liking
<hi>Abroad,</hi> than they uſually do at <hi>Home;</hi> and
that there are ſome in the World to whom I ſhall
not be a <hi>Barbarian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What has been here the performance of <hi>my</hi>
Pen, was (as I learn from Dr. <hi>Ruſt</hi>) intended,
and in part performed by the Excellent <hi>Biſhop
Taylour,</hi> who while he was meditating upon the
<hi>Beatitudes,</hi> was receiv'd up into the Enjoyment
of them. And I have lately ſpoken with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who told me, That he himſelf ſaw a <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi>
of it in the Biſhop's own Hand. I am
very ſenſible how much the Subject has loſt by the
<hi>Change</hi> of its Author. All that I can ſay is,
That I have done my Beſt, and I hope God will
accept of my good <hi>Intention,</hi> and that the World
will be ſomething the better for my <hi>Peformance.</hi>

Chriſt Jeſus, begins that
Great and Noble Inſtitution of
Chriſtian Philoſophy, his Sublime
Sermon on the Mount. This was he that
was pointed at by the eminent Prophecy, <hi>I
will raiſe them up a prophet from among their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94628:6"/>
brethren like unto thee, and will put my words
in his mouth, and he ſhall ſpeak unto them all
that I ſhall command him,</hi> Deut. 18. And
now it was that this Prophecy had its full
Accompliſhment; Chriſt was now entring
upon his Prophetick Office, and was to ſhew

great Truſt he diſcharged with as great
Care and Fidelity, and (as the Author to the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> obſerves) <hi>was faithful to him that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
him, as alſo Moſes was faithful in all his
houſe,</hi> Heb. 3. 2. As therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> gave a
Digeſt of Laws to the People with whom
he was intruſted, ſo it became this Divine
Prophet alſo to give Laws and Precepts for
the Inſtruction and Order of <hi>his</hi> Diſciples.
He was to be a Law-giver, as well as <hi>Moſes;</hi>
and, to carry on the Proportion yet farther,
he thought fit to imitate him in the very
<hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Circumſtance</hi> of delivering his
Law, and accordingly aſcended up into a
Mountain, from whence he ſhowr'd down
his Heavenly <hi>Manna</hi> upon his Hearers: So
alſo making good another Inſtance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
relating to <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſpeaks thus
of himſelf, <hi>My doctrin ſhall drop as the rain,
my ſpeech ſhall diſtil as the dew; as the ſmall
rain upon the tender herb, and as the ſhowers
upon the graſs,</hi> Deut. 32. 2.</p>
                     <p>But the Parallel will not run throughout:
For the Divine Oracles were not now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94628:6"/>
with <hi>Thundrings</hi> and <hi>Lightnings;</hi>
with <hi>Blackneſs,</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>Tempeſt;</hi>
but were deliver'd in the ſmall ſtill Voice of
<hi>Bleſſing</hi> and <hi>Conſolation.</hi> 'Twas with a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atitude
that <hi>David</hi> began his Collection of
Divine Hymns; and in like manner does the
Son of <hi>David</hi> uſher in his ſublime Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And this was very ſuitable and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
both to the Character of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> and
to the Genius of his <hi>Doctrin.</hi> As to his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
Bleſſing became the Mouth of him, who
was the Reconciler of God and Man, the
great Ambaſſador of Peace, the Author of
Salvation and Happineſs, and at whoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
the Angels ſang Peace on Earth, and
Good Will towards Men. And as to his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin,</hi>
The Precepts he was to deliver were
of ſo refined and high-raiſed a Nature, ſo
little agreeable either to the Maxims of the
World, or to the groſſer Reliſhes of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Life, that they would have found but
cold Entertainment, had they not come re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
with a Reward, and been
guarded on each Side with a Beatitude.</p>
                     <p>'Twas requiſite therefore that the <hi>Duty</hi>
and the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> ſhould go hand in hand;
and accordingly, our Lord, who well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the Temper of the Sons of Men,
how paſſionately we purſue any thing that
looks like <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and how apt we are to
ask that Queſtion, <hi>Who will ſhew us any Good?</hi>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94628:7"/>
thought it expedient to join them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in his Diſcourſe, as they will be in
the <hi>Event;</hi> and to pronounce <hi>them</hi> Bleſſed
here, whom he intends to pronounce ſo
hereafter, when he ſhall ſay, <hi>Come ye bleſſed
of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for
you from the foundation of the World,</hi> Mat. 25.</p>
                     <p>And the better to win us over to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of his Divine Sermon, our Lord, like
a wiſe Maſter-builder, lays the Foundation
of his <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> where we muſt lay that of
our <hi>Obedience,</hi> and aſſigns the firſt Place
among his Beatitudes to <hi>Humility,</hi> and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
of Spirit; for Humility is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Obedience: We muſt be firſt poor
in Spirit, before we can be rich in Good
Works; firſt humble, before we can obey;
and firſt obey, before we can reign. And
therefore with good Reaſon does our Lord
lay down this as the firſt Principle and
Ground-Work of his Inſtitution, <hi>Bleſſed are
the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In my Diſcourſe upon theſe Words I ſhall,</p>
                     <p>I. Reſolve what we are to underſtand by
Poor in Spirit.</p>
                     <p>II. Shew that this Poverty of Spirit is a
Chriſtian Duty; and the Reaſonablneſs of it.</p>
                     <p>III. Shew the Happineſs of thoſe who
are ſo diſpoſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94628:7"/>
As to the Reſolution of the Firſt, I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that this Poverty of Spirit here recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by our Saviour, is not a State of
<hi>Life,</hi> but a State of <hi>Mind;</hi> and we may take
it either in Oppoſition to <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> or in
Oppoſition to <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>High-mindedneſs.</hi> If
in Oppoſition to <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> then to be
poor in Spirit, is, to have our Souls ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
as, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Not to be eagerly carried
out in our Deſires after any created Good;
particularly, the good Things of this lower
World, whether Honors, Pleaſures or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit;
eſpecially, not to be greedy and craving
in our Deſire of Riches. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> To
be ſo moderately and indifferently affected
towards all theſe, as to be well contented
without them, and alſo ready to reſign and
part with them when either God ſhall think
fit to deprive us of them, or when we can
no longer retain them with a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
This is to be <hi>poor in Spirit,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in Oppoſition to <hi>Covetouſneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it may alſo be conſidered as oppoſed
to <hi>Pride</hi> or <hi>High-mindedneſs;</hi> and then to
be <hi>poor in Spirit</hi> will denote, <hi>Firſt,</hi> A juſt,
that is, a low and mean Senſe and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of our own ſelves, of our Souls, and
of our Bodies; of our Intellectuals, and of
our Morals; of our Acquirements, and of
our Performances. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> As a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94628:8"/>
of this, a Contentedneſs when-ever
any or all of theſe are diſeſteemed or diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
either tacitly and interpretatively,
by Affronts, and diſhonourable Treatments;
or elſe directly, by expreſs Undervaluations,
a Readineſs to prefer others before our ſelves,
and a Willingneſs that the ſame Preference
ſhould be given them by others; an utter
<hi>Captivation</hi> of our Underſtandings to the
Obedience of <hi>Faith,</hi> and a modeſt <hi>Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of them, in all doubtful Caſes, to the
Dictates of our <hi>Superiors;</hi> a declining of
Fame and Popularity, and a ſtudious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment
of our own Praiſes and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
but when either the Glory of God, or
the Good of our Brother is concerned in the
Publication. In ſhort, (to uſe the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Pſalmiſt) he is truly <hi>poor in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
who from his Heart can ſay to the
Searcher of Hearts, <hi>Lord, I am not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,
I have no proud looks; I do not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
my ſelf in great Matters, which are too high
for me; but I refrain my ſoul, and keep it low,
like as a child that is weaned from his mother:
yea, my ſoul is even as a weaned child,</hi> Pſal. 131.</p>
                     <p>Having thus briefly ſhewn what it is to
be <hi>poor in Spirit,</hi> both with reſpect to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,</hi>
and with reſpect to <hi>Pride</hi> and
<hi>High-mindedneſs,</hi> I come now, in the ſecond
Place, to ſhew, that this <hi>Poverty of Spirit</hi>
is a Chriſtian Duty; and withal the great
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94628:8"/>
Reaſonableneſs of it. And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
of Spirit,</hi> according to the <hi>firſt</hi> Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of it, is a Chriſtian Duty, 'twould
be Conviction enough to conſider how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
we are called upon in Scripture to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
our Affections from the Creature,
<hi>Coloſ. 3. 1. to ſeek thoſe things which are above;
to ſet our affection on things above, not on things
of the earth; to mortifie our members which are
upon earth,</hi> among which is reckoned <hi>inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
affection, evil concupiſcence, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,
which is idolatry.</hi> Again, We are
bid to <hi>beware of Covetouſneſs,</hi> Luk. 12. 15.
and to have both our <hi>Treaſure</hi> and our <hi>Hearts</hi>
in Heaven; <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 33. to be as indifferent
in the very Enjoyment of any Worldly Good,
as if we enjoyed it not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29. and if
in the <hi>Enjoyment,</hi> then certainly much more
in the <hi>Deſire. Laſtly,</hi> to add no more, We
are cautioned by St. <hi>John</hi> not to love the
World, neither the things that are in the
World. And leſt we ſhould take this only
as a Matter of <hi>Advice</hi> and <hi>Counſel,</hi> not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<hi>Command,</hi> he farther adds, <hi>If any man
love the world, the love of the Father is not in
him,</hi> 1 John 2. 15.</p>
                     <p>But that 'tis a Chriſtian Duty to be thus
<hi>poor in Spirit,</hi> will be farther evident from
the very <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Deſign</hi> of the Chriſtian
Inſtitution. The grand thing intended in
the Chriſtian Religion was, to reduce ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94628:9"/>
Man to his true Good and Happineſs, to
ſublimate, refine and ſpiritualize his Nature,
to looſe him from the Cords of Vanity, and
from his faſt Adheſions to created Good; to
purge him from all Earthly Concretions and
Alloys; to diſ-engage and ſeparate him, not
only from the World about him, but even
from one part of himſelf: In one Word, to
raiſe him from Earth to Heaven, not only
by a <hi>Local,</hi> but by a <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Mental</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, 'twas much otherwiſe under the
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation: There was then great
Indulgence afforded to the Animal Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Worldly Affections of Men; and
their very Religion was indeared to them by
Temporal Promiſes and Bleſſings. Not that
God intended hereby to expreſs any Liking
or Approbation of Covetouſneſs and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſs,
but only to comply with the
Infirmity of that groſs, ſtupid People, which
renderd them incapable of being won upon
by more noble Propoſals. And
beſides,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Spencer</hi> de Legibus Hebraeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Ritualibus.</note> it being a received No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among the Idolatrous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the Land, (as is
obſerved by a late learned Author) that the
Worſhip of their Idols, and falſe Gods, did
procure them fruitful Seaſons, and Increaſe
of all manner of Store; it was in proportion
requiſite, that God alſo ſhould promiſe <hi>his</hi>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94628:9"/>
Votaries the like Worldly Affluence, to keep
them from running over to the <hi>Gentile Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon theſe, and the like Accounts much
was indulged to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State and People:
They were never expreſly required to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
their Deſires from the Things of the
World; nor, unleſs they proceeded to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
<hi>unjuſtly,</hi> that is, what belonged to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
were they ever taxable for a too Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and downward Diſpoſition of Soul. Not
but that Earthly-mindedneſs was as much
an Imperfection in it ſelf as it is now, and
was really forbidden according to the more
retired and involute Senſe of the Law; but
the Letter did not reach it, becauſe then was
the Time and State of Imperfection; and it
was the only <hi>Handle</hi> which that People could
be took hold of by, whoſe <hi>Hardneſs</hi> of <hi>Heart</hi>
was the Occaſion of this, as well as of ſome
other Indulgencies.</p>
                     <p>But now, they that ſhall think themſelves
obliged to no higher Meaſures of Perfection
under the Chriſtian State, know not what
manner of Spirit they are of. Chriſt, as he has
introduced a <hi>Better Hope,</hi> Heb. 7. 19. ſo has he
annexed to it more excellent, and more exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Precepts;</hi> and as his Kingdom was not,
ſo neither is his Religion of this World. The
Chriſtian Law is <hi>Lex Ignea,</hi> a Law of Fire,
a Law that purifies and refines, that warms,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94628:10"/>
actuates and enlightens, that ſeparates alſo
and diſſolves thoſe ſtrong Ties whereby the
Soul ſticks glued to the Earth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apoſtle calls the Chriſtian Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>the law of the Spirit of life;</hi> Rom. 8. 2.
and in another place, <hi>the miniſtration of the
Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. And what our Saviour ſaid
of ſome Words of his, may truly be applied
to all, <hi>The words that I ſpeak unto you, they
are ſpirit, and they are life,</hi> Joh. 6. 63.</p>
                     <p>This therefore being the Deſign of the
Chriſtian Diſpenſation, to perfect Holineſs,
to advance the Intereſt of the Divine Life,
to elevate us to the utmoſt Degree of Moral
Perfection our Nature is here capable of, and,
as far as is poſſible, to make us Partakers of
the Divine, 'tis utterly inconſiſtent with the
<hi>End</hi> of ſuch a Law as this to ſuffer us to lie
groveling with our Faces on the Earth, to
ſeek Reſt and Happineſs in things more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble
than our ſelves, and to grow one, as
it were, with the dirty Planet upon which
we live: We ought rather, (as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
ſpeaks) <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
aſpire to the Meaſures of Immortality, ſhake
off the Clogs of Earth that weigh us down,
and make haſte to be Angels as faſt as we
can. We are obliged by the <hi>Deſign,</hi> as well
as by the <hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> to be as looſe
from the Creature as may be, not to love
the World, nor the Things of the World,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94628:10"/>
whether the Luſt of the Fleſh, or the Luſt
of the Eye, or the Pride of Life; but to be
poor in Spirit, and empty of the Creature,
that we may be rich towards God, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the Fulneſs of him that fills all in all.</p>
                     <p>And now that to be thus <hi>poor in Spirit</hi> is
a <hi>reaſonable</hi> Duty, as well as a <hi>neceſſary</hi> one,
will ſufficiently appear upon theſe two
Grounds:</p>
                     <p>I. Becauſe theſe Worldly Enjoyments are
not our True Good.</p>
                     <p>II. Becauſe they hinder and divert us
from that which really is ſo.</p>
                     <p>That they are not our True Good is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
for, if they were, we ſhould then find
<hi>Reſt</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in them. But this we
are ſo far from doing, that we are as diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<hi>under</hi> our Enjoyments, as <hi>without</hi>
them. For, though by Fruition our Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
be abated as to that particular Object
which we proſecuted, yet ſtill we deſire on
farther, and our <hi>general</hi> Thirſt after Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
is as unſatisfied as ever: Which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
argues, that our True Good is not to be
found in theſe things, but that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation.</hi> To place
therefore our Happineſs in ſuch Objects is
utterly abſurd, and againſt Reaſon, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
us to be groſly ignorant of one of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94628:11"/>
two Things, either of <hi>our ſelves,</hi> or of the
Things of the <hi>World.</hi> We are either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Dignity and Excellence of our
Natures, of the Deſigns and Ends of our
Creation, and of the Strengths and Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of our Appetites, which can be ſatisfied
with nothing leſs than Infinite: Or, if we
do know and conſider all this, then are we
ſo much the more groſly ignorant of the
World about us, to think there is any thing
to be had in this Circle of Vanity, that may
ſatisfie the Importunity of ſuch craving and
capacious Appetites. Poverty of Spirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is reaſonable, becauſe the Things of the
World are not our <hi>True Good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this is the leaſt part of their Charge:
They are not only inſufficient to be our
True Good themſelves, but they alſo, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
hinder and divert us from that which
really is ſo. For, not to mention the many
Snares and Temptations of a great Fortune,
and what a dangerous thing it is to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
furniſhed with all the Poſſibilities and
Opportunities of Sin and Folly; I only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that the very <hi>Deſire</hi> of theſe Earthly
Things diverts us, and takes us off from the
Love of God. When our Love is divided,
even among <hi>Created</hi> Objects, the Force of
it will be much abated in reſpect of each;
but much more will the Love of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
diminiſh from the Love of God: For
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94628:11"/>
there is ſo vaſt a Diſproportion betwixt the
<hi>Kinds,</hi> as well as the <hi>Degrees</hi> of the two
Goods, that he that once comes to reliſh
one, will find but little Taſte in the other.
And therefore, ſays St. <hi>Auſtin, Monemus ne
mundum ametis, ut eum qui fecit mundum li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere
ametis: Our Advice is, that you love not
the World, that ſo you may love its Maker free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
The Truth is, to love God <hi>freely,</hi> we
ſhould love him <hi>entirely;</hi> for, every Advance
we make towards the Creature, ſo much
we recede from God; for theſe are two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Terms of Motion: And there is ſo
great a Contrariety between the Love of
God, and the Love of the World, that they
do not only abaſe each other, but are in
ſome Degrees utterly inconſiſtent. For ſo
St. <hi>John, if any man love the world, the love
of the Father is not in him,</hi> Joh. 2. 15. And
if this be the Conſequence of loving the
World, I think the leſs we have to do with
it, the better; and that there is a great deal
of reaſon to be <hi>Poor in Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus far have we conſider'd the Duty
and Reaſonableneſs of Poverty of Spirit, as
it ſignifies an Indifferency of Deſire to the
Things of the World: I come now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
it, as it denotes Humility, and Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
of Mind; whereof I am alſo to ſhew,
<list>
                           <item>I. The <hi>Duty.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>II. The <hi>Reaſonableneſs.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:94628:12"/>
The Duty of Humility is plain in all the
Scripture, but more frequently and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inculcated in the New Teſtament; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that it may be reckoned among the
<hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> Doctrins of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
The Heathen Morals almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked
it, and in the Old Teſtament Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
'tis but ſparingly recommended; but
in the Chriſtian Inſtitution we every where
meet with it in Capital Characters, as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of the firſt Magnitude, <hi>Jam. 4. 6. God
reſiſteth the proud,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James;</hi> and, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
5. 5. <hi>be ye cloathed with Humility,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
And our Lord himſelf, who was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Example of all Moral and Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and in whom the Fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
dwelt bodily, ſeems yet to commend
himſelf to our Imitation, chiefly upon the
Account of his <hi>Humility; Learn of me,</hi> ſays
he, <hi>for I am meek, and lowly in heart,</hi> Matth.
11. 29.</p>
                     <p>But there needs no Multiplication of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for the Proof of this. I ſhall therefore
only farther obſerve, That the greateſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages
that ever were in the World were
always moſt eminent and conſpicuous for
this Excellency. Out of many, I ſhall ſelect
three Inſtances, which may well deſerve our
Conſideration. The firſt ſhall be the great
Fore-runner of our Bleſſed Saviour, the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Baptiſt.</hi> This Great and Holy Perſon,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94628:12"/>
when the <hi>Jews</hi> ſent Prieſts and <hi>Levites</hi> from
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to demand of him who he was,
not only diſclaimed the Titles of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of
<hi>Elias,</hi> and of <hi>that</hi> Prophet, (this his humble
Spirit was not content with) but went far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and gave this ſtrange and mortified
Account of himſelf, <hi>I am,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the voice
of one crying in the wilderneſs,</hi> Joh. 1. 23. The
Prophet <hi>David,</hi> indeed, had ſaid before of
himſelf, That he was a <hi>Worm,</hi> and <hi>no Man,</hi>
Pſal. 22. 6. And this, one would think, was
a ſufficient Stretch of Humility: But the
<hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſpeaks in a Strain below him, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf to be no more than a <hi>Voice.</hi> The
ſame holy Perſon thought himſelf unworthy
to baptize his Saviour; nay, what makes
that leſs admirable, not worthy ſo much as
to unlooſe the very Latchet of his Shooes.</p>
                     <p>The next Inſtance I ſhall mention, is the
ever-bleſſed <hi>Mother</hi> of our <hi>Lord.</hi> She, if
ever any Creature, had Cauſe to be <hi>proud:</hi>
'Tis impoſſible even to imagin a ſtronger
Temptation. She was ſaluted by an Arch-Angel,
ſaid to be a Perſon highly favoured
with God, and bleſſed among Women; and,
in particular, That ſhe ſhould be Mother to
the Son of the Higheſt, and that too by the
Power of the Moſt High. Was not here
enough to betray a poor innocent Virgin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Pride and Vanity? Had the Angels half
ſo much Reaſon for their Pride and Haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94628:13"/>
when they fell from the Heights of
Glory? Well, how did ſhe behave her ſelf
under the <hi>dangerous</hi> Salutation? Why, ſhe
ſeemed to make it rather Matter of <hi>Obedience</hi>
and <hi>Reſignation,</hi> than of <hi>Triumph</hi> and <hi>Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.
Behold,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>the handmaid of the
Lord: be it unto me according to thy word,</hi>
Luk. 1. 38.</p>
                     <p>But the moſt ſtupendous Inſtance of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
that ever was, or can be, was in the
Perſon of our <hi>Bleſſed Lord;</hi> whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
him in the Myſtery of his Incarnation,
or in the mean Circumſtances of his Birth,
or in the humble Method of his Life; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we conſider him as emptying himſelf
of his Eternal Glories, and drawing a Cloud
over his Brightneſs; or as forbidding the
Devils to publiſh his Divinity, and Men to
declare his Miracles, and his Diſciples to tell
of his Transfiguration; or as waſhing his
Diſciples Feet, or as riding upon an Aſs, or
as converſing among Sinners; and laſtly,
chuſing to die between Thieves. Theſe, and
many ſuch other Inſtances of Condeſcenſion,
argue the moſt profound Humility that can
be imagined; and withal, how concerned
our Lord was to commend and endear this
moſt excellent Duty to the Practice of Men.
Of all the Vertues and Excellencies in the
World, one would have thought this of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
leaſt capable of being <hi>practiſed</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified</hi>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:94628:13"/>
by the Son of God. <hi>Commend</hi> it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
he might by <hi>Precept,</hi> as well as any
other; but ſure, one would think, not by
<hi>Example.</hi> But ſee what rare Arts and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
God has found out, to teach us this
Leſſon. And therefore we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that there is <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> in
it, as well as <hi>Difficulty;</hi> and how much it
concerns us to <hi>learn,</hi> what God has been ſo
peculiarly ſollicitous to <hi>teach.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is then a Chriſtian Duty to be thus <hi>Poor in
Spirit:</hi> And the <hi>Reaſonableneſs</hi> of it is as great
as the <hi>Obligation.</hi> This I might ſhew from the
good Conſequences, and happy Effects of this
Diſpoſition of Spirit; but this falling in more
properly under the Third Partition of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
I ſhall for the preſent content my ſelf
with ſome other Conſideration, taken from
the Condition of Man; whom I ſhall conſider.</p>
                     <p>I. As a <hi>Creature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>II. As a <hi>Sinner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First</hi> then, Man is a <hi>Creature,</hi> and this is a
very reaſonable Ground for Humility, and
Poverty of Spirit. We uſually think it a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>humbling</hi> Conſideration to re-mind a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Meanneſs of his Original. But
now, What Original can be ſo mean, as to
be from <hi>Nothing?</hi> It is enough to take down
the Spirit of the brighteſt Intelligence, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that nothing was his Original; a State
more vile and diſhonourable than the Chaos
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94628:14"/>
it ſelf. Now, this is the Condition of Man:
He had his Riſe from nothing, and derives
his Pedigree, by his <hi>Mother's Side,</hi> from <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
and <hi>Emptineſs:</hi> And though now, by
the Omnipotency of his Creator, he is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
yet ſtill he holds his Being as preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
as he firſt received it, and depends as
much for his Exiſtence upon the Will of his
Creator, as Light does upon the Sun, or the
Image in the Glaſs upon the Preſence of the
Body. If God does but turn his Face from
him, and ceaſe to behold him, he will vaniſh
into nothing. God ſpake the Word, indeed,
before he was made, but to unmake him
there needs no <hi>contradictory Fiat;</hi> he need
only be <hi>ſilent,</hi> and not ſuſtain him by the
<hi>Word of his Power.</hi> And ſhall that Being be
proud, which was once Nothing, and has
ſtill ſuch a <hi>Natural Bent</hi> towards <hi>Annihilation,</hi>
as to need only a bare <hi>Negative</hi> to make him
Nothing again? No, ſays the Wiſe Man,
<hi>Pride was not made for man, nor furious anger
for them that are born of a woman.</hi> Man muſt
forget his Extraction, to give the leaſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
to Pride; and he need but ſtudy
and conſider that, to have the moſt <hi>inward</hi>
and <hi>feeling</hi> Senſe of Humility.</p>
                     <p>This Conſideration is yet farther improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
if we admit the Hypotheſis of thoſe
who ſay, that to be a Creature involves a
State of Nothing, as well as an <hi>Origination</hi>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:94628:14"/>
from Nothing; that there is nothing <hi>Real</hi>
or <hi>Poſitive</hi> in any Creature, but what is from
God; and that though a Creature be Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
as of God, yet he is nothing as of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
nor can exert any poſitive Act or Oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
from himſelf, as a diſtinct Principle of
Action; being ſtill, as to <hi>that,</hi> as much a
<hi>Nothing</hi> as before. If this be true, (and he
that ſhall conſider, and well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. Ration. de Deo, p. 574.</note>
what is alledged by <hi>M.
Poiret,</hi> in Defence of this Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
will ſcarce find it in his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to think otherwiſe) certainly Man has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Reaſon to be <hi>poor in Spirit,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
into the loweſt Abyſs of Humility and
<hi>Self-Abdication,</hi> as becomes a Being that not
only <hi>was once,</hi> but <hi>is ſtill</hi> a mere <hi>Nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Man therefore, as a <hi>Creature,</hi> has ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Reaſon to be humble, and <hi>poor in Spirit.</hi>
But if we conſider him <hi>2ly,</hi> as a <hi>Sinner,</hi> he
has Cauſe, not only to be humble, but to
lie down flat upon his Face, and look upon
himſelf to be more baſe and vile than the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Duſt whereof he was form'd, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he treads. To be a Sinner is much more
vile than to be the meaneſt Creature; and
the Non-Entity of <hi>Sin</hi> is more diſhonourable
than that of <hi>Nature.</hi> This latter, tho' it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
actually conform, yet it is not diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to the Will of God: But the former <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
contradicts and <hi>reſiſts</hi> his Will. This
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94628:15"/>
is, as I think one of the <hi>Fathers</hi> calls it, <hi>Nihil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle,
&amp; in Deum ar matum,</hi> an <hi>Armed Nothing.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
to be a Creature, involves Weakneſs
and Imperfection in it; but then it alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves
Good, becauſe nothing can be, but
by partaking of the Perfection of God. But
now, to be a Sinner involves nothing but
pure and unmixt Evil; and is withal, a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Remove from Good than to be nothing,
ſince it is, not only <hi>negatively,</hi> but <hi>contrarily</hi>
oppoſed to it. 'Tis indeed the greateſt Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroſity
and Deformity in the World, the
greateſt Contradiction to Order and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
to Reaſon and Proportion, to Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
and Happineſs: In one Word, 'Tis
the only Thing which God hates. What
great Reaſon then has Man to be humble,
and <hi>poor in Spirit;</hi> poor even to Emptineſs,
and Self-Annihilation, who is not only a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
but a <hi>ſinful Creature!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having now ſhewn the Duty and Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
of Poverty of Spirit, in the full La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the Word, I proceed to ſhew, in
the Third Place, the Happineſs of thoſe who
are ſo diſpoſed. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit,</hi>
ſays our Saviour, <hi>for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven.</hi> That's the only Bleſſedneſs which
is here expreſly mentioned: But they are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
alſo in other Regards: For, in the firſt
place, What an happy Diſpoſition of Soul
muſt it be, always to carry about one ſuch
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94628:15"/>
a ſtrong and lively Conviction of the Vanity
of all created Good, as not to run out into
vehement Deſires after it? For, Deſire it ſelf,
to go no farther, is always a great Torment:
'Tis the ſame to the Soul, that <hi>Thirſt</hi> is to
the Body; and <hi>Hope deferr'd</hi> (as the Wiſe
Man tells us) <hi>makes the heart ſick,</hi> Prov. 13.
But that is not all; for here will come in the
Trouble of <hi>Diſappointment,</hi> as well as of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire:</hi>
Not that which the World generally
underſtands by Diſappointment, the not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
what you deſigned, (tho' that alſo
will often happen) but the not <hi>enjoying</hi> what
you have compaſſed, the <hi>Diſappointment</hi> of
<hi>Fruition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now, to be <hi>poor in Spirit</hi> is the Way
to avoid all this. Such a Perſon expects no
Happineſs from the Creature; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
not to find it there, will be to him
no Diſappointment. He does not lean upon
any created Good with any <hi>Streſs;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though it ſhould fail under him, his Fall
will be but ſlight and eaſie. And, indeed,
it is not to be imagined what a deal of Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Care, Reſtleſneſs, Diſappointment, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
fruitleſs Labour and Endeavour are
ſaved by this Poverty of Spirit. And I think
this is no ſmall Degree of Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Again, Is it not a great Happineſs to be
ſo moderately and indifferently affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the World, as to be contented with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94628:16"/>
any Condition in it? To be of a quiet, ſedate,
reſigned and diſ-intereſſed Diſpoſition? He
that is thus diſpoſed, is above, or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Reach of calamitous Accidents. The
Storm flies over his Head, he has nothing
for Fortune to take hold of: Nor will he be
under the Hazard of parting with his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
to ſecure his Worldly Intereſt. No;
he can do his Duty, tho' at the Expence of
Martyrdom; and tho' highly <hi>deſerving</hi> of the
<hi>best</hi> Times, may yet be <hi>truſted</hi> in the <hi>worst.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then as to the Happineſs attending upon
Poverty of Spirit, as it ſtands for Humility,
there is no one Vertue that is more her own
Reward than this: Pride is the moſt <hi>uneaſie</hi>
thing in the World; and withal, the moſt
<hi>odious; uneaſie</hi> to the <hi>Patient,</hi> and <hi>odious</hi> to
the <hi>Obſerver.</hi> And, as it is uneaſie in it ſelf, ſo
is it the Parent of many troubleſom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie
Paſſions; ſuch as Anger, Contention,
Revenge, Envy, Impatience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that
it is hard to determin whether the proud
Man be more <hi>ridiculous</hi> or <hi>miſerable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now, to be humble, is to be wiſe, to
underſtand the true Proportion and Meaſure
of a Creature, to be ſerene, to be contented,
to be thankful, to be pleaſant and chearful,
to be calm and untroubled, to be diſpaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and unconcerned. In ſhort, No Man
enjoys what he really is, ſo much as he that
does not fanſie himſelf what he is not. And
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94628:16"/>
beſides, The humble Man is ſure to get that
very Honour which he declines, and becauſe
he declines it. I end this with the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Plato,</hi> That a Man that does not
rightly know himſelf can neither be <hi>prudent,
good,</hi> nor <hi>happy;</hi> which is all that goes to the
Perfection of Man: And he that does, is ſure
to be all this.</p>
                     <p>Thus far of the Happineſs belonging to the
two Kinds of Poverty of Spirit <hi>ſeverally.</hi>
There remains yet one more belonging to
them both in <hi>common;</hi> and that is, <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven,</hi> which I ſuppoſe to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
both <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> As to <hi>Grace,</hi>
we are told by the Apoſtle, that <hi>God has
choſen the poor in this world to be rich in faith.</hi>
And in the ſame place where God is ſaid to
reſiſt the Proud, he is ſaid alſo to give <hi>Grace</hi>
to the <hi>Humble,</hi> Jam. 4. 6. Indeed, Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is the proper Foundation of Grace, and
the Theatre of all Divine Operations. This
State of Nothingneſs, and Self-emptineſs, is
as much a Preparation to the <hi>New,</hi> as the
<hi>Void</hi> and <hi>Inform Space</hi> was to the <hi>Old</hi> Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
'Tis the true and proper <hi>firſt Matter</hi> in
the Spiritual World, into which the Form of
the <hi>New Creature</hi> will be introduced: And if
Man does but contain himſelf in this <hi>Nothing,</hi>
God will not fail to work all, and to be all in
him; having promiſed his Special Preſence
to the Man of an <hi>humble Spirit,</hi> Iſa. 57. 15.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:94628:17"/>
Then, as for <hi>Glory,</hi> 'tis highly equitable,
that they who have humbled themſelves
here, ſhould be exalted hereafter; and that
they who have renounced this World, ſhould
have their Portion in the next. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the ſlow-hearted and diſtruſtful World,
that thus it ſhall be, God has already given
a Specimen of it, in the Example of his Son,
who was particularly eminent for this double
Poverty of Spirit; for <hi>Renouncing</hi> the World,
and for <hi>Debaſing himſelf;</hi> whom therefore
God has <hi>highly exalted, giving him a name above
every name;</hi> Phil. 2. 9. and has alſo placed
him on his own Right Hand, <hi>Angels, and
Authorities, and Powers being made ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 22.</p>

                     <p>THEY are the Words of him who was
himſelf a Man of Sorrows, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Grief; and who was alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with <hi>Happineſs</hi> too, with the Joys
of Religion, with the Refreſhments of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
with the Antepaſts of Glory, and with
that Peace of God which now paſſes all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and ſhall hereafter ſatisfie all
Deſire: He had taſted of both Cups, the <hi>Cup</hi>
of <hi>Trembling,</hi> and the <hi>Cup</hi> of <hi>Salvation:</hi> He
had tried both the Miſeries of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Glories of the Divine; and ſo
well knew what Proportion the Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God have to the Infelicities of Man;
and how little the Sufferings of this preſent
time are, in compariſon of the Glory that
ſhall be revealed to them that with Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
bear them, and with Fruitfulneſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
under them. He therefore having tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both the <hi>Worſt,</hi> and the <hi>Beſt,</hi> muſt needs
be a proper Judge in the Caſe, whether Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
may conſiſt with Affliction, or no.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94628:18"/>
And he is ſo far from diſcouraging his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
from treading in the ſame thorny, rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Way that he did, that he rather gives
them all the Invitation in the World to do
ſo, caſts a <hi>Glory</hi> round the Head of the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful,
and repreſents Grief as a very love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thing, by telling them, that <hi>Bleſſed are
they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But are <hi>all</hi> thoſe bleſſed that mourn? And
does Grief intitle all that are under its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
to Happineſs and Conſolation?
This, indeed, would be good News to this
our World, where there is ſo much of it;
which is a Valley of Tears, and a Region
of Sadneſs; where there are a thouſand
Sighs, for one Smile; and where <hi>the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
go about the ſtreets,</hi> Eccl. 12. 5. But it is
not all Mourning that comes within the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of this Beatitude; nor ſhall all that ſow
in Tears, reap with Joy. As there are ſome
that <hi>ſorrow without Hope,</hi> ſo is there ſome
kind of Sorrow, concerning which we can
hope nothing. There is a Sorrow that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from no Human and Moral Principle,
but from Natural and Neceſſary Cauſes; as,
from the Influence of External Impreſſions,
from the Groſneſs of the Spirits and Blood,
from Melancholy, and the like. Again,
There is a Sorrow, which tho' of an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and Moral Extraction, yet ſprings from
no good or laudable Principle, but is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94628:18"/>
of a neutral and indifferent Nature.
Again, There is a Sorrow that proceeds from
an ill Principle; as, from Malice, Envy, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,
Ambition, Servile Fear, and the
like: And which tends alſo to an ill End; as,
to Revenge, Impatience, Deſpair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the Apoſtle tells us of a <hi>Worldly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi>
and of a Sorrow that worketh <hi>Death,</hi>
2 Cor. 7. So far is all Mourning from being
Chriſtian Mourning, or from giving us a
juſt Title to this Beatitude.</p>
                     <p>Here therefore it will concern us to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Three Things:
<list>
                           <item>I. That there is ſuch a Thing as the Duty
of Chriſtian Mourning.</item>
                           <item>II. Who theſe Chriſtian Mourners are.</item>
                           <item>III. Wherein conſiſts their Bleſſedneſs.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>And Firſt, I ſay, that there is ſuch a thing
as <hi>Chriſtian Mourning.</hi> This muſt needs ſeem
a ſtrange Paradox to the Philoſophy of thoſe
who make the Pleaſures of the Animal Life
the End of Man, and think that now we have
nothing to do but to enjoy them, and that
God ſent <hi>Man</hi> into the World to the ſame
purpoſe as he placed the <hi>Leviathan</hi> in the Sea,
only to take his Paſs-time therein. 'Twould
be but a cold Employment to go about to
convince ſuch Men, either of the <hi>Neceſſity,</hi>
or of the <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> of Mourning; whoſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94628:19"/>
Anſwer would be in the Language of thoſe
Sinners in the Book of Wiſdom, <hi>Come on,
let us enjoy the good things that are preſent, and
let us ſpeediby uſe the creatures, as in our youth.
Let us fill our ſelves with coſtly wine, and oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and let no flower of the ſpring paſs by us.
Let us crown our ſelves with roſe-buds before they
be withered, let none of us go without his part
of our voluptuouſneſs, let us leave tokens of our
joyfulneſs in every place; for this is our portion,
and our lot is this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the Style of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> School.
And there are alſo ſome Chriſtians, who,
tho' they do not make the Pleaſure of the
Animal Life their End, Lot and Portion, as
do the other, yet they think they may allow
themſelves a great Scope and Compaſs in it,
that they may indulge themſelves to the full
in all the Mirth and Jollity of the World, and
that there is no need of any ſuch thing as
mourning in <hi>Sion.</hi> Theſe Men ſeem to have
the ſame Notion of Chriſt's <hi>Religion,</hi> that
the <hi>Jews</hi> had of his <hi>Perſon.</hi> They looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him under the Character of a great Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Prince; and dreamt of nothing under
his Reign but Victories, and Triumphs, and
Feſtivals, and Vine-yards, and Olive-yards.
And ſo ſome think of his Religion. They
look upon it as a fine, gay, ſecular, jolly
Profeſſion; as a State of Freedom and Eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation,
of Eaſe and Pleaſantneſs; as if the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94628:19"/>
Children of the Kingdom had nothing to do,
but to eat, drink, and be merry, and that
Mourning had no more place in <hi>this,</hi> than it
is to have in the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> wherein, as
the Evangelical Prophet tells us, <hi>All tears ſhall
be wiped away from mens eyes, and there ſhall be
no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, nor
any more pain,</hi> Rev. 21. 4.</p>
                     <p>It is, indeed, moſt certain, that Religion
has its Joys and Pleaſures, and that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion has the moſt of any, and that
they are ſuch too as by far tranſcend all
others; that the beſt Life is alſo the moſt
pleaſant Life; and that 'tis worth while to
live well, if it were only for the mere plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of doing ſo. And there is a great deal
of Truth in that noble Saying of
<hi>Hierocles,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Comment. in Aurea Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, p. 177.</note>

                        </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. The
good Man excels the wicked Man,
not only in Goodneſs, but alſo in
Pleaſure it ſelf; for whoſe ſake only the other is
wicked.</hi> Nay, farther; The Pleaſures of good
Men are not only greater than thoſe of ill
Men, but ſuch as they cannot enjoy or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
and have no manner of Notion of. As
there are ſome Things of God, ſo there are
Pleaſures of Religion, which the Animal Man
does not perceive: For <hi>the ſecret of the Lord
is with them that fear him,</hi> and <hi>the ſtranger does
not intermeddle with their joy.</hi> Nay, farther
yet; No Man has any Ground or Pretence
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94628:20"/>
for Rejoycing, but a good Man. 'Tis the
moſt uſurping and daring Piece of Impudence
in the World, for an ill Man to laugh, or
be merry. What has he to do with Mirth,
who has the Wrath of God abiding on him,
and Hell open to receive him? It does not
belong to him, 'tis none of his Part. Mirth
is the Reward of a good Conſcience, the
Prerogative of Innocence, and the peculiar
Right of good Men: And they not only <hi>may</hi>
be joyful and chearful, but are alſo <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
to be ſo. Thus in the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 11.
<hi>Thou ſhalt rejoice before the Lord thy God,</hi> ſays
<hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Votary. So again the
Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 33. Rejoice in the Lord, O ye
righteous; for it becometh well the juſt to be
thankful.</hi> Again, <hi>Pſal. 68. Let the righteous
be glad, and rejoice before God: let them alſo be
merry and joyful.</hi> And again, <hi>Pſal. 100. Serve
the Lord with gladneſs.</hi> And ſays our bleſſed
Lord, in his Farewell-Diſcourſe to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<hi>Joh. 15. 11. Theſe things have I ſpoken
unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and
that your joy might be full.</hi> And we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
to <hi>rejoice evermore</hi> by the Apoſtle,
1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. who alſo reckons <hi>Joy</hi> among the
<hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 22.</p>
                     <p>Now all this is true, and I not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
but alſo recommend the thing hitherto
pleaded for. But then 'tis alſo to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
what the Wiſe Man ſays, that <hi>to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94628:20"/>
thing there is a ſeaſon;</hi> and that there is a
Time to <hi>weep</hi> and <hi>mourn,</hi> as well as a Time
to <hi>laugh</hi> and <hi>dance,</hi> Eccleſ. 3. And this not
only from <hi>Natural,</hi> but alſo from <hi>Moral</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity:
For the Circumſtances of Human
Life are ſuch, as make it our <hi>Duty,</hi> as well
as <hi>Fate,</hi> to mourn, and be ſorrowful. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
has its gloomy, as well as bright Side;
and there are to be Days of Darkneſs, as well
as Days of Light, in the Chriſtian Kalendar.</p>
                     <p>This is intimated to us by ſeveral <hi>Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi>
and by ſeveral <hi>Examples,</hi> in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Thus the Church in general is, in the
Divine Song of <hi>Solomon,</hi> compared to a Dove;
which, tho' conſiderable for ſome other Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
is yet for nothing ſo remarkable as for
her continual Mourning. So far was that
Wiſe Man from the Opinion of thoſe who
make Temporal Proſperity, a Mark of the
True Church. Again, ſays the ſame wiſe
Preacher, <hi>It is better to go to the houſe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than to the houſe of feaſting.</hi> And again,
<hi>Sorrow is better than laughter.</hi> Where you
ſee he not only inculcates the Practice of
Mourning, but alſo expreſly prefers it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its Contrary. And he gives this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for it, becauſe <hi>by the ſadneſs of the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
the heart is made better,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 3. And
therefore he makes this the Meaſure of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Folly, by telling us in the next
Verſe, <hi>That the heart of the wiſe is in the houſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94628:21"/>
of mourning, but the heart of fools in the houſe
of mirth.</hi> This Practice of Mourning is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where inculcated in the Writings of the
Prophets, but eſpecially of the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi>
who has writ a whole Book of <hi>Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
But, above all, 'tis remarkable what
our Lord himſelf ſays of Mourning, in the
16th. of St. <hi>John,</hi> where he ſeems to make
it the great Mark of Difference between his
Diſciples and the Men of this World, <hi>Verily,
verily,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I ſay unto you, that ye ſhall weep
and lament, but the world ſhall rejoice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor do there want <hi>Examples</hi> of this holy
Mourning in Scripture. Thus the Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Hannah</hi> is expreſſed by her being a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of a ſorrowful Spirit, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 15. The
Royal Prophet ſpent his whole Time almoſt
in Mourning and Sorrow, which he alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
and fomented with Muſic and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Hymns: And yet he was a Man wiſe
and learned, and a Man after God's own
Heart; and withal, a Man of great Buſineſs,
and publick Occupation. Thus again the
Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> was a great Mourner; a Man
as inſatiable in his <hi>Sorrow,</hi> as ſome are in
their <hi>Luxury.</hi> He was ſo full of Grief, as
not to be ſatisfied with the natural and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Ways of expreſſing it: And therefore
ſays he, <hi>Oh, that my head were waters, and
mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep
day and night,</hi> Jer. 9. 1. More I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94628:21"/>
in, but I cloſe all with the great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of our Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt,
who, as the Text ſays, was a <hi>Man of Sorrows,</hi>
and acquainted with Grief; and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his laſt Paſſion and Agony, when his
Soul was exceeding ſorrowful, even unto
death; and when, as the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
ſays, <hi>Heb. 5. 7. He offered up prayers and
ſupplications, with ſtrong crying and tears;</hi> but
alſo throughout the whole Courſe of his Life.
We oftentimes read of his Weeping and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing,
as upon his Proſpect of the City <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
at the Grave of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
after his laſt Supper, when, as the Text
ſays, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. he began to be <hi>ſorrowful,</hi> and
<hi>very heavy;</hi> and in the Garden, where he
wept Tears of Blood. But we never read
that he ever laughed. Once, indeed, 'tis ſaid,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 10. that he rejoiced; but then it was not
with an outward, ſenſitive and tumultuous
Joy; but with an inward, ſpiritual and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Exultation: <hi>He rejoiced in Spirit.</hi> And
what was it for? Not upon any Animal or
Secular Account, but upon an Occaſion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
Spiritual and Divine. 'Twas for
the abundant Grace of his Father, beſtowed
upon his Diſciples; and for their good uſe
of it, and improvement under it.</p>
                     <p>I do not intend in all this, ſuch rigid Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
as are practiſed and exacted by ſome of
the Religious Orders of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94628:22"/>
where a Man is not allowed ſo much as to
laugh, or to ſay any thing but <hi>Frater memento
mori,</hi> for ſeveral Years together. This would
be to turn Society into a <hi>dumb Shew,</hi> to make
Life a Burthen, and withal, to bring an ill
Report upon the good Land of Promiſe, and
to diſcourage Men from the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
But that which I ſtand for is this,
That we ought not ſo to give our ſelves over
to Secular Mirth and Jollity, but that we are
ſtill to remember that we are in the Vail of
Tears; that there is a Time for Mourning,
as well as for Rejoicing; and that this is that
Time, now we are in our Exile, and in the
midſt of Dangers and Fears; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Sorrow muſt ſometimes have its Turn,
as well as Joy; and that there is ſuch a Thing
as Chriſtian Mourning.</p>
                     <p>Nor need we be troubled that we have
diſcovered ſuch an ungrateful Duty, ſince
there is a <hi>Beatitude</hi> annexed to it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
as was before remarked, all manner of
Mourning will not come within its Compaſs,
it will concern us, in the ſecond place, to
conſider who theſe Chriſtian Mourners are.
This, I think, cannot be reſolved by any
better Meaſure, than by conſidering what
are the true and proper Cauſes why a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ought to mourn. Now to this I ſhall
anſwer,
<list>
                           <pb n="35" facs="tcp:94628:22"/>
                           <item>I. In <hi>General.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>II. In <hi>Particular.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>In General, I ſay, that then a Chriſtian
mourns for a due and proper Cauſe, when
the Principle of his Sorrow is either Zeal for
the Honour and Glory of God, or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for the Good of Mankind: Nothing
leſs than this can either deſerve his Sorrow,
or derive any Virtue or Excellency upon it.
So that, in ſhort, <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> will be
the two Principles into which all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Mourning muſt be at laſt reſolved.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this may be exemplified in
variety of Inſtances, it will not be amiſs to
conſider ſome of the more remarkable of
them. I anſwer therefore more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That one very proper and reaſonable
Cauſe why a Chriſtian ſhould mourn, is,
the <hi>Conſideration of Sin.</hi> For a Man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
ſeriouſly what a great and ſtrange kind
of Evil Sin is; how contrary to God, to his
Nature, to his Will, to his Commands, to
his Goodneſs, to his Juſtice, to the wiſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his Grace and Providence, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to the great Myſtery of Godlineſs: Then
to conſider how contrary it is to Man, to his
Nature, to his Reaſon, to his Rational In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts
and Inclinations, to his inward Peace
and Satisfaction; and laſtly, to his Intereſt,
both Temporal and Spiritual, Private and
Publick, Preſent and Future: Then again,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94628:23"/>
to conſider, how prone we are to commit it,
and that we our ſelves are the Authors of
this Proneneſs: And Laſtly, How much of
this great, ſtrange Evil there is in the World;
how Iniquity abounds, and the Love of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
waxes cold; that the whole World, as
St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>Joh. 5. 19. lies in wickedneſs;</hi>
that there are but few that pretend to any
Strictneſs or Regularity of Living, and yet
ſewer that diſcharge their Pretenſions truly
and ſincerely. I ſay, For a Man to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all this, to conſider it ſeriouſly and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly,
muſt needs be a ſad Scene of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
and ſuch as will juſtly call for his
Sorrow and Mourning. It was ſo to God
himſelf, who is brought in by <hi>Moſes</hi> as griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at his very Heart for the Abundance of
Wickedneſs which he beheld in the Old
World. And I queſtion not, but that, among
the bitter Ingredients of our Lord's Paſſion,
this was none of the leaſt, to foreſee that
there would be ſo many, who by their final
Impenitence, and perſevering in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
would receive no Benefit from it. And,
if we may judge by Proportion, the Angels
in Heaven, who rejoice at the Converſion
of one Sinner, do alſo <hi>mourn</hi> and <hi>lament</hi> for
the irreclaimable Wickedneſs of ſo many
Millions as are in the World. 'Tis a Thing
worth our Conſidering, and worth our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting.
And therefore ſays the Pſalmiſt,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94628:23"/>
                        <hi>Pſal. 119. Rivers of waters run down mine
eyes, becauſe men keep not thy law.</hi> And again,
<hi>It grieveth me when I ſee the tranſgreſſors.</hi> This
is a vertuous and laudable Sorrow, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from a good and noble Principle,
from Piety and Charity: And he that mourns
upon this Conſideration, is a true <hi>Chriſtian
Mourner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, Secondly, Another very proper and
reaſonable Cauſe why a Chriſtian ſhould
mourn, is the Conſideration of the <hi>Miſeries of
Human Life.</hi> 'Tis a moſt deplorable thing
to conſider what a deal, and what Variety of
Miſery there is in the World at once. <hi>Many</hi>
Things muſt concur, to make us tolerably
<hi>happy;</hi> but <hi>one</hi> Thing alone is oftentimes
enough to make us very <hi>miſerable.</hi> And how
unhappy then muſt Human Life be, among
ſuch a Multitude of Evils as are incident to
it! I ſhall not go about to re-count or deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
them: They are too many to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd,
and too various to be reduced to any
Method. This only I ſay, That ſhould a
Man, by ſome compendious Device, have
an united Proſpect of the Miſeries of the
World, as our Saviour, by the Devil's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice,
had of the Glories of it, 'twould be the
moſt diſmal Landſcape that ever was drawn,
or can be imagined. 'Twas for this that ſome
of the Ancients reckoned an early Death
among the greateſt Bleſſings of Heaven.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94628:24"/>
                        <hi>Quem Dii diligunt, Adoleſcens moritur, The
Favourite of the Gods dies young,</hi> ſays the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>median.
But <hi>Solomon</hi> goes farther, <hi>Eccleſs.</hi> 6.
and prefers an <hi>untimely Birth</hi> before a Man
that has ſpent many Years in this World. To
be ſhort, Such is our Condition here, that
we ſee God has not thought fit to truſt us
with the leaſt Fore-knowledge of what is
coming upon us, leſt, like Men upon a deep
Precipice, we ſhould be amazed, confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and fall down at the dreadful Proſpect.
And if the private Circumſtances of each ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Man's Life be ſo black and diſconſolate,
that 'tis thought fit he ſhould ſee no farther
than he goes, what ſhall we think of the
Miſeries of all Mankind put together? If
any thing be worth our Sorrow, certainly
this is. Our compaſſionate Saviour wept over
the approaching Ruin of periſing <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi>
And ſhall not a Chriſtian mourn for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
of the whole World? We ſuſpect the
Good Nature of him that can endure to ſit
out a deep Tragedy with dry Eyes: And
can we ſtand and look upon a miſerable
World without mourning? There are ſome
Men of Rocky Hearts, and impaſſible Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
that could ſtand by, and ſee the whole
World in Flames without any Concern, were
but their own little ſelves ſecure from the
Ruin. And this ſome are pleaſed to call <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</hi>
But certainly, Chriſtian Charity, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94628:24"/>
obliges us to ſympathize with the Miſeries of
each particular Man, to weep with thoſe that
weep, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, does much more
require us to lament the common Miſeries of
Human Life. This therefore is a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Cauſe of <hi>Chriſtian Mourning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As is alſo, in the Third Place, the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Emptineſs</hi> of all
Worldly and Created Good. The general
Cauſe of moſt of the Diſcontent and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
that is in the World, is becauſe Men
cannot get ſo much of Worldly Good as they
deſire; not at all queſtioning its <hi>Vanity.</hi> But,
on the contrary, ſuppoſing that if they could
<hi>compaſs</hi> ſuch and ſuch Things, they ſhould
be happy; and their only Trouble is, that
they cannot <hi>get</hi> them. Now this is properly
Worldly Sorrow, and comes from an ill Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
either from Covetouſneſs, Luſt, or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.
But now there may be a vertuous
and laudable Diſcontent, as well as a vicious
and ſordid one: And that is, When a Man
mourns, and is troubled; not becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>compaſs</hi> ſuch and ſuch Created Goods:
No; perhaps he would not eat of the Fruit,
if he could reach it, but purely becauſe they
are all <hi>empty</hi> and <hi>vain,</hi> and cannot ſatisfie.
He does not grieve becauſe he <hi>wants them,</hi> for
it may be he chuſes to be without them; but
becauſe they are wanting in <hi>themſelves,</hi> and
have not that in them which can ever make
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94628:25"/>
him happy. And, indeed, it is enough to
caſt a Damp upon the Spirit of any Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man, to think that what is ſubſtantial
and ſatisfactory is out of his Reach, and that
all is Vanity and Vexation that lies within it;
that the former he cannot <hi>enjoy,</hi> and that the
latter cannot <hi>ſatisfie.</hi> To be throughly and
inwardly convinced that all Fruition is a
Cheat, and ſo to have nothing in Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
no one Glimpſe or Proſpect of Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before one, to invite one to live longer:
This is a ſad Reflection, and ſuch as muſt
needs cauſe Sorrow and Mourning. But
then, 'tis a very laudable one, and ſuch as
proceeds from an excellent Principle. 'Tis
a Sorrow that ariſes from <hi>Increaſe of Wiſdom,</hi>
Eccleſ. 1. 18. from a right Notion and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of Things, from Contempt of
the World, from a due Conſciouſneſs of our
own Powers and Capacities, and from the
more than ordinary Aſpirings of the Soul to
God, who alone is able to ſatisfie her. And,
to be ſorry upon ſuch Principles as theſe, is
to ſorrow in a Rational Way, and after a
Godly Sort.</p>
                     <p>To inſtance one more: Another very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Cauſe why a Chriſtian ſhould mourn, is
the Conſideration of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty</hi> of our
<hi>Salvation,</hi> and the infinite Miſery of thoſe
who ſhall miſcarry in ſo momentous a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.
As to the Certainty of our Salvation,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94628:25"/>
it is not ſo great as ſome are apt to imagin:
For, tho' I can be aſſured of this Propoſition
with a certainty of Divine Faith, it being
Matter of expreſs Revelation, that the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and the Penitent ſhall be ſaved; yet that
I believe and repent, can be known to me
only on the Grounds of Experimental Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which is an Human, and therefore
Fallible Teſtimony: And conſequently, the
Concluſion always following the weaker
Part, I cannot be aſſured of my Salvation
with a Certainty of Divine Faith, but only
with an Human and Moral Aſſurance; which,
indeed, to call it by a right Name, is no
more than an high Probability, a ſtrong
Preſumption.</p>
                     <p>But yet, if even this Moral Aſſurance were
<hi>Abſolute</hi> and <hi>Irreverſible,</hi> and were to take in
the <hi>Future,</hi> as well as the <hi>Preſent,</hi> 'twere yet
a conſiderable Stay and Security. But it is
not ſo with us: That Aſſurance which we
have is abſolute only for the Preſent, and
reaches not the Future, but only upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
ſuppoſing that we perſevere in the
preſent Diſpoſition; which, conſidering the
Multability of our Wills, and the Multitude
of our Temptations, and the frequent Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Apoſtacy, is a thing not only of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,</hi>
but of <hi>hazardous</hi> Conſquence.</p>
                     <p>And as we are not, cannot be abſolutely
ſure that we ſhall not miſcarry, ſo, on the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94628:26"/>
other hand, 'tis moſt certain, that we ſhall
be unſpeakably miſerable if we do. For a
Man to fall off from his laſt End, and only
true Good, without any hopes or Poſſibility
of Recovery, is a thing that can hardly be
thought of without Confuſion and Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Now let a Man put theſe two things
together, That whether he ſhall be ſaved,
or no, is a Matter of a depending and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
iſſue; and that if he miſcarry, his
Caſe is intolerable; and then tell me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be not a juſt Cauſe for Trouble and
Sadneſs; and whether this Salvation, this
uncertain Salvation, be not to be wrought
out with <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Mourning,</hi> as well as
with <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Trembling?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Certainly it is: And were it not for this,
it would be no eaſie thing to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
why Gravity, Seriouſneſs, and Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of Spirit ſhould be ſuch decent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
Qualities in Men. For otherwiſe,
Why ſhould not a Man give himſelf up to
the utmoſt Gaity and Jollity, and expreſs it
in all manner of odd Poſtures and Geſtures,
up to the heighth of an <hi>Antick Diſſoluteneſs?</hi>
I ſay, Why ſhould not a Man do this? But
only becauſe this is not agreeable to the Part
he is to act; who being in a State of Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Doubtfulneſs, and having ſo great
an Intereſt depending, ought rather to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and correct the Luxuriancy of his Spirit,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94628:26"/>
with ſome Grains of Sadneſs, and Penſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and beware of laughing too much here,
leſt it ſhould be his Turn to weep and mourn
hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the principal Cauſes of <hi>Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
And from hence we may gather, who
the <hi>Chriſtian-Mourners</hi> are, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this Beatitude; thoſe, namely,
whoſe <hi>Mourning</hi> proceeds upon theſe, or
ſuch like Grounds; which are at laſt reduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to either of theſe two Principles, Zeal
for the Honour and Glory of God, or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for the Good of Mankind. They who
mourn upon the Score of <hi>Piety</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi>
are true <hi>Chriſtian-Mourners.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It remains that we now conſider, in the
laſt place, wherein conſiſts their Bleſſedneſs.
St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in his Confeſſions and Meditations,
very frequently ſpeaks of the <hi>Grace of Tears;</hi>
and as often <hi>prays</hi> for it: And well he might,
ſince it is attended with ſuch happy Effects,
and has ſuch a Bleſſedneſs intailed upon it.
Its Bleſſedneſs is both preſent, and to come.
What the preſent Bleſſedneſs is, we may
learn from the Wiſe Man, who tells us, That
<hi>by the ſadneſs of the countenance the heart is
made better.</hi> It is ſo; for by this it becomes
more ſoft and tender for all Divine Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
for the Love of God, for Devotion,
for Charity to our Neighbour, for Mercy
and Compaſſion, for Repentance, and the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94628:27"/>
like. It is alſo hereby made more ſerious,
more conſiderative and reflecting, more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected,
more ſetled and compoſed; which
is to be conſiderably <hi>better.</hi> For, as Sorrow
is the Principle of Conſideration, ſo is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
the Principle of Repentance and
Well-living, according to that of the Pſalmiſt,
<hi>I conſidered my own ways, and turned my feet to
thy teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal. 119.</p>
                     <p>And of all this we have a very ſignal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who, till
the Time of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, were
very groſs and carnal, notwithſtanding ſo
many <hi>Miracles</hi> of God, both in their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in their Paſſage
through the Wilderneſs. And when they
were brought into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> tho'
they had ſuch open and clear Teſtimonies of
the Divine Preſence among them; ſo many
Prophecies, ſo many Miracles, and ſo many
Apparitions of Angels; yet we find them
ever now and then relapſing into Idolatry.
But after the Captivity, when they had gone
through a Courſe of Sorrow and Affliction,
they preſently began to behave themſelves
more orderly; and ſeemed, like Gold, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine</hi>
upon the Trial of the Furnace: For we
do not read, that after that time they ever
fell into <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And accordingly, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to deal with them now no longer as
Children, but as Perſons of ſome <hi>Maturity,</hi>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:94628:27"/>
by withdrawing from them his <hi>Viſible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi>
and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Prophecy;</hi> thinking
them to have learnt enough already in the
School of Affliction, to ſuperſede all other
Methods of Inſtruction and Diſcipline. And
from that Time forwards, the <hi>Minds</hi> of <hi>Men</hi>
began to be more generally erected towards
Heaven, and the Good Things of a better
Life; when they ſaw, that the ſtricteſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers
of the Law fell oftentimes into thoſe
Evils which were denounced againſt the
Tranſgreſſors of it. By which means they
were, by degrees, prepared for the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>This is the preſent Bleſſedneſs of thoſe that
mourn: What the Future is, we are told by
our Saviour; who ſays, they ſhall be <hi>comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
that is, ſhall be received into a <hi>State</hi> or
<hi>Place</hi> of Bliſs and Happineſs, Joy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;
and be infinitely rewarded in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for all their pious and charitable <hi>Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
upon Earth: According to that of the
Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 126. He that now goes on his
way ſorrowing, and bringeth forth good ſeed,
ſhall, doubtleſs, come again with joy, and bring
his ſheaves with him.</hi> They ſhall be received
into the City of God, the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi>
where there is no more <hi>Mourning,</hi> nor Cauſe
of <hi>Mourning;</hi> and where not only <hi>all Sin,</hi>
but even thoſe very <hi>Vertues</hi> which are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the leaſt <hi>Imperfection,</hi> ſhall be done
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94628:28"/>
away. Here therefore there will be no Room
left even for <hi>Godly Sorrow;</hi> but all ſhall be
Joy and Gladneſs, Harmony and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.
And, Bleſſed are they who ſo mourn
here, that they may enter into this Joy of
their Lord hereafter.</p>

                     <p>THE Judgment of God differs ſo very
widely from that of <hi>Man,</hi> that his
Thoughts are ſeldom as our Thoughts, nor
his Ways as our Ways. But in nothing is
the Difference ſo ſignal, as in the Concluſions
concerning <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil, Happineſs</hi> and
<hi>Miſery.</hi> Our Judgments are ſeldom conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Divine in Matters of mere Truth
and Notion, but much ſeldomer in Practical
Maxims, and Moral Reſolutions. Here, if
any where, is chiefly to be found that <hi>Vain
Philoſophy,</hi> which we are cautioned againſt by
the Apoſtle; <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8. and that <hi>Tradition of
Man,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Rudiments of the World,</hi> which
are not after Chriſt. Herein it is that the
Wiſdom of God, and the Wiſdom of the
World, which ſeldom meet in one Point,
ſtand yet moſt divided and oppoſed to each
other; and tho' the latter be always, in ſome
Reſpect or other, Fooliſhneſs to the former,
yet never ſo much as in her Reſolutions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Good and Evil, Happineſs and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94628:29"/>
the World, for the moſt part, calling
that Evil which God calls Good, and thoſe
Miſerable whom God pronounces in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
manner Happy. This is very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
verified in the <hi>Matter</hi> now before us:
For, tho' there has been great Diverſity of
Sentiments in the Gentile-Philoſophy, about
the Objects of Human Happineſs; ſome
placing it in one thing, and ſome in another;
yet, among all their Variety, we do not find
any that placed it in <hi>Humility</hi> or <hi>Meekneſs</hi>
Theſe they ſcarce acknowledged as Vertues
much leſs to be ſuch as wherein the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Man ſhould in great part conſiſt. Nay,
they rather looked upon theſe as mean, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
Diſpoſitions, ſuch as were fit for <hi>Men</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
low Fortunes, and lower Minds; and which
were ſo far from conducing to Happineſs, that
they rather expoſed <hi>Men</hi> to Misfortunes and
Miſeries. But now, theſe are the Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Mind</hi> which our Lord and Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who was the <hi>Wiſdom of his Father,</hi> and the
<hi>Light of the World,</hi> ſingles out, and marks
for a peculiar Excellency and Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Nor need we wonder over-much at the
Singularity of this Chriſtian Paradox, ſince
the whole Courſe of our Saviour's Life and
Doctrin was a direct Contradiction to the
Maxims and Practice of the World. Thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Men hate to unſay or undo what they have
either done or ſaid, and to confeſs their former
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94628:29"/>
Folly by an After-Retractation. But now,
this is the principal thing of our Saviour's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
whoſe whole Goſpel is a Doctrin
of <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is a <hi>Retractation</hi> of
Judgment and Choice. Thus, again, Men
love Riches, but Chriſt choſe to be Poor:
They are altogether for Honours and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but he hid himſelf that he might not
be made a King: They, again, greedily pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
after Pleaſures, but both his Life and
Doctrin was all over Rigour and Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The World thinks Affronts intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and it is reckoned a piece of Gallantry
and Honour to revenge them; but our wiſe
and good Lord choſe to be reviled, and ſpit
upon: They are impatient of Calumnies and
Slanders, but he choſe to be condemned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
innocent: They, Laſtly, (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
complains) <hi>Mal. 3. 15. call the Proud
happy,</hi> and deſpiſe the meek Man, as a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
Slave and Fool; whereas, ſays our
Lord, in Oppoſition to the former, <hi>Bleſſed
are the poor in ſpirit;</hi> and, in Oppoſition to
the latter, <hi>Bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall
inherit the earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the Words, I ſhall diſcourſe of theſe
two Things in general; the <hi>Duty,</hi> and the
<hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> of Meekneſs. In treating of the
firſt it will be requiſite,
<list>
                           <item>1. To conſider what Meekneſs is.</item>
                           <item>
                              <pb n="50" facs="tcp:94628:30"/>
II. To ſhew that it is a Chriſtian Duty.</item>
                           <item>III. To ſtate the Meaſures of its Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in its more general Caſes.</item>
                           <item>IV. To inforce the Practice of it, as far as
it obliges.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt</hi> therefore, As to the Notion of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has long ſince defined it to
be a <hi>Mediocrity</hi> about <hi>Anger:</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
are his Words in the Fourth of his
<hi>Ethicks.</hi> This Difinition, tho' it be true as
far as it goes, yet, like the reſt of his, it
runs in ſuch general Terms, that a Man is
little the wiſer for it: And, indeed, it rather
ſerves to tell us the Meaning of the Word,
than to diſcover the Nature of the Thing.
To do this therefore I ſhould rather think
fit to ſay, That it is ſuch a Temper, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of Mind, whereby a Man ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
and commands the Paſſion of Anger,
as not to be carried to any ſuch Degree of
it, as may either diſcompoſe himſelf, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
his Neighbour. Call this a Definition,
or Deſcription, or what you pleaſe, I think
it is ſuch as may give a ſufficient Idea of the
Thing we are diſcourſing about.</p>
                     <p>This therefore being ſetled, our next Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
is, to ſhew, That to be thus meek, is
a Chriſtian Duty. That it is ſo, might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
appear from this General Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
that it is an Inſtance of <hi>Charity,</hi> which,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94628:30"/>
as we well know, is the Life and Subſtance
of the Chriſtian Law. And it is a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Inſtance too: For, ſince Charity
obliges us to promote both our own, and
our Neighbour's Happineſs, it muſt, by
Conſequence, oblige us to moderate and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
thoſe Paſſions which have any Influence
upon either of them. Now, among all the
Paſſions, there is none, in the Exerciſe of
which, either our own, or our Neighbour's
Happineſs, is ſo often, and ſo much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as in this of Anger. So <hi>often,</hi> it being a
thing of daily Incurſion. So <hi>much,</hi> becauſe
upon this depends all the Strength and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
both of Private and Publick Peace. And
conſequently, ſuch a due Moderation of this
Paſſion as may ſecure both (which is what
we call Meekneſs) is a very conſiderable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Charity, and therefore alſo of the
Chriſtian Law, which is ſo much a Law of
Charity, that, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi>
5. 14. it is <hi>fulfilled</hi> by it. And accordingly
we may obſerve, that among the ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
and Properties of Charity, reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up by the Apoſtle, theſe are particularly
inſiſted upon, that it ſuffers long, and is kind;
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. that it is not eaſily provoked; and
that it bears all things, which are alſo ſome
of the chief Properties of Meekneſs.</p>
                     <p>But that Meekneſs is a Chriſtian Duty,
and one of the firſt Order too, may be more
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94628:31"/>
particularly ſhewn from the expreſs Doctrin
and Example of our Divine Law-giver. As
to his <hi>Doctrin,</hi> he not only commands it, but
ſeems to reſolve all that Moral Excellency
which he either had in himſelf, or would
have in us, to theſe two, <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
Come unto me,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and learn of me.</hi>
But what? Not to make Worlds, not to
cure the Sick, not to reſtore Light to the
Blind, or Life to the Dead, (to uſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
of the excellent Cardinal
<hi>Bona</hi>) but learn of me,<note place="margin">Manuducto ad Coelum, <hi>c. 32. p.</hi> 40.</note> for I am
<hi>meek and lowly in heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What! Was it that our Lord
had no other Vertues; or that he excelled in
theſe two more than in any of the reſt, that
when he bids us learn of him, he propoſes no
other to our Imitation? Neither of theſe can
be ſaid. Not the former, becauſe in him
dwelt the Fulneſs of the Godhead, which is
not conſiſtent with the Abſence of any one
Grace or Vertue. Not the Latter, becauſe
he was uniformly, as well as entirely good,
and had every Vertue in its utmoſt Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
having (as the Scripture ſays of him) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Spirit of God without meaſure.
'Tis true, indeed, he might be, and was more
remarkable for the outward Exerciſe of one
Vertue than another, according as Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and Circumſtances might require: But
as to the inward Habits and Diſpoſitions
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94628:31"/>
themſelves, he was equally perfect in them
all, and did not excel in one, more than in
another. Why then does he recommend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
theſe two to be learnt by his Diſciples? It
muſt be partly becauſe he was the only Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
that could teach ſuch Divine Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and partly becauſe of ſome ſpecial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
in the Vertues themſelves, above
any other of the Chriſtian Law. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alſo our Lord puts them for the whole
of it, by calling them his <hi>Yoke: Take my yoke
upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek, and
lowly in heart,</hi> Mat. 11. 29.</p>
                     <p>Nor are we leſs obliged to this by the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi>
than by the <hi>Precept</hi> of our Lord: For,
as his Example was a Living Law, ſo was
the Practice of his Vertue a very eminent
part of his Example. This he himſelf inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
to us, by aſſigning this for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why we ſhould learn of him. And of
this we may be farther informed from the
whole Story and Proceſs of his Life. Never
was any Man's <hi>Meekneſs</hi> ſo much tried as his
was: For, as the <hi>real</hi> Excellency and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Perſon heightned every Affront and
rude Treatment that was offered him, to an
incomparable Pitch, ſo the <hi>outward</hi> Lowneſs
and Meanneſs of it expoſed him to a great
many of them: And yet, notwithſtanding
the Number and Heinouſneſs of his Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
we do not find that he was ever in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94628:32"/>
leaſt diſcompoſed, or put into a Paſſion by
them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes,</hi> indeed, was a Man very eminent
for this Vertue; inſomuch that the Scripture
gives this Character of him, <hi>That he was very
meek, above all the men which were upon the face
of the earth,</hi> Numb. 12. And yet we find
that, with all his Meekneſs, he could not
bear with the Croſſneſs and Perverſneſs of
that untractable People the <hi>Jews,</hi> who (as
the Pſalmiſt's Obſervation is) <hi>ſo provoked his
ſpirit, that he ſpoke unadviſedly with his lips,</hi>
Pſal. 106. Now our Lord had to deal with
the very ſame ſtubborn and croſſ-grain'd Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of Men, only now under infinitely
greater Prejudices and Diſaffections; and
ſuffered more Indignities from them, than
either were, or could be offered to <hi>Moſes;</hi>
and yet none of all their ill Uſages could
ever raiſe ſuch a thing as Anger or Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in him, though they did ſo in thoſe
who ſtood by, and beheld his Abuſes. Thus
the Unkindneſs of the rude <hi>Samaritans</hi> could
not ſo much as ſtrike a Spark into his Divine
Breaſt, when at the ſame time it made his
two zealous Diſciples, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
to that Degree, as to deſire Fire from
Heaven to conſume them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 54. And
ſo again, the rough Seizure of his Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
by the Soldiers could not extort from him
ſo much as an angry Look, when yet the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94628:32"/>
Sight of it made his warm Diſciple draw
his Sword.</p>
                     <p>And with the ſame Meekneſs he went on
with his Sufferings, with which he begun
them; as may appear from that mild An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
which he returned to the Officer that
ſtruck him, <hi>Joh. 18. If I have ſpoken evil, bear
witneſs of the evil: but if well, why ſmiteſt thou
me?</hi> What could have been ſaid more mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and diſpaſſionately, or that could argue a
more ſedate and well-govern'd Spirit? His
greateſt Apoſtle could not be half ſo moderate
under a far leſs urging Occaſion: For, when
not actually ſmitten, but only commanded
to be ſo by the Order of <hi>Ananias</hi> the High-Prieſt,
he returned him this ſharp and warm
Anſwer, <hi>God ſhall ſmite thee, thou whited wall.
For ſitteſt thou to judge me after the law, and
commandeſt me to be ſmitten, contrary to the
law?</hi> There was, indeed, nothing in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
but what, perhaps, might have been
juſtified by the Oddneſs of the Provocation;
but yet you cannot but obſerve a great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Behaviour of the <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
and of the <hi>Maſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if you would ſee a perfect Example of
<hi>Meekneſs,</hi> look upon him under the Shame,
and Diſhonour, and Pains of the Croſs; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring
at once with the Agonies of Death,
the Contradictions and Revilings of Sinners,
and the Vengeance of an Almighty God; and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94628:33"/>
all this without any the leaſt Shew of Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
or Diſcompoſure of Spirit. So that
I think I may well enlarge the Queſtion of
the Prophet, and to that, <hi>Is there any ſorrow
like to my ſorrow?</hi> add this alſo, <hi>Is there any
meekneſs like to my meekneſs?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here I cannot but make a Stand, and
with Sorrow reflect upon a certain Order of
Men, how little they have of the true <hi>Spirit</hi>
of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> how little they have learnt,
either by the Precept, or by the Example of
him whoſe Religion and Imitation too they
profeſs, and by whoſe venerable Name they
have thought fit to diſtinguiſh themſelves;
who, inſtead of this Meekneſs and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
are all made up of Paſſion and Violence,
Fury and Out-rageouſneſs; mere <hi>Fire-brands</hi>
in Society, that kindle and lay waſte where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they come, and ſeem more like <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's</hi>
ſhot into a Town, than <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of it,
by thus raging where they light, by thus
burning, deſtroying and tearing all about
them. How unlike are theſe Men to the
Temper of the meek Lamb of God! As un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
certainly, as Wolves, and Tygers. And
yet it is an Unlikeneſs they are ſo little ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, that they will yet pretend to the
Name and Practice of Chriſtians; yea, to the
very Name of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> And he had need be a

that ſhall dare to contradict them.</p>

But certainly, as <hi>Wrath worketh not the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
of God,</hi> Jam. 1. 20. ſo neither is ſuch
an allowed Courſe of it conſiſtent with it.
And as he cannot be a good Man who is ſo
inordinate in the Uſe of a Paſſion, wherein
both his own and his Neighbour's Peace and
Quiet is ſo much concerned; ſo much leſs
can he be a good Chriſtian, who is of a Frame
of Spirit ſo directly contrary to that of the
Holy Jeſus, and who wants this great Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Qualification, the Spirit of Gentleneſs
and Meekneſs, which is ſo conſiderable an
Inſtance of Charity, and ſo ſtrictly enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Precept, and ſo ſtrongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by the Example of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the <hi>Limits</hi> of this Duty are
not ſo plain as the Obligation of it, I proceed,
in the Third Place, to ſtate the Meaſures of
its Obligation in its more general Caſes. And
here, in the firſt place, it may be demanded,
Whether all Anger be contrary to Meekneſs,
and conſequently unlawful? The Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
is ſtiffly contended for by the <hi>Stoic;</hi> but
I think the Negative ſufficiently warranted
by the Apoſtolical Caution. <hi>Be angry, and ſin
not,</hi> Eph. 4. 26. Which plainly implies,
that there may be Anger without Sin: And
it is alſo plain, from the Nature of the Thing,
that there may; for Anger is a Natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
implanted in us by God, from whom
nothing can proceed that is ſimply, and as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94628:34"/>
ſuch, evil. And beſides, the Office of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is not utterly to deſtroy this Paſſion, but
only to regulate it; whereby 'tis ſuppoſed
that it is not, in its whole Kind, evil; for,
what is ſo, cannot be regulated, and muſt
be deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>Since then Anger is ſuppoſed not wholly
to be deſtroyed by Meekneſs, as being Evil,
but only to be regulated, leſt it become ſo,
the next thing to be conſidered is, by what
<hi>Meaſures.</hi> Now, theſe <hi>Meaſures</hi> may either
reſpect Anger as to the inward Paſſion, as
within a Man's own Breaſt, or as to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Acts, Effects, and Expreſſions of it.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to thoſe <hi>Meaſures</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
Anger as to the inward Paſſion, as
lodged within a Man's own Breaſt. Theſe,
I think, will be ſufficiently comprized with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
theſe four Circumſtances; the Cauſe or
Occaſion, the Object, the Degree, or the
Time. As to the Cauſe, to render that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable,
it will be requiſite, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it
be ſomething weighty and conſiderable, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wherein either the Glory of God, or
the publick Good, or elſe ſome very great
private Intereſt is concerned. 'Tis not every
little impertinent Trifle that can warrant our
Anger. <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Twill be requiſite that our
Anger owe its Birth to ſome competent <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
of previous Counſel and Deliberation:
For, if all our Actions are to be governed by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94628:34"/>
Reaſon, certainly our Paſſions ought not to
be wholly exempted from it: I am ſure they
need it moſt of all. And if a Man thinks not
before he gives himſelf leave to be Angry,
tho' the Ground of it ſhould prove never ſo
juſt and proper in it ſelf, yet, as to him, his
Anger was brutiſh, and unreaſonable. As
it will alſo be if, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it be not conceived
for a due End; ſuch as either the Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Divine Honour and Glory, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement
of Good to our Neighbour, or the
Prevention and Suppreſſion of Sin. And ſo
much to qualifie our Anger, with reſpect to
the <hi>Cauſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> To the farther Regulation
of it, 'twill be requiſite that it have a due <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;</hi>
for all are not ſo. There are ſome
Things that cannot, ſome that ought not to
be the Objects of Anger; that cannot with
Reaſon, and that ought not for Religion.
Thus we ought not to be angry with God, as
it is ſaid <hi>Caligula</hi> was; who being vex'd at the
Thunder for diſturbing his Banquet, roſe up
from the Table, and provoked <hi>Jupiter</hi> to fight
with him. Neither ought we to be angry
with <hi>inanimate,</hi> ſenſeleſs Things; as <hi>Cyrus</hi>
was with the River, for drowning one of his
ſacred Horſes. It argues a Mind overcome
and blinded with Paſſion, to be ſo prodigal
of it where it can ſignifie nothing. Nor
ought we to be angry with thoſe, who, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94628:35"/>
by Chance, or Neceſſity, or probable
Ignorance, or common Frailty, have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us. Nor are we to be angry with thoſe,
who, though they have none of theſe Excuſes
to qualifie their Treſpaſs, yet acknowledge
their Fault, beg our Pardon, and promiſe
Amendment. Repentance is the Meaſure of
God's Forgiveneſs; and ſo it ought to be of
ours. Nor, laſtly, ſhould we let looſe our
Anger againſt <hi>Brute</hi> Creatures, Children,
Fools, or Mad-men, or any other that are
under any great Defect or Diſorder of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
But we are to be angry with
ſuch only as are impious and wicked, and
that are neither aſhamed nor repent of their
wickedneſs. And even here alſo we ought
rather to be angry with the <hi>Fault,</hi> than with
the <hi>Perſon.</hi> For ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> was exceeding an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
at the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when at
the ſame time he prayed for the <hi>Idolaters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus far of the <hi>Object.</hi> The two laſt
Circumſtances whereby our Anger is to be
qualified, are, <hi>Degree</hi> and <hi>Time.</hi> As to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
this may receive a double Meaſure;
one from the Perſon who is the <hi>Object</hi> of
Anger, and another from the Perſon who is
the <hi>Subject</hi> of it. That with reference to the
Object is this, That our Anger ſhould not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the Quality of the Offence committed.
That with reference to the Subject will be
this, That it ſhould not be ſo great, let the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94628:35"/>
Offence be what it will, as to diſcompoſe the
Mind of him who conceives it, and thereby
unfit him for the Diſcharge of ſuch Offices
as he owes either to God, his Neighbour,
or himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Then as to the Time of our Anger: This
we find already ſtated by the Apoſtle, who
limits it within the Compaſs of a <hi>Day.</hi> 'Tis
a Paſſion that ought to be ſo ſhort-lived, that
the Sun muſt not go down upon it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.
26. For, indeed, it is not ſafe truſting our
ſelves with ſuch a dangerous Guide in the
<hi>Dark,</hi> nor to nouriſh a Paſſion which, tho'
in its own Nature innocent, borders ſo nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon Hatred, that with a little keeping it
will grow ſo ſtale, ſowre and inveterate, as
to commence Malice.</p>
                     <p>And thus far of thoſe Meaſures which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
Anger, as to the <hi>Inward Paſſion.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
we now to thoſe who reſpect it as to the
outward Acts, Effects and Expreſſions of it.
And here, among other things too obvious
to be inſiſted on, two Enquiries offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
more principally to be conſidered. One
is, concerning the Propulſation or Repelling
of Injuries; the other is, concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
of Injuries already done. Of both
theſe it may be demanded, how far they are
conſiſtent with the Vertue and Duty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Meekneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:94628:36"/>
As to the Former, it is to be conſidered,
that Injuries are either Publick; as, when
the Magiſtrate oppreſſes his Subjects; or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
when one Subject injures another; or,
Laſtly, ſuch as are on both Sides Publick, as
when one King or State injures another. This
premiſed, I anſwer, <hi>Firſt.</hi> That an Injury
offered from one Kingdom or State to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
may, and ought to be repelled by that
other; this being one of the main Ends and
Uſes of the Civil Sword, to protect thoſe
who are ſubjected to it; which when it does,
it is duly employed. To which it may be
added, that diſtinct Kingdoms, being under
no common Juriſdiction, have no other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
whereby to right themſelves: Either
therefore they muſt always ſuffer, which
would be intolerable to Society, or they muſt
right themſelves by the Sword. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
That in caſe the Supreme Magiſtrate oppreſs
his Subjects, 'tis by no means conſiſtent with
Chriſtian Meekneſs for them by Force to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
the Injury. We are, indeed, to <hi>obey</hi> him
only in <hi>ſome</hi> Caſes, but to <hi>reſiſt</hi> him in <hi>none.</hi>
This is certainly a true, though to ſome an
hard Saying; <hi>wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject:
and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves
damnation,</hi> are as plain Words as any in the
Bible. But Men are very ſlow to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
what they have no Mind to practiſe;
otherwiſe one would think there ſhould need
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94628:36"/>
no other Deciſion in the Caſe, than the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of our meek Lord and Maſter, who
patiently ſubmitted himſelf to an ordinary
Magiſtrate, commanded his raſh Diſciple to
<hi>ſheath his Sword,</hi> and would not ſuffer his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Legions to <hi>draw theirs,</hi> Mat. 26. 53.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to private Injuries between
Man and Man, I anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That theſe
are never to be forcibly repelled by a private
Defence, when a publick one may be had;
in defect of which, a private one may be
uſed. But then we are to conſider <hi>Secondly,</hi>
That either this private Injury reaches only
to our Goods and Poſſeſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without
hazard of Life; and here a good Man would
go very far in yielding from his Right, and
in patiently undergoing Injuries: Or elſe 'tis
with extream Danger of Life; and then, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
he not only may, but perhaps is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
by the Law of Self-preſervation, by the
utmoſt Force to repel the Injury. And thus
much to be obſerved in <hi>Repelling</hi> of Injuries.</p>
                     <p>I come now, in the Second Place, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the <hi>Vindication</hi> of Injuries already done.
And here I take notice of a Two-fold Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream.
One is, of thoſe who ſtand for the
higheſt Vindication of Injuries, without any
Meaſure, or Moderation: Which ſeems to
have been the Fault of the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, who,
by the Law of Retaliation, thought they
might exact any thing; an Eye for an Eye,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94628:37"/>
or a Tooth for a Tooth. The other is, of
the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Socinians;</hi> who ſo extol
the Law of Charity, as not to allow any place
for the Vindication of Injuries; not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it either to private Perſons, or publick;
and ſo taking from the Magiſtrate both the
Right and the Uſe of the Civil Sword.</p>
                     <p>Theſe I take to be Extreams; and that
the Truth lies between them, which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
is, That publick Vindication of Injuries
is not only lawful, but neceſſary; ſo far
from being againſt Charity, that it is a great
Inſtance of it, and required by it: For, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this there would be no living, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Society could never ſtand. But as to
private Vindication of Injuries, that which
we more eſpecially call <hi>Revenge,</hi> this I ſhall
readily allow to be utterly unlawful, and ſo
make appear upon theſe Grounds. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Vengeance is proper to God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be committed either to him, or elſe to
thoſe whom he has impower'd, who are
therefore ſtyled Gods. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
is an Act of Judgment, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
a publick Act, and therefore not to
be exerciſed by a private Perſon, who alſo
muſt not be allowed to be a Judge in his own
Cauſe. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Becauſe Vengeance cannot
belong to them, by whom the Ends of it
cannot be obtained: But now, by a private
Hand they cannot, as may appear by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94628:37"/>
what theſe Ends are; which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to be chiefly theſe Three; To amend
him that is puniſhed, To better others by
his Example, and To procure to the injured
Party, and others, Security for the future.
But now private Revenge reaches none of
theſe Ends. For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> It does not amend
or reform the Adverſary, but rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes
him farther. Nor, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Does it
tend to the bettering of others, but rather
corrupts and ſcandalizes them by an ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
Nor, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> does the private Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
procure Safety either to himſelf or others,
but rather Danger to both; and to himſelf
Vexation and Trouble for the preſent, and
Fear for the future, leſt his Enemy ſhould
revenge himſelf again. Private Revenge
therefore is univerſally to be condemned, as
utterly unlawful, and altogether inconſiſtent
with the Duty of <hi>Chriſtian Meekneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus have we ſtated the Meaſures of
this Vertue, in its more general Caſes. But
this is a thing that needs to be <hi>inforced,</hi> as
well as <hi>explained.</hi> Conſider therefore, <hi>Firſt,</hi>
That God has expreſly forbidden us all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
Anger, and has preſcribed the contrary
Offices of Charity and Meekneſs. Conſider
again, that all Injuries befall us by God's
ſpecial Providence, and may, if we hinder
not its Courſe, turn to our greater Good.
Conſider again, that God uſes an incredible
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94628:38"/>
Patience and Long-ſuffering toward the
worſt of men, and particularly towards our
ſelves; by the former ſetting us an Example
of Lenity, and by the latter making it very
reaſonable for us to follow it. Conſider
again, that all Vengeance belongs to God,
who has ſaid, <hi>Vengeance is mine:</hi> And that
therefore, he that avenges himſelf, aſſumes
the Part of <hi>God;</hi> yea, withal, of a <hi>Judge,</hi>
of an <hi>Accuſer,</hi> of a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> and of an <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner,</hi>
all at once; againſt all Senſe and
Reaſon, Equity and Juſtice. This may be
conſidered with reference to God.</p>
                     <p>Then, again, as to our Neighbour. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that he is nearly related, both to God,
and to our ſelves: To God, as made after his
Image; and to our ſelves, as caſt in the ſame
Mould with us, and partaking of the ſame
common Nature. Conſider again, what we
would have done by our Neighbour, to our
ſelves; and how reaſonable it is that we
ſhould do the ſame to him. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what we <hi>have</hi> already done to him; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we have not been guilty of the ſame,
or greater Injuries <hi>towards</hi> him, than thoſe
which we ſo warmly reſent <hi>from</hi> him.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Laſtly,</hi> With reference to our ſelves.
Conſider, <hi>Firſt,</hi> how much by our unjuſt
Anger we expoſe our ſelves to the juſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
of God, who, by his Son, has told
us, that <hi>Whoſoever is angry with his brother
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94628:38"/>
without a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
Mat. 5. 22. Conſider again, That we
may eaſily, and do often miſ-interpret Men's
Minds and Intentions by their outward De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour;
and think our ſelves affronted by
them, when there is no ſuch thing intended;
and that therefore, even upon this Account,
it is very reaſonable we ſhould be <hi>ſlow to
wrath.</hi> Conſider again, How much cauſleſs
and intemperate Anger unfits us for all the
Parts of Divine Worſhip, which can neither
be well performed by, nor will be accepted
from a Heart flaming with this ſtrange Fire.
And therefore, ſays the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of
Prayer, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. Lifting up holy hands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wrath;</hi> implying, that a Vacancy from
Wrath is a neceſſary Qualification for Prayer.
To which purpoſe it is very conſiderable, that
when King <hi>David</hi> would have erected a
Temple for the publick Worſhip of God,
tho' a Man otherwiſe of a ſweet and gentle
Diſpoſition, and only accidentally, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently
too, engaged in Circumſtances of
Anger and Contention; yet he was refuſed,
and the Work impoſed upon one not of a
more meek Spirit, but only of a calmer and
more ſerene Life. And if God would not
accept an <hi>Houſe of Prayer</hi> from a Man of a
Military Way and Character, much leſs will
he accept thoſe <hi>Prayers</hi> which proceed from
a Soul diſturb'd with Anger. Conſider again,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94628:39"/>
how it unfits us for the Buſineſs of our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
how it hinders the free Exerciſe of our
Thoughts, how it prejudices our Health, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs
the Tranquility of our Minds, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
us odious and uneaſie to all about us;
in one Word, how utterly it unfits us, both
for enjoying our ſelves, and from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in by others. Conſider, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> to
what mean and ſordid Principles within us
this Paſſion owes it Riſe; ſuch as Pride, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love,
vain Curioſity and Suſpicion, raſh Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity,
Negligence and Inadvertency, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
Luſt, Envy, and the like. So that,
beſides its own proper Illneſs, 'tis farther to
be deteſted upon the Scandal of its Parentage.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far diſcourſed of the Duty of
Meekneſs; <hi>Firſt,</hi> By ſhewing what it is. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
By ſhewing that it is a Chriſtian Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> By ſtating the general Meaſures
of its Obligation. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> By propoſing
ſuch Conſiderations as may recommend its
Practice. I come now briefly to diſcourſe of
its <hi>Bleſſedneſs;</hi> which may alſo ſerve as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
diſtinct Conſideration to inforce the
Practice of it. <hi>Bleſſed are the meek,</hi> ſays our
Saviour, <hi>for they ſhall inherit the earth:</hi> The
only Beatitude which has a Temporal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
annexed to it; wherein our Lord ſeems
to imitate <hi>Moſes,</hi> who in his Law had alſo
one Commandment with a Temporal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.
And there ſeems to be great Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94628:39"/>
between them: One is, <hi>That thy days
may be long in the earth;</hi> and the other, <hi>They
ſhall inherit the earth.</hi> Here therefore we are
to do two Things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> We muſt enquire
into the Senſe and Meaning of the Beatitude.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> Into the Truth of it. That is, We
muſt <hi>Firſt</hi> enquire, What is meant by the
Meek's inheriting the Earth; And <hi>Secondly</hi>
ſhew, That they do ſo inherit it.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> By their inheriting the Earth,
I ſuppoſe, cannot be meant, that they ſhall
have large Portions of it, that they ſhall raiſe
great Eſtates, that they ſhall take Root, and
ſpread, and, as the Prophet expreſſes it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.
<hi>joyn houſe to houſe,</hi> and <hi>lay field to field.</hi> This,
I ſuppoſe, cannot be meant:
<list>
                           <item>I. Becauſe this is not true: The Meek do
not inherit the Earth according to this Senſe.</item>
                           <item>II. Becauſe if they did, this would not be
a proper Ground for their being pronounced
Bleſſed.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> This Senſe is not true; the
Meek do not <hi>thus</hi> inherit the Earth. We
rather find that the World is made for the
Bold and the Violent, for the Rough-ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Turbulent, for the Furious and Boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous;
and that they have commonly the
greateſt Share of it, who deſerve the leaſt.
And therefore we commonly urge this as one
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94628:40"/>
Argument againſt the Goodneſs of Riches,
That they frequently fall to the Lot of the
worſt Men. And therefore, ſays the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,
<hi>Pſal. 74. Lo, theſe are the ungodly, theſe
proſper in the world, and theſe have riches in
poſſeſſion:</hi> While, in the mean time, the Meek
are oppreſſed and devoured by theſe Beaſts of
Prey; and are ſo far from inheriting the Earth,
that it is as much as many of them can do to
<hi>live</hi> upon it, and more than ſome of them can
do to find Room <hi>under</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppoſe they did thus inherit
the Earth, by having great Portions of it, yet
this would not be a proper Ground for their
being pronounced Bleſſed: For, Are Clods
of Earth a ſuitable Good for Man? Or, Is
Happineſs to be meaſured by the Acre? Do
we find that rich Men are ſo very much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
than others? Or, Do we think that the
Earth has Mines of Happineſs, as it has of
Gold? But, whatever <hi>we</hi> think, Is it at all
probable, that our Bleſſed Lord, who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
made choice of Poverty, who but in a
Line or two before pronounced the Poor bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
who tells us that his own Kingdom was
not of this World, who bids us beware of
Covetouſneſs, and warns us of the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Riches, by telling us how hard it is for
one that has them to enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven; who dehorts us from laying up
Treaſures on Earth; and who, laſtly, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94628:40"/>
to his Diſciples nothing more than the
Contempt of the World, by aſſuring them,
that the Life of Man does not conſiſt in the
Abundance of Things which he poſſeſſes: I
ſay, Is it imaginable that our Lord, after all
this, ſhould therefore pronounce the meek
Man bleſſed, for having great Poſſeſſions?</p>
                     <p>This therefore cannot be the Thing meant
by the Meek's inheriting the Earth; which
I take, rather to ſignifie the <hi>Manner</hi> of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing,
than the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of their Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and to import thus much, That the
Meek ſhall enjoy what they have, be it lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or great, with Comfort, and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Tranquility of Mind; whereas thoſe
of a contrary Diſpoſition, tho' they may <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs</hi>
a great deal, may yet be truly ſaid to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy</hi>
little or nothing. And this ſeems to be
the Senſe of the Pſalmiſt, when, in Words
directly parallel to theſe of our Lord, he ſays,
<hi>The meek-ſpirited ſhall poſſeſs the earth, and ſhall
be refreſhed in the multitude of peace,</hi> Pſal. 34.
11. That is, They ſhall have Comfort and
Pleaſure, Peace and Content, with whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they have; which, how little ſoever,
ſhall yet carry a true Reliſh, and yield more
real Satisfaction to them, than the otherwiſe-affected
can reap from their ample Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues.
According to what the Pſalmiſt, in
the ſame place, immediately ſubjoyns, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
34. 16. <hi>A ſmall thing that the righteous
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94628:41"/>
has, is better than great riches of the ungodly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I take to be the <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> of
this Beatitude. As to the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of it, there is this double Security for it;
the Natural Tendency of the Vertue of
Meekneſs, and the Bleſſing of God upon it.
As to its Natural Tendency, Meekneſs is a
very decent, amiable and winning thing;
and, accordingly, the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>The
ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit.</hi> And by
this, in all probability, the meek Man will
ſweeten and indear even his very Enemies to
him, and ſo gain himſelf Peace <hi>without</hi> by
his quiet and inoffenſive Behaviour. But
however this be, yet he is ſure to have Peace
<hi>within,</hi> with himſelf, and with God. And
having this, he is in a very fit Condition of
Mind to enjoy himſelf, and to take Comfort
in what he poſſeſſes.</p>
                     <p>Which he will be farther enabled to do,
<hi>Secondly,</hi> by the Bleſſing of God. And this
again the Pſalmiſt takes notice of, ſome few
Verſes after the fore-cited ones: <hi>Verſ. 22. Such
as are bleſſed of the Lord ſhall poſſeſs the land,</hi>
ſays he; implying, that as the Meek, whom
he juſt before ſpoke of, ſhould poſſeſs the
Earth, ſo it is through a ſpecial Bleſſing of
God that they ſhould do ſo. And theſe are
two great Securities for a Life of Comfort,
and Self-Enjoyment; the Peace of a ſedate
Spirit within, and the Bleſſing of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94628:41"/>
And both theſe the meek Man has,
whom therefore we may venture to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Bleſſed; and therefore Bleſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſhall <hi>thus</hi> inherit the Earth:
Which yet ſhall be but a Type and Pledge
of his future Inheritance with the Saints in
Light.</p>

                     <p>THO God has provided <hi>Entertainment</hi>
for all the Appetites which he has
made, yet there are but two Appetites of
Man which he intends to gratifie to the
<hi>heighth,</hi> and to bleſs with a full and laſting
Satisfaction; and thoſe are, the Deſire of
being happy, and the Deſire of being good.
There are ſome Appetites of Man which are
never ſatisfied; for, ſays the Wiſe Man,
<hi>Eccl. 1. 8. The eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing,
nor the ear filled with hearing. Seeing</hi> and <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
are the moſt refined of all the Senſes;
and thoſe Appetites which are moſt ſpiritual
and refined, and come neareſt to the Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Intellectual Nature, are always
hardeſt to be ſatisfied: And the Intellectual
Nature it ſelf, when it is more raiſed and
elevated, as in the State of Separation, will
have a more enlarged Appetite, and a ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Edge of Deſire, and ſo will be harder to
be ſatisfied than it is now. Which, by the
way, I take to be the Reaſon why thoſe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94628:42"/>
Senſual Spirits, which now feel no great
Uneaſineſs from the Abſence of the Supreme
Good, will, notwithſtanding, hereafter be
extreamly miſerable, in being exiled from
his Beatifick Preſence. As for the <hi>groſſer</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
of the Animal Nature, ſuch as Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
Thirſt, and the like; theſe, indeed, have
this Advantage above the <hi>Finer,</hi> that they
may be ſatisfied for ſome time, (and ſuch
is the Brutiſhneſs of Man) are too often
over-charged. But then they will return
again in certain Periods, like the Tide, and
be as importunate as ever for new Supplies;
and, as our Saviour told the Woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi>
Joh. 4. 13. <hi>Whoſoever drinks of this
Water ſhall thirſt again.</hi> The Appetite may
be laid aſleep for a while, but it will infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
awake again into its former Eagerneſs.</p>
                     <p>But it is not the Unhappineſs of Man to
have <hi>all</hi> his Appetites like theſe, ſuch as will
either <hi>never,</hi> or not <hi>finally</hi> be ſatisfied. There
are two that are deſigned for a full and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
Satisfaction; the Deſire of being hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
and the Deſire of being good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
but ſtill with this material difference
between them, That the Deſire of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is not abſolutely ſecure of Satisfaction,
but only upon Condition. The Satisfaction
of this Deſire is ſuſpended upon the Quality
of our Moral Conduct: But now, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of Goodneſs and Vertue has, by the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94628:43"/>
Grace and Indulgence of God, an abſolute
Title to Satisfaction, and is ſure to be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gratified: For, ſays our Saviour, <hi>Bleſſed
are they which do hunger and thirſt after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
for they ſhall be filled. Shall be filled,</hi>
without any farther Condition, or Reſerve.</p>
                     <p>That we may the better comprehend the
<hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of this Beatitude, it will be
neceſſary.</p>

                        <item>I. To enquire what Righteouſneſs that is,
which if we hunger and thirſt after, we ſhall
be filled.</item>
                        <item>II. What kind of Hunger and Thirſt that
is, to which this Promiſe of Repletion is
made.</item>

that thoſe who do hunger and thirſt after
Righteouſneſs ſhall be filled.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>To ſatisfie the firſt Enquiry, I ſhall not
critically weigh all the acceptations of the
Word <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in Scripture; thinking
it ſufficient to the Buſineſs in hand, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the general <hi>Kinds</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi> of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.
This therefore may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
either in a <hi>Judicial,</hi> or in a <hi>Moral</hi> Senſe.
Righteouſneſs in a Judicial Senſe imports as
much as a Legal Diſcharge, whereby the
Perſon impleaded becomes Right in the
Court, or Righteous. Which Legal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94628:43"/>
may be again two Ways, either by
remitting a Criminal, or by acquitting ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
or accuſed Innocence. Theſe are the
two Ways of a Legal Diſcharge; and then
is a Perſon judicially righteous, when he is
diſcharg'd either of theſe two ways, either
by the Remiſſion of his Guilt, or by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of his Innocence. The latter of
theſe is properly Juſtification; tho' the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
be <hi>that</hi> Juſtification whereby Chriſtians
muſt expect to ſtand in the Judgment of
God, ſince, in the other Senſe, no Man liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhall be juſtified: For we are not juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as <hi>innocent</hi> Perſons, but as <hi>Sinners;</hi> and,
accordingly, are not <hi>acquitted,</hi> but <hi>pardoned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Righteouſneſs, in a <hi>Moral</hi> Senſe, may be
ſuppoſed to import all thoſe Divine and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Vertues which are required by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Law, conſiſting of the whole Duty of
Man, to God, himſelf, and his Neighbour.
This latter kind of Righteouſneſs may again
be conſidered, either <hi>Materially</hi> and <hi>Abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly</hi>
for the bare Vertues themſelves, as they
are certain ſuppoſed Actions which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tend to the Good and Perfection, both of
Human Nature, and of Human Society; or
elſe <hi>Formally</hi> and <hi>Concretely</hi> for ſuch and ſuch
Vertues as ſubjected in Man; or for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
Will of doing ſuch ſuppoſed Actions,
which is formal Vertue, and whereby the
Man is denominated vertuous or righteous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:94628:44"/>
This is not one of thoſe Diſtinctions which
are without any <hi>Difference:</hi> For the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is very clear and great. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
When it is ſaid, <hi>I love or practiſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
and, <hi>I am proud of my Vertue,</hi> 'tis plain
that the Word Vertue does not bear the
ſame Notion in both Propoſitions. For,
when it is ſaid, <hi>I love and practiſe Vertue,</hi>
there it is plain that Vertue is taken Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
for the Abſtract Idea of Vertue, which
is ſuppoſed to be the Object of my Love.
But when it is ſaid, <hi>I am proud of my Vertue,</hi>
here 'tis as plain that Vertue is taken For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,
for my Habit of Willing it; whereby
I am denominated vertuous: For I cannot
be ſuppoſed to be proud of Vertue in its Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
Idea, but only of the Love I have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it. To be ſhort, Moral Vertue may
be taken either for the Things which are fit
to be done, or for the habitual Will of doing
them. The former is the Righteouſneſs of
the Law, preſcribing what ought to be done:
The latter is the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Man,</hi>
willing to do what is ſo preſcribed. Theſe
are the general Kinds of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>Now to the Queſtion; What kind of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
that is, which if we hunger and
thirſt after, we ſhall be filled? I anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi>
That the Righteouſneſs here intended can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be Judicial Righteouſneſs, ſince the mere
Deſire of Pardon or Juſtification is not of it
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94628:44"/>
ſelf ſufficient to procure it, or to avert the
Sentence of Condemnation. It muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be <hi>Moral</hi> Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>If you ask in what Senſe? Whether as
materially, or as formally taken? I think ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Senſe may be admitted. But then there
will be difference in the Propoſition, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Senſe preſumed. For, if Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
be here taken <hi>materially,</hi> than the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring
and Thirſting after it will be a <hi>ſimple</hi>
and <hi>direct</hi> Act of the Will: But if <hi>Formally,</hi>
for that Righteouſneſs whereby a Man is
formally good and vertuous, then the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring
and thirſting after it will be a <hi>Reflex</hi> Act
of the Will; that is, a Deſire, not of Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Righteouſneſs, but of the Love of Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Righteouſneſs, which is a Man's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Righteouſneſs. And this Senſe of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
I take to be moſt agreeable to the
Exigence of this Place, becauſe the Deſiring
Material Righteouſneſs, by a direct Act of
the Will, actually makes a Man formally
righteous, and ſo prevents and anticipates
that Repletion which our Lord promiſes as
a future Reward and Bleſſing. Whereas the
Deſiring Formal Righteouſneſs, or the Love
of Material Righteouſneſs by a Reflect Act,
ſuppoſes the Man not ye actually righteous, as
he is alſo ſuppoſed in the Beatitude; and ſo
leaves him capable of having the Promiſe
made good to him, that he ſhall be fil- led.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:94628:45"/>
Now, as to the <hi>Degrees</hi> of Chriſtian Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
the Maſters of Spiritual Life uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
aſſign Three. By Degrees, I ſuppoſe,
meaning not all thoſe Advances in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
whereby a Man may exceed either
another, or himſelf; for then they might as
well have reckoned 3000, there being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Latitude in Goodneſs: But only ſuch
Advances as imply different <hi>Periods,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
<hi>States</hi> of the Divine Life. Theſe they
aſſign to be Three; grounding this their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
upon the Authority of St. <hi>John,</hi> who,
they ſay, repreſents Chriſtians as under a
Threefold State, by beſpeaking them under
the ſeveral Titles of <hi>Little Children, Young
Men,</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> Joh. 2. 12. By Little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
meaning young or new Converts, who
muſt be fed with the Milk of the Word, with
the plain Doctrins and Principles of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.
By young Men, thoſe who are grown
up to ſome Strength in Holineſs, and have
made ſome Progreſs in the Mortification o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
the inferiour Life. By Fathers, thoſe who
are arrived to a perfect Habit of Goodneſs,
and, as far as Human Nature will admit, are
fully regenerated into the Divine Life.</p>
                     <p>But I think this Computation muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched:
For, with all the Invention which
I have, I can find but three States, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
for the whole Moral Condition of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
For all the Men in the World, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94628:45"/>
every particular Man in ſeveral Periods of
his Life, may be reduced to one of thoſe three
Orders: Either he is one of thoſe who do
not apprehend Sin as an Evil; who either
through Want of Underſtanding and Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
have not attained to any Senſe of its
Malignity; or through Debauchery and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
Viciouſneſs have loſt it, and ſo will
and chuſe Sin <hi>purely</hi> and <hi>intirely,</hi> with Unity
of Conſent, and without any mixture of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy,
which is the moſt exalted pitch of
Wickedneſs that a Creature is capable of. Or
elſe one of thoſe who indeed do look upon
Sin as Evil, and as ſuch nill and are averſe to
it; but not looking upon it always as the
<hi>greateſt</hi> Evil, do oftentimes nill it only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly,
and abſolutely ſpeaking do will
and chuſe it, to avoid (as they then think)
ſome greater Evil. Or elſe laſtly, one of thoſe
who looking upon Sin not only under the
Notion of Evil, but as the greateſt of all
Evils, nill and refuſe it, not only in ſome
certain reſpect, but abſolutely and thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſo as not by any means to be perſwaded
to commit it.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Three Degrees will comprize the
whole Moral State of Mankind. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
I obſerve that St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a three-fold Law. The firſt is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <hi>The Law of Sin which
is in the Members,</hi> Rom. 7. 23. The Second
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94628:46"/>
is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Ver. 23. <hi>The Law of the Mind,</hi>
or Conſcience. The Third is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life,</hi> Rom. 8. 2.</p>
                     <p>Theſe three Laws anſwer exactly to the
three Moral States of Human Nature. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the firſt Law, the Law of Sin, are thoſe
who will and embrace Sin purely and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Under the Second Law, the Law of the
Mind, are thoſe who nill and ſtand averſe
to Sin in ſome certain reſpect, as Evil, but
yet will and chuſe it abſolutely and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Under the third Law, the Law of the
Spirit of Life, are thoſe who abſolutely and
thoroughly nill the Commiſſion of Sin.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe States is a ſtate of meer
Sin and Death, and thoſe of this Order are
they who are ſaid to be <hi>Dead in Treſpaſſes and
Sins,</hi> Eph. 2. 1. The Second is a ſtate of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Life. The Third is a ſtate of Health
and Vigour. The firſt is a ſtate of Reſt and
Acquieſcence in Sin. The ſecond is a ſtate
of Contention. The third is a ſtate of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.
In the firſt ſtate the Mind is laid faſt
in a deep ſleep. In the ſecond ſhe is between
ſleeping and waking. In the third ſhe is
broad awake, and well come to her ſelf. He
that is in the firſt ſtate, is born only of the
Fleſh, and has no higher Principle in him:
He is that <hi>Animal Man</hi> that perceives not the
things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. He that is in the
ſecond, has indeed ſome quickning Motions,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94628:46"/>
ſome ineffective Stirrings and Endeavours of
the Divine Life. But he that is in the third,
is born of the Spirit and of God, and doth not
commit Sin, becauſe his <hi>Seed remains in him,</hi>
Joh. 3. 9.</p>
                     <p>From this Diſtribution of the Moral State
of Man, 'tis evident that there can be but two
diſtinct Degrees of Righteouſneſs, or ſtates
of the Divine Life. For the firſt of the three
(as was before remark'd) is a ſtate of meer
Death and Sin. Righteouſneſs and Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
only to the two latter, but with this great
difference, that the firſt of theſe two Degrees,
tho it has ſomething of Life and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in it, yet 'tis ſuch as is conſiſtent with
the final and abſolute Prevalency and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Sin, and conſequently ſuch as cannot
qualifie a Man for Pardon, or put him into
a ſtate of Grace and Salvation. Whereas in
the laſt the Principle of the Divine Life is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be ſo ſtrong, as not only to reſiſt,
but to overcome Sin. And he that is thus
ſpiritually alive, is alive indeed, alive unto
himſelf, and alive unto God, and if he abide
in this Life, ſhall live for ever.</p>
                     <p>There are therefore but two ſuch Degrees
of Spiritual Life and Righteouſneſs as imply
different ſtates. And therefore to the Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of St. <hi>John</hi> my Anſwer is, That it
muſt neceſſarily be underſtood not of three
diſtinct ſtates of Righteouſneſs (there being
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94628:47"/>
no more for the whole Moral condition of
Man) but of three Degrees in one and the
ſame general State. If it be demanded which
of the two ſtates of Righteouſneſs that is? I
anſwer, That St. <hi>John</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to
intend the laſt and beſt ſtate, becauſe he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
himſelf to his little Children, young
Men and Fathers, as thoſe who had their
<hi>Sins forgiven them,</hi> who had <hi>overcome the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one,</hi> and who had <hi>known the Father,</hi> Joh.
2. 12, 13. All which Expreſſions argue one
ſtate of Grace in common between them, tho
differing in Meaſures and Proportions. The
reaſonableneſs of which threefold Gradation
I do not think my ſelf concern'd at preſent
to enquire into or juſtifie, it being ſufficient
to my preſent purpoſe to have ſhewn that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
cannot be meant of three different ſtates o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
Righteouſneſs, but only of three different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in the ſame ſtate. The ſtates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are but two.</p>
                     <p>Now to the Queſtion, What degree or
ſtate of Righteouſneſs that is, which if we
hunger and thirſt after we ſhall be fill'd: I
anſwer, That it muſt be no other than that
which puts a Man in favour with God, and
qualifies him for the Mercies of the New
Covenant. For if the <hi>Righteouſneſs it ſelf</hi> be
not ſuch as will render a Man acceptable with
God, how can the <hi>Deſire</hi> of it intitle him to
his Promiſes? 'Tis a much leſs Worthineſs to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94628:47"/>
deſire any Righteouſneſs than 'tis to have it;
and how then can it be an acceptable thing
to deſire an unacceptable Righteouſneſs!
The Righteouſneſs therefore here intended
muſt be ſuch as makes him that has it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God; and conſequently it can be
no other but the laſt degree or ſtate of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs:
Since nothing ſhort of that can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reconcile God to Man, or make Man fit
for God. And this I take to be the conſtant
Voice of Scripture, and the Doctrin of our
Holy Church, which every where repreſents
an abſolute and effectual Love of Holineſs,
and the like Hatred of Sin as neceſſary to the
ſtate of Grace and real Regeneration.</p>
                     <p>There are, I know, ſome among us, who
notwithſtanding their uſual and popular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
That they differ from our Church not
in any Doctrinal Points of Religion, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
about ſome few Ritual Obſervances, do
yet teach very differently in this Article, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the ſtate of Regeneration and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo low, that a bare ineffective ſtriving
againſt Sin is reckon'd a very ſufficient mark
of it: Wherein they conſpire with thoſe of
the Roman Church, who make the ſlighteſt
Repentance by the Acceſſion of Sacerdotal
Abſolution to be full and valid; only with
this Difference, That what the one make ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
in a certain caſe, and on a certain ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
the other make ſufficient univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94628:48"/>
and abſolutely, requiring nothing further
as of neceſſity to Sanctification than a bare
ineffective ſtrife againſt Sin. A ſtate which
a Man may be ſoon <hi>in,</hi> tho, according to the
ſame Gentlemen, not ſo ſoon <hi>out.</hi> For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
has the leaſt ſenſe of Sin as an Evil (and
certainly there are but few who have not ſo
much) muſt needs be ſo far averſe to it, and
cannot poſſibly commit it but with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance:
Which yet according to theſe Men
is ſufficient to intitle a Man to the ſtate and
reward of Sanctification, tho at the ſame
time he be the <hi>Servant of Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I confeſs is a good way to counter
ballance the Severity of their Reprobating
Decrees, and to ſtock Heaven as much by
one Doctrin, as they depopulate it by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But certainly the Gate of Heaven i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
much too ſtrait both for this Doctrin and for
thoſe (I will not ſay that hold it, but) tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
live by it. It is a Doctrin too little according
to Godlineſs to be according to Truth, and
ſuch as makes neither for the Honour of God
nor for the Safety of Man. But I need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it no further, it being ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by our moſt excellent Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> in
his Preface to the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> before
his <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num Neceſſarium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All therefore that I further remark is, Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
ſince the Righteouſneſs of the firſt degree is
that which theſe Men make ſufficient for Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94628:48"/>
with God, the ſame degree of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
would, I ſuppoſe according to theſe
Men, be a ſufficient Title to this Beatitude.
But if the laſt Degree of Righteouſneſs be
only that which can procure us acceptance
with God (as moſt certainly it is) then that
is the only Righteouſneſs, which if we duly
hunger and thirſt after, we ſhall be fill'd. I
ſay, which if we duly hunger and thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Which leads me in the ſecond place to
enquire what kind of Hunger and Thirſt that
is to which this Promiſe of Repletion is
made.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, 'tis plain that Hunger and Thirſt
here muſt be taken in a figurative and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical
Senſe; ſince Righteouſneſs is not
the Object of a <hi>Natural,</hi> but of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.
Hunger and Thirſt therefore is the
ſame with willing or deſiring. This as to
the <hi>Kind.</hi> But then as to the <hi>Degree,</hi> 'tis to
be conſider'd, That every Good does as ſuch
neceſſarily move the Will, as every the leaſt
poſſible Weight moves the Scale. But it
does not always move <hi>effectually,</hi> as every
Weight in the Scale does not weigh it <hi>down.</hi>
But however ſomething it does towards it,
ſince otherwiſe as much Weight would be
neceſſary to turn the Scale as if it had been
quite empty. I ſhall therefore diſtinguiſh of
Willing as a very contemplative Theoriſt
does of Phyſical Motion, into that which is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94628:49"/>
                        <hi>impotent,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dr. Gliſſon de Vita Naturae, c. 19. p. 254.</note> and that which is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</hi>
By impotent willing
meaning that natural Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or <hi>Velleity</hi> we have to every
Good as ſuch, which indeed would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent,
if not out-weighed by Reaſons of
ſtronger Moment on the other ſide; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overcome by them becomes impotent,
not as to the Endeavour (for that is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
but as to actual Determination. By
prevalent willing, I mean ſuch a Degree of
willing as is not a meer endeavour, but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
into actual and effectual Choice: When
the Moral Scale not only <hi>gravitates</hi> and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
but weighs down.</p>
                     <p>Now to the Queſtion, Which of theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of willing or deſiring is here intended?
I anſwer, the laſt and higheſt, that which is
peremptory and effectual, that which paſſes
into Act, and ends in a thorough Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Will. Since nothing leſs can
either be ſignify'd by ſuch ſtrong Metaphors
as theſe of <hi>Hungring</hi> and <hi>Thirſting,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
with the ſincerity of a Chriſtian Spirit.
'Tis not enough therefore to have ones Face
ſet towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to caſt ſome amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Glances upon the Beauty of Holineſs.
'Tis not enough to have ſome faint ineffective
Wiſhes, ſome kind reſentments towards
Righteouſneſs, there being but few ſo wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
wicked and unmoraliz'd as not to have
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94628:49"/>
ſome ſuch little <hi>Velleities</hi> of being Good; and
no queſtion <hi>Balaam</hi> that deſired the <hi>Death,</hi>
did alſo at <hi>this</hi> rate deſire the <hi>Life</hi> of the
<hi>Righteous.</hi> But the Deſire muſt be ſtrong
and active, vehement and importunate, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
and peremptory, without any Reſerves
or Conditions. It muſt bear the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the Soul, that the Keeneſt Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and Thirſt does to the Body, that is, it
muſt be a great deal ſharper, as much as the
Appetites of the Spirit are more quick and
exquiſite than thoſe of the Body. It muſt
be ſuch a deſire as our Saviour had to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the Paſſover, and inſtitute his laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
when he ſays, <hi>Luk. 22. 15. With deſire
have I deſired to eat this Paſſover with you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſuffer.</hi> Briefly, it muſt be ſuch a Deſire
as carries in it the full bent and ſtreſs of the
Soul, ſuch as is accompanied with the moſt
earneſt and hearty Endeavours, and with the
moſt Paſſionate and Devout Prayers and
Aſpirations to God. Such as that of the
Pſalmiſt, <hi>O that my ways were made ſo direct,
that I might keep thy Statutes!</hi> With many more
ſuch throughout the whole 119 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which
I commend to the Meditation of the Pious.</p>
                     <p>This is that Hungring and Thirſting after
Righteouſneſs intended in this Beatitude. And
accordingly 'tis obſervable what <hi>Solomon</hi> in a
place almoſt parallel to this of our Lord, ſays
concerning the Love of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94628:50"/>
in Scripture, eſpecially in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
Writings, ſignifies the ſame with <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
Prov. 2. <hi>My Son, if thou wilt receive my
words, and hide my commandments with thee;
ſo that thou incline thine ear unto wiſdom, and
apply thine heart to underſtanding; yea, if thou
crieſt after knowledge, and lifteſt up thy voice
for underſtanding; if thou ſeekeſt her as ſilver,
and ſearcheſt for her as for hid treaſures. Then
ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and
find the knowledge of thy God.</hi> Here the Wiſe
Man makes the moſt ſearching Diligence,
and the moſt vigorous exertion of Soul neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to the finding of Wiſdom. And he that
ſo ſeeks her ſhall find her. Which brings
me in the laſt place to make good the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
it ſelf, that thoſe who do thus hunger
and thirſt after Righteouſneſs ſhall be fill'd.</p>
                     <p>But before I proceed to this, I beg leave
by way of Digreſſion to ſpeak ſomething of
another ſort of Hunger and Thirſt which all
Chriſtians are concerned to have. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
tells us, that <hi>Except a man eat the fleſh of
the ſon of man, and drink his blood he has no
life in him,</hi> Joh. 6. 53. Now if the Fleſh and
Blood of our Lord be neceſſary to the <hi>Life,</hi>
then certainly the Hungring and Thirſting
after it is neceſſary to the Health and good
Habit of a Chriſtian. There is not a more
open ſign of a diſtemper'd Conſtitution ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the <hi>Natural,</hi> or in the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Man,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94628:50"/>
than either to long for what is not his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Food, or not to have an Appetite for
that which is. And therefore ſince the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Blood of Chriſt is the proper Food
and Aliment of a Chriſtian, it concerns him
as he values the Health and proſperous ſtate
of the Divine Life, not only to feed upon it,
but to keep up in himſelf a due <hi>Hunger</hi> and
<hi>Thirſt</hi> after it.</p>
                     <p>More eſpecially this he ought to do, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he approaches the Holy Altar to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of this Divine and Heavenly Feaſt. He
ought then by all the Arts of the Spirit, and
by all the Methods of Grace, to quicken and
raiſe this Hunger, and ſet an edge upon this
Thirſt. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> (if I miſtake not) diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Diſpoſitions of a worthy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant,
reckons this <hi>Hunger</hi> and <hi>Thirſt</hi> among
them, and makes them as neceſſary Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as any. And there is a great deal of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for it. This Holy Sacrament is generally
ſet out in Scripture by Meat and Drink. 'Tis
call'd expreſly by the Name of the <hi>Lord's
Supper.</hi> And, ſays our Saviour to the <hi>Jews,
My fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink
indeed,</hi> John 6. And as 'tis <hi>expreſſed,</hi> ſo alſo
was it <hi>prefigur'd</hi> by Types of the like Nature,
ſuch as the Tree of Life in the midſt of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe,
the Bread and Wine of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi>
the Manna, the Paſchal Lamb, the Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread,
the Bread wherewith the Angel fed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94628:51"/>
the Prophet, and particularly by the Waters
ſpringing out of the Rock, whereof the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
drank in the Wilderneſs.</p>
                     <p>Now I conſider that as theſe Figures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
the Nature and Efficacy of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacrament, that 'tis the Food of the Soul,
and the Life and Strength of the <hi>Spiritual
Man,</hi> ſo they do alſo repreſent to us our <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and the proper Meaſure and Argument
of Preparation: For if Meat and Drink be
the Entertainment, what more convenient
Preparation than <hi>Hunger</hi> and <hi>Thirſt?</hi> We
ought indeed to come to theſe Springs of
Salvation, as the Hart is repreſented to do
by the Pſalmiſt to the Water-brooks, pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and thirſty, longing and impatient. Or
rather, to uſe a nearer Emblem, as thoſe
thirſty <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did to the Waters that iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of that Myſtic Rock in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
'Tis impoſſible to give a juſt Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this <hi>Sacramental Thirſt;</hi> but if we
could but ſo far advance our Fancy, as to
repreſent to our ſelves with what eagerneſs
and greedineſs thoſe thirſty and ſcorch'd
Travellers in the Wilderneſs did apply their
Mouths to the ſpringing Stone that was now
more indear'd to them by the <hi>Benefit</hi> than by
the <hi>Miracle,</hi> then and then only may we
have ſome Notion of that Hunger and Thirſt
wherewith we are to approach and receive
theſe Divine Myſteries. For if that Rock
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94628:51"/>
and Miraculous Water was a Type of our
Sacrament (as the Apoſtle aſſures us it was,
telling us expreſly, that that Rock was Chriſt)
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. then by the like proportion that
<hi>Thirſt</hi> was alſo a Symbol of our Duty, a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of our <hi>Sacramental Thirſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as he that will come to this Divine
Feaſt, muſt come Hungry and Thirſty; ſo
he that is truly Hungry and Thirſty as he
ought, will be ſure to come, and not (as too
many do) ſtudy to find out Pretences to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
his Abſence. But why do I ſay <hi>Study</hi>
to find Excueſs? There are ſome Men that
will be hinderd by <hi>any</hi> thing; nay, by <hi>every</hi>
thing. There is nothing, there <hi>can</hi> be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo little and inconſiderable, but what
will hinder ſome Men from the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
That which would not hinder them
from any thing elſe, things of much lighter
Weight than what were pretended by thoſe
in the Parable, the buying of a Farm, or the
Trying of a Yoke of Oxen, or the Marrying
of a Wife. If the Heavens do but frown, or
if they themſelves are never ſo little out of
humour; if a Viſit be intended a day after,
or if a Domeſtick Jar happen'd a day before,
then preſently keep off from the Sacrament.
Nay, ſome are ſo very abſurd, that though
they themſelves are in perfect Charity with
all the World, and have not the leaſt Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of the old Leven remaining in them,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94628:52"/>
yet if <hi>another</hi> Perſon happen to be out with
<hi>them,</hi> they ſhall think this a ſufficient War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to ſtay away from the Sacrament; which
amounts as much as if a Man ſhould ſay, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
another Perſon has ſinn'd againſt me,
therefore I will ſin againſt God and my ſelf,
and ſo be ſure to outdo him.</p>
                     <p>But there is a Degree of Folly beyond this.
There are ſome that cover over this groſs
Neglect, which comes the neareſt of any
thing to what the Apoſtle calls <hi>Trampling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the blood of the covenant, and doing deſpite
to the Spirit of Grace,</hi> with the ſpecious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>Reverence.</hi> They have, forſooth, ſo
profound a Reverence for the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they cannot find in their Hearts
to come to it. A very odd Way of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Reverence to any Divine Inſtitution, by
turning ones Back upon it. This is ſuch a
Reverence as the <hi>Jews</hi> pretend towards the
<hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> or Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which
conſiſts in their never uſing it. Such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
(if ſo much) as the Papiſts ſhew
to the Hoſt, when they carry it in Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to be gazed upon, and ſtared at. But
do theſe Men, indeed, reverence the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?
Then one would expect, at leaſt,
that when-ever they <hi>do</hi> come, they ſhould
behave themſelves there with more Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Reverence than others that are moſt
conſtant. But there is nothing like to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94628:52"/>
Nor do I at all wonder at it, ſince
the Way to Communicate well, is to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
often. And I farther remark, That
thoſe who behave themſelves moſt <hi>irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently</hi>
at all other Parts of Divine Worſhip,
are the very Men that ſtay moſt away from
the holy Altar, upon the Pretence of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                     <p>But how comes it to paſs that <hi>this</hi> is the
only Part of Religion that muſt be neglected
upon the Account of Reverence? Do they
do ſo by any <hi>other</hi> Part of Religion? 'Tis
true, indeed, that all the other Parts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worſhip are too much neglected, as
well as this; but I do not find that ever any
were ſo abſurd as to pretend <hi>Reverence</hi> for
the neglecting of <hi>them;</hi> and why then ſhould
they do it here?</p>
                     <p>But do theſe Men indeed reverence the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacrament? Why then do they not pay
ſome Regard to the <hi>Command</hi> it ſelf, as well
as to the <hi>Matter</hi> of it? <hi>Do this,</hi> ſays our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>in remembrance of me.</hi> Why ſhould
all the Reverence be fixed upon <hi>This,</hi> and
none upon <hi>Do?</hi> Or, if they do reverence the
<hi>Command,</hi> how are they not afraid of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it? Or how can a Command be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
by not obſerving it? <hi>Do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of me.</hi> If the doing this be in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of our Saviour, then the not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is to forget him: And how can he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94628:53"/>
Reverence to the <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
the <hi>Author</hi> of it?</p>
                     <p>And here I cannot but take notice of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
groſs Notion that I find paſſes very cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
among Common People. They think
all the Danger lies in Coming unprepared:
If they eat and drink unworthily, then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Death and Damnation: But if they
ſtay away, all is ſafe and well, As if a Man
might not deſtroy himſelf <hi>Faſting,</hi> as
well as by taking <hi>Poiſon.</hi> Theſe Men ought
to conſider that there is ſuch a thing as an
<hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy Non-Communicant,</hi> as well as an
<hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy Communicant.</hi> And I wiſh they
would read a certain Book that bears that
Title, <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy Non-Communicant:</hi> They
would then perhaps be ſenſible of ſome other
Danger, beſides that of Coming without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Preparation. In the mean time, all
that I ſhall farther ſay to thoſe Men is, That
what-ever Pretences they make to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
'tis certain they have not that <hi>Hunger</hi>
and <hi>Thirſt</hi> which is ſo neceſſary to the Life
of a Chriſtian, and which, if they had it,
would bring them oftner to this Spiritual
Banquet, and procure them the Bleſſing of
being <hi>filled,</hi> and repleniſhed. To the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of which I now return.</p>
                     <p>Now there are two Ways of being filled;
either <hi>Abſolutely</hi> and <hi>Simply,</hi> ſo as not to be
any more in Deſires: Or with reſpect to ſome
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94628:53"/>
                        <hi>certain</hi> Object, ſo as not to deſire any more
of the <hi>ſame;</hi> tho', ſimply ſpeaking, you do
deſire <hi>ſtill.</hi> The Firſt of theſe is <hi>Satisfaction,</hi>
the Second is <hi>Satiety:</hi> And thoſe that duly
hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs ſhall be
filled both Ways; that is, They ſhall be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and they ſhall be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with <hi>Happineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> They ſhall be filled with <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
Rom. 5. 5. For, ſince the Spirit of God,
which ſheds his Love abroad in our Hearts,
is a good and loving Spirit, and knows no
other Bounds in his Communications than
what are ſet him by the Capacity of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
it follows, that he will not fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh
all thoſe with his Graces, who are
duly qualified to receive them. But now,
nothing can be ſuppoſed to be a greater Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification,
than ſuch Hungring and Thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as I have deſcribed. This is the utmoſt
Man can do to diſpoſe himſelf for the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Divineſt Impreſſions. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is that ſacred Lure, that powerful Charm,
which draws down the Holy Spirit into the
Hearts of Men; as the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> ſay of apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſpoſed Matter, that it <hi>ſucks</hi> a Soul into
it, by a kind of Natural <hi>Magick,</hi> from the
World of Life. This Hunger and Thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Righteouſneſs is the very ſame to the
Life of the Soul, as that <hi>Organical Aptneſs</hi> is
to the Life of the Body: It is the Congruity
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94628:54"/>
of the Soul, in order to Spiritual Life. That
Soul therefore that is ſo qualified for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
cannot miſs, according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Grace, of being filled with it.</p>
                     <p>The Short is, God deſires the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Man, more than Man himſelf does,
or can do: He delights to ſee his own Image
reflect from him, and ſtands ready to ſow
the Seeds of the Divine Life in every capable
Soil; and therefore we need not doubt but
that the truly hungry and thirſty Soul ſhall
be filled with the <hi>Bread of Life,</hi> and with
the <hi>Waters of Comfort,</hi> Pſal. 23. Not that he
ſhall be ſo filled with Righteouſneſs in this
Life, as not to deſire any more of it, (for
we are now in a State of Proficiency, not of
Perfection) but in the next he ſhall: He
ſhall then be ſo repleniſhed with it, as not to
deſire any one farther Degree of it; and ſhall
be perfectly poſſeſſed of that Divine Life and
Nature, whereof he is now only Partaker.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Theſe hungry and thirſty Souls
ſhall be filled with <hi>Happineſs.</hi> This is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Conſequent of the other, there being
both a <hi>Natural,</hi> and an <hi>Eſtabliſhed</hi> Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between Righteouſneſs and Happineſs.
Some, indeed, have gone ſo far, as to make
them one and the ſame as to <hi>Kind,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhable
only as to <hi>Degree.</hi> Hence that
common Theological Effate, <hi>Grace is Glory
begun, and Glory is only Grace finiſhed.</hi> But
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94628:54"/>
I think there is more Prettineſs in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
than Truth in the Notion. Nay,
there is one Inſtance which plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
it to be falſe: For 'tis moſt certain,
that the Human Soul of our Saviour was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in a State of <hi>Perfect Grace,</hi> having, as
the Scripture ſays, received the Spirit of God
without Meaſure; and yet it is as certain,
that he was not, while on Earth, in the <hi>State
of Glory,</hi> being then a Man of Sorrows, and
acquainted with Grief: Much leſs was he in
the State of Glory at the Hour of his Paſſion,
and during his dreadful Dereliction. Which
yet could never be, if perfect Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
were, as ſome contend, one and the ſame
thing.</p>
                     <p>But our Propoſition will ſtand well enough,
without the help of this Notion. For, tho'
<hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> be not the ſame thing with
<hi>Happineſs,</hi> yet there is ſuch a Connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, that they who are filled with
the former, ſhall certainly be ſo with the
latter. And this depends upon the Nature
of Things, as well as upon the Order of God:
For a righteous Frame of Spirit not only
gives us Admiſſion to the Supreme Good,
but alſo diſpoſes us for the Enjoyment of it;
without which, all the other Materials of
Happineſs would ſignifie nothing. 'Tis the
Diſpoſition of the Soul that makes the Viſion
of God truly <hi>Beatifick;</hi> and when we <hi>awake
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94628:55"/>
up after his likeneſs, and behold his preſence in
Righteouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. 117. 16. then, and then
only, we ſhall be <hi>ſatisfied</hi> with his Glory.</p>
                     <p>And here we may ſtand ſtill a little, and
reflect what a great Privilege thoſe that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and thirſt after Righteouſneſs have, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all thoſe who make Secular and Carnal
Things the Objects of their Deſire. Theſe
things can never fill them <hi>abſolutely,</hi> ſo as to
extinguiſh all Deſire; being neither them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the Good of Man, nor leading to that
which is: Nor can they always ſatisfie that
<hi>particular</hi> Appetite which is converſant about
them; ſometimes becauſe the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
cannot be had, Nature having not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
enough for the Covetouſneſs and Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury,
tho' ſhe has for the Neceſſities of Men:
And ſometimes becauſe they are too deficient
when we have them, by reaſon of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
to the Enlargement of the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
as in the Objects of <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Hearing,</hi>
wherewith neither the <hi>Eye</hi> nor <hi>Ear</hi> is ſatisfied,
as was remarked before. And when theſe
things <hi>do</hi> fill any particular Appetite, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for a time, till the next Fit of Longing
comes; as the Ground is, for the preſent,
refreſhed with a tranſient Shower. But for
thoſe that hunger and thirſt after <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
as their Deſires are more noble, ſo their
Satisfaction ſhall be more abundant. 'Tis
their great and peculiar Bleſſedneſs to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in all Senſes, and in all Capacities, and to
all Eternity.</p>

                     <p>OF all the Paſſions which God has plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Human Nature, there is none
which at once carries ſo bright a Reſemblance
of <hi>God,</hi> and is ſo fitted to the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of <hi>Man,</hi> as that of Pitifulneſs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.
And if, when God made Man, he
conſulted his own Eternal Eſſence, certainly
when he drew this Part of him, we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him to have reflected upon the divineſt
of all his Ideas, and to have ſtamped upon
him the moſt lovely Feature of the Divinity.</p>
                     <p>All the other Paſſions are, in their own
ſimple Natures, indifferent, neither good nor
evil in themſelves, but equally determinable
to either, and, for the moſt part, are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
determined to the wrong. They are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
irregular, either in the Degree, or in
the Object; are either miſ-governed, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed;
and when moſt orderly managed,
the higheſt Character they can pretend to, is
only to be Inſtruments and Servants to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
They are as a guſty Wind and Sail to a

Ship; if ſhe ſteer right, they proſper, and
further her Courſe; but if wrong, they ſerve
only to ſtrike her againſt the Rocks with
more Speed and Force.</p>
                     <p>But now this Affection of Pity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
riſes higher than Indifferency, and
is not content with a bare ſtate of Innocence.
It is of it ſelf a vertuous Diſpoſition, and needs
only actual exertion to make it a direct Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and then its own Native Excellency will
place it among the Higheſt Orders. And
therefore tho our Saviour by aſſuming our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire

Natural Paſſions, yet as <hi>Mercy</hi> was that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute

ſo is <hi>that</hi> the Affection which he chiefly
commends to Man, by his Practice, and by

and adopting this alone of all the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into the Sacred Number of his <hi>few</hi> Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
by telling us, that <hi>Bleſſed are the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,

                     </p>
                     <p>This great and peculiar Honour, done by
our Lord to this Affection, will invite us to

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Nobleneſs and Excellency of it.</p>

But before we can well enter upon theſe
Conſiderations, we muſt firſt premiſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
concerning the Notion of Mercy, or
Compaſſion. By which, I ſuppoſe, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
underſtood, a Trouble or Uneaſineſs
of Spirit, conceived at ſome Evil that has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
another; with a Deſire to help him
out of it: Whereby it may be perceived, that
this is a mixt Paſſion, compounded of <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
and <hi>Deſire:</hi> Sorrow for the Evil of the
Patient, and Deſire of delivering him from
it.</p>
                     <p>If it be asked, What kind of Evil tha muſt
be, which is the Object of this Sorrow, or
which may recommend a Man to our Pity?
I know no Reaſon why we ſhould except
againſt any. There are, I know, ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Divines and Moraliſts (among
whom is <hi>Curcellaeus</hi>) Pag. 999. who will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
no other Evil to be capable of Pity, but
only Evil of <hi>Pain;</hi> nor that neither, if it be
<hi>deſerved.</hi> But, for my part, I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
why <hi>Sin</hi> may not fall under our Pity,
as well as any other Evil. Nay, I think that
the greateſt Object of Pity in the World is an
irreclaimable Sinner. And as for <hi>Affliction,</hi>
tho' the thing it ſelf be moſt pitiable when
joyned with Innocence, yet, I think, upon
the <hi>whole,</hi> the guilty Sufferer is more to be
pitied than the Innocent, ſince I can pity him
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94628:57"/>
for his Demerit, and for his Miſery too;
whereas the later is pitiable only for his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.
Indeed, the guilty Patient is not to be
pitied ſo much for his direct Miſery, becauſe
he deſerves it; but then he is more to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
for his Deſert and Miſery together, than
the other is for his Miſery only. And I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
not but that our compaſſionate Saviour,
when he wept over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> relented as
much for the <hi>Sins,</hi> as for the <hi>Vengeance</hi> that
was hanging over that unhappy City. And
that, had thoſe two great Tragick Scenes
been at once preſented before him, the <hi>Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of the <hi>Innocents,</hi> and the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of
that <hi>guilty People,</hi> he would have found more
to be pitied in the latter, than in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Tragedy.</p>
                     <p>I know that, by the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Laws, it was forbidden to ſhew any Signs
of Compaſſion in the behalf of thoſe that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
as <hi>Criminals;</hi> and, in Conſequence to
this, they were not to <hi>ſit,</hi> (that being the
Manner and Poſture of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Mourning) but to <hi>ſtand</hi> at their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Which was the Reaſon (as a learned
Critick of our Church ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves)
why the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Notes and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, <hi>p.</hi> 25.</note>
tho' deeply affected for
the ſevere Uſages of her Son,
yet, in Compliance with the Law, choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>ſtand,</hi> than to <hi>ſit</hi> near the Croſs; and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94628:57"/>
tho' full of inward Grief, refuſed to make
any <hi>ſolemn</hi> Shew of Lamentation.</p>
                     <p>But I ſuppoſe that the Signification of theſe
Laws, in forbidding open Compaſſion to
convicted Malefactors, was not, that they
were not Objects capable of it, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to pity them would argue a Senſe of their
Innocence, but only to procure the greater
Reverence to Judicial Sentences, and to ſhew
their great Satisfaction and Acquieſcence in
the Adminſtration of Juſtice. This therefore
will not exclude Criminals from the Sphere
of our Compaſſion, of which I ſee nothing
that ſhould make them uncapable. And I
would fain know what would have become
of all Mankind, if <hi>Suffering Innocence</hi> had been
the only Object of Commiſeration.</p>
                     <p>Theſe few things being premiſed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Notion of Mercy and Compaſſion,
let us now conſider the things that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it. The firſt whereof is, The Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Excellency of it. This has ſuffered
much under the Miſ-repreſentation of two
ſorts of Adverſaries, the <hi>Stoick,</hi> and the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotelian.</hi>
In the Stoick Morality it is ſo far
from having any Reputation for Excellence,
that it paſſes for a downright Vice, for an
Inſtance of Weakneſs and Littleneſs of Soul,
for ſuch a Piece of Softneſs and Effeminacy as
does not comport with the Character of their
<hi>Wiſe Man;</hi> who, indeed, is allowed to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:94628:58"/>
but not to be <hi>troubled</hi> for the Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and to add, if he can, to the Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>their</hi> Minds, but not to loſe any thing
of his <hi>own. Non miſerebitur, ſed ſuccurret,</hi>
ſays <hi>Seneca:</hi> He may help the Miſerable, but
muſt not ſhare in the Miſery. This the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of <hi>Zeno</hi>'s School will, at no hand, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
which, indeed, ſhould make us the
more beholden to them for granting what
they do. But it is no Wonder that they who
will not allow a Man to be ſenſible of his
<hi>own</hi> Evils, ſhould forbid all Pity to thoſe of
<hi>other</hi> Men.</p>
                     <p>On the other Side, the <hi>Ariſtotelian;</hi> tho'
he does not ſtrike this Affection out of the
Liſt of the Vertues, as does the other, yet he
very much cheapens and depreciates the
Worth and Excellency of it, by deriving it
only from ſelfiſh Principles, by making this
the only ground of pitying others, that we
upon the account of common Nature and
Chance are obnoxious to the ſame Evils our
ſelves.</p>
                     <p>In oppoſition therefore to this Double Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
I ſhall maintain and illuſtrate the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
and Excellency of this Diſpoſition
upon this double Ground.</p>
                     <p>I. Becauſe 'tis found always in the Beſt of
Natures.</p>
                     <p>II. Becauſe it proceeds from the beſt of
Principles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:94628:58"/>
And firſt, 'Tis always found in the Beſt
of Natures. God as he is the Beſt, ſo is he
alſo the moſt merciful and compaſſionate of
all Beings. 'Twas the very Name where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he proclaim'd himſelf to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 34.
6. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
&amp;c.</hi> And our Saviour commends this
Attribute of God in particular to our Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Luk. 6. 36. Be ye merciful as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is merciful.</hi> We read in Scripture of the
<hi>Tender Mercies</hi> of God, or as it may be more
ſtrictly render'd, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 78. The <hi>Bowels</hi> of
the Mercy of God. There is a ſtrange Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis
and Strength in the Expreſſion. And
indeed there is nothing in Scripture ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically
expreſſed as the Tenderneſs and
Mercy of God. 'Twould be endleſs to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Particulars, but there is one place
which may go for all. 'Tis that famous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation
of God with himſelf upon the
diſingenuous Behaviour of his People <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
Hoſ. 11. 8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up</hi> Ephraim?
<hi>How ſhall I deliver thee</hi> Iſrael? <hi>How ſhall I
make thee as</hi> Admah? <hi>How ſhall I ſet thee as</hi>
Zeboim? <hi>Mine Heart is turned within me,
and my repentings are kindled together.</hi> What
moving, melting ſtrains are theſe! What a
lively, breathing Image of Mercy and Pity!
And yet 'tis but an <hi>Image</hi> ſtill, vaſtly ſhort
of the Original, as will always be, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94628:59"/>
is ſaid or thought of the infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Talmud</hi> (as I am told)
ſpeaking concerning the Employment of God
before the making of the World, ſay, not as
he in St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that he was preparing an
Hell for the Inquiſitive, but that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
how to be <hi>merciful</hi> to Mankind. And
'tis true indeed God did from all Eternity
contrive to ſhew Mercy to Man, tho not by
way of ſtudy or employment of Mind, as
they groſly fancy.</p>
                     <p>But the Hebrews further Note (what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is more conſiderable) that God to ſhew
his great Honour and Love for this dear At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,
in all his kind and merciful Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
with Men, choſe always to be call'd
by that his great and incommunicable Name,
<hi>Jehovah,</hi> as to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Clift of the Rock,
<hi>Jehovah, Jehovah, the Lord, the Lord God,
merciful and gracious,</hi> &amp;c. But in any Proceſs
of Juſtice and Judgment, he always ſtyles
himſelf <hi>Eloah,</hi> or <hi>Elohim,</hi> a Name import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Force and Power, and that is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to God as the other, but common to him
with the Creatures, being ſometimes given
to the Angels, ſometimes to Magiſtrates, and
ſometimes even to Falſe Gods. The Name
<hi>Jehovah</hi> was more Sacred, and of higher im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
than that of <hi>Elohim;</hi> and therefore God
to ſhew his ſpecial regard to Mercy above
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94628:59"/>
his other <hi>Strange Work,</hi> choſe in his milder
Addreſſes to be call'd by the former, and in
his ſeverer Proceedings by the latter. Which
was the reaſon, (as the forementioned Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Critick remarks,) why our Saviour at the
Point of his Dereliction cried out, not, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,
Jehovah,</hi> but <hi>Eli, Eli, my God, my God,</hi>
as not preſuming at that time and in that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
to call God by his Titles of Paternal
Love and indearment, but as <hi>Naming the
Judge of the World doing the extreameſt right
upon his own Son, treading the Wine-preſs alone
in the Perſon of all Mankind,</hi> as that Learned
Author expreſſes it, Pag. 7.</p>
                     <p>But the greateſt and moſt convincing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of the Mercy of God, is ſeen in
the myſterious and coſtly Redemption of
Laps'd Man. The greateſt Exaltation of
which, is to ſay nothing of it, but, as the
Angels are repreſented to do in Heaven, to
ſtoop down and look near into it with ſilence
and wonder. <hi>Which things the Angels deſire
to look into,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 12. An Alluſion no
doubt to the Propitiatory or Mercy-lid upon
the Ark, whereupon two Angels, <hi>Cherubins,</hi>
(who are the Angels of <hi>Knowledge</hi>) did
abide with their Faces one toward another,
and their Eyes bent down to the Ark. Which
by the way is alſo a ſufficient Argument of
the Unfathomableneſs of this great Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mercy, which can ſtill find further
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94628:60"/>
Employment for the Study and Curioſity
even of Angels.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps 'twill be ſaid, that Mercy in
<hi>God</hi> is of another kind than what is call'd by
that Name in <hi>Man,</hi> that it comes nearer the
Stoical Notion of Mercy, importing only a
bare Will to help the Miſerable, without any
compaſſionate Reſentment for his Miſery. It
may be ſo, I wont diſpute that now, tho I
can hardly believe but that ſuch ſtrong and
flaming Expreſſions of the Divine Mercy in
Scripture muſt needs ſignifie ſomething more
than what ſuch <hi>cold</hi> Interpreters affix to them.</p>
                     <p>But however, to be more convincing, I
further inſtance in the Human Soul of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Jeſus Chriſt. 'Tis moſt certain that of
all Human Spirits his was the moſt excellent.
<hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocence was not comparable
to him. He was excellent only by way of
Nature, but our Saviour's Human Spirit to
the ſame or greater Excellence of Nature had
alſo ſuperadded the Excellency of Grace, not
common Grace, but that great and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Grace of the Hypoſtatick Union. And
'tis as certain that as he had the <hi>Beſt,</hi> ſo he
had the <hi>Beſt-natur'd</hi> and moſt tenderly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
Soul in the World. I need not
produce Inſtances, his whole Life is but one
Argument of it. Only one Paſſage, when he
ſaw the multitude ſcattered abroad like
Sheep that have no Shepherd, 'tis ſaid,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94628:60"/>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>He was moved with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
on them,</hi> Mat. 9. 36. ſo we render it;
but indeed the Expreſſion is too high and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to be verbally tranſlated. 'Twould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a long copious Paraphraſe to drain the
Senſe of that one Word, which ſignifies all
that inward Feeling and Yerning of the Heart
and Soul at a pitiful Object, that melts and
turns the very Bowels of the Good-natured
Spectator.</p>
                     <p>And the ſame Tenderneſs of Spirit which
he had on Earth, he retains ſtill in Heaven,
tho in all other reſpects <hi>Impaſſible,</hi> and incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled
with Divine Glories. Whereupon he
is call'd in Scripture our <hi>merciful High-Prieſt;</hi>
and to convince any Oppoſer that this is not
meant of Mercy improperly ſo called, a bare
Will to help without any Compaſſionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment,
ſays the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,
we have not an High-Prieſt which cannot be
touched with feeling of our Infirmities,</hi> Heb. 4.
15.</p>
                     <p>And theſe two Conſiderations by the way
give a clear defeat to the Pretences of both
the forementioned Adverſaries. For whereas
the <hi>Stoick</hi> traduces this noble Vertue for a
piece of Weakneſs and Infirmity, fit only for
ſoft and effeminate Perſons; to him I oppoſe
the inſtance of our Saviour's Human Soul
while on <hi>Earth.</hi> And whereas the <hi>Ariſtote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
makes the only ground of Pity to be a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94628:61"/>
fear of falling into the like Calamity; to him
I oppoſe the ſame Inſtance of our Saviour,
but in <hi>another Capacity,</hi> when he was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Impaſſible in his glorify'd ſtate, and
above the poſſibility of partaking with us in
our Miſeries any other way, than by <hi>Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
and Compaſſion.</p>
                     <p>To this I may add, that among <hi>meer</hi> Men
the moſt generous and brave Spirits, thoſe
whom <hi>Paganiſm</hi> has Deify'd, Chriſtianity has
Sainted; thoſe Heroes whom Hiſtory has
mark'd with Honour, and whom Envy it ſelf
is aſham'd to calumniate, have all along been
ſignal for their <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Good-Nature.</hi> As
on the contrary, the moſt baſe, timorous and
low-ſpirited Breaſts are always obſerv'd to
be the Seats of <hi>Cruelty</hi> and Hard-heartedneſs.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis no wonder that this Diſpoſition is
found in the Beſt of Natures, ſince in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Place it proceeds from the Beſt of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
For it proceeds from <hi>Charity,</hi> with
which the leaſt thing a Man can think or do
is excellent, and without which the greateſt,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. even <hi>Martyrdom</hi> it ſelf, is nothing
worth. It has that for its Parent which is
the Mother of all Vertues, and which is of it
ſelf the fulfilling of the moſt perfect, that is,
of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Law. And that it proceeds
from Charity is plain. For the more we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the Happineſs and well-being of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
the more we ſhall be troubled to ſee
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94628:61"/>
any of them in Miſery, and be the more
willing to procure them Eaſe and Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
And this tho we do not apprehend
our ſelves in danger of the like Calamity,
there being no neceſſity of making that the
ground of Pity, as appears from the inſtance
of our Saviour's Human Soul in its Glorified
State. I deny not but that the generality of
Men are moved to Pity upon the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of common Danger, and that it may be
their own turn next to ſuffer and ſtand in
need of help; but it is not neceſſary that they
<hi>ſhould,</hi> and 'tis their imperfection that they
<hi>are.</hi> I ſay <hi>their</hi> imperfection, not that of the
<hi>Affection</hi> it ſelf, whoſe Idea involves no ſuch
ſelfiſh Principle, and which may really be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from it, as by the fore-alledged Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
is certain and evident.</p>
                     <p>And now if to be found in the Beſt of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and to proceed from the Beſt of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
be any Argument of Excellence, we
may hence conclude what a Noble and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Diſpoſition of Mind this is, and that
when the <hi>Roman Orator</hi> told <hi>Caeſar,</hi> That of
all his many Vertues, none was either more
acceptable, or more wonderful than his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Clemency; he might perhaps Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
the <hi>Emperour,</hi> but ſaid nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
of the Vertue.</p>
                     <p>As will further appear by conſidering Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
the great Reaſonableneſs and Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it. As to the Former, beſides that all
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94628:62"/>
that which may be ſaid in the behalf of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Univerſal Love, may be alledged
as well for this, there are theſe two more
proper and peculiar Grounds to prove and
inforce it.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>I. To conſider what Man has Receiv'd.</item>
                        <item>II. To conſider what he Expects.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>And Firſt, if we conſider what Man has
already <hi>receiv'd,</hi> this Vertue of Mercy will
appear to be highly reaſonable. Man has
receiv'd innumerable Mercies of God, ſome
of which are ſo great, ſo ſurprizing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
that 'tis made one of the greateſt
Trials and Commendations of his Faith to
<hi>believe</hi> them. Such as the Honour of the
Hypoſtatick Union, the Redemption from
Sin and Miſery by the Death of the Son of
God, the Grace of Repentance, and the like.
All which are yet improv'd and hightened
by this further Conſideration, that they are
proper and peculiar to him, no other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
not ſo much as the Angels themſelves
being Partakers with him. The Angels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
as all other Creatures partake of the
Goodneſs of God; but Man alone among all
the Creatures has the Priviledge to be the
Object of his Mercy. Since therefore Man
and Man only has receiv'd ſo much Mercy
of God, it appears very reaſonable that he of
all Creatures ſhould ſhew Mercy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:94628:62"/>
As it will Secondly, if we conſider what
he <hi>expects.</hi> Man has not yet received ſo much
Mercy, but that he expects more. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that he has receiv'd is by the Redemption
of Chriſt to be put into a <hi>Capacity</hi> of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but the Mercy that he expects is to be
<hi>actually</hi> ſaved. The Court of Mercy is the
only Court where Man dares appear, or can
abide a Trial. Briefly, Man expects Mercy
both from God and from Man, in this Life,
and in the next, in Death and after Death,
and therefore there is great reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that he of all Creatures ſhould he mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
and that <hi>Cruelty</hi> was as little <hi>made for
Man as Pride.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor is this Affection leſs Uſeful than Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.
The condition of Man in this World
is ſuch, as makes it as neceſſary for him to
be <hi>pitiful,</hi> as to be a <hi>ſociable</hi> Creature. Man
cannot ſubſiſt without the Guardianſhip and
Protection of Society; nor is Society any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
without this Affection. For what ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
Strengh and Ability (and Society as
ſuch infers no more) without Inclination to
aſſiſt? The Wiſe Man tells us that <hi>Wiſdom is
better than Strength;</hi> Eccl. 9. 16. and 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true; but neither of them, nor both of
them ſignifie any thing without a tender and
compaſſionate Temper. Then only may we
expect Happineſs and Defence from Society,
when there is the ſame Sympathy in the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94628:63"/>
as there is in the Natural Body, when
there is a mutual Correſpondency and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of Parts, like the Sympathetick
Anſwer of one Lute to another. When the
<hi>Heaven hears the Earth</hi> in the Prophet's Phraſe;
or as the Apoſtle more fully expreſſes it, when
<hi>If one Member ſuffer, all the Members ſuffer with
it; or if one Member be honour'd, all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
rejoyce with it,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 26. This would
make a <hi>Millennium</hi> indeed; nor is any thing
further wanting, but only that Men would
agree together to make the Experiment.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe this is a Paſſion of ſo great uſe
and neceſſity to the preſent Condition of
<hi>Man,</hi> God has been pleas'd to take an early
and an effectual Care for the Security of it, not
only by giving the Soul of <hi>Man</hi> an Original
Bent and Inclination that way, but alſo by
diſpoſing him to it by the very Make and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration
of his Body, that ſo the whole <hi>Man</hi>
might ſtand inclined to ſhew Mercy and
Compaſſion. For we are to conſider that
there are ſome natural Diſpoſitions in the
Brain, whereby we are mov'd and admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be pitiful and compaſſionate, ſince the
courſe of the Animal Spirits is (by I know
not what Principle) directed to thoſe parts
whereby we are ſtirr'd up to the ſenſe of
others Pain or Miſery. For as experience
witneſſes, whenever we happen to caſt our
Eyes upon a <hi>Man</hi> that is wounded, we find
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94628:63"/>
a ſuddain Tide of Spirits thronging towards
thoſe Parts of our Body, which anſwer to the
Parts affected of the wounded <hi>Man,</hi> unleſs by
ſome Accidental Cauſe their Courſe be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
ſome other way. And theſe <hi>Motions</hi>
by which the Parts of our own Body are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by the occaſion of thoſe <hi>Motions</hi> which
are excited in others, do raiſe that Sentiment
within us, which we call <hi>Pity</hi> or <hi>Compaſſion,</hi>
which by an Order of God's Eſtabliſhment,
we can no more help being affected with,
than we can that our Animal Spirits ſhould
flow to and affect thoſe parts of our Body
which correſpond to thoſe of another which
we ſee wounded. So that you ſee the Ground
and Foundation of this Affection is laid in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
God has bound it upon us by a <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
as well as by a <hi>Moral</hi> Law, by the very
Figure and Contexture of our Bodies, which
certainly he would not have done, but that
he knew how uſeful and neceſſary it was for
the Intereſt of Mankind in their preſent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
which is a ſtate of Want and mutual
Dependence upon each other, whereby we
ſtand in need of one anothers Pity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</p>
                     <p>And now if this Divine Affection (for ſo
we may now venture to call it) be not yet
ſufficiently recommended from its Nobleneſs
and Excellency, and from its great Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
and Uſefulneſs, let us further add the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94628:64"/>
particular Bleſſedneſs here aſſigned to it. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
are the merciful,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>for they
ſhall obtain mercy.</hi> This they ſhall obtain from
Men and from God, here and hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Firſt they ſhall obtain <hi>Mercy</hi> from Men
here. Not that this is to paſs for an abſolute
Rule, without any Exception, ſince as long
as Men are but Men, <hi>Mercy</hi> is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abuſed and ill-requited, as well as any
other Vertue; otherwiſe our Saviour would
have been more kindly treated than he was
by the <hi>Jews.</hi> But the meaning is, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
does more naturally recommend a <hi>Man</hi>
to the good Will and Compaſſion of others,
than a Merciful and Benign Temper, and that
generally ſpeaking, if Men be but tolerably
well diſpoſed, and have any Senſe of Juſtice
and Gratitude, the merciful Man will actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
find Mercy among them. However if
not, he has the greater ſtock of Mercy to
come. For,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the <hi>Merciful</hi> ſhall obtain <hi>Mercy</hi>
from God hereafter. And this does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon ſo many Caſualties, and ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
Suppoſitions as the other. Here 'tis
only required that <hi>mercy and truth meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and that the Man be ſincere and upright
in all other moral reſpects. And ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is neceſſary. For 'tis not to be thought
that <hi>Mercy</hi> alone, any more than any other
Solitary Vertue can qualifie a Man for <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>
                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:94628:64"/>
No, the Man muſt be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
Perfect and intire, and wanting nothing as
to all the Integral Parts of Duty, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
in the Judgment of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 4.
Only there may I think be allow'd this
further Senſe in the Propoſition, that no <hi>one</hi>
Vertue ſhall go ſo far towards the obtaining
of full <hi>Mercy</hi> from God, as this of <hi>Merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
And that if the <hi>Merciful</hi> Man for want
of other neceſſary parts of Chriſtian Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſhould not be able to <hi>ſtand</hi> in the laſt
Judgment, yet however his Fall ſhall be
much the milder, and he ſhall have great
Abatements of Puniſhment made him for the
ſake of this one Excellency. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
'tis very conſiderable that our Saviour
in the Deſcription of the laſt Judgment,
makes all the Favour and all the Severity of
that day to proceed according to the Practice
or Omiſſion of this Duty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</p>
                     <p>One way or other therefore the merciful
ſhall be ſure to obtain <hi>Mercy,</hi> nor will God
forget this <hi>Labour of Love.</hi> Pray God we
may not forget it our ſelves, but may ſo love,
ſtudy and practiſe <hi>Mercy</hi> here, that we may
hereafter not only receive a milder Sentence,
but find ſuch a Degree of Mercy, as may fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<hi>rejoice againſt Judgment.</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <p>ONE of the moſt diſtinguiſhing Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Chriſtian Inſtitution above
any other either Divine or Human, is, that
it requires an inward Rectitude of Mind and
Spirit, and makes the <hi>Heart</hi> the Principle and
Seat of Spiritual, as it is of Natural Life. The
<hi>Heathen Morality</hi> went little further than the
regulation of the outward Behaviour, not
much regarding the Sanctity of the <hi>Interiour.</hi>
And tho ſome few raiſed Spirits among them,
moved by a Diviner Impulſe, would now
and then, like <hi>Men</hi> in Extaſies, talk above
the World and themſelves too, recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
certain <hi>Purgations</hi> and <hi>Purifications</hi> of
Soul, as the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> and <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> yet
this was not taught or known in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Schools of Nature, nor was it any where
made the Ordinary Standard of <hi>Morality.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jewiſh Religion,</hi> as it preſented to the
World a Second and more correct Edition
of the Law of Nature, ſo was it in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
reſpect more perfect than the Gentile
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94628:65"/>
                        <hi>Morality,</hi> there being in the <hi>Moral</hi> Law <hi>one</hi>
ſpecial Precept which directly concerns <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of Heart. But yet there was a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
even here too, becauſe tho there was a
Prohibition of <hi>inward Concupiſcence,</hi> yet it had
no penal Sanction annex'd to it. Every other
Precept was ſo guarded as to be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
it ſelf upon thoſe who trangreſſed it.
Idolatry was puniſh'd, Perjury was puniſh'd,
Profanation of the Sabbath, Diſobedience to
Parents, Murther, Adultery, Theft, and
bearing falſe Witneſs were all puniſh'd, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Concupiſcence had no puniſhment allotted
to it. Which (as a Learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
Conjectures) gave ſome
occaſion to think,<note place="margin">Phillippus a Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borch. Theolog. Chriſtian, p. 217.</note> that they
might ſecurely indulge their
Concupiſcence, ſo it did not break forth into
the outward and groſſer Act.</p>
                     <p>Certain it is, that many among the Jews
ſo thought and practis'd, contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with external Conformity to the Law,
without any regard to the inward Purity and
Holineſs, as may appear from our Saviour's
frequent reprehenſions of the Phariſees upon
this very account. And 'tis very probable
that this their Fancy was occaſion'd by there
being no Puniſhment aſſign'd to the Breach
of the <hi>Tenth</hi> Commandment, as that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Perſon conjectures. However 'tis certain
that it was a great Defect in the Law not to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94628:66"/>
bind ſo perfect a Precept with a Penal San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Tho indeed the true reaſon was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'twas too perfect to be ſeverely exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that Infant Age and State of the Church.
The Law therefore did not rigidly <hi>exact</hi> it,
tho it did plainly <hi>command</hi> it. Which tho
no defect with relation to that Time and
State, (the Law being as perfect as the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
as to all the ends purpoſes intended by
it, and every way accommodated to the
Condition of thoſe on whom it was impoſed)
yet abſolutely ſpeaking it was a great Defect
and Imperfection of the Law.</p>
                     <p>Then as to the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion (which
indeed is only Heatheniſm pretending to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation)
this, tho the laſt; and aſſuming to
it ſelf the improvement of all that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
is yet really ſhort even of Heatheniſm
it ſelf. This is ſo far from requiring internal
Purity, that it does not require ſo much as
external, but allows and <hi>recommends</hi> too the
groſſeſt Impurities; which has often made
me wonder why the <hi>Turk</hi> ſhould write up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the out-ſide of his Alcoran, <hi>Let no Man
touch this Book, but he that is pure.</hi> I'm ſure
the Book it ſelf requires no ſuch thing, nor
can I juſtifie the Reaſon of the <hi>Motto</hi> in any
other ſenſe but this, That none but he that is
pure is fit to be truſted with ſuch a corrupt
Inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:94628:66"/>
But the Chriſtian Law is <hi>pure</hi> indeed, and
none but ſuch as are ſo are worthy to unlooſe
the Seals of this Book. This requires the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Purity that is conſiſtent with the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Morality, Purity without, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
within, pure Hands and pure Hearts.
It requires it more expreſly, and in a greater
degree, than either the Heathen or Jewiſh
Religion, and (what was wanting in the
other) under the Sanction of Rewards and
Puniſhments, and thoſe the greateſt imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
It does not only command inward
Purity, but incourage it too by the ſtrongeſt
Propoſals that can affect either the <hi>Senſe</hi> or
the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of Man. One of the greateſt of
which Encouragements is, that our Saviour
inſerts it into the order of his Beatitudes, and
gives it a ſpecial Title to the Beatifick Viſion
in theſe Words, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart,
for they ſhall ſee God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Subject to be here diſcourſed of is
<hi>Chriſtian Purity,</hi> or Purity of <hi>Heart.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

                     </p>
                     <p>By Purity of Heart in general, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
an inward Conformity of all the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94628:67"/>
Thoughts and Deſires of the Soul to the Will
and Law of God. When not only the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Actions are according to the Rule, but
the whole inward Frame and <hi>Poſition</hi> of the
Mind ſtands right and well order'd, and (as
the Apoſtle deſcribes it) not only the Body,
but the <hi>whole Spirit and Soul is blameleſs,</hi>
1 Theſ. 5. 23.</p>
                     <p>And to make it ſo, theſe two things are
particularly requiſite, Firſt, That we do not
conſent to any unlawful Deſires, no not ſo
much as to the firſt Motions of Sin, whether
proceeding from the corruptneſs of our own
Nature, or from Diabolical Suggeſtion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
That we do not entertain with any
delight the remembrances of our paſt Sins.</p>
                     <p>But more particularly yet, Purity of Heart
may be doubly conſider'd, either in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Pollution,</hi> or in oppoſition to <hi>Mixture.</hi>
In the firſt Senſe it removes Senſuality, in the
Second Hypocriſie. This diſtinction of the
Word Pure is acknowledg'd and withal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to this place by our Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pract. Cat. p. 107.</note> illuſtrated by
the Inſtances of Water and
Wine, the former of which is ſaid to be
pure, when not mudded or defiled; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
when not mixt.</p>
                     <p>But tho the Word be equally capable of this
latter Senſe, yet I do not think it to be at
all intended by our Saviour in this place,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94628:67"/>
there being no ſuch particular Congruity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this ſort of Purity and the nature of
the Reward here aſſign'd. Confining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Diſcourſe to the former Senſe of the
Word, as more ſuitable to the Circumſtance
of this place, from what has been premiſed,
we may collect this Idea or Character of the
Pure in Heart, <q>That they are ſuch as regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
not only the external Conduct of their
Lives, but alſo the inward Frame and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude
of their Minds, and conform not
only their Actions, but their Wills and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
Thoughts and Deſigns to the Rule of
the Law, and to the Dictates of the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Light</hi> of God in the Soul. Such as ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
the Lord God in their Hearts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the inmoſt receſſes of their minds into
an Holy Awe and Reverence of the Divine
Preſence, ſet a Law to all their Intellectual
Powers, and ſuffer not the leaſt Thought
or Paſſion to violate the Order either of
Reaſon or Grace. Such laſtly, as yield no
conſent either to the Being or Stay of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
Motions, nor give any entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Allurements of the World, the
Fleſh, or the Devil, nor delight themſelves
with any pleaſing recollections, any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Scenes of their paſt Immoralities,
but ſet themſelves at the greateſt diſtance
from Sin, reſiſt the very firſt Beginnings,
and, as near as they can, abſtain from the
leaſt Appearances of Evil.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:94628:68"/>
This is the moſt reſembling Idea that I can
frame to my ſelf of the Pure in Heart. And
now leſt this ſhould be taken for a meer Idea,
a thing of Notion rather than Practice, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the next place to repreſent the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of ſuch a Diſpoſition of Soul.</p>
                     <p>The Neceſſity of it is Double in order to a
double End, <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Happineſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And Firſt, This Purity of Heart is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in order to Holineſs, that is, there can be
no true Chriſtian Holineſs without it. This
will appear by conſidering,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That the Chriſtian Law expreſly
requires it. For this I need appeal no further
than to the progreſs of this ſame Diſcourſe of
our Saviour upon the Mount. Where among
ſeveral other <hi>improving</hi> Expoſitions of the
<hi>Moſaic Law,</hi> we find this, <hi>Ye have heard that
it was ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not
commit Adultery. But I ſay unto you, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
looketh on a Woman to luſt after her,
hath committed Adultery with her already in his
Heart,</hi> Mat. 5. 27. By which <hi>Luſting</hi> here
I conceive muſt not be underſtood the bare
natural Appetite of Concupiſcence (that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as ſuch indifferent) but the Appetite ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly
determin'd; nor that neither as 'tis
a pure Natural and Mechanick Motion, (for
ſo it has nothing Moral in it, and can only
be materially Evil) but as it has the conſent
of the Will going along with it. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94628:68"/>
may be either to the very <hi>Deſire</hi> it ſelf, or
to the <hi>Acting</hi> of it. If to the Act, then the
Man is in all Moral Accounts a compleat
Adulterer, and will be ſo eſteem'd by God,
who as he <hi>Sees,</hi> ſo he <hi>Judges</hi> by the Heart,
and will not think a Man the more innocent
only for wanting an Opportunity of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
what he fully intended. But if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
be only to the Deſire, then tho the Man
be not a compleat Adulterer, yet he may be
truly ſaid in the Style of the Pſalmiſt, to be
a <hi>Partaker with the Adulterer,</hi> Pſal. 50. to
have enter'd within ſome degrees of Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity,
and to have tranſgreſſed againſt that
Chriſtian Purity, which forbids all Conſent
not only to the compleat Acts, but alſo to the
firſt Motions of Sin.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The neceſſity of this Purity of
Heart in order to true Holineſs, will appear
by conſidering the Nature of God, who is
both a <hi>Spirit</hi> and a <hi>Diſcerner</hi> of Spirits, and
ought therefore for a double Reaſon to be
worſhipp'd in <hi>Spirit and in Truth,</hi> Joh. 4. 24.
Our Saviour thought the former ſufficient,
but the latter adds a further degree of ſtrength
to it. God as a Spirit cannot be worthily
ſerved by any thing leſs than the Sacrifice of
the Spirit, which perhaps was one of the
Reaſons why our Saviour, when he was to
become a Sacrifice to his Father, took upon
him not only Human Fleſh, as ſome of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94628:69"/>
Ancient Hereticks would have believ'd, but
alſo an Human Soul. And as a Diſcerner of
Spirits he cannot be put off with a bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of a Spiritual Service, or accept of a
polluted and unſanctified Spirit. The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
had a due ſenſe of this, when he ſaid,
<hi>Pſal. 51. 6, 10. Thou requireſt truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts, and ſhalt make me to underſtand wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ſecretly.</hi> And when he pray'd, <hi>Make me
a clean Heart, O God, and renew a right Spirit
within me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This Purity of Heart may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concluded neceſſary to true Holineſs from
the Nature of Man himſelf, in whom as the
Soul is in all reſpects the <hi>Principal,</hi> ſo in all
Moral reſpects it is the <hi>only</hi> part concern'd.
This <hi>Inner Man</hi> is that Man who is the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
and proper Subject of all Good and
Evil, Vertue and Vice, and accordingly this
is the part to which our Sanctification and
Regeneration is always aſcribed, and from
which the Man receives his whole Moral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.
And therefore ſays the Apoſtle,
<hi>To be carnally minded is Death, but to be ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
minded is Life and Peace,</hi> Rom. 8. 6. Where
you ſee 'tis the inward Diſpoſition of the
<hi>Mind</hi> that makes all the difference. If this
be Pure and Holy, the whole Man is ſo; but
if this ſtand not right to God and Goodneſs,
'tis not all the external Conformity in the
World that can ſupply the Defect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:94628:69"/>
'Twas the Conceit of the Ancient Jews (as
we are told by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>) that
every Proſelyte of <hi>Juſtice</hi> at the
very inſtant when he became ſo,<note place="margin">De Jure Nat. &amp; Gent. pag. 159.</note>
had a new Soul infuſed into him,
to which Opinion our Saviour is ſuppoſed to
allude in his Diſcourſe with <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> Now
tho Chriſtianity does not acknowledge a
New, that is, <hi>another</hi> Soul in its Converts,
yet it requires that the ſame Soul become
new, it requires a new Frame and Temper
of Spirit. The <hi>Chriſtian Man</hi> is to be Born
again, and to become a New Creature, a
Creature of another Rank and Order. And
'tis the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> upon which this great
Tranſaction is to paſs, and which is to be
the immediate Subject of this extraordinary
Change. And accordingly our Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is expreſſed in Scripture by our being <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
in the Spirit of our minds,</hi> Eph. 4. 23.
We muſt be renew'd; and where? Not in
our Body or outward Man, but in our Minds.
And in what part of the Mind? not in the
Inferiour part, whether <hi>Senſitive</hi> or <hi>Plaſtic,</hi>
that which is exercis'd about Objects of Senſe,
or that which <hi>moves</hi> and <hi>forms</hi> the Body, but
in the higheſt and nobleſt part, in the <hi>Spirit</hi>
of our Minds, which anſwers to the Platoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the very <hi>Flower</hi> and <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the
Soul. Here 'tis we are to be renew'd, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we muſt if we be renew'd at all, this
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:94628:70"/>
being in all regards the Principal, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>moral</hi> part of Man.</p>
                     <p>To this purpoſe it muſt be further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
that this Intellectual Heart, the Spirit
and Soul of Man is the Fountain and Source
of all Action. This is that which ſees in the
Eyes, and hears in the Ears. This is that
which underſtands and wills, loves and hates,
Here are all the Springs and Powers of Life
and Motion, here is the laſt reſort of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Impreſſions, and from this <hi>Central
Point</hi> are derived all the Lines of Action and
Motion, even as all the Arteries and Veins
are from the Natural Heart, which it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes
and diſperſes throughout the Body, and
has its Pulſes in every part. If therefore this
general Head-Spring be not kept pure and
clean, how can the Streams run clear? And
upon this was grounded that ſignal Advice
of the Wiſe Man, <hi>Prov. 4. 23. Keep thy heart
with all diligence, for out of it are the iſſues of
Life.</hi> Parallel to which I find a paſſage in
the Meditations of the Royal
Philoſopher <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Oxford Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 224</note>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>Look within, for within is the Fountain of Good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Further yet, this Intellectual Heart is not
only the Fountain of Action and Motion,
but the moſt active and moſt rapidly moving
thing in the World. This Heart is always
<hi>Beating,</hi> the Pulſes of it never reſt; Thought
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:94628:70"/>
riſes upon Thought, and Deſire ſucceeds De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
The Motion is perpetual, conſtant and
vehement; ſo vehement, that the ſwifteſt
Bodily Motion, no not that of the Starry
Orb is comparable to it; ſo vehement that
it cannot be diſcern'd or number'd, and
comes nearer to a <hi>Reſt</hi> than a Motion, as the
ſwifteſt turnings round of a Globe look like
ſtanding ſtill. Now what a dangerous thing
is ſuch a Motion as this, if not rightly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd?
Of what vaſt heights in goodneſs
is it capable! And to what vaſt heights of
wickedneſs may it riſe, if not well govern'd!
There is therefore great neceſſity that this
<hi>Heart</hi> of Man ſhould be kept with all Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and that it ſhould be kept pure and
undefiled.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly and Laſtly, the Neceſſity of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Heart in order to Holineſs will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
as from the Chriſtian Law, the Nature
of God, and the Nature of Man, ſo alſo from
the <hi>intimate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> that is between the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Human Nature. All things are
full of God, who is therefore call'd in the
Sacred Tongue <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or the <hi>Place.</hi> But
there is nothing ſo intimately united to him
as the Spiritual part of the Creation. God
is the immediate <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Souls,</hi>
who all live, move, and have their being in
him, and are joyn'd to him by a <hi>Central
Touch,</hi> as the great <hi>Plotinus</hi> ſpeaks. The
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:94628:71"/>
Apoſtle ſays, that even our Bodies are the
Temples of the Holy Ghoſt; our Souls then
muſt be at leaſt his Sanctuary, and moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Receſs. But what? Was not God juſt
now ſuppoſed the Place of Spirits, and are
Spirits now made the Place of God? Yes,
and without any Abſurdity. For ſo St. <hi>John</hi>
deſcribes our Union with God, by our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in God, and by God's dwelling in us,
<hi>John</hi> 4. 16. The Union is Double, on God's
part, and on Ours. God dwells in us by his
ſpecial Preſence, by the Spirit of Grace and
Benediction. But we dwell in God Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and Totally. God dwells only in ſome
certain Spirits, ſuch as are of a Diſpoſition
fit to receive and entertain him; thoſe who
(as the Jews love to ſpeak) are worthy to
have the <hi>Shechinah</hi> reſt upon them. But all
Spirits good and bad, however qualified,
dwell in him. For where elſe ſhould they
dwell, ſince he is all, and fills all? Now both
theſe Unions infer the Neceſſity of Purity of
Heart in order to Holineſs.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, if we conſider the Soul of Man
as dwelling in God, what infinite reaſon is
there that that part of him eſpecially ſhould
be kept pure which is eſſentially joyn'd to,
touches and inhabits ſo pure and ſo awful an
Excellence! <hi>Put off thy Shoes from off thy Feet,</hi>
ſaid God to <hi>Moſes, for the place whereon thou
ſtandeſt is holy Ground,</hi> Exod. 3. 5. And if ſo
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:94628:71"/>
much Reverence be due to the Dwelling-place
of God, what Reverence is there then
due when God himſelf is the Dwelling-place!
How dares any Man lodge an impure Soul
in the Boſom of ſo pure a Majeſty! Or how
can he in any meaſure be eſteemed Holy,
tho in all other reſpects never ſo unblamable,
who is polluted in <hi>that</hi> part which is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
united to the Beauty of Holineſs!</p>
                     <p>Then Secondly, if we conſider God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the Soul and Body of Man, there is
great neceſſity of Purity of Heart. And that
upon a double Account:</p>
                     <p>I. Becauſe the Spirit of God which is the
Principle of all Grace and Holineſs will not
enter but into a pure and clean Heart.</p>
                     <p>II. Becauſe no other is worthy of ſo Divine
a Preſence.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, the Holy Spirit will not enter
but into a pure and clean Heart. For this
ſpecial and gracious Preſence of God is not
like his General and Eſſential Preſence, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
and unlimited, but fixt and confined
to certain Laws and depending upon certain
Conditions and Qualifications. And tho the,
firſt Addreſſes, influential Viſits, and diſtant
Overtures of the Holy Spirit prevent all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
diſpoſitions of Man, who (as our
Church expreſſes it in her <hi>10th.</hi> Article) <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94628:72"/>
turn and prepare himſelf by his own natural
ſtrength,</hi> yet to his fix'd Dwelling and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
Abode in us, 'tis neceſſary that there
be an antecedent Preparation of Heart. Which
I conceive to be the reaſon that tho <hi>all</hi> Men
are at ſome time or other Partakers of the
common and ordinary Motions of the Spirit,
(who is ſaid to have ſtriven even with the
old World) <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. yet none but very
<hi>good</hi> Men have the Priviledge to be the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of his Reſidence. And this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I take to be diſtinctly repreſented in thoſe
Words of St. <hi>John, Behold I ſtand at the door
and knock: If any Man hear my voice, and open
the door, I will come in to him and ſup with him,</hi>
Rev. 3. 20. Where by ſtanding at the Door
and knocking, is meant common and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
Grace. And this indeed is uſed to
all, without any previous Qualifications. But
he does not come in and ſup, that is, take up
his Reſidence and be a familiar Gheſt, till his
Voice be heard, and the Door open'd, that
is, till the Man has well attended to, and
complied with thoſe his antecedent Motions
and Suggeſtions, till he has ſwept and made
clean the inner Room of his Heart: So that
Purity of Heart is abſolutely neceſſary, tho
not for the firſt preventing Influences, yet
for the reſidence and in-dwelling of the Holy
Spirit, who tho he viſit thoſe that ſit in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and in the Shadow of Death, yet he
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94628:72"/>
will not <hi>Lodge</hi> but in a pure and bright Soul.</p>
                     <p>Nor Secondly, is any other than ſuch
worthy of ſo Divine a Preſence. Indeed the
pureſt Soul has reaſon to ſay with the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion,
<hi>Lord, I am not worthy that thou ſhouldſt
come under my Roof,</hi> Mat. 8. 8. if we conſider
the diſproportion that is between the Purity
of God, and that of the pureſt Temple we
can prepare for him. For <hi>he putteth no truſt
in his Saints, nor are the Heavens clean in his
ſight,</hi> Job 15. 15. How much more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
then is the impure and polluted Soul of ſo
pure a Preſence! Suppoſe the Spirit of God
<hi>would</hi> enter into a Polluted Spirit, yet what
Soul that has any ſenſe of Decency would
dare to continue any longer ſo, when once
poſſeſs'd by ſo Divine an Inhabitant! <hi>Pſal.</hi>
93. <hi>Holineſs becomes thine Houſe for ever,</hi> ſays
the Pſalmiſt, that is, it is very meet and right,
decent and proportionable, that the place of
the Divine Reſidence ſhould be kept holy
and undefiled. The Divine Preſence is the
greateſt and moſt ſolemn Conſecration of any
place that can be, and wherever he fixes his
Manſion, there the Inſcription ought to be,
<hi>Holineſs to the Lord.</hi> And the reaſon of all
this is by the Pſalmiſt render'd elſewhere,
<hi>For thou art a God that has no pleaſure in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
neither ſhall any evil dwell with thee,</hi> Pſal.
5. 4.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:94628:73"/>
Having thus far ſhewn the Neceſſity of
Purity of Heart in Order to Holineſs, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
this part it remains that we further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
its neceſſity in order to <hi>Happineſs.</hi>
Now this Neceſſity may reſpect either our
Admiſſion into Happineſs, or our Enjoyment
of it when admitted. That Purity of Heart
is neceſſary to our Admiſſion into Happineſs
is already ſufficiently deducible from what
has been premiſed concerning its neceſſity to
Holineſs, whout which we are expreſly told,
<hi>No man ſhall ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. We are
therefore further concern'd only to ſhew that
'tis neceſſary to the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>And here not to feign a long Hypotheſis of
a Sinners being admitted into Heaven, with a
particular Deſcription of his Condition and
Behaviour there, we need only conſider that
the Supreme Good is of a <hi>Relative</hi> Nature,
as well as any other Good, and conſequently
the enjoyment of it muſt neceſſarily require
ſome Qualification in the Faculty, as well as
the enjoyment of any other Good does, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that may render that Good a Good to
that particular Faculty. Otherwiſe tho it may
be <hi>poſſeſs'd,</hi> yet it can never be <hi>enjoy'd.</hi> This
again muſt be ſomething that muſt produce
ſome Likeneſs or Agreeableneſs between the
Faculty and the Good to be enjoy'd. Which
becauſe the Pureſt of all Beings, leaves no
room to doubt but that Purity of Heart muſt
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94628:73"/>
be that Agreeableneſs, without which as a
Man cannot <hi>reſemble,</hi> ſo neither can he <hi>enjoy</hi>
God.</p>
                     <p>We ſee that even in this Life 'tis very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to be in the Company of a Perſon whoſe
Humour is diſagreeable to ours, tho perhaps
in other reſpects of ſufficient Worth and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.
And how then can we imagin that
an ill-diſpoſed Soul ſhould take any Pleaſure
in God, who is to her infinitely more unlike,
and therefore diſagreeable, than one Man can
be ſuppoſed to be to another? For my part,
I rather think that ſhould an impure Soul be
afforded a Manſion in Heaven, ſhe would be
ſo far from being happy in it, that ſhe would
do <hi>Penance</hi> there to all Eternity. For beſides
that a ſenſualized Soul would carry ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
with her thither for which ſhe could
find no ſuitable Objects, which would be a
conſtant Torment; thoſe that ſhe <hi>does</hi> find
there would be ſo diſproportionate, that they
would rather vex and upbraid, than ſatisfie
her Indigence. So that this in ſhort would
be her Caſe, That which ſhe deſires and could
reliſh, that ſhe has not; and that which ſhe
has, that ſhe neither deſires nor can reliſh;
the reſult of which muſt needs be a very
high degree of Miſery and Diſſatisfaction. So
abſolutely neceſſary is Purity of Heart both
to the <hi>Acquiſition</hi> and <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:94628:74"/>
And yet there is ſomething that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
it further yet, and that is the <hi>Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
that attends it, the third and laſt thing
to be conſider'd. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in Heart,
for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> But before we come ſo
far as this, there is a Preſent Bleſſedneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to it in this Life, which I ſhall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touch upon. And here beſides that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Peace of Mind, that Satisfaction of
Conſcience, and Spiritual Joy and Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
which are the common Advantages of
a good and well-order'd Life, there are theſe
three more peculiar Advantages of Purity of
Heart.</p>
                     <list>

                     </list>
                     <p>More <hi>Innocent,</hi> becauſe 'tis ſuppoſed to
put a Bar againſt the very firſt Beginnings
of Sin, and conſequently to be removed at
a greater diſtance from it.</p>
                     <p>More <hi>Eaſie,</hi> becauſe 'tis eaſier to abſtain
from the firſt Beginnings of Sin, than from
a further Progreſs in it after you have once
begun. Nor is there ſo much pains requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to admit, as to eject a Temptation.
Which made an ingenious Perſon ſay, That
the Prohibition of <hi>Concupiſcence</hi> was not ſo
much a new or diſtinct Commandment, as
an Inſtrument of Security for the keeping all

Laſtly, More <hi>Safe,</hi> becauſe more Eaſie;
there being not ſo much danger of yielding
to what a Man can eaſily forbear, as to that
which he muſt abſtain from with pain and
uneaſineſs.</p>
                     <p>But the greateſt Bleſſedneſs of all is the
<hi>Viſion of God.</hi> Which I ſuppoſe may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
beyond that <hi>Beatific</hi> Viſion of him,
which is the Happineſs of Angels and Saints
in Heaven, and may ſignifie ſome peculiar
Advantage belonging to the Pure in Heart
even in this Life, namely, the clearer Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of all <hi>Neceſſary</hi> and <hi>Ideal</hi> Truths
(which may well be call'd ſeeing of God,
they being one and the ſame with the Divine
Eſſence) eſpecially ſuch Ideal Truths as are
of a Moral and Spiritual Nature, to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of which, Purity of Heart is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Preparative. According to that of
the Angel to <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 12. 10. <hi>Many ſhall
be purifi'd and made white, and none of the
Wicked ſhall underſtand, but the Wiſe ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</hi>
But having profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcours'd of this<note n="*" place="margin">Reflect. on the Conduct of Human Life.</note> elſewhere,
I ſhall ſtay no longer upon this
part, but proceed to that other
Viſion of God which is called <hi>Beatific.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here I remark, that this is the only Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to which the expreſs Promiſe of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of God is annex'd. This indeed is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly
contain'd in ſome others, but there
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94628:75"/>
only openly expreſſed. And becauſe 'tis rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to think that our Lord does ſuit his
Rewards to the Natures of the Excellencies
here ſpecifyed, We may well conclude that
he intended ſome peculiar Honour and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
to this holy diſpoſition of Soul, and
to ſignifie that it has a more than ordinary
Title to the Happineſs of the Beatific Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This will include two things,</p>
                     <p>I. That the Pure in Heart ſhall have a
clearer and more inlarged ſight of God.</p>
                     <p>II. That they ſhall take a greater delight
in what they do ſee of him.</p>
                     <p>And Firſt, They ſhall have a clearer and
more enlarged ſight of God. This will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon two Suppoſitions.</p>
                     <p>I. Upon the peculiar Aptneſs of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
for the Viſion of God.</p>
                     <p>II. Upon the Will of God to afford a
greater and clearer manifeſtation of himſelf
to a Soul ſo diſpoſed.</p>
                     <p>That Purity of Heart has a peculiar apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in order to the Viſion of God, we need
not doubt, if we conſider that the only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why we ſee not God, now, is the groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this Tabernacle wherein the Soul is
incaſed. This is that <hi>Glaſs</hi> through which
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94628:75"/>
we now ſee ſo Darkly, and which makes us
do ſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. This is that black
Skreen that parts the <hi>Material</hi> from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible</hi>
World. The more abſtract there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are from the Body, and from the
Bodily Life, the more fit we ſhall be both to
<hi>behold,</hi> and to indure the Rays of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Light. We find that even now the
purer and finer our Blood and Spirits are,
the freer and clearer are our Thoughts. The
more bright and tranſparent this Glaſs is,
the more the Ideal Light will dart in upon
our Souls. And the ſame will hold in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
hereafter. The purer the Soul is,
the purer will all its Faculties and Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be; the leſs it will retain of corporeal
Guſts and Reliſhes, the more recollected
and undivided will be its Powers; for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Thought follows Unity of Deſire; and
the fewer things a Man deſires, the fewer
will be his Thoughts, and conſequently the
more ſtrong and vigorous upon the Object
where they fix. To which we may add,
that the purer the Soul is, the purer will alſo
be her <hi>Reſurrection Body,</hi> which is of great
moment to the Viſion of God, as well as to
other <hi>Spiritual</hi> Operations. For we muſt
then ſee through a Glaſs as well as now;
only the Glaſs will be clearer, according to
the different Purity of the Soul, which even
in this Life gives a particular Brightneſs of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94628:76"/>
Air to the Countenance, and makes the
Face to ſhine with an unimitable Luſtre. Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Heart therefore even upon this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
account has a peculiar aptneſs in order to
the Viſion of God. But to this may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Secondly the <hi>Will</hi> of God to afford a
greater and clearer manifeſtation of himſelf
to a Soul ſo diſpoſed. For 'tis highly ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
to believe, that God who is ſo great a
Lover, will alſo be a liberal Rewarder of
inward Purity; and that he who delights to
dwell in pure Hearts now, will reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a very plentiful meaſure to ſuch here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
So that both from the aptneſs of the
Diſpoſition and from the Will of God we
may conclude, That the Pure in Heart ſhall
have a <hi>larger</hi> ſhare of the Beatific Viſion.</p>
                     <p>Nor ſhall they only ſee more of God, but
Secondly, take a greater Delight in what
they do ſee of him. And this is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Ingredient of their Happineſs: For 'tis
not the meer <hi>having,</hi> but the <hi>delighting</hi> in a
thing that makes a Man happy. And this
is the Condition of Pure Souls. The ſame
Purity which procures them a more inlarged
ſight of God, will alſo make them to delight
in the Viſion of him, ſo that they ſhall <hi>Taſte</hi>
as well as <hi>See</hi> how <hi>good</hi> God is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. For
the purer the Soul is, the liker it is to God
who is Eſſential Purity; and the more it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
God, the more it muſt needs love
and delight in him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:94628:76"/>
Likeneſs is the greateſt indearment of
Love, and the moſt natural Foundation of
Delight and Complacency. We ſee this in
all the Orders of Being, and in all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Life. In the Sympathetic Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Vegetables, in the Voluntary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſortings
of Animals, and in the choſen Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
of Men. But moſt of all may this be
ſeen in God himſelf. What is it but the
moſt perfect Likeneſs and Conformity of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences,
Underſtandings and Wills that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the Sacred Perſons of the myſterious
and adorable Trinity ſo infinitely lovely and
agreeable to each other! This was that
which made the Father ſay of the Son, <hi>Heb.</hi>
1. 3. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well-pleaſed,</hi>
becauſe he ſaw there the <hi>Brightneſs
of his Glory, and the expreſs image of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
And upon this is founded that mutual
Delight which the other Sacred Perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
from each other. That therefore which
makes the Perſons of the Holy Trinity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in one another, muſt needs make the
pure Soul delight in the Holy Trinity. A
pure Soul cannot but delight in a pure God,
and the purer ſhe is, the more ſhe will love
and delight in him. Purity of Heart does even
here <hi>Anticipate,</hi> much more then will it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<hi>increaſe</hi> the Joys of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>It remains therefore, that having this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Hope, we ſtudy to purifie our ſelves
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94628:77"/>
even as God is pure, and ſo endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
and tranſcribe the Divine Perfections
here, that we may contemplate them with
the greater Complacency and Delight here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
To which purpoſe, let us now and
always Pray in the Words of our Holy and
Devout Church,</p>
                     <p>O God, make clean our Hearts within us, And
take not thy Holy Spirit from us. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>THE Words very well become the
Mouth of him that ſpake them, who
was himſelf the greateſt <hi>Peace-maker</hi> in the
World. He made Peace in Heaven by the
Blood of his Croſs, and endeavoured to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
it on Earth. He firſt reconciled God to
Man, and then tried to reconcile Men to one
another. He choſe to be born in the moſt
quiet and peaceful ſtate of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
when <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in token of an Univerſal
Peace had ſhut up the <hi>Myſtical</hi> Gates of <hi>Janus</hi>
his Temple. And when he came into the
World his Proclamation by the Angels was
Peace; and when he was to leave the World,
the ſame was his Legacy, <hi>John 14. Peace I
leave with you, my peace I give unto you.</hi> The
Order of his whole Life was a conſtant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with the Peace of the State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he gave two ſignal Inſtances, in Paying
Tribute when not obliged, and in Forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Reſiſtance of the Officer that ſeized him;
and his laſt Prayer was for the Peace and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:94628:78"/>
Unity of the Church. And now, ſince by
this great Love and Study of Peace he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf to be the Genuine Son of God,
who is ſtyled the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.
33. he might with the better <hi>Decorum</hi> make
the ſame Diſpoſition of Mind the Meaſure
and Argument of <hi>our</hi> Filial Relation to him;
as he does when he tells us, <hi>Bleſſed are the
peace-makers, for they ſhall be called the children
of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By <hi>Peace-makers</hi> here, I ſuppoſe, is meant,
not only thoſe that interpoſe as Moderators,
to compoſe Feuds and Quarrels, (tho that be
the more immediate Senſe of the Word;)
but more generally thoſe that are peaceably
affected, and that ſhew this their Peaceable
Diſpoſition, either by living quietly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſively,
or by endeavouring to maintain
Peace where it is, or to reſtore it where it is
interrupted. The firſt of theſe Degrees of
Peaceableneſs conſiſts in a mere Negative;
the two laſt are of a Poſitive Nature, and
conſequently of a greater Excellence: But
the moſt excellent of all is the laſt, it being,
for the moſt part, not only a <hi>thankleſs,</hi>
but an odious, difficult and hazardous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
to bring <hi>them</hi> nearer together,
whom Anger has ſet at a diſtance. 'Tis like
the Buſineſs of a <hi>Fire-quencher,</hi> who, tho he
may, with plying of Engins, and great a-do,
reſcue the Pile of Building from the devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94628:78"/>
Flames, yet his Eyes will be ſure to ſmart
with the <hi>Smoak.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this Peace, in the not violating, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
or reſtoring of which this Peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-mindedneſs
is concern'd, may be either
private Peace between Man and Man, or
publick Peace between Societies of Men.
Again, Publick Peace is diſtinguiſhable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the general Diſtribution of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Society into Civil and Eccleſiaſtick, that
of the State, and that of the Church. The
former concerns Men, not only as ſubjected
to Government, or as under this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Form of Government; but alſo as
Men, and conſequently all Men: For, even
the State of Nature, antecedently to all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Conventions and Conſtitutions, (as has
been abundantly proved againſt the Author
of the <hi>Leviathan</hi>) is not a State of War, but
of Peace. The latter reſpects only thoſe
who are Members of the Chriſtian Church,
whereof Chriſt Jeſus is the Head, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to that Spiritual Government whereof
he is the Author. The former kind of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace is oppoſed to War and ſeditious
Practices, the latter to Schiſms and Diviſions.</p>
                     <p>The Way being thus far cleared by point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the general Degrees of Peaceableneſs,
and the general Kinds of Peace, we may now
with the leſs Entanglement proceed to fix
the Subject and Order of the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:94628:79"/>
And here I do not intend a <hi>Caſuiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Tract, by entring upon that long <hi>beaten</hi>
Common-place concerning our Obligation to
Peace, and the Meaſures of obſerving it with
reference either to Church or State: For,
beſides that this has been the conſtant Theme
of almoſt every Caſuiſt, and that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to ſay any thing <hi>more</hi> than <hi>All,</hi> or <hi>better</hi>
than <hi>Some</hi> have already ſaid upon it, I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
think that the thing is of it ſelf plain
enough; and that, were it not for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs
of ſome Men, rather than for any
Obſcurity in the Duty, there needed not
have been any other Meaſure given in this
Matter than that <hi>general</hi> one of the Apoſtle,
<hi>If it be poſſible, as much as lies in you, live
peaceably with all men.</hi> For, when 'tis enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
How far we are obliged to Peace in the
State, or Peace in the Church? The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
is plain and ready from hence, That we
are obliged to both as far as is poſſible, and
as much as in us lies; and that nothing leſs
than <hi>Abſolute</hi> and <hi>Evident</hi> Neceſſity can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
either War in the State, or Separation
in the Church. Which one Rule if well
heeded and practiſed, the Condition of the
World would be much more peaceable and
quiet than it is, or is like to be.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead therefore of treating of this Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in a <hi>Caſuiſtical</hi> way, by deſcribing the
Meaſures of our Obligation to Peace, I
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94628:79"/>
ſhall rather chuſe this Order of Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, To ſet forth the general Excellency
of a peaceable Diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To conſider that more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Prerogative of it, in making thoſe that
have it Children of God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, To conclude all with ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon the preſent Diſturbers of the
Peace of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And Firſt, The general Excellency of a
peaceable Diſpoſition may be derived from
theſe two Principles:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, From what it <hi>argues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, From what it <hi>cauſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And Firſt, It argues a well-ordered Frame
and good Habit of Mind; good by natural
Diſpoſition, good by Deliberation and Choice,
and good by Gracious and Divine Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It argues a Soul, not only lightly tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured,
but deeply ſeaſoned, and throughly
imbued with Goodneſs.—<hi>Incoctum ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſo
pectus honeſto.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid
of the peaceable Man, that St. <hi>James</hi> ſays of
him that offends not in his Tongue, that he
is a <hi>perfect Man,</hi> Jam. 3. 2. Not that the due
Government of the Tongue alone does make
a Man perfect; for there is a Body of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
as well as a Body of Sin; and
to make it perfect, the Members muſt have
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:94628:80"/>
both a juſt Number and Size; but that,
conſidering the many Requiſites to ſo great
and excellent a piece of Temperance, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
and ſuppoſes him to be ſo; and, as it
there follows, <hi>able alſo to bridle the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
And ſo here the peaceable Man may be
ſaid to be the perfect Man; not that he is ſo
made by this ſignal Excellence, but that this
Diſpoſition argues him to be ſo, conſidering
what a various Accompliſhment of Soul is
required before a Man can be capable of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
ſo noble a Vertue.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome Degrees in Wickedneſs
that neceſſarily ſuppoſe others: The Man
muſt firſt walk in the Counſel of the Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſtand in the Way of Sinners, before
he can have the <hi>Forehead</hi> to ſit down in the
Chair of the Scornful. And ſo there are
ſome Degrees in Goodneſs, that do alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
ſuppoſe others. For there is a Scale
of Perfection in both, and we can neither
be good nor bad by Strides and Jumps. And
this is ſuch a Degree of Goodneſs as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
many others to have gone before it,
being one of the <hi>Top-ſtones</hi> of the <hi>Spiritual
Building,</hi> and one of the laſt finiſhing Strokes
of the Divine Image of that Chriſt which
is <hi>formed</hi> in us: <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. For the Holy
Spirit of God (as was ſhewn in the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Diſcourſe) requires a conſecrated Abode,
a chaſte Body, and a pure Soul; and will
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94628:80"/>
not enter into us till the former be made a
Temple, and the latter a Sanctuary. And
yet this Excellence is reckoned by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
among the ſpecial <hi>Fruits</hi> of the Spirit,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. and conſequently muſt pre-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
all that Moral Preparation, at leaſt,
that the Entrance of the Holy Spirit does;
and muſt therefore argue a well-order'd
Frame and good Habit of Mind.</p>
                     <p>But this being only a general (tho', to
one that attends the Force of it, ſufficiently
concluſive) Argument, I will more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhew that it does ſo, by conſidering what
particular Qualifications of Soul are required,
in order to a peaceable Diſpoſition; whoſe
Preſence muſt needs <hi>argue</hi> whatever it <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</hi>
Now theſe Requiſites are either Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
or Poſitive: The Negative are,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That the Man be free from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
<hi>Self-Love;</hi> it being impoſſible that
he who prefers his own little private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
before the publick Intereſt, ſhould be
at peace with the Publick when that tender
part comes once to be touched. No, Such
an one will ballance <hi>Self</hi> againſt all the
World, will not care what becomes of the
Publick when it ſtands in Competition with
that; but will embroil all the World in War
and Miſchief if he can, for the leaſt Self-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:94628:81"/>
Secondly, That the Man be free from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,
which tho' the Root of all Evil,
is yet more ſo of Strife and Diſſention, than
of any other. Covetouſneſs and Peace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
dwell long together. 'Tis, indeed, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Litigious Principle,</hi> and one of the greateſt
Makebates and Incendiaries in the World.
'Tis this that fills the Court with Brawls and
Wranglings, and the Field with Blood and
Slaughter. And 'tis a known Obſervation,
That in all Wars, whether juſtly or unjuſtly
undertaken, the greateſt part fight only for
<hi>Plunder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That he be free from <hi>Ambition,</hi>
which is as great an Enemy to Peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
as it is to inward Tranquility. The am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
Man is always advancing his Aim at
ſome higher Mark of Honour; and if Peace
will not ſerve to raiſe him, War ſhall. Take
an Inſtance of this from the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
What a World of Schiſms and Diſturbances
in the Church, and Factions, Seditions, Plots,
Maſſacres and Wars in the State, have been
from time to time occaſioned by the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that See! But there is an higher In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
than this; for it was <hi>Ambition</hi> that
made War in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That he be free from <hi>Envy,</hi>
which, indeed, ſpites every thing that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent;
but is, of all things, the moſt direct
and ſworn Enemy to Peace. 'Twas the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94628:81"/>
of the Devil that firſt diſturbed the Peace
and Order of the World, and ſet the whole
Creation in Battel-Array againſt Man. And
it is the ſame envious Being that ſtill raiſes
and foments all the Enmities and Diſſentions
that divide both the Church and State; and
may therefore be called the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,</hi>
as well as the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Lyes.</hi> Envy is
the greateſt Enmity in the World; and the
envious Man is the moſt univerſal Enemy:
There is no Man but whom, by the very
Principles of his Diſpoſition, he is obliged ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>hate,</hi> or to <hi>deſpiſe.</hi> All his Superiors
and Equals he hates, and deſpiſes all his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors;
which comprize the whole Body of
Mankind. And both Ways is Envy an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to Peace, and very deſtructive to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and States. Whereof there is a ſignal
Inſtance in the Caſe of <hi>Hanno</hi> and <hi>Bomilcar,</hi>
who, through Envy to the growing Glories
of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> denied him a Supply of Forces
to carry on his <hi>Italian</hi> Conqueſts, and ſo
ruin'd <hi>him,</hi> their <hi>Country,</hi> and <hi>themſelves</hi> too.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That he be free from <hi>Revenge,</hi>
which is another great Treſpaſſer againſt
Peace; and without which, the reſt would
not be ſo miſchievous as they are. For this
continues and foments thoſe Enmities to
which the other give Birth, rivets and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens
Animoſities in the Minds of Men, and
by freſh Returns of Provocation, brings in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94628:82"/>
(what has in vain been attempted in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>)
a kind of <hi>Perpetual Motion</hi> in Malice,
and immortalizes Quarrels and Contentions.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly and Laſtly, To comprize all at
once, 'tis requiſite that the peaceable Man
be free from all manner of <hi>Luſts,</hi> and <hi>Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Paſſions,</hi> whether of the Senſual or Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Part; and from all Diſaffection and
Diſorder of Soul; this being the Spring and
firſt Mover to all the Diſcords and Diſorders
that are without: According to that of St.
<hi>James, From whence come wars and fightings
among you? Come they not hence, even of your
luſts, that war in your members?</hi> Where theſe
reign, there can be no Peace; and therefore
the peaceable Man muſt be free from theſe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the <hi>Negative</hi> Qualifications, in
order to a peaceable Diſpoſition. The <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
I need but juſt name, the Proof of them
being virtually contained in the other. They
are therefore, Firſt, Charity, or Univerſal
Love; that ſeeketh not her own, but the
Common Good. Secondly, Generoſity, and
a noble Enlargement of Soul, that ſets a Man
above the little petty Occaſions of Quarrel and
Contention. Thirdly, Humility and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
that makes a Man poſſeſs himſelf and
his Station with Contentedneſs and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.
Fourthly, A candid, ſweet and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign
Temper, that thinks no Evil, but is
well pleaſed in the Proſperity of every Man,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94628:82"/>
and every State or Community. Fifthly, a
mild, meek and forgiving Spirit, that does
not keep up the <hi>Circulation</hi> of Injuries, but
lets the Quarrel fall and die. Sixthly and
Laſtly, A ſerene and well-compoſed Soul,
one that rules well her own <hi>inward Charge,</hi>
having her Paſſions in Subjection with all
Gravity, Peace and Tranquility of Mind.</p>
                     <p>All theſe excellent Qualifications are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to furniſh out a peaceable Diſpoſition,
which will not come into the Soul, as the
Soul will not into the Body, till after it be
duly tempered and prepared for it. Whence
the Propoſition to be made out is ſufficiently
concluded, that it argues a well-ordered
Frame, and good Habit of Mind: Which is
the firſt Ground of its Excellency.</p>
                     <p>The Second is taken from the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what it <hi>cauſes.</hi> The Effects of it are
as great and noble as its Principles and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſites.
Its great and general Effect is
<hi>Happineſs,</hi> upon which no one Vertue has ſo
large an Influence as this. Some Happineſs
it cauſes immediately and directly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
to ſecure whatever Happineſs it does
not cauſe. Some Bleſſings it originally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures,
and preſerves the Poſſeſſion of all. So
that, ſome way or other, all our Bleſſings are
<hi>Bleſſings of Peace,</hi> ſince to this we owe either
the Bleſſings themſelves, or, at leaſt, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Enjoyment of them. And all this it does
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94628:83"/>
by giving Strength, Beauty and Pleaſure to
Society.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Strength.</hi> Peace is as much the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new</hi>
of Society, as Mony is of War; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, Society is ſo far from obtaining any of
its juſt and natural Ends, that 'tis a far leſs
eligible State than that of perfect Solitude:
For, in perfect Solitude Men only want the
mutual Aſſiſtance of one another; but in a
divided and enraged Society, every Man is
in the Condition of <hi>Cain,</hi> in fear leſt the next
that meets him ſhould do him a Miſchief.
'Tis Peace that makes Society a Defence,
and that diſtinguſhes the Congreſſes of Men
from the Herds of Beaſts, or, which is worſe,
from the Confuſion of the Rabble. And as
it ſtrengthens Society <hi>within,</hi> ſo it ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
it without too: Nor would War be any
Security abroad, without Peace at home.
Briefly, 'Tis Union and Coherence that
makes every thing ſtrong, and Peace is the
Cement that holds all faſt together. And
what Society is there that can ſubſiſt without
it, when even a <hi>Kingdom divided againſt it
ſelf,</hi> tho' it be that of the Devil himſelf, <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſtand?</hi> Mark 3. 24.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Beauty.</hi> There is, indeed, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Beauty in Strength; and every thing
that is ſtrong is ſo far beautiful. But, beſides
this, Peace gives a more proper and peculiar
Beauty to Society; the Beauty of Order and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94628:83"/>
Proportion, of Decency and Agreeableneſs.
For, a peaceable Diſpoſition inclines every
Man to mind his own proper Buſineſs, and
to contain himſelf within that Place and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherein God an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> his Superiors have
fixed him, and not to <hi>aſpire</hi> to what is <hi>above</hi>
him, or <hi>invade</hi> what does not <hi>belong</hi> to him.
For, indeed, Peace it ſelf cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this, any more than Society can without
Peace. Where-ever therefore there is Peace,
there will alſo be this Order and Proportion:
The Hand will not affect the Office of the
Eye, nor the Foot the Place of the Head;
but every Member will be contented with,
and intent upon his own Office and Place in
the Body. The Reſult of which muſt needs
be the greateſt Beauty and Harmony.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> This, indeed, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
conſequent to the two former, ſince it
cannot but be a great pleaſure to every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
well-affected Member of Society to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon the Strength and Beauty of the
whole. But, beſides this, a peaceable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
derives a more immediate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Pleaſure upon Society. For, Who can
expreſs the Pleaſure that is in Love and Joy;
Sweetneſs and Dearneſs in Mutual Kindneſs
and Confidences, in Union of Minds, and
Univerſal Friendſhip! They that have had
the Happineſs to taſte of this Pleaſure, know
they cannot expreſs it; which made the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94628:84"/>
beak forth into that abrupt Extaſie, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
how good and how pleaſant it is for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to dwell together in unity!</hi> Pſal. 133.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far ſet forth the general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of a peaceab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> Diſpoſition from what
it <hi>argues,</hi> and from what it <hi>cauſes.</hi> I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
in the Second Place, to conſider that
more particular Prerogative of it, in making
thoſe that have it, Children of God.</p>
                     <p>To be Children of God is, indeed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all good Men; who being begotten
a-new by the immortal Seed of the Word,
do bear God's Image in Holineſs, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
in all things to do their Father's
Will. But there are ſome Diſpoſitions that
give a more peculiar Right to this Title than
others, as they are nearer Reſemblances of
the Divine Excellencies: Among which is
the Diſpoſition now under our Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereby a Man becomes, in a ſpecial
Degree and Manner, like God, and ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
himſelf to be his Child, and may up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Conſideration of that likeneſs fitly be
ſo called. And this is the conſtant uſe of
this Phraſe in Scripture, <hi>Joh. 8. 44. Ye are of
your Father the Devil</hi> (ſays our Lord to the
unbelieving Jews) <hi>and the Luſts of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ye will do.</hi> And ſo again, <hi>Luk. 6. 35. Love
your Enemies, and do good,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ye ſhall be
the Children of the Higheſt, for he is kind to the
unthankful and to the evil.</hi> And ſays the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94628:84"/>
                        <hi>Eph. 5. 1. Be ye followers of God as dear
Children.</hi> They are the Children of God,
who are Followers of God, who purifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as he is pure, and who are perfect as
he is perfect. So that to be the Child of God,
or the Child of the Devil, ſignifies as much
as to carry a particular reſemblance of either.
When therefore 'tis ſaid, that the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
ſhall be call'd the Children of God,
it comes to as much as that they carry a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Character of the Divine Likeneſs,
whereby it may be known to whoſe Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they retain, and that they are the <hi>True</hi> Sons
of God.</p>
                     <p>And ſo indeed they are. For God is the
God of Peace; and the greateſt Peace, that
which paſſes all Underſtanding, is call'd
the <hi>Peace of God.</hi> For God is the greateſt
Lover of Peace, the Author and Giver of
Peace, and the Rewarder of all ſuch as live
in Peace. Indeed under the Jewiſh State,
(which as in other things, ſo in this was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
peculiar, that 'twas a State of <hi>Theocracy</hi>)
God was known by the Name of the <hi>Lord
of Hoſts,</hi> not as expreſſing his true natural
liking and approbation, but only his relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to that particular People, whoſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
King and Leader he was. But now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the State of the Goſpel, which exhibits
a more genuine Idea of God (for the only
begotten Son, which is in the Boſom of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:94628:85"/>
Father, he has declared him) <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 18. he
has changed his Title from the ſtyle of <hi>War</hi>
to the ſtyle of <hi>Peace,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This indeed was ever his <hi>Delight,</hi> but
now 'tis his <hi>Glory,</hi> and inſerted among the
brighteſt Ornaments of his Crown. He is
now manifeſted to be what he ever really
was. God from all Eternity to all Eternity
enjoys a profound Peace within himſelf, and
the Sacred Perſons of the Trinity are not
more one in Eſſence and Nature, than in
Will and Inclination. Their <hi>Moral</hi> is as
great as their <hi>Natural</hi> Unity. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God is a Kingdom of Peace, and
Heaven the Throne of his Majeſty is a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Region. We never read but once that
there was any War there, and thoſe that
cauſed it were quickly baniſh'd thence, <hi>Rev.</hi>
12. 7. To be ſhort, God both enjoys and
eſtabliſhes Peace above, he <hi>maketh Peace in
his High-places,</hi> and he has ſent his Son to
procure it below, to reconcile Men to him,
and to one another, that ſo both Worlds
might conſpire in Unity, and that this Will
of God might be done in Earth as it is in
Heaven. And therefore ſince God has ſhewn
himſelf to be ſo great a Lover of Peace, there
is ſufficient ground for this particular Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
of a peaceable Diſpoſition, that it
makes thoſe that have it Children of God.
From which I paſs in the third and laſt
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:94628:85"/>
place, to conclude all with ſome Reflections
on the preſent Diſturbers of the Peace of
Chriſtendom.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the Obſervation of a Great
Civilian and Moraliſt,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pufendorf</hi> de Officio Hom. &amp; Civ. p. 154.</note> that <hi>Peace
is a ſtate peculiar to Man as he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd
from Brutes.</hi> And ſo
indeed it <hi>ſhould</hi> be. But could we ſuppoſe a
Stranger from one of the other Planetary
Worlds to come and take a View of this
our little Spot, and of the Manners of thoſe
that live upon it, he would not ſure think
<hi>this</hi> of all the things in the World to be the
Character of Man. For he could not but
obſerve, and perhaps it would be one of the
firſt Remarks he would make, that there
are more Wars and Fightings among Men,
than among any other ſort of Creatures, and
more among <hi>Chriſtians</hi> than among any
other ſort of Men. For at the very firſt
opening of the Scene, what a miſerable face
of things would appear both in Church and
State! What Wars and Deſolations in the
one! And what <hi>Debates, Envyings, Wraths,
Strifes, Backbitings, Whiſperings, Swellings</hi> and
<hi>Tumults</hi> in the other! 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 20.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe moſt of the Diſturbances in
the State proceed from thoſe of the Church,
I ſhall confine my Reflections to thoſe that
diſturb the Peace and Order of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church. Where I ſhall Firſt, Point out
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94628:86"/>
who theſe Diſturbers are. And Secondly,
Set ſome ſuch Conſiderations before them,
as may make them ſenſible of their Crime.</p>
                     <p>There are I conceive theſe two general
ways of diſturbing the Peace of the Church;
either by impoſing unlawful or unreaſonable
Terms of Communion, or by refuſing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with ſuch as are Lawful and Reaſonable.
That the firſt of theſe is a Breach of the
Church's Peace there can be no doubt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it introduces a neceſſity of Separation.
And that the latter is ſo is as plain, becauſe
'tis a Separation without any Neceſſity for
for it. Either of theſe is <hi>Schiſm,</hi> whoſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as all agree) conſiſts either in making
a neceſſity of Separation, or in ſeparating
without neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt of theſe will fall heavy upon the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who, (as it has been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
made good againſt her) has brought
in an Abſolute Neceſſity of Separation, by
impoſing ſuch notoriouſly unlawful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
Terms of Communion. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will light upon all thoſe who ſeparate
from ſuch parts of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> where
they may lawfully Communicate. More
eſpecially it will light heavier than ordinary
upon all thoſe <hi>Sectaries</hi> among us, who now
divide from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the
Terms of whoſe Communion, (as has been
undeniably prov'd and maintain'd) are not
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94628:86"/>
only Lawful, but highly reaſonable, and of
an excellent Conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>I need not here, nor is it my Deſign to
ſet my ſelf profeſſedly to make out the Charge
of Schiſm againſt the Diſſenters and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> It has
been done over and over, to the utmoſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Evidence, and the whole Circle of
the Reformed Churches cry out upon them
for their unreaſonable Separation. Only I
would deſire them to try themſelves and
their Cauſe by that one plain Apoſtolical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
before mentioned, and ſee whether they
can juſtifie themſelves by that ſingle Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
It is this, <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as
lies in you, live peaceably with all Men,</hi> Rom.
12. 18. If with all Men, then certainly much
more with Bodies and Societies of Men;
much more with our Governors and Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors;
much more yet with the <hi>Church,</hi> the
moſt Sacred and moſt Eminent of all Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
And if as far as is <hi>poſſible,</hi> then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as far as is <hi>lawful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now I would ask our Diſſenters and
Separatiſts this one Queſtion, and appeal to
their <hi>Conſciences</hi> as well as to their <hi>Practices</hi>
for an Anſwer. Do they live peaceably with
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> as by lawful Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
eſtabliſh'd, as far as is <hi>poſſible,</hi> and as much
as <hi>in them lies?</hi> So far from this, that I <hi>might</hi>
ſay, (were I minded to aggravate things)
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94628:87"/>
that they do the quite contrary, and <hi>Divide</hi>
from us as far as poſſible, and as much as in
them lies, it being very notorious that they
run from us as far they can, meaſure their
Purity and Sanctity by their diſtance from
us; and condemn and difuſe many things
meerly becauſe we approve and uſe them.</p>
                     <p>But I need not take advantage of this, tho
it be too notorious to be denied, as well as
too ſcandalous to be defended. I only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
Do they live peaceably with the
Church as far as is poſſible, and as much as
in them lies? They cannot with any Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
ſay that they do. For if they did, not to
ſay that they might come much nearer to us
than they do, they muſt of neceſſity conform
with us. Since as they were never able to
ſhew any thing unlawful in our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
ſo they now generally allow it to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and accordingly will afford us their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
now and then upon occaſion, as often
as they think fit to do us that Honour. Well
then, if our Communion be lawful, then 'tis
<hi>Poſſible</hi> for them to communicate with us,
and if they do not, then 'tis plain that they do
not live peaceably with us as far as is <hi>Poſſible,</hi>
and as much as in them lies, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by vertue of this plain Apoſtolical Canon
ſtand fully convicted of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and let them
bring themſelves off if they can. I am ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
they will be able to anſwer it but ill
here, and am afraid worſe hereafter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:94628:87"/>
I have now in general pointed out the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbers
of the Chriſtian Peace, and I wiſh I
could now as eaſily make theſe Troublers of
our <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſenſible of this their Crime, as prove
them guilty of it. In order to which not to
inſiſt upon the Heinouſneſs of the Sin of
Schiſm which is as expreſly forbidden in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as Murder or Adultery, and the great
Obligation that lies upon all Chriſtians to
preſerve the Unity and Peace of the Church,
which the Scripture every where ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſſes and inculcates, and which the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the Primitive Chriſtians ſo ſtrongly
recommends; and for which both our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and our Intereſt (eſpecially at this time)
would ſuggeſt to us a Thouſand Arguments;
I ſay not to inſiſt upon theſe and ſuch like
conſiderations (for a combination of which
I refer to an excellent Diſcourſe of Dr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>'s
concerning the Unity of the Church) I
would only deſire the Perſons concern'd to
conſider how much by their Schiſms and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
they prejudice the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
I do not mean as to the Life and Power of
Godlineſs, (tho that be very true, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to be ſeriouſly conſider'd) but as to the
Propagation of the Chriſtian Faith. And that
with reſpect to the three great Enemies of
it, the <hi>Heathen,</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> and the <hi>Mahumetan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, With reſpect to the <hi>Heathen,</hi> to
whom as the Unity and Agreement of the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:94628:88"/>
                        <hi>Firſt</hi> Chriſtians was a great indearment, and
a very prevalent Invitation, ſo as to occaſion
that common Speech among them, <hi>See how
the Chriſtians love one another!</hi> So the Schiſms
and Diviſions of the <hi>Preſent</hi> Chriſtians muſt
needs be a great Scandal and Objection. For
indeed how can any conſidering Heathen be
perſwaded to think ſuch a Broken and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
Religion to be of Divine Revelation,
when that which <hi>he</hi> takes to by the Light of
Nature has more of Unity and Conſent!</p>
                     <p>Secondly, With reſpect to the <hi>Jew,</hi> who
may certainly number the Diſſentions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
among the greateſt Hindrances of his
Converſion. For when in the Prophetick
Writings among other Characters of the
times of the Meſſias he ſhall find this to be
one, and one of the chiefeſt, that it ſhall be
a Reign of Charity and Peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 4. that
<hi>they ſhall beat their Swords into Plowſhares, and
their Spears into Pruning-hooks;</hi> That <hi>Nation
ſhall not lift up Sword againſt Nation, neither
ſhall they learn War any more.</hi> That <hi>The Wolf
ſhall alſo dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard
ſhall lie down with the Kid,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay the Jew
finding this to be one of the Characteriſtics
of the Meſſias his Reign, and obſerving with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
nothing like it in the Chriſtian State, but
rather a perfect <hi>Reverſe</hi> of all this, and not
being able to diſtinguiſh with ſome between
the Deſign and Natural Genius of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:94628:88"/>
Religion, and the accidental Event of
things; or with others, to have recourſe to
the other more glorious Reign of Chriſt in
the Millennial State of the Church, wherein
theſe great and ſtrong Figures ſhall have a
proportionable Accompliſhment, he muſt
needs be ſhrewdly tempted to think that
the time of the promiſed Meſſias is not yet
come, and that the Religion which now
goes for his, is as falſe, as its Profeſſors are
evil and wicked.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly and Laſtly, with reſpect to the
<hi>Mahumetan,</hi> who indeed allows Chriſt to
have been a true Prophet, and his Religion
to have been once a true Religion, only he
ſays it has had its Time as well as that of the
Jews, and is now, as <hi>ſuperannuated,</hi> to give
place to a more perfect Inſtitution, that is, to
<hi>Mahumet</hi>'s, who as he came after Chriſt, ſo
was he to fill up his Defects, and to deliver
the laſt and ſtanding Will of God. And
will he not find pretence to be confirmed in
this his Opinion, and to prefer his Maſter
<hi>Mahumet</hi> as much before Chriſt as we do
Chriſt before <hi>Moſes;</hi> when he ſhall perceive
(as quickly he may) that there is not half
ſo much Unity and Agreement among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
even concerning their very Religion
which is to be the Bond of their Unity, as
there is among <hi>Mahumetans?</hi> Certainly he
will, and tho he periſh in his Error, yet I
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94628:89"/>
fear his Blood will be upon thoſe who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
the occaſion of it. Theſe are great
Scandals and Objections both to the Heathen,
Jew and Mahumetan, and Woe be to them
by whom this great Offence comes. Our
Saviour pronounces a ſevere Woe againſt
them that ſhall offend even one of his little
ones, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 6. and what then ſhall be the
doom of thoſe that ſcandalize ſo great a part
of the World! I heartily wiſh that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Diſturbers and Dividers of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
State and Church would ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                     <p>IT has been ever a great occaſion of Diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to ſome Men that there ſhould
be any ſuch thing as Evil in the World. A
greater yet, that this Evil ſhould often fall
upon good, and ſometimes upon the beſt of
Men. But the greateſt of all is, that not
only good Men ſhould meet with Evil, but
that their very Goodneſs ſhould betray them
into it; that ſuffering ſhould not only be the
Portion of the Righteous, but that Men
ſhould ſuffer for the Sake of their Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
It ſeems hard indeed that a Righteous
Man ſhould ſuffer, but much more that he
ſhould ſuffer for his being Righteous, and
that Affliction ſhould not only be the <hi>Lot,</hi>
but alſo the <hi>Effect</hi> and <hi>Conſequence</hi> of his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
For if Honeſty and Integrity cannot
be a Defence and Priviledge againſt Evil,
yet one would expect it ſhould not be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer
of it, and that if the Man were not
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94628:90"/>
the better for his Virtue, yet at leaſt he
ſhould not be the Worſe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe have been always as perplext <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances</hi>
in the Moral, as any that ariſe in
the Natural Syſtem of the World; a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Trouble and Diſcouragement to the
Good and Pious, and a more frequent Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Triumph to the Atheiſtical and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
who have raiſed from hence their
moſt plauſible Objections both againſt the
<hi>Being</hi> and the <hi>Order</hi> of Divine Providence,
which by theſe greateſt Difficulties of it they
have been incouraged either to <hi>Deny</hi> or to
<hi>Condemn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With the two firſt of theſe Difficulties I
am not at preſent concern'd, nor ſhall I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin
of what force the laſt and greateſt
might be, were this the laſt ſtate of things,
and the <hi>All-concluding Scene</hi> of the World.
Perhaps it might then be ſtrong enough to
conclude what ſome are now ſo weak as to
wiſh and believe. But certainly with the
ſuppoſition of an After-ſtate the Objection is
ſo far from being <hi>Deſperate,</hi> that I can ſee
nothing <hi>Difficult</hi> in it: And I think 'tis here
ſufficiently anſwer'd by that ample Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
promis'd by our Saviour to all thoſe
whoſe faithful adherence to a good Cauſe,
ſhall at any time engage them in Sufferings
and Afflictions. For ſays he, <hi>Bleſſed are they
which are perſecuted for Righteouſneſs ſake, for
theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="171" facs="tcp:94628:90"/>
Which laſt Words (as our Saviour after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
explains them) contain not only a
Promiſe of Heavenly Happineſs in general,
but of a greater Degree and Meaſure of it,
and intitle the Sufferers for Religion, thoſe
who undergo Perſecution for Righteouſneſs
ſake, to a more than ordinary weight of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
So that hence ariſe two Propoſitions to
be diſtinctly conſider'd:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That there are Degrees in that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which ſhall be the Reward of Saints in
Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That one of the Higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of it ſhall be the Reward of thoſe who
ſuffer Perſecution for the ſake of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>That there are Degrees of Glory, tho by
ſome a much conteſted, is yet I think a moſt
certain and unqueſtionable Truth. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of which I ſhall endeavour to eſtabliſh
upon theſe few evident Principles.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I conſider that this muſt needs be
the natural and neceſſary reſult of things. And
here I deſire only it may be granted me, That
there are ſome certain Diſpoſitions of Soul
neceſſary to reliſh and enjoy the Happineſs
of Heaven. This I think is a Suppoſition
that need not be diſputed, ſince even to the
enjoyment of ſenſible good there is requiſite
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94628:91"/>
a proportion of Senſe. The Ear muſt be tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
ſet to reliſh the Charms of Muſick,
and the Palate muſt be rightly diſpoſed to
find any pleaſure in the ſweeteſt Delicacies.
And if theſe groſſer Objects that have a more
natural Affinity with the Organs of Senſe,
and ſtrike hard upon them, will not yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
them without ſome more <hi>particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
Preparation; there is greater reaſon to
think that the Delights of Heaven that are ſo
far above the Level of our Natures, ſo pure
and ſo refined, cannot be taſted but by a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Diſpoſition of Soul. The Neceſſity of
which appears ſo great, that I am apt to
think (as a late worthy Writer
of our Church does) that the
whole Moral Excellency of ſome
Vertues is their Qualification for
the Happineſs of another State,<note place="margin">Practical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Death, p. 76.</note> they being
of no great conſequence to the preſent Order
of this World.</p>
                     <p>Well then, if certain Diſpoſitions of Soul
be required to fit us for the Happineſs of
Heaven, then it follows, that the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
any Soul is for the Glories of Heaven,
the more happy ſhe muſt needs be in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of them. And if ſo, then 'twill be
neceſſary to ſay, either that all Souls are
equally diſpoſed, which would be to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
the Senſe and Experience of the whole
World; or if one be better diſpoſed than
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94628:91"/>
another, then in proportion one will alſo be
more happy than another. The Conſequence
is plain and neceſſary, If there muſt be a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Qualification of Soul to fit a Man for
Happineſs, then certainly the more qualify'd
the more happy. Which has made me often
wonder at the ſelf-inconſiſtency of thoſe who
allowing a virtuous Frame and Temper of
Mind to be a Natural Diſpoſition for Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
do yet deny greater Degrees of Glory
to greater Degrees of Vertue. Indeed if a
Moral Diſpoſition of Soul did not fit us for
Happineſs, the caſe were otherwiſe; but
ſince 'tis allowed to do that, I cannot conceive
but that the Degrees of Happineſs muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Degrees of Vertue. And indeed how
can he that thinks at all, think otherwiſe,
but that a Soul well purged and purified, that
has undergon a long courſe of Mortification,
till ſhe is throughly awakened into the Divine
Life and Likeneſs, and is arrived to <hi>the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> Eph.
4. 13. muſt find more Happineſs in the Viſion
of God, than a Soul juſt pregnant with the
Divine Form, and that carries away with
her only the firſt Rudiments of Spiritual Life!
Certainly that Soul which is moſt like God
will be moſt happy in the fruition of him.
This is no more than what may be concluded
from the meer natural neceſſity of things
without having recourſe to any Poſitive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94628:92"/>
of God about it. But neither may that
be ſuppoſed to be wanting. For,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I conſider that the ſame may
be concluded from the Juſtice and Goodneſs
of God as well as from the Nature of things.
And firſt, from his Juſtice. Not that there
lies an <hi>Abſolute</hi> and <hi>Antecedent</hi> Obligation
upon God to beſtow greater Rewards upon
greater Saints; for if Eternal Life it ſelf be
(as the Apoſtle repreſents it) <hi>the Gift of God,</hi>
Rom. 6. 23. no doubt but the Degrees of it
are ſo too. God cannot become a Debtor to
Man, or to any other Creature but by a free
Act of his own. He may indeed oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to us by a voluntary ingagement, but we
cannot paſs any ſtrict Obligation upon him
by any thing we can do; and to talk of <hi>Merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
in this Senſe is no leſs than Blaſphemy,
and I can hardly believe that any Man that
underſtood himſelf, ever thus held it.</p>
                     <p>But tho God be not abſolutely obliged to
his Creatures, but only upon Suppoſition,
and conſequently cannot be Abſolutely bound
to reward greater Saints with greater Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
yet if we once ſuppoſe him to ingage
himſelf by Promiſe to be a Rewarder of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in general; there will be all the reaſon in
the World to think that by the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
he has alſo <hi>Vertually</hi> obliged himſelf to
crown the greateſt Vertues with the greateſt
Rewards. For ſince the reaſon why he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94628:92"/>
himſelf to be a Rewarder of good
Men was not (as is already precaution'd)
any Abſolute Merit of theirs, but only to
ſhew his great Love of Vertue and Goodneſs,
'tis reaſonable to conclude that by the ſame
Motives, and in purſuance of the ſame End,
he alſo ingaged himſelf to be a more liberal
Rewarder of greater Saints. Since this is as
neceſſary a means to ſhew his Love to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Goodneſs as the other. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tho we ſhould grant (which yet in the
ſequel will appear otherwiſe) that God had
expreſly promiſed only to be a Rewarder of
Vertue in general, yet ſince the End and
Reaſon of this His ingagement was to ſhew
His great Love to Vertue, this would be
warrant enough to conclude, That he had
implicitly and vertually ingaged Himſelf to
have an equal regard to the ſeveral Degrees
of Vertue, and to reward them after their
reſpective Proportions.</p>
                     <p>But to riſe higher yet, tho God cannot be
in <hi>Strict Juſtice</hi> obliged to reward the beſt of
our Services but by an ingagement of his
own, much leſs to reward them with Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Happineſs, yet I think there muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
a kind of <hi>Congruity</hi> or <hi>Becoming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
on God's part ſo to do, even Antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to any Promiſe or Covenant. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
no ſtrict Obligation till after ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
but there may, and I think muſt be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94628:93"/>
a Congurity even before. For tho there be
no Proportion of <hi>Equivalence</hi> between our
beſt Works and the Rewards of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and conſequently no poſſible room for
any ſtrict Merit, yet I cannot but think with
a Perſon of great Judgment and
Moderation,<note place="margin">I e Blane Theſes Theolog. <hi>p.</hi> 590.</note> that there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of <hi>Conveniency;</hi> that is,
as he afterwards explains it, tho there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſtrictly due from God to the Services of
good Men, yet 'tis highly worthy of God to
reward them; upon which account they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
may be ſaid to be worthy, according to
that of the <hi>Apocalyps, They ſhall walk with me in
white, for they are worthy,</hi> Rev. 3. 4.</p>
                     <p>And indeed unleſs we will admit of this
<hi>Congruity,</hi> I do not ſee how to juſtify the
Senſe of that Apoſtolical Maxim, <hi>He that
comes to God muſt believe that he is, and that
he is a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him,</hi>
Heb. 11. 6. 'Tis plain that the Apoſtle here
ſpeaks of the Grounds of Natural Religion,
and what ſhould move and qualify a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Man to make his firſt Addreſſes to God.
This he tells you is to believe the Being and
the Providence of God, that he <hi>is,</hi> and that
he is a <hi>Rewarder.</hi> But now how ſhall a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Man believe that God is a Rewarder?
By any Revelation of his? But that he is not
yet ſuppoſed to admit. He muſt therefore
conclude it by his own natural Reaſon, by
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94628:93"/>
conſidering the Idea and Nature of God, the
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that which may naturally be
known of him, and how becoming it is for
ſo excellent a Being to reward thoſe who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themſelves ſeriouſly and heartily to him.</p>
                     <p>Well then, if it be reaſonable to believe
upon the Stock of natural Principles that God
is a Rewarder, without being aſſured of it
by any Revelation (which is here ſuppoſed
in the Heathen's Caſe) then it follows, that
even antecedently to any Promiſe of God
there is a great Congruity, tho not a ſtrict
Obligation that he ſhould be a Rewarder. For
otherwiſe what ground could the Heathen
Man have ſo to Conclude or Believe? This
Congruity therefore muſt of neceſſity be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
however apt ſome may be to ſtartle
at it, when the Word <hi>Merit</hi> is put before it.
This is <hi>Prejudice,</hi> but the thing it ſelf as I
have here ſtated and explained it, is both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
and neceſſary to be granted. And if
there be ſuch a Congruity that God ſhould be
a Rewarder in general, then by the ſame
Proportion it follows that he ſhould diſpenſe
his Rewards according to the Degrees of
Vertue. There being certainly at leaſt as
much Congruity in this as in the other.</p>
                     <p>And beſides this, there is no reaſon to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
but that the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God which is
in it ſelf infinite, and which is already ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to exert it ſelf ſo liberally as to reward
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94628:94"/>
the little and defective Services of a ſhort
Life with Eternal Glories, will alſo be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with it ſelf, as to reward thoſe moſt,
who have preſſed forward to the higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Sanctity. And were it not for this,
I do not ſee what incouragement there is for
Men to <hi>Excel</hi> in Vertue, which yet the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God obliges us to ſuppoſe. For what
ſhould move a Man to be eminently good,
conſidering how difficult it is to be ſo, and
how little recompens'd in this World, if it
were not in order to a greater Reward here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after?</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid, that the leaſt Degree of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is a ſufficient incouragement for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Degree of Vertue; I grant it is ſo, were
that greateſt Degree of Vertue the neceſſary
Condition of it, without which the leaſt Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
could not be obtain'd. But ſince leſs will
ſuffice for that (as muſt be admitted, unleſs
you will ſay that all glorified Saints are
equally good and vertuous) I do not ſee
how there can be ſufficient Incouragement
for higher Attainments, but only upon the
Suppoſition of greateſt Rewards. Which
therefore from the Goodneſs as well as Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of God there is good Reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly and laſtly, From Principles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
I appeal to Holy Scripture, which I
think will be found to ſpeak as fully and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94628:94"/>
plainly to this purpoſe as may reaſonably be
deſired. For there we find that <hi>God will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to every man according to his deeds,</hi> Rom.
2. 6. And again, that <hi>every one ſhall receive
the things done in his Body, according to that
he hath done, whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 Cor.
5. 10. And leſt this ſhould be referr'd to the
general Diſtribution of Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
more expreſly it is ſaid, that <hi>he that
ſows ſparingly ſhall reap alſo ſparingly,</hi> and that
<hi>he that ſows bountifully ſhall reap alſo bountifully,</hi>
2 Cor. 9. 6. The ſame again is expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
under the Parable of the <hi>Talents</hi>
committed to the Management of Servants,
who were ſeverally rewarded according to
their ſeveral Improvements, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. And
tho Parables are not allowed to conclude
<hi>throughout,</hi> yet certainly as to the thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
and purpoſely intended by them they
are as concluſive as any other Forms of
Speech, which in this Parable muſt be the
different Diſpenſation of Rewards hereafter,
or nothing. Again, the Scripture mentions
different Seats of Glory, <hi>Joh. 14. 2. In my
Father</hi>'s houſe are many <hi>Manſions,</hi> ſays our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
that is, Manſions of diſtinct Ranks
and Orders; For 'twould have been but a
ſmall piece of News for our Saviour to have
told his Diſciples, that in Heaven there were
a great many Manſions in number. Nor
would this be ſo ſuitable to the Introduction
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94628:95"/>
of his Diſcourſe, <hi>Let not your Hearts be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again we read of particular Rewards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to Men of particular Characters, as
of a <hi>Prophet's Reward,</hi> and a <hi>Righteous Man's
Reward. He that receives a Prophet in the
name of a Prophet, ſhall receive a Prophet's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
ſays our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 41. Why a
Prophet's Reward, if there be not ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Reward aſſign'd to a Prophet? And
again, 'tis plainly intimated that every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and every Act of Vertue ſhall have its
proper Recompence, where 'tis ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi>
10. 42. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall give to drink unto one
of theſe little one a Cup of cold Water only in the
Name of a Diſciple, ſhall in no wiſe loſe his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
To which purpoſe there is alſo a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
expreſs place in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> Prov. 19.
17. <hi>He that hath pity on the poor, lendeth unto
the Lord; and look what he layeth out it ſhall be
paid him again.</hi> Where there is a Reward
promiſed not only to Charity in general, but
to every Degree of it. And if every Degree
of Vertue ſhall be particularly rewarded, it
evidently follows that the greater our Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
are, the more abundant ſhall be our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
otherwiſe ſome Degrees of Vertue
would go unrewarded, contrary to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                     <p>To this it may added, that a greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Bleſſedneſs is every where attributed
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94628:95"/>
to Patriarchs, Prophets and Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
when their Glorification is expreſſed by their
<hi>Sitting down</hi> in the Kingdom of God, and that
of other Saints, by their ſitting down with
them in alluſion to the Eaſtern manner of
Feaſting. This Priviledge of a more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Seat is particularly aſſign'd to <hi>Abraham,
Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> by our Saviour, when he
tells us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 11. that <hi>Many ſhall come from
the Eaſt and the Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with</hi>
Abraham, Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the Kingdom of
Heaven.</hi> And ſo again to the Apoſtles, <hi>Mat.</hi>
19. 28. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that ye which
have followed me in the regeneration, when the
Son of Man ſhall ſit in the Throne of his Glory,
ye alſo ſhall ſit upon Twelve Thrones.</hi> It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied but that this is meant of the
Apoſtles only, and not of his Diſciples at
large, becauſe of the Twelve Thrones. And
why ſhould Twelve of them only be ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if they were not to be Thrones of an higher
Order? Or what <hi>Extraordinary</hi> would our
Saviour have promiſed to his Diſciples? And
this is further confirmed by St. <hi>John,</hi> who
in the Deſcription of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
makes the Twelve Apoſtles the Foundations
of the City. <hi>And the Wall of the City</hi> (ſays
he) <hi>had twelve Foundations, and in them the
Names of the twelve Apoſtles of the Lamb,</hi> Rev.
21. 14. A place exactly parallel to that of the
Twelve Thrones.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="182" facs="tcp:94628:96"/>
To diſpatch all in a Word, the Condition
of Saints in Glory is expreſſed in Scripture
by their being <hi>made like unto the Angels;</hi> Mat.
22. 30. and 'tis of it ſelf reaſonable to think
that the ſame General Order and Proportion
ſhall be obſerv'd in both theſe Sons of God,
<hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men.</hi> But now 'tis moſt certain
that the Angels have their different Orders
and Hierarchies, being diſtinguiſh'd into
Thrones and Dominions, Principalities and
Powers, and into Angels and Arch-Angels,
and that ſome of them ſit nearer to the
Throne of God than others. Whereupon
the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> call <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel,
<hi>The Prince of Faces,</hi> or the Prince of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
being (as they ſay) ſo near to the
King of Heaven, as to be admitted to ſit
down by him, and regiſter the good Actions
of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> And ſays the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi>
of himſelf, <hi>I am</hi> Gabriel <hi>that ſtand in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God,</hi> Luk. 1 19. He diſtinguiſhes
himſelf as much by his <hi>Station</hi> as by his
<hi>Name.</hi> And the Viſion of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> repreſents
one of the Angelic Orders covering their
Faces with their Wings, which ſuppoſes them
to be nearer than Ordinary to the Preſence
of God, ſo as not to be able to abide the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it, without the help of a <hi>Veil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Since therefore there is ſuch a Variety in
the Angelical Stations, and our future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is generally repreſented by theirs, this
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94628:96"/>
alone were enough to put us upon thinking
that our Glorification muſt admit of the like
gradual Diverſity. And 'tis no more than
what natural Order and Decency ſeems to
require, that the Members of Chriſt's My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Body ſhould retain the ſame Diverſity
in the other World that St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſcribes to
them in this, that there ſhould ſtill be an <hi>Eye</hi>
and an <hi>Hand,</hi> an <hi>Head</hi> and a <hi>Foot,</hi> more
Honourable and leſs Honourable Parts: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. Whereof the Natural Heaven exhibits a
very convenient Emblem, in which one Star
differs from another Star in Glory. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, tho there were no plain Proof to be
had for this, yet there is ſuch an obvious
Congruity in the thing as would <hi>convince</hi>
where it could not <hi>ſilence.</hi> And I believe
there is no Man, tho never ſo forward to
raiſe Objections againſt what has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for, and to equalize the Glories of
Heaven (for the other World has its <hi>Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
as well as this) that could yet obtain
Leave of his own Modeſty to expect as
bright a Crown as the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> or St.
<hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus far aſſerted the different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Glory, which I have the longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
upon, becauſe 'tis a very <hi>practical</hi> as
well as <hi>notional</hi> Theory, being of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
to the encouragement of Heroick
Goodneſs, I come now to conſider the ſecond
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94628:97"/>
thing propoſed, that one of the Higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Glory ſhall be the Reward of thoſe
who ſuffer Perſecution for the ſake of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
that is, of <hi>Martyrs.</hi> And here for the
Eviction of this, having already ſhewn that
there are Degrees of Glory in proportion to
the Degrees of Vertue, I think 'twill ſuffice
to ſhew that Martyrdom is one of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Degrees of Vertue. For the Argument
reduced to Form will ſtand thus:</p>
                     <p>An higher Degree of Vertue ſhall have an
higher Degree of Glory.</p>
                     <p>But Martyrdom is an higher Degree of
Vertue:</p>
                     <p>Therefore Martyrdom ſhall have an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Degree of Glory.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Propoſition is what we have been
proving hitherto. To infer the Concluſion
therefore there needs only a Proof of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
Here therefore my Buſineſs ſhall be
to give a ſhort repreſentation of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of <hi>Martyrdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Honour of Martyrdom was ſo great
in the Primitive Church, that even the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs
of it, which depretiates every thing
elſe, could not diminiſh from its Veneration.
It was then thought of ſo great Excellence,
as to ſupply the room of Baptiſm, and the
new Convert, whoſe early and ſudden exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
prevented his ſolemn Admiſſion into
the Chriſtian Church, was yet eſteemed a
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94628:97"/>
very good Member of Chriſt's Myſtical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and number'd with his beſt Saints in
Glory everlaſting. The ſame Honour to
Martyrs made them chuſe their Tombs for
the places of their Devotion;<note place="margin">St. <hi>Jerom</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi> as I think Chap. 4.</note> and
God himſelf was pleaſed to ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
his ſpecial regard to theſe his
Saints, and to ſhew how preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
their Death was in his ſight,
by making the places of their Reſt the Stage
of his Miracles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nor is there any thing in all this more
ſtrange and extraordinary, than the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the Vertue it ſelf which was thus
honoured. A general repreſentation of which
is thus given by the Pen of a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
Writer of the Roman
Church.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Monſieur <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault</hi> Chriſtian Man. <hi>p.</hi> 336.</note> 
                        <hi>A Church which, by
the way, has made more Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
and has fewer than any in the World.
But ſhe has dealt long enough in Blood, to
be able to form an Idea of Martyrdom from
the Martyrs which ſhe has made.</hi> We ſee
<hi>(ſays one of her Sons)</hi> nothing in the Church
more noble than Martyrdom. 'Tis the higheſt
form of Vertue, the laſt Expreſſion of Charity;
and when a Man has ſhed his Blood and parted
with his Life for Jeſus Chriſt, there is not any
inſtance that can further be expected from his
Love. Juſtly therefore may we acknowledge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more Auguſt in Religion than Martyrs.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94628:98"/>
They are the Heroes of Chriſtianity, the gallant
Men of this State, the Nobleſt Parts of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Body. There is no greatneſs that gives
not way to their Dignity; whatever we admire
is below their worth, and according to the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of one of the wiſeſt Fathers of the Church (<hi>he
means St.</hi> Cyprian) 'tis more to be a Martyr
than to be an Apoſtle. Neither hath any thing
been ever more Honour'd in the World. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
has wrought an Hundred Miracles to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Innocence, wild Beaſts have reſpected
them, the Flames have ſpared their Garments,
Tyrants have admired them, and many times
their Executioners have become their Diſciples,
in ſo much that theſe renowned Champions had
great reaſon to be afraid of Vain-glory, at the
ſame time that God deliver'd them from Sorrow.
<hi>The Deſcription is handſom and elegant,
but what</hi> they Deſcribe, <hi>they have left to</hi> our
Church <hi>to</hi> Practiſe.</p>
                     <p>But more particularly and diſtinctly, to
take the juſt <hi>Height</hi> of the Excellency of
Martyrdom, we muſt firſt lay down a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
whereby the Excellency of any Vertue
is to be eſtimated. Now the Excellency of
any Vertue may be meaſured either from
the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of the Object will'd, or from the
Degree of <hi>willing</hi> it. And two Perſons that
are equally Vertuous with reſpect to the
good that is will'd, may yet be very une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
ſo with reſpect to the Degree of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94628:98"/>
becauſe one may will the ſame Good,
and the ſame degree of Good more intenſely
and affectionately than the other. Thus for
inſtance, <hi>Virginity</hi> may be ſaid to be more
excellent than a Conjugal Life, and that
though you do ſuppoſe the States themſelves
to be equally Pure, becauſe 'tis harder to
preſerve Virginal than Conjugal Chaſtity:
So that tho the Degrees of Purity be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſame in both States; yet becauſe they
are more ſtrongly will'd in the one than in
the other, the Virgin may be ſaid to be more
pure than the Conjugated Perſon; not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
as a Lover of greater Purity, but as a
ſtronger and more pertinacious Lover of the
<hi>ſame,</hi> which he adheres to under more diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
Circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>And this I take to be the Caſe of <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
whoſe general Excellency above other
Vertues conſiſts in the Degree of Inclination
or Adheſion to good, which in the Martyr
is ſuppoſed to be ſo ſtrong as to determine
him rather to ſuffer Death, and the utmoſt
Extremity of it, than to tranſgreſs what he
knows to be his Duty. And indeed if we
conſider how ſweet Life is, and how natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
averſe we are to Death even in the moſt
eaſy, much more under the moſt terrifying
Circumſtances, it muſt needs be a very
ſtrong and peremptory adheſion to Vertue
that ſhall ingage a Man to quit his Life ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than his Innocence, and Dye rather than
offend.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:94628:99"/>
But to be more particular yet. To recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the excellency of Martyrdom there is
a Concurrence of the greateſt Vertues. The
moſt eminent of which (for 'twere endleſs
to reckon up all) are the greateſt <hi>Faith,</hi> the
greateſt <hi>Love,</hi> and the greateſt <hi>Courage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, The greateſt <hi>Faith.</hi> There is indeed
no Faith like the Faith of a Martyr. This
is that Faith which overcomes the World,
and all that is terrible in it; That Faith to
which all things are poſſible and nothing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
and that removes <hi>Fear,</hi> which is more
than to remove <hi>Mountains.</hi> This is that
Faith which is more eſpecially the Subſtance
of things hoped for, and the Argument or
Demonſtration of things not ſeen. This no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Definition of Faith is never ſo fully veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
as in the Faith of a Martyr. This is
that Faith that turns the End of the <hi>Perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi>
and ſhortens the interval of Time, and
makes the future World preſent, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
Heaven open, and the Son of Man
ſtanding on the Right Hand of God ready to
defend, and receive, and reward thoſe that
will be content to indure the Croſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
both the Shame and the Pain of it for
his ſake. And all this with ſuch certainty
and fulneſs of Perſwaſion, that 'tis ready to
change its Nature, through too much Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and to ceaſe to be any longer Faith,
and commence Science or Revelation. For
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94628:99"/>
indeed nothing leſs than this, than ſuch a full
down-bearing Perſwaſion can well inable a
Man to drink off this bitter Cup, and to be
<hi>Baptized</hi> at this <hi>Bloody Font.</hi> It muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be a ſtrange Degree of Affiance and
Confidence which that Man has in God, who
can reſign up all that is good and pleaſant,
and ſubmit himſelf to all that is evil and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
in this World, and meet Death with all
its Natural and Artificial Terrors, and truſt
God for his Reward in another Life. What
a generous, victorious Faith is this! And
what a noble Idea muſt ſuch a Perſon have
of God! 'The Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> is highly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
in Scripture for his readineſs to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
up his Son at the Command of God. And
no doubt 'twas a very rare and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Faith that could reconcile him to ſuch an
unnatural undertaking. But certainly the
Faith of a Martyr is very much beyond this,
as much as 'tis an higher act of Reliance to
truſt God with ones own Soul, and for ones
Eternal Happineſs, than for a Poſterity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
a promiſed Land.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The greateſt <hi>Love.</hi> There is
indeed no Love like the Love of a Martyr.
This is that Love which is properly ſtronger
than Death, and which is ſo perfect as to
caſt out or overcome all Fear. This is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Love truly <hi>Seraphick,</hi> and which
comes the neareſt of any to the Love of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94628:100"/>
and beatify'd Spirits. If there be any
ſuch thing as Seraphick Love in the World,
this is it. Not only becauſe 'tis bright and
flaming, noble and generous, but becauſe 'tis
a Love that gets above all the Bodily Paſſions,
ſilences all the motions of the lower Life, and
makes the Man act as if he were all Soul and
Mind. More particularly, Martyrdom is the
greateſt Love of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and the greateſt Love
of <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Martyrdom is the greateſt Love of
<hi>Vertue,</hi> becauſe that is valued at an higher
rate than Life it ſelf, which the Martyr will
rather loſe than Sin. Our Saviour makes it
the greateſt Inſtance and Argument of
Friendſhip, for a Man to lay down his Life
for his Friend. And ſo doubtleſs it is. For
'tis then plain that the Man ſets a greater
value upon his Friend, than he does upon
Life. And the like may be ſaid of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
that he ſets a higher value upon Vertue,
than he does upon Life, which yet is ſo dear
that (as one obſerves, who for our ſafety
too well underſtands the ſecret Springs and
Inclinations of Human Nature) <hi>all that a
man has will he give for it,</hi> Job. 2. 4. And yet
this very Life for which a Man will give all
things, is by the Martyr given as a Sacrifice
to his Innocence.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Martyrdom is the greateſt Love
of <hi>God,</hi> becauſe the Martyr ſets ſo high a
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94628:100"/>
Price upon him, that he will chuſe rather to
die than forfeit the enjoyment of his Favour
and Bleſſedneſs, and may truly ſay with the
Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 63. 4. Thy loving kindneſs is
better than Life.</hi> 'Tis an eaſie thing for a Man
in a warm guſty fit of Devotion, when the
Evil day is far off, and no probable danger
of any competition between his Religion and
his Life, to ſay that he ſets a greater Value
upon the loving Kindneſs of God than upon
Life. You know who did ſo. <hi>Tho I ſhould
die with thee, yet I will not deny thee,</hi> that is,
(to reduce the Words to a more Logical
Order) I would rather die than deny thee.
This is eaſily ſaid, but not ſo eaſily done, as
the Event too ſadly ſhew'd. But he that
ſays he values the loving Kindneſs of God
more than Life, and dies rather than forfeit
it, may be believ'd. For what greater Love
can there be than this, or what higher In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
or Tryal of it? The greateſt Love of
God was to die for Man. God could not
ſignalize his Love to Man by any higher in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
than by dying for him; and the
greateſt Love of Man is to die for God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The greateſt <hi>Courage.</hi> For there
is alſo no Courage like the Courage of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.
He fears no Evil but only Sin and
Damnation, which are juſt and reaſonable
Objects of Fear, and will undergo any other
Evils to avoid theſe, which is the trueſt and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94628:101"/>
the greateſt Courage. For where is there
any like it? I would not have the Man of
Honour or Dueliſt, of all the Pretenders to
Courage in the World, offer at a Competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
here. For 'tis moſt certain that he abuſes the
notion of Courage as well as that of Honour.
His Courage is to dare to ſin and be damn'd,
that he may avoid the Reproach of Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,
that is, not to fear and avoid what
with all poſſible concern he ſhould, and to
fear and avoid what he ſhould not. And if
this be <hi>Courage,</hi> I muſt then confeſs that I
do not know what is <hi>Cowardize.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But neither may the <hi>Military</hi> Man be a
Competitor here. 'Tis I confeſs great and
brave for a Man in a juſt and laudable Cauſe,
for the Defence of his Prince and Country,
to fall a Sacrifice at the Head of an Army.
And the <hi>Herald</hi>'s Office ſuppoſes as much.
But there are alſo ſome Allays that qualifie
the Glory even of this Action. For the Man
is ſuppoſed to be ingaged with Multitudes
and Numbers, which <hi>incourage</hi> as well as <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend;</hi>
and to fight in a Heat, when his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are raiſed, and his Blood runs high, ſo
as ſcarce to be able to feel a Shot or a Stab
that ſhall be given him, and to want Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of Retreat, and to be kept from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
upon his Danger by Noiſe, Tumult
and Confuſion, and to have the Spur of
Emulation, and the Incentive of Anger,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:94628:101"/>
ſometimes of Hatred and Revenge; and
which is more than all the reſt, the Hopes of a
ſafe come off at laſt. Believe me, this goes a
great way, and I queſtion whether among
thoſe that venture themſelves in War, one of
ten thouſand would do ſo, if he knew before-hand
that he ſhould certainly die in the Field.
But now to have a Man go alone and in cold
Blood to the <hi>Stake,</hi> or to the <hi>Scaffold;</hi> When in
every Period of his Advance 'tis ſtill in his
Power by compliance to recede from his
dreadful undertaking, and there calmly and
deliberately ſubmit himſelf to <hi>certain</hi> Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and <hi>feel himſelf die</hi> with all his Thoughts,
Reflections and Paſſions about him; this is
Courage indeed, and ſuch a Noble Spectacle
as might well deſerve to be a <hi>Theatre</hi> to Angels
and Men, yea even to God himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are ſome of thoſe great things that
illuſtrate the excellency of Martyrdom, and
ſhew it to be one of the higheſt Degrees of
Vertue, and conſequently that it is intitled
to an higher Degree of Glory: Which the
Scripture alſo expreſly makes to be the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Martyrs, who are ſaid to <hi>indure tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and not to accept of deliverance, that they
might obtain a better Reſurrection,</hi> Heb. 11.
A Better Reſurrection, that is, a Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to a Better State of Happineſs, that being
the only Meaſure whereby one Reſurrection
may be ſaid to be Better than another. And
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:94628:102"/>
ſays the Angel to St. <hi>John</hi> concerning thoſe
who are clothed with white Robes, and had
Palms in their Hands, <hi>Rev. 7. 14. Theſe are
they which came out of great Tribulation, and
have waſh'd their Robes, and made them white
in the Blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they
before the Throne of God, and ſerve him day and
night in his Temple. And he that ſitteth on the
Throne ſhall dwell among them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now ſince there is a brighter Crown
of Glory prepared for Martyrs, and thoſe
that ſuffer Perſecution for the ſake of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
all that further remains is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
from the Premiſes theſe two Practical
Inferences.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That we entertain no hard Thoughts
of the Juſtice or Goodneſs of God for ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo many ſevere Perſecutions in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Church, ſome whereof were violent, as
under the Roman Emperors; ſome Fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
by Hereticks, as <hi>Arius, Neſtorius,</hi> &amp;c.
And ſome of a mixt nature, conſiſting both
of Fraud and Violence, when both Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Spiritual Power did combine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(as now in the Papal See) againſt the
Lord and his Chriſt. I ſay we ſhould learn
from hence not to cenſure the ways of God
for this, nor to <hi>charge him fooliſhly,</hi> ſince there
is ſo plentiful a Reward laid up for thoſe that
ſuffer in the Cauſe of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="195" facs="tcp:94628:102"/>
Secondly, That we do fortifie our ſelves
with the Conſideration of this Beatitude, That
if God ſhould ever honour us ſo far as to call
us to the Trial of the Croſs, we may be ſo
true to God, to Religion, and to our own
Souls, as to ſuffer couragiouſly and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ever looking up to that glorious <hi>Crown,</hi>
that <hi>white Robe,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Triumphant Palms</hi>
which diſtinguiſh the Noble Army of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
who eternally ſing Hymns and Praiſe
to God for the Bleſſing of thoſe Croſſes,
which now ſpring up into Crowns, and in
bearing of which they find ſo great Reward.</p>
                     <closer>Glory be to God on High.</closer>

                  <div type="conclusion">

                     <head>The Concluſion of the Whole, in a Diſcourſe
concerning the Beatitudes in general.</head>
                     <p>HAving hitherto Diſcourſed upon every
Beatitude particularly by it ſelf, I think
it may not be improper for the further Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of this Work, to conclude all
with a Diſcourſe concerning the Beatitudes
in General. Where there are three Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Enquiries that ſeem to demand Satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, Concerning the Manner and
Way of this Divine Sermon, Why our Lord
choſe to deliver his Laws and Precepts by
the way of <hi>Bleſſing?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second is, Concerning the Number
of the Beatitudes.</p>
                     <p>The Third is, Concerning their Order and
Method.</p>
                     <p>For Satisfaction to the firſt Enquiry, I
conſider firſt, That Chriſt who came into
the World upon an <hi>Errand</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> the
greateſt Love that an infinitely good God
could expreſs to a Creature, and who no
doubt had alſo a Soul well tuned, and a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
well temper'd, and both ſet to the ſofteſt
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:94628:103"/>
Key of Harmony and Sweetneſs, was willing
to deliver his Laws in the moſt <hi>indearing</hi> and
charming manner that could poſſibly be,
that he might the better recommend both
<hi>Himſelf</hi> and his <hi>Doctrin</hi> to the good Will of
his Auditors, and reconcile them thro the
Love of the <hi>Former,</hi> to the Obedience of the
<hi>Latter.</hi> Which is a very laudable affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Popularity,</hi> firſt to engage Men's Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to our <hi>Perſons,</hi> that we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
win them over to the Acceptance and
Entertainment of our <hi>Doctrins.</hi> This indeed
ought to be the Care and Endeavour of all
Preachers; but there was this more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
reaſon for it in our Lord, becauſe the Love
of <hi>his</hi> Perſon was not only an <hi>Indearment</hi> of
Obedience, but alſo a very conſiderable <hi>part</hi>
and inſtance of it. He therefore inſtead of
uſing an <hi>Imperative</hi> Style, by down-right
commanding ſuch and ſuch things, choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a more gentle and condeſcending way
to inſinuate what was <hi>his</hi> Will, and <hi>our</hi> Duty,
by pronouncing them <hi>Bleſſed</hi> that do ſo and
ſo.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I conſider that our Lord Chriſt
being to act the <hi>Counter-part</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to
relax the rigour of his Law, by being the
Author of a milder Diſpenſation, thought
fit to give an early and a ſolemn Specimen
of his greater Mildneſs, by varying the Style
of his Legiſlation from that uſed by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:94628:104"/>
And therefore whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> deliver'd his
Law after an <hi>Imperatorial</hi> way, by ſaying,
<hi>Thou ſhalt not</hi> do this, and <hi>Thou ſhalt not</hi> do
that: Our Good Lord choſe rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
his Law more tenderly and <hi>Humanly,</hi>
by declaring the <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> of thoſe that
ſhould obſerve it. And the rather becauſe
<hi>Moſes</hi> had armed and immured his Law with
<hi>Curſes</hi> and <hi>Maledictions.</hi> Firſt in General,
<hi>Curſed is every one that continues not in all
things which are written in the Book of the Law
to do them.</hi> Secondly, more particularly, by
annexing a Curſe to particular Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as in that famous Commination in the
27 of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> to evey Clauſe of which
the People were to ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to ſhew of what a different <hi>Spirit</hi> the
Chriſtian Inſtitution was from that of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
our Lord choſe to adminiſter his Law in a
form of <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> in Oppoſition to <hi>Moſes</hi> his
<hi>Curſings;</hi> thereby verifying thoſe farewel
words of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon to the Jews, in
a larger ſenſe than he intended them, <hi>God
having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs
you, in turning away every one of you from his
Iniquities,</hi> Act. 3. 26.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I conſider that our Saviour was
to deliver a <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> a Law that requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Love both as the <hi>Matter</hi> and as the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
of Obedience. Love was both the <hi>thing</hi>
to be done, and the <hi>Motive</hi> of doing it. The
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:94628:104"/>
Son of God was to be the great Prophet of
Love. 'Twas reſerved for him, as being
the <hi>Expreſs Image</hi> of him who is Love it ſelf,
and therefore the only Maſter fit to teach it.
This was the <hi>Fire</hi> which he came to <hi>kindle
upon Earth,</hi> Luk. 12. 49. the moſt ardent and
affectionate Love towards God and towards
Men. This was to be the Subſtance and
Accompliſhment of his Law, and the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
Badge of thoſe that profeſs'd Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to it. <hi>By this ſhall all Men know that ye
are my Diſciples,</hi> &amp;c. But now 'twould not
have been agreeable for a Law of Love to
begin its recommendation from ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as ſhould work upon the more <hi>Servile</hi>
part of Man. <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed deliver'd his
Law with all the Circumſtances and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Fear,</hi> and the Nature of his Law
required ſuch an Addreſs, but 'twas fit that
a Law of Love ſhould come recommended
to the World by Motives of <hi>Love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly and Laſtly, It may be further
conſidered that this ſolemn Inſtruction of our
Lord upon the Mount conſiſted of Precepts.
So very ſublime and elevated, and withal
ſo ſtrange and unuſual, as having had not
Credit, if Reception, in the World before,
that 'twas but neceſſary for the Prevention
of Prejudice to ſet a Beatitude in the <hi>Front</hi> of
every Duty, and to bribe the Paſſions of the
Hearers with a forward Anticipation of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:94628:105"/>
leſt Men ſhould ſay of the <hi>Commands</hi>
of Chriſt, as the Prophet brings them in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> Iſa. 53. 2. that <hi>there is no
Form nor Comelineſs, nor Beauty in them that
we ſhould deſire them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For theſe and other like Reaſons that may
be added, our Divine and gracious Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was pleaſed to deliver his Laws rather
by aſſerting the <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> than the <hi>Obligation</hi>
of them. Which while I conſider, I cannot
but enter into a profound Admiration of the
ſtrange Goodneſs and Condeſcenſion of our
Lord, that he ſhould ſo far lay aſide the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of a <hi>God</hi> and a <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> that he might
the better act the part of a <hi>Friend</hi> and of a
<hi>Redeemer.</hi> And to ſet this Conſideration the
more home upon our Minds, let us by the
aids of Fancy draw the Curtains of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Scene, and imagin to our ſelves
that we ſaw our Saviour ſeated upon the
<hi>Mount of Bleſſing,</hi> with his Eyes devoutly ſet
towards Heaven, and his Hands affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtretch'd forth over the adoring and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
Multitude, and with Looks full of
concern for the Good of Souls, gravely and
pathetically diſtilling down upon them the
Dew of his Heavenly Doctrin and temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Authority with the Style of Goodneſs
Kindneſs, as well as his Divinity with the
Veil of Fleſh. Who can with ſufficient
Wonder contemplate ſo pleaſing a Scene of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:94628:105"/>
Love and Sweetneſs! And who, that well
contemplates it, can find in his Heart to
tranſgreſs a Law delivered with ſo much
Condeſcenſion, or offend a Lawgiver ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely,
ſo amazingly good!</p>
                     <p>Now concerning the <hi>Number</hi> of the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
why our Lord ſhould aſſign <hi>Eight</hi> and
no more, 'tis not eaſie to offer what ſhall
ſatisfie all Minds. Were I minded to amuſe
my Reader, I could tell him that in the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Philoſophy</hi> 8 is the Number of Juſtice
and Fulneſs, becauſe it is firſt of all divided
into Numbers equally even, namely into
2 Fours, which Diviſion again is by the ſame
reaſon made into 2 times 2, that is, 2 times 2
twice reckon'd. And by reaſon of this Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Diviſions it received the Name of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi>
But I do not believe our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
any <hi>Roſie-Crucian Myſtery</hi>
in this matter,<note place="margin">Mr. Heydon Roſie-Crucian <hi>Infallible Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> pag. 73.</note> tho a certain Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of that Order would fain
inſinuate that he did, reckoning
this among other Obſervations
upon the Number 8, that there were 8 kinds
of Bleſſed Men in the leſſer World, <hi>The Poor
in Spirit, the Mourners, the Meek, they that
hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. But
I think all that can here be warrantably and
ſafely ſaid is, that our Saviour intending (as
he ſignify'd by his Aſcent into the Mount)
a Diſcourſe of Perfection and Excellence,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94628:106"/>
conſiſting of ſuch Divine Vertues as were
moſt perfective of Human Nature, and for
the Practice of which he himſelf was moſt
exemplary, was by his Deſign concern'd to
inſtance only in the moſt ſelect and excellent
Duties both to God and Man. Whereupon
premiſing Humility as being a Duty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to both, and withal the Foundation of
all the reſt, he found remaining three extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Duties relating to Man, <hi>Meekneſs,
Mercifulneſs</hi> and <hi>Peaceableneſs;</hi> and four to
God, <hi>Mourning for Sin, Hungring and Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
after Righteouſneſs, Purity of Heart, and
Suffering of Perſecution for Conſcience Sake.</hi> So
that our Saviour ſeems rather to have been
directed by a natural Meaſure, and to take
things as he found them, than to proceed by
any Arbitrary Meaſure of his own. And
this I think is the only ground of his aſſigning
eight Beatitudes, and not that he had any
<hi>Fondneſs</hi> to the <hi>Number</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Then laſtly, as to the <hi>Order</hi> of the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his <hi>Practical Catechiſm,</hi>
Pag. 114. remarks two things. Firſt, That
the Grace firſt named is a general Principal
Grace, and the Foundation of the reſt, as he
there ſhews in particular. Secondly, That
there is an interchangeable Mixture of theſe
Graces one towards God, and another to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Man, ſo interweav'd, that the firſt
reſpects God, the next Man, the next God
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94628:106"/>
again, till you come to the laſt which reſpects
God again. To verify which Remark, he
begins his Computation not from <hi>Humility,</hi>
which is a general Fundamental Grace, but
from <hi>Mourning,</hi> which is the firſt particular
one, and reſpecting God. So that the Firſt
and the Laſt both reſpect God, who is the
true <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Firſt and the Laſt,
and thoſe between divide between our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and God. To teach us, that to God
belongs the <hi>Chief,</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> and the <hi>Laſt</hi> of
our Love, and that our Neighbour is to be
regarded after and in ſubordination to God.
To this I further add, that there is alſo a
gradual and deſcending connexion between
all the Beatitudes, the latter ſtill depending
upon the former, as well as all the reſt upon
the firſt. For from Humility 'tis an eaſie
deſcent to Mourning. When a Man takes
a juſt Survey of his own Nothingneſs and
Unworthineſs by contemplating himſelf as a
Creature and a Sinner, 'twill be ſo natural
for him to mourn and be ſorrowful, that the
danger is of being overwhelm'd with too
much Sorrow. Then from Mourning 'tis
eaſie to advance to Meekneſs, it being one
of the chief Properties of Sorrow to ſoften
and melt down the Spirit, which when
meekly diſpoſed, will alſo be in a fair diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to Hungring and Thirſting after
Righteouſneſs, <hi>The Wrath of Man worketh
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:94628:107"/>
not the Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle,
that is, is no way a Friend to the promoting
of Righteouſneſs; whence on the contrary
we may gather, that Meekneſs is a Friend
to Righteouſneſs; As it muſt needs be, ſince
a calm and ſedate Soul is moſt fit for attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Beauty</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which as the Jews
ſay, will not reſt upon a <hi>turbulent Mind.</hi> And
when once the Soul is wrought up to a quick
and lively reliſh of what is Good and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
'tis then an eaſie ſtep to Mercifulneſs,
it being a very Juſt and Righteouſs thing to
ſhew Mercy. Which alſo leads a Man to
Purity of Heart, as that without which even
Mercy it ſelf will not find Mercy. From
whence the very next ſtep is to Peaceableneſs,
to which nothing more conduces than a Pure
Heart, free from thoſe Luſts and Senſual Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
which are the Seeds of Strife and
Contention. And when a Man has attain'd
to a peaceable Temper, then is he fit for the
greateſt thing in the World, to be a Martyr,
and will readily ſuffer Perſecution rather than
occaſion any Diſturbance either in the Church
or State, and with the generous Prophet be
content to be thrown overboard to appeaſe
the Tempeſt. So admirably well contrived
and full of Order was our Saviour's Diſcourſe,
as it became him who was the Wiſdom of
God, as well as the Light of Men, and in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94628:107"/>
whom were <hi>hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom
and Knowledge,</hi> Coloſ. 2. 3.</p>
                     <p>Al now that further remains, is that by a
ſtrict Conformity to theſe Excellent Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Chriſtian Perfection we endeavour
to bring our ſelves within the Number of
theſe Bleſſed Perſons, whom our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
Happy here, and to whom he will
ſay in a more Emphatical Accent, <hi>Come ye
Bleſſed,</hi> hereafter.</p>

                  <p>YOU obliged me ſo highly by acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Introduct. Pag. 1. Sect. 1. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like the Eye, whilſt it makes us ſee and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
all other things takes no notice of it ſelf.</hi>
What the Ingenious Author intends in this
Period, or how to make out any conſiſtent
Senſe of it, I do not underſtand. For if his
meaning be, That the Underſtanding while
it is intent upon other things, cannot at that
time take notice of it ſelf; this comes to no
more, than that when 'tis intent upon one
thing it cannot attend to another, which is
too eaſily and obviouſly true of all <hi>Finite</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to be any great Diſcovery. But if his
meaning be (as it rather ſeems, becauſe of the
Particle (All) and the Compariſon here uſed)
that the Underſtanding like the Eye, tho it
makes us ſee all other things, yet it takes no
notice of it ſelf, then 'tis a Contradiction to
his whole following Work, which upon this
Suppoſition muſt needs be very <hi>unaccountably</hi>
undertaken.</p>
                  <p>Introduct. Pag. 2. Sect. 3. <hi>Firſt I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the Original of thoſe Ideas which a
Man obſerves,</hi> &amp;c. But ſure by all the Laws
of Method in the World, he ought <hi>firſt</hi> to
have Defined what he meant by Ideas, and
to have acquainted us with their <hi>Nature,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he proceeded to account for their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
For how can any Propoſition be
form'd with any certainty concerning an Idea,
that it is or is not <hi>Innate,</hi> that it does or does
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94628:110"/>
not come in at the Senſes, before the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word Idea be ſtated, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing, at leaſt in general, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood?
If the Nature of Ideas were but
once made known, our Diſputes would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be at an end concerning their Original,
whether from the Senſes or not: But till that
be done, all further Diſcourſe about them is
but to talk in the <hi>Dark.</hi> This therefore ought
to have been his <hi>firſt,</hi> and indeed <hi>main</hi> Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to have given us an account of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Ideas. And yet this is not only neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
in its proper place, but wholly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and paſſed over in deep ſilence; which
I cannot but remark, as a <hi>Fundamental</hi> defect
in this Work.</p>
                  <p>In the Three following Chapters our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
ſets himſelf to prove that there are no
<hi>Innate Principles.</hi> But before I conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be or no, I premiſe this double
Remarque. Firſt, That a thing may be falſe
in it ſelf, and yet not ſo becauſe, or in vertue
of ſuch an Argument. Secondly, That tho
a thing be really falſe, yet it may not become
ſuch a Man to deny the Exiſtence of it, who
by ſome other Principles of his may be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to hold the contrary. The firſt of theſe
argues the Writer guilty of <hi>Inconſequence.</hi>
The Second of <hi>Inconſiſtency.</hi> Upon both
which Accounts this otherwiſe very ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Writer ſeems in this part to be chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94628:111"/>
Which from the Sequel I leave to be
collected.</p>
                  <p>His Firſt Argument againſt <hi>Innate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
is taken from the want of Univerſal
Conſent. <hi>There are,</hi> (ſays he,) Pag. 5. Sect.
4. <hi>No Principles to which all Mankind give
an univerſal Aſſent.</hi> But in the firſt place
how can this Author ſay ſo, ſince in ſeveral
places afterwards he reſolves that ready and
prone Aſſent which is given to certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
upon the firſt Propoſal, into the
<hi>Self-evidence</hi> of them? There are then even
according to him <hi>Self-evident</hi> Propoſitions.
And will he ſay that Self-evident Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not univerſally aſſented to? How
then are they Self-evident? There muſt be
therefore, according to him, ſome Principles
to which all Mankind <hi>do</hi> give an univerſal
Conſent. I do not ſay that this proves them
<hi>Innate,</hi> but only that there are ſuch Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Well, but how does he prove there are no
ſuch? Why, he inſtances in ſome of the moſt
Celebrated, and ſays Pag. 5. Sect. 5. that <hi>All
Children and Ideots have not the leaſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or thought of them; and the want of that is
enough to deſtroy univerſal conſent.</hi> Now I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
thought that Univerſality of Conſent
had been ſufficiently ſecured by the Conſent
of all, and the Diſſent of none that were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of either. And what then have we to do
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94628:111"/>
with <hi>Ideots</hi> and <hi>Children?</hi> Do any or all of
theſe <hi>Diſſent</hi> or think otherwiſe? No, that
he will not ſay, becauſe they think not at all,
having (as he ſays) not the <hi>leaſt Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Thought of them.</hi> And how then does
the want of their <hi>Suffrage</hi> deſtroy univerſal
Conſent, when all Perſons that think at all
about ſuch Propoſitions, think after one and
the ſame way?</p>
                  <p>The moſt therefore that this Author can
mean by want of Univerſal Conſent, is that
every individual Perſon does not <hi>actually Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>
This perhaps may be granted him from
the Inſtance of <hi>Ideots</hi> and <hi>Children.</hi> But then
the Queſtion will be about the <hi>Conſequence</hi> of
his Argument, whether Actual Aſſent from
every Individual be neceſſary to the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of <hi>Innate Principles?</hi> Or, in other Words,
whether from there not being any Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to which every individual Man gives an
actual Aſſent, it follows that there are no
Innate Truths. The Author is of Opinion
that it does. <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, Pag. 5. Sect. 5.
<hi>It ſeems to me near a Contradiction to ſay, that
there are Truths imprinted on the Soul, which
it perceives or underſtands not.</hi> And again in
the ſame place, <hi>To imprint any thing on the
Mind without the Mind's perceiving it, ſeems to
me hardly intelligible.</hi> And again, Pag. 12.
Sect. 24. <hi>That a Truth ſhould be Innate, and
yet not aſſented to, is to me as unintelligible as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94628:112"/>
for a Man to know a Truth, and be ignorant of
it at the ſame time.</hi> Here we have both the
<hi>Conſequence</hi> of the Author, and the <hi>Ground</hi>
upon which it ſtands. The Conſequence is
this. If there be no Truths actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by all Minds, then there are none na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
imprinted. The Proof of it is this.
'Tis impoſſible that what is imprinted on the
Mind, ſhould not be perceiv'd by the Mind.
Therefore if there be no Truths actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by all Minds, there are none naturally
imprinted. Now on the contrary to this I
thus oppoſe. If there may be Impreſſions
made on the Mind, whereof we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious,
or which we do not perceive, then
(by the Author's own meaſure) the not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of them is no Argument againſt ſuch
Original Impreſſions. The Conſequence is
unexceptionable, not only as clear in it ſelf,
but as being the very <hi>Reverſe</hi> of the Author's
own Argument. And now that there may
be ſuch Impreſſions whereof we are not
Conſcious, is what the Author himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
does own, and what by his Principles
he ſtands obliged to own.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, 'tis what he does expreſly own. For,
ſays he, Pag. 38. Sect. 6. <hi>Being ſurrounded
with Bodies that perpetually and diverſly affect
us, variety of Idea's, whether care be taken about
it or no, are imprinted on the minds of Children.</hi>
And yet they do not perceive them, as he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94628:112"/>
had ſaid before. Therefore by his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
there may be an Impreſſion of Ideas
where there is no Perception. The ſame he
confeſſes again, Pag. 61. Sect. 4. <hi>How often
may a Man obſerve in himſelf, that whilſt his
mind is intently imploy'd in the Contemplation
of ſome Objects, and curiouſly ſurveying ſome
Ideas that are there, it takes no notice of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,</hi>
&amp;c. And again, Sect. 5. <hi>I doubt not
but Children by the exerciſe of their Senſes about
Objects that affect them in the Womb, receive
ſome few Ideas before they are born,</hi> &amp;c. And
if before they are born, then certainly before
they are conſcious of them. There may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be Impreſſion without Conſciouſneſs.
Which he alſo plainly implies in his Account
of <hi>Memory.</hi> Which he does not make to be
a recovery of Ideas that were <hi>Loſt,</hi> but a
Re-advertency or Re-application of Mind to
Ideas that are actually there, tho not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to. <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, Pag. 65. Sect. 2.
<hi>The narrow mind of man not being capable of
having many Ideas under View and Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at once, it was neceſſary to have a Repoſitory,
to lay up thoſe Ideas, which at another time it
might have uſe of.</hi> And accordingly Pag. 66.
Sect. 7. He calls them <hi>Ideas which are lodg'd
in the memory.</hi> And Pag. 67. Sect. 8. He calls
them <hi>Dormant Ideas.</hi> So that according to
him, to <hi>remember</hi> is to retrieve, not the Ideas
themſelves, (for they are ſuppoſed to lie
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94628:113"/>
                     <hi>Dormant</hi> in the Mind) but only the <hi>Percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
or Conſciouſneſs of them. This he makes
to be the buſineſs of Memory, and therefore
there may be an imprinting of Ideas with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Actual Perception, which may now, it
ſeems, ſtand well enough together without
any danger of a <hi>Contradiction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to the Acknowledgment of this, his
own Principles will alſo oblige him. For
ſince in conformity to the <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
he makes all our Ideas to be derived
from our Senſes, or rather by our Senſes from
ſenſible Objects, he muſt needs ſuppoſe (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the variety of ſenſible Objects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we are ſurrounded) that there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
more Ideas impreſs'd upon our Minds
than we can poſſibly attend to or perceive.
Which may alſo be argued from the Finite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our Faculties, as was hinted in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                  <p>Well then, ſince there may be an Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Ideas without any actual Perception
of them, whether there be any <hi>Innate Ideas</hi>
or no (which I ſhall not now diſpute) it
does not therefore follow that there are none,
becauſe they are not univerſally perceiv'd.
Which utterly <hi>ſilences</hi> that Argument taken
from the Non-perception of them in Children.
And ſince our Author both does, and is by
his Principles obliged to allow that there are
many Ideas impreſs'd upon us when we
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94628:113"/>
have no actual Perception of them, it does
not certainly become him, tho there were
really no ſuch thing as <hi>Innate Ideas;</hi> and tho
the Non-perception of them were an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt them, to bring this as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt the Exiſtence of any ſuch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are not univerſally perceiv'd. This
is not to agree with <hi>himſelf,</hi> however he may
agree with <hi>Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our ingenious Author further argues, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Innate Principles</hi> from the <hi>Lateneſs</hi> of
the Perception of ſuch which are preſumed
to be of that number, in that they are not the
firſt that poſſeſs the Minds of Children. <hi>Can
it be imagin'd</hi> (ſays he, Pag. 13. Sect. 25.)
<hi>that they perceive the Impreſſion from things
without, and are at the ſame time ignorant of
thoſe Characters which Nature it ſelf has taken
care to ſtamp within?</hi> This I take to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uncertain way of arguing, and of leſs Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
than the Former. For if <hi>Nullity</hi> of
Perception will not conclude againſt <hi>Innate
Principles,</hi> much leſs will the <hi>Lateneſs</hi> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
be able to do it. And beſides, there
may be many Reaſons drawn from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and to us unknown Contexture of
Minds, and from the manner of that Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Impreſſion (if any ſuch there be) which
would alſo be to us equally unknown, beſides
the Order of External Circumſtances, that
may be the Cauſe why theſe natural Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94628:114"/>
may not be ſo ſoon read as ſome others.
And therefore I do not ſee what ſufficient
ground the Author has for ſaying, Sect. 26.
That <hi>if there be any Innate Truths, they muſt
neceſſarily be the firſt of any thought on.</hi> Why?
Where is the neceſſity? The Reaſon given
by the Author is becauſe, <hi>If they are any Innate
Truths, they muſt be Innate Thoughts.</hi> Are
then Truths and Thoughts the ſame? Indeed
Truth of the Subject is the ſame with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
Thought. But Truth of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is not the Thought it ſelf, but that which
is thought upon. And why then muſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Truths be Innate Thoughts?</p>
                  <p>But our Author proceeds to another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
wherein he places more Strength. <hi>If,</hi>
ſays he, Pag. 13. Sect. 27. <hi>Theſe Characters
were native and Original Impreſſions, they would
appear faireſt and cleareſt in thoſe Perſons in
whom yet we find no footſteps of them.</hi> He means
in Children, who, he ſays, have no Reſerves,
no Arts of Concealment to hinder them from
ſhining out in their full Luſtre. But how
does the Author know but that this Natural
Impreſſion may be ſo order'd that it ſhall not
become legible till ſuch a certain Period of
time, and without ſuch and ſuch Laws and
Conditions? We know very well that we do
not come to the uſe of Thinking in <hi>general</hi> till
ſuch a certain Period of Time, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
himſelf confeſſes Pag. 12. Sect. 25. That
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94628:114"/>
                     <hi>there is a time when Children begin to think;</hi>
and why then may there not be a time ſet
for the ariſing of ſuch and ſuch particular
Thoughts? And how can he tell that Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
is that time? Or if it be, why do not
the Ideas impreſſed by ſenſible Objects appear
faireſt in Children for the ſame Reaſons? If
there be any force in this Argument, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
own <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is as much concern'd in
it, as that which he would overthrow.</p>
                  <p>Come we now to his Arguments againſt
<hi>Innate Practical Principles,</hi> the firſt of which
is from their not being univerſally aſſented to.
But what does he here mean by their not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
univerſally conſented to? That they are
not actually aſſented to by every Individual
whether capable or not? Or that they are
not conſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed to by all that judge any thing
about them; if the former, that proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
as we have ſhewn already; if the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then I deny the Propoſition, and affirm
that there are not only as <hi>Certain</hi> but as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſted</hi>
Propoſitions in Morality as in any
other Science. But our Author demands,
Pag. 15. Sect. 2. <hi>Where is that Practical Truth
that is univerſally receiv'd?</hi> I anſwer by refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him to the 274 Page of his own Book,
where he ſays Sect. 18. That this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Where there is no Propriety there is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,</hi>
is a Propoſition as certain as any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
in <hi>Euclid;</hi> I add, and as plain
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94628:115"/>
too. It needed nothing to aſſure the Truth
of it but only the Explication of the Terms.
And I further Remarque that in the ſame
place he ſays that Morality may be placed
among the Sciences capable of Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Well then, if there may be Propoſitions
demonſtrated in Morality, then thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
muſt at laſt be reſolved into <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
evident</hi> and <hi>inconteſtable.</hi> Since otherwiſe
there can be no Demonſtration. There are
therefore inconteſtable Principles in Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And he confeſſes as much in expreſs
terms; <hi>I doubt not,</hi> ſays he in the ſame place,
<hi>but from Principles as inconteſtable as thoſe of
the Mathematicks, by neceſſary Conſequences, the
meaſures of Right and Wrong might be made out
to any one,</hi> &amp;c. Here he expreſly owns incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
Principles in Morality, that is, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
Truths, that is, Truths that cannot
be denied, and therefore <hi>muſt</hi> be aſſented to.
And how then can he with any tolerable <hi>Self-Conſiſtency</hi>
ſay that there are no Moral Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
univerſally conſented to? If none are
univerſally conſented to, then all are by ſome
conteſted. And yet he ſays there are in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
inconteſtable Principles. How to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
this I no more know, than he does to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
<hi>Morality</hi> and <hi>Mechaniſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His next Argument is, That <hi>there cannot
any one Moral Rule be propoſed whereof a Man
may not juſtly demand a Reaſon,</hi> Pag. 16. Sect. 4.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94628:115"/>
Well, what then? Therefore they are not
<hi>Innate.</hi> I do not ſee the Conſequence. Why
may not the ſame Propoſition be Innate, and
yet deducible from Reaſon too, as well as
the ſame Propoſition be the Object of both
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Science?</hi> Why may not Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be Innate as well as Principles? Why
may not God be ſuppoſed for a further Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of our Vertue to implant even thoſe Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
Propoſitions upon our Minds, which
are alſo capable of being demonſtrated from
Principles of Reaſon? Whether he has ſo
done or no I do not diſpute; I only ſay that
their Dependence on Reaſon is no Argument
that he has not.</p>
                  <p>He argues again, Pag. 18. Sect. 9. from
Mens <hi>tranſgreſſing</hi> theſe Moral Rules with
Confidence and Serenity, which he ſays they
could not do, were they <hi>Innate.</hi> I do not
apprehend here the leaſt Appearance of a
Conſequence. Why may not an <hi>Innate Law</hi>
be tranſgreſs'd as well as a <hi>Written Law?</hi> An
Innate Law only dictates that ſuch a thing
ought or ought not to be done, and ſo does a
Written Law. He might therefore as well
have concluded that there is no Written Law,
becauſe it is Tranſgreſs'd, as that there is no
Innate Law becauſe it is Tranſgreſs'd.</p>
                  <p>The Author ſeems to have been ſenſible
of the Weakneſs of this Argument, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to ſtrengthen it, ſays he, Pag. 19. Sect. 12.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94628:116"/>
                     <hi>The breaking of a Rule ſay you is no Argument
that it is unknown; I grant it, but the general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
allow'd Breach of it any where, is a Proof that
it is not Innate.</hi> Here I remark by the way
that he grants that the Breaking of a Law
does not prove it <hi>not known,</hi> and why then
ſhould it prove it not <hi>Innate?</hi> If a known
Law may be tranſgreſſed, why may not an
Innate Law, Innate being only another way
of being known? But ſays he, <hi>The Generally
allow'd Breach of it proves it not Innate.</hi> I do
not ſee the Neceſſity of this neither. The
allow'd Breach of a Law is only a more ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated
Breach of it, and if the Breach of a
Law does not prove it not to be Innate, why
ſhould the allow'd Breach of it do ſo? And
beſides, why may not an Innate Law be <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowedly</hi>
broken as well as a Written Law?</p>
                  <p>But ſays our Author, Pag. 21. Sect. 14.
<hi>Did Men find ſuch Innate Propoſitions ſtamp'd
on their Minds, they would be eaſily able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
them from other Truths, and there
would be nothing more eaſie than to know what
and how many they were.</hi> Perhaps not ſo very
eaſie. For I ſee no abſurdity in Suppoſing,
and 'tis what I can very well conceive, that
a Man may be ſenſible of a <hi>Truth impreſs'd,</hi>
and yet not of the <hi>Impreſſion,</hi> and ſo may not
know that it is impreſs'd, but think it came
ſome other way, and conſequently may not
be able to diſtinguiſh it from ſome other that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94628:116"/>
does ſo. The truth of this may be ſeen in the
Inſtance of <hi>Inſpiration.</hi> Since there have been
Prophets (<hi>Caiaphas</hi> for one) <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 51. who
were not able to diſtinguiſh Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
from their own proper genuin
Thoughts: 'Tis therefore no Conſequence to
ſay that there are no Innate Principles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we cannot diſtinguiſh them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the main Arguments, and to
which all that is further offered may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
whereby this Author impugns the
Doctrin of <hi>Innate Principles;</hi> and I think nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any nor all of them are ſufficient for the
Cauſe wherein they are ingaged. And I am
ſo far from being ſurprized at their <hi>Deficiency,</hi>
that I think it abſolutely impoſſible for him
or any Man elſe upon his Principles, to
prove that there are no <hi>Innate Truths.</hi> For
ſince with thoſe of the Peripatetic School he
allows that Ideas are impreſs'd upon the
Mind from ſenſible Objects, he cannot (as
another might) object againſt the <hi>Poſſibility</hi>
of ſuch Impreſſions. He cannot ſay they are
capable only of a Figurative and Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Senſe; ſince according to him the ſame
is litterally and really done every Day, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Hour, every Minute. No, he muſt grant
that 'tis poſſible there may be ſuch Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
All the Queſtion then will be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Timing</hi> of it, whether any of theſe
Impreſſions be Original Characters or no!
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94628:117"/>
And why may they not be at firſt as well as
afterwards? How can he or any Man elſe
tell (upon his Principles) whether the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of Nature has imprinted any ſuch or
no? Or whether we brought any with us
into the World or no? However that be, I
am ſatisfy'd 'tis impoſſible for any Man that
holds <hi>Mental Impreſſions,</hi> to prove the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
eſpecially if with that he allows the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of <hi>Pre-exiſtence,</hi> which I believe no
conſidering Man will ſay is Impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I do as little believe there
are any ſuch things as Innate Principles ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and properly ſo called, meaning by them
certain Original Characters written upon or
interwoven with the Mind in the very firſt
Moment of its Being and Conſtitution, I ſay
I do as little believe this as the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Not for the Reaſons by him alledg'd,
with the Cogency of which I am not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd;
but becauſe I do not allow any ſuch
thing as <hi>Mental Impreſſions,</hi> or Characters
written upon the Mind, which if it pretend
to any thing more than Figure and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor,
I take to be mere <hi>Jargon,</hi> and unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible
<hi>Cant.</hi> You know Sir, I account for
the Mode of <hi>Human <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> after a
very different way, namely, by the Preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialneſs
of the Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or Ideal World to
our Souls, wherein we ſee and perceive all
things. For a fuller account of which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94628:117"/>
you to my <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and to
my <hi>Reflections</hi> lately publiſh'd. I cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by my Principles admit of any ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Characters in a ſtrict and proper Senſe.
Only I may, and am alſo inclined to admit
ſomething of near Analogy with it. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that God may and does exhibit ſome
particular Truths of the Ideal World more
early, more clearly, and more conſtantly to
the view of the Soul than others, that by
theſe ſhe may be the better directed to the
Good of the Reaſonable Life, as Animals by
ſenſitive Inſtincts and Inclinations are to the
Good of Senſe. This is all that I conceive to
be ſtrictly either <hi>Poſſible</hi> or <hi>True</hi> in that grey-headed
venerable Doctrin of Innate or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Principles.</p>
                  <p>Having thus far conſidered our Author's
Impugnation of Innate Principles, I come
now to examin the Original which he gives
to <hi>Ideas.</hi> Theſe he derives <hi>Book 2. Chap.</hi> 1.
from this double Fountain, <hi>Senſation</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</hi>
Eſpecially from the Former, telling
us again and again, that <hi>the Senſes let in Ideas
and furniſh the yet empty Cabinet,</hi> Pag. 8. Sect.
15. That <hi>the Senſes convey into the Mind ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
diſtinct Perceptions of things,</hi> Pag. 37. Sect.
3. And that <hi>the Senſes do furniſh the Soul with
Ideas to think on,</hi> Pag. 44. Sect. 20. with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other ſuch Expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:94628:118"/>
Theſe indeed are Pretty <hi>Smiling</hi> Sentences.
But before we go a Step further I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
know of the Author what kind of things
theſe Ideas are which are thus let in at the
Gate of the Senſes. This indeed I expected
an Account of in the beginning of the Work;
but ſince the Author has been pleaſed to caſt
a <hi>Shade</hi> upon this Part, I now demand, what
are theſe Ideas? Why you ſhall know that
preſently, <hi>Whatſoever the Mind perceives in it
ſelf, or is the immediate Object of Perception,
that I call Idea,</hi> ſays he, Pag. 55. Sect. 8. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good; ſo much my Lexicon would have
told me. But this does not ſatisfy. I would
know what kind of things he makes theſe
Ideas to be as to their <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Nature.</hi> Are
they in the firſt place Real Beings or not?
Without doubt Real Beings, as having Real
Properties, and really different one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and repreſenting things, really diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
Well, if Real Beings, then I demand,
are they Subſtances, or are they Modificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Subſtances? He will not ſay they are
<hi>Modifications.</hi> For beſides that a Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Subſtance cannot be a Repreſentative
of a Subſtance, there being no manner of
likeneſs between a Subſtance and a Mode;
if an Idea be a Modification only it cannot
ſubſiſt by it ſelf, but muſt be the Modificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſome Subſtance or other, whereof alſo
there may be an Idea; which Idea being (as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94628:118"/>
is ſuppoſed) only a Mode, muſt have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Subſtance, and ſo on without end. As
for example, If my Idea of <hi>Figure</hi> be only a
Mode, then it muſt have a Subſtance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to exiſt as well as Figure it ſelf, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
exiſt alone; and ſince of that Subſtance
whatever it be, there may be alſo an Idea,
which is ſuppoſed to be a Modification, this
Idea muſt alſo have another Subſtance, and
ſo on to Infinity. He will not therefore, I
ſuppoſe, ſay that our Ideas are <hi>Modifications.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He muſt then ſay that they are <hi>Subſtances.</hi>
Are they then Material Subſtances or Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial?
If he ſays they are <hi>Material</hi> Subſtances
or Corporeal Emanations from ſenſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
I would deſire him to weigh with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and try if he can anſwer, what is alledg'd
by <hi>M.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De inquirend. Verit. Lib. 3. Part 2 c. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Malebranch</hi> againſt the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of ſuch Emanations. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
let him tell me how this
can conſiſt with the <hi>Impenetrabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of Bodies, which muſt needs hinder theſe
Corporeal Effluvias from poſſeſſing the ſame
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi</hi> or Point, which yet muſt be ſuppoſed,
if theſe be the Repreſenters of Objects, ſince
there is no aſſignable Point where the ſame,
and where multitudes of Objects may not be
ſeen. This one Difficulty is enough to make
this way <hi>impaſſable.</hi> But let him further tell
me how any Body can eradiate ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable
Number of theſe Effluvias ſo as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94628:119"/>
to fill every Point of ſuch vaſt Spaces, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt ſenſible Diminution. Well, but
ſuppoſe they could, let him tell me how theſe
Corporeal Effluvias, ſometimes of vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and Magnitude, can enter the Eye; Or
if they could, how they can do it in ſuch
Troops and Numbers without juſtling, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing,
and inverting one another. Or if
this might be avoided, where ſhall we find
room to receive ſuch a numerous Company
of Corporeal Images? And upon what part
will you have them impreſſed? Upon the
Soul? Or upon the Brain? But who can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
either of theſe? How can an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
Subſtance, as the Soul is, <hi>receive</hi> any
Stamp or Impreſſion? And how can ſuch a
fluid Subſtance as the Brain is, <hi>retain</hi> any?
The leaſt jog of a Man's Head muſt needs
obliterate ſuch ſlight and Aerial Traces, as
the Wind does the Figures that are written
upon the Sand; Not to ſay that theſe Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
coming on ſo thick one upon another
muſt needs work out themſelves almoſt as
ſoon as they are in, and in a ſhort time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
the very Brain too. But ſuppoſe we
could get over all this, the greateſt Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is yet behind; How will ſuch Corporeal
Effluvias be able to repreſent immaterial and
intellectual Objects? They will at the moſt
be able but to repreſent Material Objects,
and not all of them neither, but only thoſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94628:119"/>
whoſe Emanations they are. And what ſhall
we do with Ideas that will not do their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
that cannot repreſent a quarter of the
things which we are concern'd to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand?</p>
                  <p>Theſe and a thouſand more Abſurdities
muſt he wade through, that will aſſert our
Ideas to be Corporeal Effluvias derived from
external Objects. It remains then that they
muſt be <hi>Immaterial</hi> Subſtances. And ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all queſtion they are. <hi>All</hi> of them as to
their <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and <hi>moſt</hi> of them as to their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation.</hi>
But how ſhall Bodies ſend forth
ſuch Immaterial Species? They can emit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is Corporeal, like themſelves.
How then ſhall they commence Immaterial?
Body can no more <hi>emit</hi> Spirit, than it can
<hi>create</hi> it. And what is there after Emiſſion
that ſhall be the Principle of Transformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Some I know talk of ſtrange Feats done
by the Dexterity of <hi>Intellectus Agens</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiens,</hi>
which they ſay refine and ſpiritualize
theſe Material Phantaſms; but I ſuppoſe our
Author is of too Philoſophical a Faith to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of ſuch a <hi>Romantick Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſhort of this Argument is, if our Ideas
are derived from ſenſible Objects, then they
are Material Beings, becauſe Matter can ſend
forth nothing but Matter. But they are not
Material Beings, for the Reaſons alledg'd
above. Therefore they are not derived from
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94628:120"/>
Senſible Objects. Which I think has the force
of Demonſtration. And to this purpoſe it
may be further conſider'd (what I hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
that as our Ideas are all of them Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
as to their Eſſence and Subſtance, ſo
many, perhaps moſt of them, are alſo imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
as to their Repreſentation, that is, they
repreſent after an immaterial manner, as the
Ideas of Truth, Vertue, and the like; which
<hi>Carteſius</hi> makes to be the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>Imagination</hi> and
<hi>Pure Intellection,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Meditat. 6. p. 36.</note> and whereof he
gives an Inſtance in the Example of a <hi>Chilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi>
whoſe Angles we cannot repreſent in a
diſtinct View, but may clearly <hi>underſtand</hi> it.
But now how can that which repreſents after
an immaterial manner, come from ſenſible
Objects? Again, we have Ideas of things that
are not to be found in the Material and Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
World, as of a Right Line, or an exact
Circle, which our Author himſelf confeſſes,
Pag. 283. Sect. 6. not to be really extant in
Nature. And what does he think of the Idea
of <hi>God?</hi> Will he ſay that <hi>that</hi> is alſo derived
from ſenſible Objects? Yes: For, ſays he,
Pag. 147. Sect. 33. <hi>If we examin the Idea we
have of the Incomprehenſible Supreme Being, we
ſhall find that we came by it the ſame way,</hi> that
is, by Senſation. But in the firſt place, how
does this agree with what he ſays, Pag. 341.
Sect. 2. <hi>That we have the knowledge of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94628:120"/>
of all things without us (except only of
God) by our Senſes?</hi> So then it ſeems we do
not know the Exiſtence of God by our Senſes.
No? then neither have we the Idea of him
by our Senſes. For if we had, why ſhould
we not know his Exiſtence by Senſation as
well as the Exiſtence of other things, which,
as he ſays, we know only by Senſation? For,
ſays he, Pag. 311. Sect. 2. ſpeaking of the
knowledge of Exiſtence, <hi>We have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of our own exiſtence by Intuition, of the
exiſtence of God by Demonſtration, and of other
things by Senſation.</hi> Then it ſeems we do not
know the Exiſtence of God by Senſation, but
that of other things we do. But why are
other things known by Senſation, but only
becauſe their Ideas come in at our Senſes?
For I ſuppoſe he will not ſay that the things
themſelves come in at our Senſes; for then
what need is there of Ideas at all? And if
other things are therefore known by Senſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
becauſe their Ideas come in by the Senſes,
then why is not God alſo known by Senſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
foraſmuch as his Idea according to him,
comes alſo the ſame way? And yet he will
not allow that God's Exiſtence is known by
Senſation; which indeed is very true, but
then he ſhould not have ſaid that the Idea of
God comes in by the Senſes.</p>
                  <p>But what a ſtrange <hi>Adventure</hi> is it in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
to make the Idea of God to come in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94628:121"/>
by our Senſes, and to be derived from Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Objects! For beſides the Difficulties and
Abſurdities already touch't upon, what is
there in the Material World that can reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
God? Nay, what is there in the whole
Creation that can repreſent <hi>him</hi> to our
Thoughts? God himſelf cannot <hi>make</hi> an Idea
of himſelf: For ſuch an Idea, whatever it be,
muſt be a Creature; and can a Creature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
God! Nothing certainly but God
himſelf can do that. He muſt be his own
Idea, or he can have none. There is but one
poſſible Idea of God, and that is his <hi>Son,</hi> the
Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or Ideal World, <hi>the brightneſs
of his Glory, and the expreſs Image or Character
of his Perſon.</hi> 'Tis he that is the Idea of God,
and of the whole Creation, that both <hi>is,</hi> and
<hi>repreſents</hi> all things. And ſince the way of
knowledge by our Senſes turns to ſo poor an
Account, I would deſire our moſt ingenious
Author to conſider, whether it be not abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
more rational and intelligible (not to
ſay pious) to ſuppoſe that we ſee all things
in God, or the Divine Ideas, that is, in the
partial Repreſentations of the Divine Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.
For our Author himſelf confeſſes,
Pag. 315. Sect. 10. that <hi>Whatſoever is firſt of
all things, muſt neceſſarily contain in it, and
actually have, at leaſt all the Perefections that
can ever after exiſt. Nor can it ever give to
another any perfection that it has not, either
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94628:121"/>
actual in it ſelf, or at leaſt in an higher degree.</hi>
God then, even according to him, is all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
or, has the whole Plenitude of Being.
And I wonder that this Principle had not
led this Sagacious Perſon further. I know
whither it would have carried him, if he had
follow'd the Clue of it. For why ſhould we
ſeek any further, and puzzle our ſelves with
unintelligible Suppoſitions? What elſe <hi>need,</hi>
and what elſe <hi>can</hi> be the immediate Object
of our Underſtanding but the Divine Ideas,
the <hi>Omniform Eſſence</hi> of God? This will open
to us a plain intelligible Account of <hi>Human
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> yea of <hi>Angelical</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi>
too. Here I can tell what an Idea is, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Omniform Eſſence of God partially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
or exhibited, and how it comes to
be united to my Mind. But as for all other
ways, I look upon them to be deſperate. But
theſe things are already by me purpoſely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
of elſewhere, and are alſo
further to be deduc'd in my <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
of the Ideal World,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus far reflected upon the two
Principal Parts of this Work concerning <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Principles,</hi> and the <hi>Origin</hi> of <hi>Ideas,</hi> in a
continued way of Diſcourſe, all that further
remains is now to conſider only ſome few
ſingle Paſſages as they ſtand by themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 16. Sect. 3. <hi>Practical Principles muſt
produce Conformity of Action, or elſe they are in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94628:122"/>
vain diſtinguiſhed from Speculative Maxims.</hi>
'Tis enough to diſtinguiſh them from Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Maxims, if they are in order to Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that is, if they are concerning ſuch things
as may and ought to be done by us, tho in
the event they do not produce any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.
Otherwiſe a Law would not be a
Law till 'tis obey'd.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 57. Sect. 15. <hi>There is nothing like our
Ideas exiſting in the Bodies themſelves. They
are in the Bodies only a Power to produce thoſe
Senſations in us.</hi> The firſt part I acknowledge
to be true: For certainly Heat in the Fire is
no way reſembling what I call Heat in my
ſelf, meaning by it either ſuch a grateful or
ungrateful Senſation as I feel, when I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Fire more or leſs. But the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Clauſe I cannot approve, thinking it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that any Body ſhould directly and
properly produce any Senſation in my Soul.
'Tis God certainly that is the Author of all
my Senſations, as well as of my Ideas. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
can only be Conditions or Occaſional
Cauſes of them.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 158. Sect. 10. Speaking of the Law
of Vertue and Vice, ſays he, <hi>If we examin it
right, we ſhall find that the meaſure of what is
every where call'd and eſteemed Vertue and Vice,
is the Approbation or Diſlike, Praiſe or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe
which by a ſecret and tacit conſent eſtabliſhes
it ſelf in the ſeveral Societies of Men,</hi> &amp;c. Praiſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94628:122"/>
or Diſpraiſe may be a probable Sign, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
Meaſure, but it can never be the
Primary Meaſure or Law of Vertue and
Vice; whoſe difference muſt be founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
more certain and immutable grounds of
Diſtinction than the Praiſe or Diſpraiſe of
Men. For Praiſe or Diſpraiſe does not <hi>make,</hi>
but <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> the difference of Vertue and Vice
as already ſetled, and antecedent to it. A
thing is not good becauſe 'tis praiſed, but is
therefore praiſed becauſe 'tis good. And how
comes this Praiſe or Diſpraiſe to be <hi>eſtabliſh'd
by ſuch a ſecret and tacit conſent,</hi> if there be not
ſome other more certain meaſure of Good
and Evil, according to which our Praiſe or
Diſpraiſe is to proceed?</p>
                  <p>Pag. 185. Sect. 5. <hi>I doubt not but if we could

that fall not under our Senſes, to have had their

what he thinks of the Word <hi>(Although)</hi>
Has he not a clear Conception of what is
meant by that Word? And yet is there any
thing of the <hi>Material Relation</hi> under it? I
the rather inſtance in this Word, tho I might
inſtance in a thouſand more, becauſe I have
read of a Man (I think the Relation is in
Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi>'s Intellectual System) that was
of our Author's Mind, that there was no
Word but what ultimately ſtood for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94628:123"/>
material and ſenſible, and was convinc'd
of the contrary by lighting upon the firſt
Word of <hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>Offices</hi> which is <hi>Quanquam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pag. 196. Sect. 19. <hi>The Doctrin of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability
of Eſſences proves them only to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
Ideas, and is founded on the Relation that
is eſtabliſh'd between them and certain Sounds
as ſigns of them.</hi> True indeed with reſpect
to us, who becauſe we do not know all the
Eſſences of things, muſt be ſuppoſed to make
that only the Eſſence which we intend to
ſignify by calling it by ſuch a Name. But I
hope notwithſtanding this, the Author will
allow that there are alſo in reality Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Eſſences of things, independent on our
Conceptions, as may appear in <hi>Mathematical
Figures.</hi> Where the <hi>Nominal</hi> Eſſence and
the <hi>Real</hi> Eſſence are all one.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 205. Sect. 9. He tells us that <hi>Eſſences
are only Articles of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> 'Tis
true, thoſe Collections of ſimple Ideas which
we bind up together under one Name,
which he elſewhere calls <hi>Nominal Eſſences,</hi>
are only Creatures of the Underſtanding;
but as I ſaid before, there are alſo determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Eſſences in the things themſelves, tho
for the moſt to us unknown, which have a
fix'd and immutable Nature without any
dependence on any Underſtanding but the
Divine. 'Tis true indeed, we are fain to
ſort and rank things by their Nominal Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94628:123"/>
becauſe the Real Ones are moſt times
unknown; but that is no Argument againſt
the Being of Real Eſſences. And this is by the
Author himſelf confeſs'd, Pag. 234. Sect.
11. where he ſays that <hi>in our Ideas of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
we have not the Liberty as in mix'd
modes, to frame what Combinations we think fit,
to rank things by, but muſt follow Nature, and
ſuit our Complex Ideas to real Exiſtences.</hi> So
that here we have Patterns to follow, and
I deſire no more.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 242. Sect. 6. <hi>Were the ſignification of
Body and Extenſion preciſely the ſame, it would
be as proper and intelligible to ſay the Body of an
Extenſion, as the Extenſion of a Body.</hi> Here
he ſuppoſes it would be proper, to ſay the
Extenſion of a Body upon that Suppoſition,
whereas indeed were they preciſely the ſame;
neither of them would be proper.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 244. Sect. 14. <hi>The Platoniſts have
their Soul of the World, the Epicureans their
Endeavour towards Motion,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe the
Author reckons among unintelligible Forms
of Speech, and ſuppoſes them to be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than <hi>Gibberiſh.</hi> As to the Soul of the
World 'tis a Subject of too great a Latitude
to be diſcours'd of at preſent. But as to the
Epicureans <hi>Endeavour</hi> towards Motion, that
there is ſuch a thing, he may be ſufficiently
convinc'd by looking upon a pair of Scales,
where tho the leſſer Weight does not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actually
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94628:124"/>
weigh down, yet that it preſſes and
endeavours towards it is moſt certain, ſince
otherwiſe as much Weight would be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to weigh it down as if it were quite emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But this we do not find; whence it
muſt of neceſſity be concluded that the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Weight tho it did not paſs into actual
Motion, yet it did ſomething toward it, that
is, it <hi>Endeavoured.</hi> The ſame might alſo be
illuſtrated from the Actions of the Will, ſome
of which are perfect and compleat Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
others only <hi>Velleities</hi> or <hi>Endeavours.</hi>
But if the Author would be further ſatisfied
in this Matter, I deſire him to read the 19
and 20 Chapters of Dr. <hi>Gliſſon, de Natura
Subſtantiae Energetica,</hi> where he will find this
Argument very curiouſly handled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag. 274. Sect.</hi> 19. The Ideas of Quantity
may be ſet down by ſenſible Marks, Diagrams,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this cannot be done in Moral Ideas, we
have no ſenſible marks that reſemble them. <hi>Very
true, which is a plain Argument that ſuch
Ideas are not from our Senſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pag. 289. Sect. 2. <hi>Truth ſeems to me to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
nothing but the joyning or ſeparating of
Signs, as the things ſignified do Agree or Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
one with another.</hi> This indeed is Truth
of the <hi>Mind</hi> or of the <hi>Subject,</hi> but not Truth
of the <hi>Thing</hi> or of the <hi>Object,</hi> which conſiſts
not in the Mind's joyning or ſeparating either
Signs or Ideas, but in the Eſſential Habitudes
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94628:124"/>
that are between the <hi>Ideas</hi> themſelves. And
that theſe are ſuch, our Author himſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
by ſaying, <hi>as the things ſignified do Agree
or Diſagree with one another.</hi> Here then is
Agreement and Diſagreement antecedently
to any joyning or ſeparating. And I very
much wonder that our Author profeſſing in
the Title of the Chapter to diſcourſe of Truth
in general, and particularly of that Truth too
which has been the Enquiry of ſo many Ages,
ſhould yet confine his Diſcourſe to Truth of
Words and Truth of Thoughts without the
leaſt mention of Objective Truth. Which
indeed is the Principal kind of Truth.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 300. Sect. 5. <hi>I think it is a ſelf-evident
Propoſition, that two Bodies cannot be in the
ſame place.</hi> If the Propoſition be Self-evident
how comes he only to <hi>Think</hi> 'tis ſo? If it were
only <hi>Evident</hi> he muſt do no more than ſo.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 323. Sect. 14. <hi>Eternal Truths are not
ſo from being written in the minds of Men, Or
that they were before the World: But whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
we can ſuppoſe ſuch a Creature as Man is,
inabled with ſuch faculties, we muſt conclude he
muſt needs when he applies his Thoughts to the
conſideration of his Ideas, know the Truth of
certain Propoſitions,</hi> &amp;c. This is a true <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotelian</hi>
Account of Eternal Truths. But I
demand, Are theſe Eternal Truths in being
before the Exiſtence of Man or no? If not,
how comes he to underſtand them when he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94628:125"/>
does exiſt? What, does he make that to be
true, which before was not ſo? But if they
were in being before the Exiſtence of Man,
then their Eternity does not conſiſt in their
being underſtood by Man when ever he ſhall
exiſt, but in their own fix'd and immutable
Relations, whereby they have an antecedent
Aptneſs ſo to be underſtood. Which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
himſelf ſeems to imply by ſaying, <hi>He
muſt needs ſo underſtand them.</hi> Why muſt
needs?<note place="margin">Reaſon &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, p. 76<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> But only becauſe they are
neceſſarily ſo and no otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.
But of this I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 344. Sect. 8. He takes notice of one
manifeſt Miſtake in the Rules of Syllogiſm,
<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>No Syllogiſtical reaſoning can be right
and Concluſive, but what has at leaſt one general
Propoſition in it.</hi> This our Author thinks to
be a Miſtake, and a manifeſt miſtake. But
perhaps if we rightly underſtand that Rule
of Syllogiſm, there is no Miſtake at all in it.
All the Ground of the Diſpute is from the
Doubtfulneſs of what is meant by a general
or univerſal Propoſition. A Propoſition may
be ſaid to be univerſal either when a Note of
Univerſality (as <hi>All</hi>) is prefixed before the
Subject. Or when tho that Note be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed,
yet the Predicate is ſaid of the whole
Subject according to the full Latitude of its
Predication, ſo as to leave nothing of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94628:125"/>
Subject out, whereof the Predicate is not ſaid. According
to the former Senſe of Univerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it is not neceſſary that in every concluding
Syllogiſm one Propoſition be univerſal. But
according to the latter Senſe of Univerſality
(which indeed is the moſt proper ſenſe of it)
it is certainly neceſſary. And I dare chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
any Man to ſhew me one Inſtance of
a concluding Syllogiſm that has not one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
univerſal in the latter Senſe. For
even a ſingular Propoſition is thus univerſal,
ſince being Indiviſible, it can have nothing
ſaid of it, but what is ſaid of it wholly and
univerſally, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> expreſſes it.
The Author may ſee a further Account of
this in Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> his Theſis <hi>de Propoſitione
ſingulari,</hi> at the latter end of his <hi>Inſtitutio Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe, Sir, are the moſt conſiderable Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
that at once reading I thought liable to
Reflection in this Work, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
theſe few <hi>Erratas,</hi> I think to be a
very extraordinary Performance, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the moſt publick Honour and Reſpect.
And tho I do not approve of every particular
thing in this Book, yet I muſt ſay that the
Author is juſt ſuch a kind of Writer as I like,
one that has thought much, and well, and
who freely Writes what he thinks. I hate
your <hi>Common-place</hi> Men of all the Writers in
the World, who tho they happen ſometimes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94628:126"/>
to ſay things that are in themſelves not only
True, but conſiderable, yet they never write
in any Train or Order of Thinking, which
is one of the greateſt Beauties of Compoſition.</p>
                  <p>But this Gentleman is a Writer of a very
different Genius and Complexion of Soul, and
whoſe Character I cannot eaſily give, but
muſt leave it either to the Deſcription of
ſome finer Pen, or to the ſilent Admiration
of Poſterity. Only one Feature of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
I am concern'd to point out, which
is, that he ſeems to be a Perſon of ſo great
Ingenuity and Candor, and of a Spirit ſo tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Philoſophical, that I have thence great and
fair Inducements to believe that he will not
be offended with that Freedom I have uſed
in theſe Reflections, which were not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the leſſening his Fame, but ſolely for
the promoting of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>right Thinking.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this will juſtifie that part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
where agreeing with the Author in
the Propoſition intended to be proved, I lay
open the inſufficiency of his Proofs. For to
ſay that a thing is falſe for ſuch Reaſons,
when 'tis not falſe for ſuch Reaſons, tho it
be abſolutely falſe, is as great an Injury to
Truth, as to ſay a thing is falſe when 'tis
not falſe. A falſe Inference is as much an
Untruth, as a falſe Concluſion; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
he that might reflect upon the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
if falſe, may with as much reaſon reflect
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94628:126"/>
upon a wrong way of inferring it, tho the
Concluſion it ſelf be true. Which I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with reſpect to the former part about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Principles, where tho I agree with the
Author in the thing denied, yet I think his

                  <head>A Brief Conſideration of the Remarks
made upon the foregoing Reflections by
the Gentlemen of the Athenian Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in the Supplement to the Third Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
&amp;c.</head>
                  <p>THE Gentlemen of this new Society
undertake two things, to <hi>Report,</hi> and
to <hi>Judge</hi> of the Contents of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Books that are Printed in <hi>England;</hi>
which I acknowledge to be a very uſeful
and laudable Undertaking, if performed Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and Faithfully, with Judgment and
Integrity. But whether they have thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
themſelves in reference to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Reflections, the Liberty they have
taken with the Author, will I think war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
him to Examin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Supplement,</hi> Pag. 2. Paragraph 1. <hi>It will
be ſufficient to obſerve that Mr.</hi> Norris <hi>is a</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſian,
<hi>and as it ſeems, of thoſe of the</hi> Carteſians
<hi>that are of Father</hi> Malebranche's <hi>Opinion. This
occaſions that being full of theſe Thoughts, he
ſeems not always to have well comprehended his
meaning whom he Criticiſes upon.</hi> Why the
being a <hi>Carteſian,</hi> and according to the way
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94628:127"/>
of <hi>M. Malebranche,</hi> ſhould make me leſs apt
to comprehend Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Book, I cannot
divine. Were the thing it ſelf never ſo true,
yet I think the Reaſon here given of it, is as
odd as may be. But 'twill be time enough
to ſeek out for the Reaſon of my miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Book, when it is better
proved than at preſent, that I have done ſo.
But as to that, if Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> himſelf had told
me ſo, his bare Authority without any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
would have obliged me to ſuſpect my
Apprehenſion, and to think once again; it
being a Deference owing to every Author to
ſuppoſe that he beſt underſtands his own
Meaning. But from you Gentlemen, who
ſtand upon the ſame Level with me, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
Reaſon, and to be ſhewn <hi>where</hi> and <hi>how</hi>
I have miſtaken him. For the preſent I am
rather apt to think that I have comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Senſe well enough, but that
you underſtand neither <hi>Me,</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Lock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Paragr. 2. <hi>He upbraideth Mr.</hi> Lock <hi>of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
to treat of Ideas, without defining what
he underſtood by this Word.</hi> Here is a falſe
<hi>Report.</hi> I did not cenſure Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
to diſcourſe of Ideas, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
a Definition of the <hi>Name</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Word,</hi>
(for that I grant he has done) but for offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to account for their Origination, without
giving a Definition, or any Account of the
<hi>thing.</hi> My Words are, <hi>But ſure by all the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94628:128"/>
Laws of Method in the World, he ought firſt to
have Defined what he meant by Ideas, and to
have acquainted us with their Nature, before he
proceeded to account for their Origination.</hi> And
again, <hi>This therefore ought to have been his Firſt
and indeed main Buſineſs, to have given us an
account of the Nature of Ideas: And yet this is
not only neglected in its proper place, but wholly
omitted and paſs'd over in deep Silence, which I
cannot but remarque as a Fundamental Defect
in this Work.</hi> What is it pray, that is here
remarqu'd as a Fundamental Defect? Not
ſure his not defining the Term Idea (for
that I grant <hi>pag.</hi> 22. where I ſay, that <hi>ſo much
my Lexicon would have told me;</hi>) but his giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no account of the nature of Ideas, That
is there remarqu'd as a Fundamental Defect,
and I find no cauſe yet to think otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Ibid. <hi>But Mr.</hi> Norris <hi>may ſee that he's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,
if he'll read over again the end of the
Firſt Chapter of</hi> Book I. <hi>where the Author begs
his Readers Leave,</hi> &amp;c. Miſtaken indeed, if
he had charged the Author with not defining
the Term <hi>Idea,</hi> but not at all miſtaken, in
caſe the thing charg'd upon him was the not
defining the <hi>Nature</hi> of Ideas; for of that the
Author gives no account, neither in the place
theſe Gentlemen refer to, nor any where elſe.</p>
                  <p>Ibid. <hi>It was ſufficient to him</hi> (viz. Mr.
<hi>Lock,) to ſhew in what manner, or if ye will, on
what occaſion we come to have different Ideas,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94628:128"/>
without its being neceſſary to ſpeak of the Ideas
themſelves.</hi> Here is an implicit Conceſſion
that Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> does not undertake to open the
nature of Ideas, and withal that that was the
thing laid to his Charge, which ſufficiently
clears the Reflecter from the pretended Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake.
But then withall 'tis affirmed here,
that there was no need he ſhould undertake
ſuch an Account. Now this being matter
of <hi>Judgment,</hi> not of <hi>Report,</hi> the thing muſt be
a little argued. Theſe Gentlemen ſay it was
ſufficient to ſhew how we come by our Ideas,
without ſpeaking of the Ideas themſelves.
Againſt this I contend it was not ſufficient,
it being impoſſible to give any ſatisfactory
account how we come by them, till their
nature be in ſome meaſure diſcover'd. For
how can any thing be affirm'd or denied of
any thing, unleſs its Nature be known?
How can any Attribute be given with any
certainty to an unknown Subject? Indeed
when the nature of the thing is ſufficiently
known and agreed upon, we need only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
the Term whereby we expreſs it: As
when 'tis ſuppoſed to be known what the
Nature of an Angle is, I need only ſay that a
Triangle is that which has Three Angles.
Which is the Riaſon why <hi>Euclid</hi> in his Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry
thought himſelf concern'd only to give
<hi>Nominal</hi> Definitions. For the nature of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi>
is evidently known; we ſee the very
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94628:129"/>
Eſſence of them, and therefore there needs
no other Definition but that of the Term on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whereby we ſignify them, that ſo there
may be no miſtake of our meaning; that
we may not be ſuppoſed to mean a <hi>Square</hi>
when we talk of a <hi>Circle.</hi> But when the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing is not known or agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(as in the preſent caſe) then a bare De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of the Term is not ſufficient; but the
thing it ſelf muſt be (at leaſt in general) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
before any Propoſition can be with
any certainty advanc'd concerning it. For
ſuppoſe inſtead of ſaying that our Ideas come
from our Senſes, I ſhould ſay that <hi>the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Object of our Conception</hi> (which is the
Nominal Definition) comes from our Senſes,
what advantage would this be to the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Propoſition; or how could it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
whether the immediate Object of our
Conception be from our Senſes or no, unleſs
it be firſt made known what this immediate
Object of our Conception is? We muſt
know its Nature, before we can derive its
Pedigree.</p>
                  <p>Paragr. 3. <hi>Mr.</hi> Lock <hi>hath maintain'd that
there are no Innate Ideas, ſince there is no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
wherein all Mankind agree. But to that
the Author oppoſes the Evident Propoſitions
which all the World agrees to,</hi> &amp;c. To that; To
what? Here is either a great Blunder, or a
very groſs Prevarication. What Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94628:129"/>
here ſaid to maintain, conſiſts of two diſtinct
Parts, a Propoſition, and a Reaſon of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
The Propoſition is, that there are no
Innate Ideas; the Reaſon is, becauſe there is no
Principle univerſally aſſented to. Now to
which of theſe is it that the Reflecter oppoſes
Self-evident Propoſitions? Not to the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
certainly, but to the Reaſon of it. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
Self-evident Propoſitions not to prove
againſt the Theſis laid down, that Ideas are
Innate (for that he expreſly denies, <hi>Pag.</hi> 20.)
but to prove againſt the Reaſon given, that
there are Principles univerſally aſſented to. As
may appear from the very Words of the place
refer'd to, <hi>Pag.</hi> 4, which I leave the Reader to
conſult. The ſhort of Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s reaſoning in
that part is this, If there are no Principles uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
aſſented to, then there are none In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
but there are no Principles univerſally
aſſented to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the Minor Propoſition is
what the Reflecter denied, and to which he
oppoſed evident Propoſitions, a thing granted
by the Author. Not that he intended to
infer thence, that there are Innate Ideas:
For tho it may follow that if there be Innate
Ideas they will be univerſally conſented to,
and conſequently if not ſo conſented to, they
are not Innate: Yet it does not follow that
if they <hi>are</hi> univerſally conſented to, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are Innate, that being accountable
for upon other Grounds. The Reflecter ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94628:130"/>
Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Conceſſion of Self-evident
Propoſitions, only to evince that according
to him, there muſt be Principles univerſally
conſented to, and conſequently that he ought
not to argue againſt Innate Ideas from the
want of ſuch Principles. But the Queſtion
of Innate Ideas themſelves is not here ſo
much as glanc'd at: And therefore ſays the
Reflecter, <hi>Pag. 5. There muſt be therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to him, ſome Principles to which all
Mankind do give an univerſal Conſent. I do
not ſay that this proves them Innate, but only
that there are ſuch Propoſitions</hi> wherein he
thought he had laid in a ſufficient Caution
againſt all Miſtake. And yet theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
would fain inſinuate as if the Reflecter
alledged evident Propoſitions in oppoſition
to the Theſis laid down, to prove that there
are Innate Notions, as plainly appears from
the State of the Queſtion which they are ſo
kind as to put for him in the very next
Words. For</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> Say they, <hi>The Queſtion is to know if
we underſtand the ſame thing by Innate Notions
and Evident Propoſitions, which is not aſſuredly
in the Ordinary uſage of the Word Innate, that
has not at all the ſame ſignification with that of
Evident.</hi> Had I oppoſed evident Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Theſis maintain'd, in order to
prove that there are Innate Notions, then
indeed the Queſtion might have turn'd upon
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94628:130"/>
this Hinge, whether we underſtand the ſame
by <hi>Evident</hi> and <hi>Innate;</hi> and their Saying
that this is the ſtate of the Queſtion, does
impute the other to me. But ſince my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to Self-evident Propoſitions is only to
prove againſt the reaſon of the Propoſition,
that there are Principles univerſally conſented
to, this is ſo far from being a true State of
the Queſtion, that 'tis an utter miſtake of
the Argument. 'Tis plain that my Deſign
was not to prove by that or by any other
Argument, that there are Innate Ideas, (for
I expreſly diſown them as well as Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi>)
but only to prove that there are Principles
of Univerſal Conſent. And for this I inſiſt
upon Self-evident Propoſitions, and I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wanting in the Argument to ſerve the
purpoſe for which it was uſed.</p>
                  <p>Ibid. <hi>Yet Mr.</hi> Norris <hi>ſuppoſing that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Eſſay confounds theſe Two things,
accuſes him of Contradicting himſelf, ſince he
granteth that there are evident Propoſitions.</hi>
Well, I find when Men are once got into a
Wood, 'tis a hard matter to get out again.
Here is ſtill a further continuation of the ſame
Blunder. I am far enough from ever ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that the Author of the Eſſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
theſe Two things, <hi>viz.</hi> Evident
Propoſitions and Innate Notions, and as far
from confounding them my ſelf, or from ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
from the Former to the Exiſtence of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94628:131"/>
the Latter, which I tell you again I expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny. Nor do I make the Author's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency
and Self-Contradiction to conſiſt
in granting evident Propoſitions, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Innate Notions (which neither of us
take to be the ſame) but in granting evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Propoſitions, and at the ſame time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
Principles of Univerſal Conſent: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I tax him with Self-Contradiction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Praragr.</hi> 4. One of the Reaſons which Mr.
<hi>Lock</hi> uſed to overthrow Inbred Ideas, is that
there is no Appearance that any has theſe Innate
Ideas, which he never minded. But Mr. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
maintains that the Conſequence is not good,
becauſe according to him (<hi>according to Mr.</hi>
Lock <hi>it ſhould be</hi>) our Spirit may receive Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
which we do not at all actually perceive,
as are the Ideas which the Memory preſerves. It
may be replied to him that he muſt prove that
we may have Notices which we never made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
on. <hi>It is replied again, that he need
not prove it, ſince Mr.</hi> Lock <hi>has freely
granted it more than once, and is alſo by
his Principles obliged to grant it; as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
in the Reflections themſelves,</hi> Pag. 8,
9. <hi>whither I refer the Reader.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Paragr. 5. <hi>The Author in reaſoning againſt
what Mr.</hi> Lock <hi>had ſaid of the Innate Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Morality, inſiſts anew upon this Bottom,
that he can evidently prove, even by Mr.</hi> Lock'<hi>s
Confeſſion, diverſe Principles of Morality. He
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94628:131"/>
concludes alſo from thence, that he is in the
wrong, to ſay that there are no Principles of
Practice to which Mankind give an univerſal
Conſent, ſince there are Principles of Morality un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controvertible.
But tho a thing be uncontroverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>It does not thence follow that 'tis Inbred
or Naturally known.</hi> What, again in the ſame
Blunder? Sure theſe Mens Heads turn round.
Who ever ſaid it does follow? Does the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecter
by this contend for Innate Notions? No
certainly; he only infers from evident Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Morality, that there are ſome that are
univerſally aſſented to, in oppoſition to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
who affirm'd there were no ſuch. But he
does no where make that an Argument for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Notions, which he expreſly declares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.
One would think theſe Men were hard
put to't for Imployment, thus to frame Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of their own, that they may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
overturn them again.</p>
                  <p>Paragr. 6. <hi>In fine, the Author after having
made diverſe Remarks like theſe which we relate,
upon Mr.</hi> Lock's <hi>Notions,</hi> &amp;c. But what if
theſe hitherto related be none of the <hi>Authors,</hi>
but your <hi>own?</hi> However, I believe the reſt
of thoſe diverſe Remarks would truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
like theſe, if repreſented by the ſame
Glaſs: But whether in reality they are like
theſe or no, I leave to the Conſideration of
Better Judges.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:94628:132"/>
Paragr. 7. <hi>This Definition is notwithſtanding
like to that of Father</hi> Malebranch. What if
it be, is it therefore Sufficient? 'Tis true,
Father <hi>Malebranch</hi> in the Second part of his
<hi>De Inquirend. Verit.</hi> Pag. 196, does thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
an Idea, <hi>Objectum Immediatum Mentis,</hi>
which is only a Nominal Definition, as Mr.
<hi>Lock</hi>'s is; but will theſe Gentlemen ſay that
he ſtops here, and gives no account of the
Nature of Ideas? If ſo, either they have not
read him, or do not underſtand him, or do
miſreport him.</p>
                  <p>Ibid. <hi>When we have no deſign to treat of the
Nature of a certain thing, it is ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
the Word which we uſe.</hi> If the nature of
the thing be evident and acknowledged, 'tis
ſufficient to define the Term, otherwiſe not.</p>
                  <p>Ibid. <hi>He inlarges very much, eſpecially to ſhew
that the Ideas are not all of the Emanations of
the Bodies which we ſee, which yet Mr.</hi> Lock
<hi>does not in the leaſt ſay.</hi> What if Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>
does not expreſly ſay ſo? He ſays however
that they are from our Senſes, that is, from
ſenſible Objects: And if ſo, then ſuppoſing
that he makes them real Beings, they muſt
either be Corporeal Emanations, or Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Images; the Abſurdity of both which I
was concern'd to ſhew. And I think it is
ſhewn ſufficiently.</p>
                  <p>Ibid. <hi>What ſeems to have ſet Mr.</hi> Norris <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe Reaſonings, is that Mr.</hi> Lock <hi>ſays, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94628:132"/>
moſt of our Ideas draw their Original from Senſe,
which ſignifies nothing elſe but this, that we could
have no Idea of Diverſs things, unleſs we had
perceiv'd them by means of the Senſes.</hi> If this
were all that Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> contends for, we are
better agreed than I was aware of; for 'tis
acknowledg'd alſo upon my Principles, that
the Senſes are the <hi>occaſions</hi> of our having Ideas;
that is, that God has eſtabliſh'd a certain Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Connexion between ſuch Impreſſions
made upon our Senſes and ſuch Ideas. Not
that theſe Impreſſions do cauſe or produce
theſe Ideas, but that they are Conditions at
the preſence of which God will, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which he will not raiſe them in, or to
ſpeak more properly, exhibit them to our
Minds. But that Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> means quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
thing from this, when he aſcribes the
Original of our Ideas to our Senſes, I think
no one that reads him with even ordinary
Attention, can doubt. 'Tis plain, that he
means that our Ideas do proceed from <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi>
namely, from ſenſible Objects, and are
by our Senſes convey'd into the Mind; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Hypotheſis of the Vulgar Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</p>
                  <p>Paragr. 8. <hi>Mr.</hi> Norris <hi>reproaches the Author
of the Eſſay of ſaying</hi> Pag. 147. Sect. 33. <hi>that
'tis by means of the Senſes that we form the Idea
of the Supreme Being.</hi> 'Twere well if theſe
Gentlemen were as free from Reproaching
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94628:133"/>
the Author of the <hi>Reflections,</hi> as he is from
reproaching the Author of the <hi>Eſſay:</hi> I ſhould
not then have had this Objection to anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Ibid. <hi>But our Critic has undoubtedly ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
err'd in this place.</hi> But what if our <hi>Critic</hi>
ſhould prove to be in the Right, and our <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics</hi>
to be they that ſo ſtrangely err? Undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
this would be but an ill come off after ſo
Magiſterial and Deciſive a Sentence. But
why is the Critic ſo ſtrongly preſumed to
have err'd? Why becauſe Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> after
having named Senſation and Reflection as the
Sources of all our Ideas, continues thus: <hi>It is
ſo in all our other Ideas of Subſtances, even of that
of God</hi> (that is to ſay, that they are all form'd
either by Senſation or Reflection) <hi>for if we
examin the Idea which we have of the ſupreme
and incomprehenſible Being, we ſhall find that it
comes to us the ſame way,</hi> (by the one or by the
other) <hi>and that the Complex Ideas that we have
of God and ſeparated Spirits, are compoſed of
the Simple Ideas that we have by Reflection. For
example, having form'd in our ſelves by our
own Experience the Ideas of Exiſtence, Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Knowledge, Power, Pleaſure, Succeſs, and
of divers other Properties, which 'tis better to
have than not to have; when we will form a juſt
Idea of the Supreme Being, we augment each of
theſe Ideas, joyning that of Infinity to them; and
thus we form the Complex Idea of the Divinity.
If Mr.</hi> Norris <hi>had read all this Article with
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94628:133"/>
Attention, he would have ſpared himſelf the pains
of ſeeking Figures of Retoric to refute an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which no body maintains.</hi> Now to ſet this
whole matter in a clear and fair light, the
ſhort of it is this: I had charged Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>
with deriving our Idea of God from the
Senſes. Herein they ſay I <hi>reproach</hi> him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
that Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> derives the Idea of
God not from <hi>Senſation,</hi> but from <hi>Reflection.</hi>
Well, be it ſo, yet this is to ſet the Idea of
God but one Remove further from the
Senſes ſtill, which will come to one and the
ſame thing at long run. For theſe Ideas of
Reflection are but a Secondary ſort Ideas that
reſult from the various Compoſitions and
Modifications of thoſe primary ones of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.
This is all that can poſſibly be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by this ſecond order of Ideas. They
are only a various Compoſition of the firſt.
For 'tis not in the Power of the Soul to make
any new Ideas it has not received; ſhe can
only variouſly modifie and Compound thoſe
which ſhe has. So that notwithſtanding this
Expedient, the Idea of God will be, tho not
<hi>immediately,</hi> yet <hi>mediately</hi> and ultimately from
the Senſes. If it be pleaded that theſe Ideas
of Reflection are not form'd out of thoſe of
Senſation, but from the Operation of the
Mind about thoſe Ideas. In anſwer to this,
I grant that the Mind may reflect upon its

they are Converſant about, and that theſe
Operations may then be conſider'd as Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that terminate the Underſtanding. But
then I ſay that 'tis impoſſible that hence
ſhould ſpring any new Ideas of a diſtinct
Nature from the reſt, it being both againſt
the Nature, and above the Power of the
Underſtanding to make its own Object. And
beſides, this Expedient is ſo far from helping,
that it rather heightens the Abſurdity. For
according to this Account, the Idea of God
would not only be a Creature, but a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Creature. Indeed, whether it be ſaid
that the Idea of God be from Senſation or
from Reflection, it would both ways follow
that 'tis a Creature; only there's this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between them, that in the former way,
it would be a Creature of God's making,
but in the latter way, a Creature of our own
making: Which I think is the greater Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity
of the two.</p>
                  <p>Ibid. <hi>He joyneth therewith ſome Reflections,
to make Father</hi> Malebranch'<hi>s Opinion more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
with which it does not fadge, no more
than with thoſe which he makes on diverſe places
of Mr.</hi> Lock'<hi>s Book.</hi> Thus theſe Gentlemen
are pleaſed to ſay; but ſince they offer nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Inſtance, nor Reaſon of it, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

Ibid. <hi>Whom concluding, he highly commends,
which a great many People will Subſcribe without
Trouble.</hi> Well, I am glad there is ſomething
wherein I have the good Fortune to agree
with this Noble Society, and if it will be any
Pleaſure to them to know how much I do
ſo, I ſhall take this occaſion to tell both them
and the World, that though I have writ
againſt Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> I have yet as great
thoughts of him as any of thoſe that ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
defend him; that I both honour his
Perſon, and admire his Book, which, bating
only ſome few things, I think to be one of
the moſt Exquiſite Pieces of Speculation that
is Extant. And that were I in order to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
improvement, to recommend but
Three Books only in the World, one of them
ſhould be this of Mr. <hi>Locks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Paragr. 9. <hi>We find furthermore at the end
of the Book where the Author retracts, having
maintain'd in an Engliſh Book, that Sin was
a Real thing, he declares now that he believes
'tis meer Nothing.</hi> This is a groſs Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
that ſavours neither of the Juſtice
nor of the Civility of the Preſs. <hi>He declares
now.</hi> How does he declare it? Expreſly or
by Conſequence? Not ſure expreſly. If by
Conſequence, not to remark the improprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of declaring a thing by Conſequence, or
the injuſtice of charging any Man with the
conſequences of any Opinion as by him <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:94628:135"/>
were they never ſo truly deduced,
does it follow, that becauſe I diſown the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiveneſs
of Sin, that therefore I hold 'tis a
<hi>meer Nothing?</hi> Suppoſe I ſhould ſay, that
theſe Gentlemens Ignorance in Philoſophy,
and the common Principles of Metaphyſicks
were not of a Poſitive Nature, do I thereby
ſay it is nothing? Muſt Sin either be Poſitive
or Nothing? Is there no Medium? What,
did theſe Gentlemen never hear of a <hi>Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</hi>
But this 'tis when Nature is not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
when Science is Uſurp'd, and when
a ſort of Men whoſe Talent was never known
to lie much towards Philoſophy, will needs
turn a Conventicle into a <hi>Port Royal,</hi> and ſet
up for <hi>Vertuoſo's.</hi>

<hi>Conſiderations upon the Nature of
Sin,</hi> I make Sin to be of a <hi>Poſitive</hi> Nature, upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

upon that Suppoſition, and do therefore freely own
my ſelf to have been in a Miſtake, and do here retract
it under my Hand. As to the preſent Diſcourſes I
know of nothing I have to <hi>Correct,</hi> only there is One
Notion which I find Occaſion to <hi>inlarge</hi> and carry on
further than at first I was aware of. It is in the
Third Beatitude concerning the <hi>Meek's inheriting

and to be the Seat of the Millennial Reign
of Chriſt. I do not <hi>unſay</hi> any part of my Former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,

a further Supplement to it. For which Notion I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
