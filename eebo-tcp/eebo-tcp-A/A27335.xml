            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To contend with him whether He or I can write beſt <hi>Latine,</hi> would be <hi>pedantick,</hi> and too much like himſelf, for he hath the wit to tell us that formerly he was a <hi>petty School-Maſter</hi> at <hi>Dantzik;</hi> and he <hi>wiſely</hi> relates this himſelf, upon as wiſe an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, in his <hi>26</hi>th <hi>Obſ.</hi> and <hi>1</hi>ſt <hi>Book;</hi> that the world may know, that he cannot only <hi>write</hi> Latine, but <hi>teach</hi> it for a need; and that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians may ſee the reaſon, why he is ſo <hi>Magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> in conſultations. To vie with him, whether He or I be <hi>the abler Phyſitian,</hi> would be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Me as Him; for this is a <hi>query</hi> too par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and very unhandſome between <hi>any two,</hi> and is not wont to be agitated but between en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and proud perſons: for Scholars diſputes ſhould be about <hi>things,</hi> and not about <hi>perſons.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50464:5"/>
Yea, and although in the caſe of a particular perſon, Phyſicians may differ in their opinion, and perhaps each think he hath all reaſon on his ſide; yet it is very <hi>baſe,</hi> for <hi>either</hi> of theſe to begin to print this caſe, and to condemn the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> were he never ſo guilty. For <hi>Example,</hi> This Gentleman, without giving me the leaſt Item thereof, calls me to a <hi>publick</hi> account, for a <hi>private</hi> Conſultation, and ſays of me, that in the particular caſe of your <hi>Daughter, my Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> had neither <hi>Method</hi> nor <hi>Reaſon</hi> in it. For, though it be againſt the Laws of Logick, <hi>to infer a general concluſion, for a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtance.</hi> Yet how prone are people, and apt to conclude that all <hi>my Practice</hi> is ſuch? until I ſome ways vindicate my ſelf from this <hi>aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>?

Arts and Sciences</hi> whatſoever: for if the Body be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered,</hi> the Soul can no more <hi>find out</hi> or work theſe, than an <hi>Artiſt</hi> can ſhew his skill without his <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>

Nor that we ought to be ſo volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, or <hi>ſelf-delighting,</hi> as to be unwilling at any time, <hi>when we are called thereunto,</hi> to ſit down and ſtay by a ſick or dying Patient, and to compaſſionate in the houſe of <hi>mourning,</hi> his ſighs and groans, and many ſad complaints: neither need we be much concerned, that the <hi>Aſtrologer and Fortune-teller,</hi> the cunning <hi>cheat</hi> or ſuſpected <hi>Wizard,</hi> the <hi>Chirurgion,</hi> the <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary,</hi> the hold <hi>confident,</hi> whether Farmer, Groom, Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, or Cobler, the <hi>Mountebank,</hi> or the <hi>Cordial</hi> or <hi>Pill-Doctors,</hi> that are <hi>always</hi> to be ſpoken with all moſt ever-ywhere at ſome <hi>Book-ſeller's</hi> Shop, in any part of the Kingdom, and do practiſe without <hi>ſeeing</hi> their Patients, or <hi>feeling</hi> their Pulſe, or knowing their Diſeaſe, or Age, or Sex or Strength, or any thing: that the <hi>Midwife,</hi> the <hi>Nurſe,</hi> the <hi>Neighbour Goſſip,</hi> Perſons of all ſorts, and of both ſexes do turn <hi>Doctors,</hi> and find a nearer way to Phyſick than going about to the <hi>Univerſities,</hi> and many times far more profitable, but at no time ſo honourable, nor yet ſo ſatisfactory unto their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> if they have any: for I would ask any of theſe <hi>Intruders</hi> into our <hi>faculty</hi> (I do not mean ſuch charitable Gentlewomen or Miniſters of a Pariſh, as do beſtow their skill <hi>gratis</hi> upon their poor

Neighbours, when no better help is to be had, but thoſe that make <hi>gain</hi> of Phyſick, and upon <hi>boaſting</hi> their skill, do prevent Patients from ſending for others that have more underſtanding in the <hi>Art)</hi> I ſay, I ask theſe, how they ſatisfy themſelves from being guilty of their Patients <hi>Blood,</hi> when they happen to dye under their Cure? and how they can approve themſelves for <hi>humble</hi> Perſons, yea, or excuſe themſelves from the height of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Impudence;</hi> that, condemning the <hi>modeſty</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of theſe men, that being bred <hi>Scholars</hi> from their youth, ſtudy firſt many years in the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,</hi> and afterwards go not forth to <hi>Practiſe,</hi> before they have ſubmitted themſelves unto the Tryal of the <hi>Learned,</hi> and by them are approved and ſent forth as fit for the imployment, in a year or two, perhaps as few months, do take up to Practiſe Phyſick, and do out-<hi>hector</hi> the other, who know more, than to be ſo able as they are, to <hi>bluſter and brag,</hi> as if they were the only knowing perſons and skilful in the <hi>Art;</hi> though they have no other <hi>Teſtimony</hi> thereof, than their <hi>own,</hi> and yet the People believe them, and <hi>ſo let them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this would grieve one indeed, but its helpleſs alſo, that when an <hi>honeſt,</hi> and perhaps <hi>able</hi> Phyſician, hath done all he can for his Patient, hath diſcharged his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> his <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> his <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> his <hi>good Nature,</hi> and <hi>all his Art;</hi> he ſhould yet miſerably be obnoxious, and lie open unto the obloquies and ſlanders of <hi>all</hi> ſorts of people; cenſured many times, and ſlighted when he cannot ſo much as <hi>ſtudy</hi> what his fault was; and condemned without being permitted firſt to anſwer for himſelf; neither indeed can he, for who can talk and reaſon his own caſe, with the hundredth part of the people, that will cenſure and condemn him?</p>
            <p>Phyſicians when they once go forth to Practiſe and leave the <hi>Univerſity,</hi> they ſeldom or never meet with any opportunity in the places where they dwell, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any publick proof that they underſtand their <hi>Art.</hi> If a Divine be a deſerving Gentleman, and one emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

for Learning, he need none <hi>other</hi> help than his <hi>own</hi> to publiſh this unto the World; for every Sermon he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers, is not only an <hi>exerciſe</hi> of his <hi>Function,</hi> but a <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of his <hi>Abilities,</hi> whilſt his Auditors that are always <hi>numerous,</hi> even every one of them that <hi>underſtands</hi> him, is at once a witneſs both of his <hi>Piety</hi> and of his <hi>Parts.</hi> If a Lawyer ſpeaks handſomely and <hi>pertinently</hi> unto a Caſe, it is done in the audience of thoſe <hi>Learned in the Law,</hi> and commonly before a <hi>Judg;</hi> and although the <hi>Clients</hi> Caſe goes againſt <hi>him,</hi> yet the Counſellors <hi>credit</hi> goes <hi>nothing</hi> the leſs, for the whole Court witneſſeth, that he ſpake as much to the purpoſe as could be ſaid, and pleaded like himſelf. But the Phyſician is expoſed naked unto every ones laſh, and be he never ſo good, if the ſucceſs proves bad, he hears generally <hi>ill,</hi> and there ſeldom wants ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy pickthanks or other, who perhaps to bring in a Friend of their own, into a Family that may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, can eaſily diſparage and blaſt a Man's Reputation, with groundleſs ſurmiſes and ſuggeſtions. We have not only to do with the <hi>Apothecary</hi> and <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion,</hi> and both their <hi>Boys (for Patients will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ask even theſe, of what value the Phyſician is);</hi> but with the <hi>Nurſe</hi> likewiſe, and the <hi>Midwife,</hi> with the <hi>Tender upon,</hi> and the <hi>Hanger-on,</hi> the <hi>twatling Goſſip,</hi> and the <hi>skilleſs buſie-Body;</hi> in effect, every one is Judg in our Caſe, and moſt commonly thoſe that have the leaſt knowledg have the greateſt confidence if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence in their verdicts.

Yea, <hi>good ſucceſs</hi> will not alwayes ward a Phyſician from others <hi>bad</hi> opinions, and I do not remember that I ever ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded worſe than when I ſucceeded beſt, and that by

this Stratagem, which is the <hi>fundus noſtrae calamitatis,</hi> and the worſt of all that hath yet been ſaid, other Phyſicians, that either <hi>do</hi> or <hi>ſhould</hi> underſtand the Art, and be beſt able to vindicate both the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> and its <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> ſome of them are ſo ſelf-conceited, envious, and covetous, that when they are called into a Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they are often the firſt that fling the ſtone at their fellow-Phyſicians; and if the Patient dye, they ſlanderouſly and privately ſuggeſt, that he took a wrong courſe, and <hi>killed</hi> him; if beyond their prognoſtick he recovers and <hi>lives,</hi> that he was ſo dangerous and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous, he would have killed him, but that Nature was ſo ſtrong as to contemn all the effort of his <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical</hi> and <hi>irrational</hi> Practice.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I could never hitherto ſo highly <hi>flatter</hi> my ſelf into ſo good an opinion of my parts or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in <hi>learning,</hi> as to harbour any thoughts, much leſs reſolve upon any means of coming forth into print: <hi>Alas!</hi> I am hardly ſo learned, as to know that the <hi>whole</hi> of what I know, is not the <hi>tenth</hi> of what I am ignorant of; and if I ſhould come abroad as ſtanding upon my <hi>own Legs,</hi> my ſtature is but low and my abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities lower, and I might juſtly be afraid, that I ſhould be ſo far from appearing like a <hi>Saul</hi> among his <hi>Brethren,</hi> taller by the head than other Phyſicians <hi>(as me thinks all thoſe ſhould be that voluntarily put themſelves in print)</hi> that rather I ſhould ſeem like a <hi>Pigmey</hi> among the <hi>Giants.</hi> And, if in any thing I ſhould pretend, <hi>Dwarf though I am,</hi> to ſtand upon the great ones <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> and by that means to ſee farther than they, ſo as to enlarge the <hi>Horizon</hi> of our Art, by making diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of ſome <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> ſome new things in Phyſick not treated of before; <hi>Alas!</hi> there are many things new to <hi>me,</hi> which may be old to <hi>othe<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

            <head>ANIMADVERSIONS On Mr. <hi>Loſs,</hi> and on his Medicinal Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in General.</head>
            <p>MR. <hi>LOSS</hi> is a Gentleman of ingenious parts, but not ingenuous; a good Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but not ſo good as he eſteems him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; one that writes ſmooth Latin, and knows it too, and hath made good uſe of it, and for it hath been highly eſteemed for a great Phyſitian by theſe that underſtand his Latin better than his Art; in which yet, he might have done much better, had his <hi>Modeſty</hi> been equal with his <hi>Skill</hi>: but he is beſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the parts where he lives, and is there diverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accounted of. If ſome of his Neighbours were to draw his Portraiture, it would be with a Black coal, others with a white, reputing him for a very honeſt man, and mighty able in his Art: whether he beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervs this, or that character, let the Reader judg.</p>
            <p>He ſtiles himſelf the <hi>Heidelbergh, Palatinate, Dorcheſter Phyſician,</hi> being hard put to it for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Title, becauſe he is neither Doctor of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, nor yet a Licentiat that I know of, other than by the Biſhop's Officer of the Dioceſs; and yet how he comes forth in print and in pomp too, with an affected bombaſt Title, full indeed in the Mouth, but in the Ear empty; it makes a loud noiſe, but to little pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50464:12"/>
much like the hard words of ſome outlandiſh Prince's Titles of Honour, and yet belonging to none other, than an Alien Practitioner of Phyſick in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> What I pray are we, or he, the wiſer that he was born at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> or that <hi>Heidelbergh</hi> is a City in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> or that he now lives in the Town of <hi>Dorcheſter.</hi> 2dly. It is more to the <hi>point,</hi> that he was formerly a petty School-maſter at <hi>Dantzick.</hi> That afterward, becauſe of the <hi>German</hi> Wars, he fled over into <hi>England</hi> for ſafety and ſubſiſtence, and applyed himſelf to one Mr. <hi>Olivian</hi> of <hi>Blandford,</hi> famous in his time for Chirurgery and Phyſick, who took him into his houſe, as Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> himſelf tells us <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. and upon what terms any one may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, and ſome do know. That afterward, he was recommended to an honeſt Apothecary of <hi>Dorcheſter</hi>; one whom he hath required ſince his death, by publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by Name, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Obſ.</hi> 22. for one debauched in his youth, and therefore Melancholy in his old Age, and purſued with impious and blaſphemous thoughts againſt God. Taking up his quarter in this Town, and with this Apothecary, after a few Market-days, as many before him, and ſince have done, at an eaſy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and price, indeed none at all, and without any trouble of performing any Univerſity Exerciſes, the Country Market-people, do by and by dub him, and he commenceth Doctor in the no-Univerſity of <hi>Dorcheſter</hi>; where he hath raigned as a <hi>Dominus fac totum</hi> theſe many years, adding to the repute of his Art, as great a Profeſſion of Religion, and yet unworthily ſlighting and ſlandering all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phyſicians that have lived by him, or have been joyned with him; I could name their Names, but its needleſs. Paſs we on from our Grave Author, but he is not <hi>è Coo</hi> ſenex, to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful Medicinal Obſervations; and if they be not likewiſe as empty almoſt as his Title, excepting the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin only, let any one judge.</p>
            <p>That I may not ſeem to cavil with him, or to be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50464:12"/>
more willing to make faults in his Book than find them, I deſire the Reader to take notice, that whoſoever he be that puts forth Medicinal Obſervations, he doth witneſs unto the World the truth of theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That his Obſervations are Medicinal,</hi> that is, ſuch as do belong to Phyſick, and of which a Phyſitian ought to take cognizance in his Patient, or to uſe this Gentleman's one words, in his Epiſtle dedicatory, <hi>In dignoſcendis &amp; curandis Morbis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That they are choice, &amp; Obſervatione digniſſima,</hi> as himſelf alſo ſays; Things that highly deſerve to be taken notice of, as being no rubbiſh, but finely ſearced and ſelected out of the maſs of common and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Medicinal matters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That they are true,</hi> not taken up upon truſt from others, credulouſly, and by too eaſy a belief, much leſs meer forgeries in the Author's brains, but ſuch as he hath had experience and proof of. <hi>Relictis enim</hi> (ſaith he again) <hi>inani logomachiâ, &amp; ſutilibus diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unculis, in quibus multi conſeneſcunt, maximi ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per feci experientiam, tantum enim novit medicus quantum aut vidit aut probavit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet notwithſtanding all this, either I am groſly miſtaken, or our Obſervator is culpable in all theſe three particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Forgeries</hi> I ſhall prove in my Animadverſions on the 15<hi>th Obſerv. and</hi> 2<hi>d Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Trivial Remarks, and inobſervable Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> do fill up his Book almoſt every where; a taſte whereof I ſhall give the Reader in my Animadverſions on his 1 <hi>Obſerv. and</hi> 1 <hi>Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His non-Medicinal Medicinals,</hi> I ſhall now give an account of; and that the ordinary Reader may be able to judg better of what I ſay, and to determine whether I deal fairly with mine Adverſary, I ſhall firſt ſet down, what thoſe Medicinal things are, of which Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Obſervations ought to conſiſt: &amp; afterward, I ſhall preſent the Reader with a Catalogue of our Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator's
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50464:13"/>
non-Medicinal impertinencies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What things are Medicinal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All things that are medicinal ſeem to me compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reducible unto theſe two general Heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Who.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>What.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>To the firſt. <hi>Who</hi> the Patient is, I refer all ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of him, as may contain whatſoever is in him obſervable, and may give light, either to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of his Diſeaſe, or to its Cure. Not, that all the particulars which I ſhall mention, need to be taken into conſideration in all Patients; but that every one of them may be obſervable in ſome one or other. Not again, that they will give light to every one, but that they may give light to any Phyſician, that hath read <hi>Natural Philoſophy, Anatomy,</hi> and <hi>the Inſtitutions of Phyſick,</hi> and underſtands them.</p>
            <p>In the Patient there are theſe three ſorts of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervables.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>His Naturals.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>His non-Naturals.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>His former praeter-Naturals.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>To his <hi>Naturals,</hi> belong;</p>
            <p n="1">1. His <hi>Parentage,</hi> what the ſtock is he comes of. I do not intend by this his Pedigree or Gentility, but whether his Parents were wholſom or not, healthy or unhealthy: for ſuch as the Tree is, ſuch is the Fruit. Yet my meaning is not again that if the Patient hath an Hereditary Diſeaſe, becauſe the Phyſician ought to take notice of it himſelf, that therefore it is fit for him to publiſh ſo much to all the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His <hi>Age</hi>; for our Temperament changeth much with our Age. Youth is hot and moiſt. Man-hood hot and dry; Middle-age cold and dry, and Old-age cold and moiſt. And by the Temperament we in part come to know what humour abounds moſt in the Body. There are alſo Diſeaſes proper to ſome Ages, and there are other conſiderations proper to this Head.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50464:13"/>
But my purpoſe is not, that a Phyſitian ſhould publiſh a Regiſter of all his Patients ages: for neither do the old Ladies deſire to be told that they are ſo, nor yet the very young, that they are Ladies yet too young; or if at preſent they do not concern themſelves that their age is ſpoken of, becauſe they are young, yet ten or twenty years hence, when the printing in this Gentleman's Book, will be as legible as now it is, they will not be overpleaſed, eſpecially if they have not yet got Husbands, to have their age ſo eaſily lookt into, at every Bookſellers ſhop.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Sex</hi>: for Males ordinarily are hotter and dryer, Females colder and moiſter. Males are more active generally, and their manner of life is more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious and abroad, more expoſed to dangers, and to company. Females are more ſedentary and retired, and adapt to melancholy. There are alſo many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes that are appropriated to each Sex. But I do not perſwade any Phyſician to lay aſide the modeſty due to each Sex, &amp; to publiſh the names of Perſons that are yet alive, troubled with this or that diſeaſe, proper to their Sex; but not proper to be taken notice of by all of the other Sex.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His <hi>Natural Conſtitution</hi>; To which I refer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. His <hi>Complexion,</hi> which is wont to ſhew it ſelf principally in the countenance, whether that be fair, black, ruddy, or yellow. And this helps alſo to diſcover what humour is moſt predominant in the Body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His <hi>Temperament</hi>; whether that of his whole body, or more obſervable in any of the particular parts of it, as the Head, Stomach, Lungs, Liver, Spleen &amp;c. that of the whole Body may be much gueſſed at by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His <hi>Diſpoſition</hi>; whether he be moroſe, or affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, weak, or pettiſh and angry. Hitherto alſo may belong what his other paſſions are, how he moans and how he dreams.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50464:14"/>4. His <hi>Habit of Body,</hi> by which I underſtand not his Bulk only, whether he be fat or lean, fleſhy or thin, but alſo whether the veſſels appear in the skin large and conſpicuous, or little and ſmall; whether the contextures of the skin it ſelf be with wide and open pores, or with narrow and cloſe; whether the skin feels ſoft or hard, rough or ſmooth; whether the Hair be of this colour or of that, much or little, harſh or ſoft, curled or ſtraight, quick of growth or ſlow, long-laſting or that ſoon falls off, and decays.</p>
            <p>By theſe his <hi>Naturals,</hi> as by ſo many helps, the Phyſitian may underſtand what humour is moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant naturally in his Patient's Body, and whether the preſent peccant humour, and the diſeaſe be nearer or farther off from his natural conſtitution, and what meaſure of health is to be aimed at in his recovery, and what probability there is of it.</p>
            <p>To his <hi>non-Naturals,</hi> belong theſe queries.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is the <hi>Air</hi> he breaths in?</p>
            <p>To this belongs the Country he dwels in, the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his habitation, the time and ſeaſons of the year, the wind, and weather, the influences of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and the neighbourhood of any thing that is contagious or noxious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What <hi>Dyet</hi> hath he kept?</p>
            <p>To this belong the ſubſtance, quantity, quality, manner of preparing, order of uſing, and the time of taking either his Meat or Drink. But it is not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, though the Patient ſhould be a Drunkard, or Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, or great Tobacconiſt, to follow this Gentleman's example, and publiſh them for ſuch in print.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What <hi>Exerciſe</hi> doth he uſe?</p>
            <p>To this belongs whether he uſeth any exerciſe or none; what its kind is; when the time, before dinner, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after, and upon a full ſtomach; as alſo how long it is continued, whether only until the body begin to ſwell a little and grow florid, or until it ſweats and is weary.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What hath been his <hi>ſleeping and waking</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50464:14"/>To this belongs the poſture he ſleeps in, the time how long, the time when he begins, as alſo the benefit or hurt which is received thereby.</p>
            <p n="5">5. What are his <hi>Excretions or Retentions?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this belongs very many things, even all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſenſible evacuations of the Body, or non-eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, and above all the inſenſible tranſpiration, which as <hi>Sanctorius</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Medicina Statica,</hi> by many degrees exceeds all the ſenſible.</p>
            <p n="6">6. What are the <hi>Paſſions of his Mind?</hi> his Love, or Joy, or Grief, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To his <hi>former praeter-naturals,</hi> belong an enquiry after ſuch ſickneſſes as at any time heretofore he hath ſuffered in any remarkable manner, what they were, by what cauſes extraordinary they came about, what ſymptoms did follow them, and what did formerly do him either good or hurt. For theſe things many times will much contribute to the underſtanding of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, and its deſired cure. And thus much briefly of the firſt General, <hi>Who</hi> the Patient is.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond <hi>What,</hi> in the ſtating of caſes already paſt, of which Medicinal Obſervations are made, do belong theſe two parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What the Patients <hi>Complaints</hi> were?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What the Phyſitian did <hi>fore-ſee</hi> or prognoſticate, what he did <hi>do,</hi> and what was the <hi>effect</hi> of all?</p>
            <p>To the firſt of theſe belong the Patient's praeter-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals in the caſe propoſed, and they can be none other, than either his <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> or its <hi>cauſes,</hi> or <hi>ſymptoms,</hi> and becauſe theſe are accidents, <hi>quae adeſſe vel abeſſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt ſine interitu ſubjecti</hi>; but which cannot ſubſiſt without their ſubject, therefore hereunto likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the diſquiſition of the part or <hi>parts affected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not reckon up all diſeaſes and what belong to them, their cauſes, or the parts affected; that would be to tranſcribe <hi>Phyſick</hi> and <hi>Anatomy,</hi> but foraſmuch as the Patients complaints are generally ſymptoms, and by ſymptoms principally are found out the diſeaſe,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50464:15"/>
the cauſes, and the parts affected, it will be no great digreſſion to ſuch as I write unto, if I ſet them down here the heads of Symptoms.</p>
            <p>All the Symptomatical complaints which any Patient can make, they muſt belong to one of theſe three Heads.</p>
            <p>To his <hi>injured Actions</hi> or Functions, whether ſuch as are <hi>diminiſhed,</hi> or <hi>depraved,</hi> or totally <hi>aboliſhed</hi>: and whether again they be,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Animal</hi>: whether
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Principal,</hi> as Reaſon, Imagination, &amp;c. or</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Leſs-Principal,</hi> as Senſe and Motion.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>Senſe</hi> belong all a Patients Complaints of Pain, whether heavy, pricking, ſhooting, corroding, beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Motion</hi> belong all Geſtures and Poſtures of the Body, as alſo Tremblings, Shiverings, Convulſions, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Vital,</hi> whether belonging to his
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Reſpiration,</hi> be it weak or ſtrong, free or ſtopt, ſhort or long; or</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Pulſe,</hi> be it ſtrong or weak, quick or ſlow, &amp;c.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Reſpiration of the Pulſe do depend the Circulation of the Blood.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Natural,</hi> whether belonging to
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The Formation of the</hi> Faetus <hi>in the Womb,</hi> done wonderfully and ſtrangely, when neither We, nor our Parents think on't; a Meditation, which alone me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks is enough to convince an Atheiſt.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>His Nutrition and Accretion,</hi> ſubſervient where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto are vulgarly reputed, <hi>Attraction, Retention, Concoction, and Expulſion.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I am not ignorant of ſome men's finding fault with this ancient Diviſion, who do reduce it unto the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chotomy of <hi>Animal</hi> and <hi>Vital,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Natural</hi> is ſuppoſed to be nothing elſe but involuntary Animal: But, as far as I can yet underſtand, there ſeems then to me no neceſſity at all of any Diviſion in us, for all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50464:15"/>
our Actions may be accounted <hi>Animal,</hi> ſince I cannot conceive what <hi>Vital</hi> is, if I abſtract from it <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> which belong to <hi>Animal</hi>: and if the Formation of us in the Womb, be Involuntary <hi>Animal,</hi> as alſo our <hi>Nutrition</hi> and <hi>Accretion,</hi> why may not all our Actions be <hi>Animal</hi> Voluntary, Involuntary, or Mixt?</p>
            <p n="2">2. To his <hi>Excretions</hi> or <hi>Retentions,</hi> whether</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> by the Pores of the skin, or</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Particular,</hi> by the Eyes, Ears, Noſe, Mouth, Bladder, Belly, Womb, &amp;c. The things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this Head are very large.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To his <hi>Altered Qualities,</hi> whether</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>Firſt Sort,</hi> as Hot, Cold, Moiſt, Dry, and their Compounds; or</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of the <hi>Second Sort,</hi> as Hard, Soft, Rare, Denſe, Light, Weighty, Subtile, Craſs, Arid, Slippery, Friable, Glutinous, Rough, Smooth, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of the <hi>Third Sort,</hi> as belonging to Colour, Smell, Taſte, or Sound. And thus much of the <hi>Firſt</hi> Part of the <hi>Second</hi> General, <hi>What.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>Second</hi> belong the Phyſician's Judgment on the Caſe, what is the Part affected; what the Diſeaſe; and what the Cauſe is of the Diſeaſe. His Prognoſticks touching the Event; His Method of Cure, and all his Inſtruments for the ſatisfying his Indications by a right uſe of Remedies <hi>Dietetick, Chirurgick,</hi> and <hi>Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceutick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe and all things belonging to theſe, are the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and Boundaries of all ſuch Medicinal things, of which Medicinal Obſervations ought to conſiſt.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>A Catalogue of Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> his Impertinencies.</head>
               <p>IF I ſhould go about to mention all the particulars of his Non-Medicinals in his Book of Medicinal Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, I doubt whether I ſhould not tranſcribe a great ſhare of it; I ſhall therefore content my ſelf with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50464:16"/>
mentioning ſome of the chief Heads, to which they all ſeem reducible. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Divine or Moral Meditations</hi> are not Medicinal, I do not ſay they are not good, yea moſt willingly I do acknowledg that Divinity and Morality do treat of the moſt Excellent things; ſuch as ſo far exceed mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Phyſick, as the Soul is in worth above the Body. And foraſmuch as the World are generally apt to brand Phyſicians more than other Men, with the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſin of Atheiſm, I do heartily wiſh, that every Phyſician would vindicate his Profeſſion and himſelf, as much as may be, from that moſt Ignominious ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by demonſtrating his Piety towards God, his Charity towards his Neighbour, and his Sobriety in his Life and Converſation; that the World may ſee that although his Studies lead him further than others, into the inward Receſſes and dark ſecret Operations of Nature, yet even therefore is the God of Nature by him much the more admired, and moſt worthily Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But what hath a Phyſician to do with theſe things in a Book of Phyſick? The Cure of Souls doth belong unto an other Faculty, the Cure of Bodies is ſufficient for ours; and although many Parſons turn Phyſicians, yet I would have no Phyſician turn Parſon, except it be then, when there is none other to be had, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or pray with a ſick or dying Patient. But to mix matters of the Soul, in a Book of Medicines for the Body, is <hi>Fanaticiſm</hi>; and what wiſe man will condemn Medicinal Obſervations in print, for not being Larded with Divine Meditations?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Geography</hi> is no part of Medicine. Indeed the Region or Country a Patient dwels in, the Situation of his habitation, its being expoſed to injurious Winds and Weather, or too much ſhut up from the acceſs of free and open Air: the having in its Neighbourhood the Sea, or ſome Lake, Ponds, or Fens, or any thing elſe that may be noiſom or infectious. Theſe things do belong to Air, one of the ſix <hi>Non-Naturals</hi>; but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50464:16"/>
I pray to what part of Phyſick belong theſe Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons following, gravely ſet down by our Author in his Book?</p>
               <p>That <hi>Dewliſh</hi> is ſix miles from <hi>Dorcheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Frampton</hi> is a ſmal Town four miles from <hi>Dorcheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Milburn</hi> is ſix miles from <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> in the Road to <hi>Blandford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Haw-Church</hi> is three miles from <hi>Lime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Athethamſton</hi> is four miles from <hi>Dorcheſter.</hi> And to put an end unto this ſorry ſtuff,</p>
               <p>That <hi>Winston</hi> is three miles from <hi>Dorcheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One would think that in theſe and ſuch-like Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, our Author were ambitious of ſhewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a <hi>petite</hi> Geographer, one very well skilled in the Situation and diſtance of the places about <hi>Dorcheſter</hi>; not a Village there, or Gentleman's Seat, but as he hath occaſion he mentions them, and tells you more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly than any Map, which way theſe lye, and how far they are from his <hi>Cittadel</hi> or Metropolis of the Town of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> where he hath lain as it were Perdiu, like a Spider in the Center of his Web, for near fourty years; and I believe when he is ſent for there abroad, he is able to inſtruct the Meſſenger himſelf, which is the beſt way, and how far it is unto his Patient, for in all this time, he hath been all about the Country, even over and over; and he ſeems emulous in his Book, in thoſe matters, to out-vie the Poſt-boy and the Carrier.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Heraldry</hi> is no part of Phyſick, and yet how many lines doth this Gentleman imploy to tell us who are the Gentry of <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> whoſe true Worths and Qualities needed none of his Blazoning. How buſie is he to tell us who are <hi>Knights,</hi> and who are <hi>Eſquires,</hi> which of theſe are in his account <hi>Heroes,</hi> and what Gentlewomen are his <hi>Heroinae</hi>; of what honoured ſtock and Pedigree they are, what their moſt Illuſtrious Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent is, who their Fathers were, and who their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and of what Noble Family came their Mothers.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50464:17"/>
He ſeems in thoſe to have had a ſmall Deſign or Plot upon them, by a ſort of fawning flattery, to win them over to make uſe of him, or elſe, to buttreſs up his fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Reputation amongſt them; Compenſating unto himſelf their now neglect, by publiſhing what a great Phyſician he hath already been, by having been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted in ſo many great Families, as his Book makes mention of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Encomiums</hi> and <hi>Commendations of People</hi> is no Medicinal Obſervation, and yet how induſtrious in this particular alſo is our Gentleman? He tells us this is an honeſt Man, and skilful in his Art, that a moſt Reverend Miniſter and vigilant Paſtor. And in his Commendations he ſpends the beſt part of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, which it ſelf contains in it little remarkable, and leſs that is praiſe-worthy; for he ſeems to have written it only, that thereby he might have occaſion to name the Patient, and commend him. Such a Gentleman ſays he, was as eminent for Vertue, as high by Birth, and he dyed Piouſly. Such a Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man plaid excellently upon the Lute. Such a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman was Pious, and accompliſhed with the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of all ſorts of Vertues. Another was much given to read the Bible, a third was Fair and Beautiful, a fourth an extraordinary good Houſewife. I do not in the leaſt either envy or deny any of theſe worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons their deſerved praiſe, but buying the Book for <hi>Medicinal Obſervations,</hi> amongſt all thoſe Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations which this Author beſtows upon others, me thinks I find little or none at all owing unto himſelf, for having in part thus deceived me, by putting into my hands a ſort of <hi>Academy of Complements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Publiſhing and divulging of other mens faults, errors, or ſins,</hi> ought to be no part of a Phyſick Book, and yet how the ſame Man that commends ſome to the height, condemns others no leſs, ventilating their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cenſuring them, and making his own Patients examples of God's vindictive Juſtice; but I will not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50464:17"/>
name them in Engliſh, it's too much that he hath named them in Latin.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Mens Trades or way of Lively-hood,</hi> when they contribute nothing to the Knowledg or Cure of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, it is impertinent to mention them in a Phyſical caſe. And yet with what a Catalogue of the <hi>victum quaeritantium</hi> in and about <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> doth this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman furniſh us; telling us who is a <hi>Carter, a Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a Grocer, a Glover</hi>; and what not? So that if any one hath a Child to put forth to Apprentice therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, or ſome occaſion for himſelf to make uſe of any of theſe Trades, no Regiſter-Book that had been kept in an Office for the purpoſe could better inform him in this matter, than this Gentleman's Book of <hi>Medicinal Obſervations</hi>: there he may find the ſeveral ways of getting ones Living; and who the perſons are that have applyed themſelves unto each Trade; what their Chriſtian and Sirnames be, where the place of their abode: if out of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> how far from it; as alſo how they are to paſs in the world: ſome he tells us are Rich, ſome Poor, and ſome indifferently accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated with the goods of Fortune.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, not to be tedious. It is impertinent to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, that in all caſes, <hi>the Names of Patients,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as are yet alive, ſhould be affixed unto the Narratives of their Diſeaſes. Some good Authors have indeed ſometimes ſet down their Patients Name, and it is fit it ſhould be ſo, if they be no ways injured thereby, &amp; the caſe be ſo ſtrange &amp; rare, that otherwiſe it will not eaſily be believed. But this Gent. ſpares none, neither Male nor Female, be the Diſeaſe what it will; and be the perſons liable or not liable, to be ſham'd or wrong'd; as if he had purpoſed to give the World a Catalogue of his Patients, more conſulting his own Credit, in having the Repute of a Phyſician of ſo great Practice, than the Reputation of his Patients whom thereby he hath diverſly injured. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are many Diſeaſes which prudent perſons do
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50464:18"/>
not deſire that every one ſhould know that they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with.</hi> Becauſe, although we have all the ſame Comely and Uncomely parts, ſo that no man can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably mock another, for what is incident unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; yet it is too often ſeen that people in a pet, or paſſion, or to gratify ſome unreaſonable fantaſie or humour, do many times ſcoff and laugh at, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe abuſe their Neighbours; even upon ſuch ſlight ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts: and therefore wiſe men what they can, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this, by concealing ſome Diſeaſes; and ſurely they cannot but think otherwiſe of them that publiſh them. Beſides,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Infirmity of the Body, is not always the only concern of the Patient when he is named.</hi> For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his credit and reputation is likewiſe brought upon the ſtage, perhaps his imprudence and follies are exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: yea, his very ſins and wickedneſſes raked into. I will not quote theſe Obſervations, yet I ſay thus much; Suppoſe our Author himſelf were guilty of ſome ſuch things as are not fit to be named, and ſhould fall into the Gout, or ſome other Diſeaſe that might give occaſion of a ſeeming juſt defamation, and of making him an example of God's juſt Judgment upon him, in puniſhing him in his Age, for the ſins of his Youth; I am perſwaded he could not take it well; and yet for reaſons beſt known unto himſelf, thus, even juſt thus, doth he ſerve ſome, who certainly never ſent for him, or gave him a Fee, thus to defame them.</p>
               <p>What though ſome men have Palſies and weakneſs in their Nerves, who did in their youthful time drink ſtrong Ale and generous Wines, more perhaps than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; is it therefore a neceſſary and undeniable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence that from thence only, or principally, they contracted their <hi>Palſey</hi>? Are there not hundreds that have drank as much, and yet were never ſo Paralitick? Or what if a Phyſician privately and with himſelf alone ſhould conclude that this were the only or chief cauſe, muſt he needs therefore tell all the World his Patient's
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50464:18"/>
name; both his Chriſtian and Sirname, his Trade, and the Place where he dwels, that nothing might be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the ſtigmatizing of the man? Alas! We are all of us more ſinners than we deſire publickly to be told of; and this ſort of open reproof, eſpecially without firſt trying private, is likelier to increaſe ſin, by ſtirring up ſtrife, than to work the ſinner unto a true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and will ſooner harden him with Impudence, than ſoften and melt him into Tears. And at length, this is the buſineſs rather of a Divine, than of a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian; and its a piece of charity much fitter for a Cloſet than a Printing-Preſs. And laſtly, he that undertakes it alſo, muſt be ſure not to be guilty of the ſame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or of as bad.</p>
               <p>What if any one hath got an unſeemly Diſeaſe? though it be with never ſo much innocency contracted, may not his modeſty yet oblige him perhaps to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it? And may he not be unwilling that his Neighbours, his Servants, yea ſo much as his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould know it? And can ſuch an one take it well, when he finds it put forth in print, with his name appended, and the witneſs of his Phyſician to atteſt it?</p>
               <p>There are many Women ſo modeſt, that unwiſely and incautelouſly, they do ſometimes ſacrifice their lives to that miſtaken vertue: concealing ſo long their Feminine Diſeaſes from their Phyſician, until it is too late to diſcover them. Would not ſome ſuch bleſs themſelves and bluſh, when having told them to him, they ſhould hear that he hath told them again unto all the World, and here put both their Diſeaſes and their Names in print? Theſe, and ſome ſuch as theſe have been the effects of this Gentleman's publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his Patients Names; a thing not only Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, but Injurious, proving a diſcomfort, if not a diſcredit to ſeveral of them: and before he printed his Book, he was adviſed of the Imprudence of the action, but in vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:50464:19"/>Having thus reckoned up ſome heads of Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, I cannot eaſily imagine any other cauſe why our Author ſhould patch up <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his ſleeve, with pieces and patterns of all ſorts of ſtuff, unleſs he had been ambitious of a Party-coloured Coat, to have ſomething of every thing in his Book, with this Motto, <hi>Omne tulit punctum.</hi> But he may call to mind theſe two Verſes;

               </p>
               <p>And I do ſeriouſly queſtion whether his Book, which by theſe and other ſtuffings he hath ſwelled up to the bulk and price of half a Crown, if all this Garbiſh were out, and with it all his vulgar Medicinals and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Remarks, might not be ſold at near its worth, for half a Shilling.</p>

                           <head>The Firſt Obſervation. A Counter-cleft.</head>
                           <p>THE Life of Man, is not only circumſcribed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in narrow bounds, but obnoxious likewiſe to many miſeries and dangers; and it is a certain Ocean of calamities, but not the ſame to all. Which way ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you turn your ſelf, all things that are about you be not only uncertain and not to be truſted unto, but for the moſt part, they threaten openly, and do ſeem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a preſent death: ſo that you know not what a night may bring forth. Go a Shipboard, and there is but one foot between you and death; walk in the ſtreets of a City, and look how many tyles there are on the houſes, ſo many are the dangers you are obnoxious unto. Get a horſeback, and if but one foot faulters, your life is in danger. Take this Man for an example, near three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years old, whoſe name was <hi>Michaeli;</hi> for many years much accuſtomed to govern and drive forward a Cart with four Horſes, and by this very labour earning his living. This Man, little fearing that death was ſo near; being caſt from a ſtumbling Jade, which he rid upon going to water, daſh't his forehead againſt a ſtony ground, and receiving there a wound by the fall, by others help he was taken up and carried home half-dead. By and by he vomited choler and fell a bleeding at the noſe, a ſure ſign if we may believe <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that the Brain was ſhaken, and ſome ſmall Vein was broke. There was called with me a Chirurgeon, one skilful in his Art, and an honeſt man. Having made diligent ſearch, we find that the wound was hardly skin-deep. The Chirurgeon therefore without more ado binds up the wound according to Art: in the <hi>interim,</hi> the bowels being firſt waſhed with a Glyſter, ſome blood
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50464:20"/>
in his Plethorick Body was taken away by the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Cephalick Vein. The next day we find all things worſe, and plainly deadly; for his Body was in a Fever with ſtupidneſs and deliring, and being mute unto all that was asked, which our chief Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in Medicine, in the <hi>1</hi>ſt of his <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> and the <hi>14</hi>th tells us are very bad in hurts of the Head: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we begin wholly to deſpair of him. Nevertheleſs, we give him our helping hand in his deplorable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the Chirurgeon, that he might not ſeem to omit any thing which in ſuch caſes Art is wont to preſcribe, &amp; that it might more certainly appear whether the forehead-bone had any hurt, which we were afraid of, inſtructed by the Oracle of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> dilated the wound inflicted on the forehead, but that bone was found whole and without hurt: neither could we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any thing by our diligent feeling about his head, the Patient himſelf being plainly ſtupid and mute. Yet there was great conjecture of a broken Skull: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we took counſel about opening it with a Trepan. But what fals out? This miſerable old Man, having been almoſt all the day ſeiſed with a ſleepy Diſeaſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evening fell into an horrible Convulſion, and within few hours died. His Skull being opened after his death, in the hinder-part of his head oppoſite to his forehead, there was found a <hi>Fiſſure</hi> or <hi>Counter-cleft,</hi> which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>; and great ſtore of gore mixed with corruption, lying upon the <hi>dura</hi> matter, which was his death. So that <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaid true, that <hi>Cicero</hi> of Phyſicians, that it is wont ſometimes ſo to fall out, that the blow lights upon one part, and the <hi>Fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> happens in another.</p>

               <head>Animadverſions on this firſt Obſervation.</head>
               <p>HAD not Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> highly incenſed me with ſuch vilifying expreſſions behind my back, as did not only report me for no Doctor, but no Scholar likewiſe; I ſhould never have been ſo prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical or buſie as to have concerned my ſelf with him or his Book. But, ſince beſides his private ſlanders, he is pleaſed to publiſh an harſh cenſure of me, in his 15<hi>th Obſ.</hi> and 2<hi>d Book.</hi> Before I anſwer what he hath Objected againſt me in that Obſervation, I think it honeſt and fit, a little to examine the depths of his Worſhip's Learning; taking to task what comes firſt to hand, and what, himſelf being Judg, ſeems beſt to deſerve to be the Captain and Leader of theſe Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Obſervations, which he hath been fourty years a gathering.</p>
               <p>I confeſs I once thought to have followed this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman on, as his Obſervations lye, but I found it too fulſom a task. His Learning appears ſo full in <hi>this Obſervation,</hi> and his Learning and Honeſty in <hi>the</hi> 15<hi>th and</hi> 2<hi>d Book,</hi> that for my part, I have enough in theſe two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Life of Man is not only, &amp;c.</hi>]</p>
               <p>It is indeed a grave and ſerious Meditation which this Gentleman begins his Book with, and it takes up the firſt page thereof, further than which, if one reads not, he may well ſuſpect that he is miſtaken, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Medicinal Obſervations, hath bought a Book of Divine Meditations. But let him but have the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience until he comes to the ſtory of the Carter, and then he will find how ingeniouſly from his fall, came the riſe of this excellent Meditation. The knock over the Carter's Pate, did very likely beat it into the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician's brains; it mindeth us of being always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50464:21"/>
and in a readineſs to dye, becauſe our life is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way hazardous; ſome of thoſe hazards the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath reckoned up, but amongſt his Caſualties, he hath not named this, which yet flows naturally from the <hi>Obſervation,</hi> that if it ſhould be any of our chances by a blow in the forehead, to have a Counter-cleft be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and we happen to fall into the hands of ſuch an Artiſt as our <hi>Author,</hi> that ſuſpects ſomething, but underſtands nothing of our Diſeaſe, before we are dead, it is not only hazardous, but certain that we have loſt our lives. But to divert us from theſe thoughts, he hath ſubtilly practiſed their craft, who have learnt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and cunningly turns Divine, that he may ſome-wayes expiate his fault as a Phyſician, making his dead Patient, whom for want of skill he could not cure, to become yet a ſort of living example of the Calamities and Caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the life of Man. Thus by a new ſort of <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſura,</hi> the Phyſician receives the blow, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſends forth at the fiſſure, the Meditation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Near threeſcore years Old.</hi>]</p>
               <p>It's true, the Age of a Patient is ſo generally men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by all that write Caſes of Phyſick, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt never forgot, and the reaſon is, becauſe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of a Patient's Age, may upon ſeveral accounts be very uſeful to the Phyſician; it helps very much to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Patient's Temperament, which varies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Age, and withal the predominant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in his Body; which will always be ſome ways anſwerable to the Temperament. It alſo helps to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſtrength of the Patient, when we are to paſs our judgment what the Event will be; it likewiſe helps to indicate or contra-indicate Bleeding or ſtrong Purging, and the Rules of dyet, and the right order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſix Non-Naturals varies much according unto our Age. Beſides, in this particular caſe of a <hi>Counter-cleft,</hi> there is ſcarce any thing that deſerves ſo much to be conſidered of, as the Patient's Old Age;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50464:22"/>
for if by it the futures of the Skull be obliterated, great reaſon there is upon ſuch a knock on the Pate, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Counter-cleft. But this Author of courſe rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons up his Patients Age, but who can ſhew in all the Obſervation, where he makes any uſe or advantage of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoſe Name was</hi> Michaeli.]</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe there was ſome miſtake in the Printer, and that his Name was either <hi>Michael,</hi> or <hi>Michel,</hi> but not <hi>Michaeli.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Obſervator</hi> is very punctual in ſetting down the names of all his Patients, but I admire that this good man did forget the Chriſtian Name of this ſame <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi>; he did remember well enough all his four Cart-Horſes, and yet that he ſhould ſo unluckily forget the Carter's Name, whether it was <hi>Dick</hi> or <hi>Jack,</hi> or <hi>Tom,</hi> Names that they are more often called by than by their Sir-names. But I'll ſay that for our Author, that I do not know of any ſuch another neglect in all his four Books of Medicinal Obſervations, where we have <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> and <hi>Robert,</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine</hi> in abundance. But here indeed, the Chriſtian Name was forgotten, whether out of the abundance of his Divinity, in his many lines preamble to this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he forgot Chriſtianity; or that being conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of his having digreſſed too long, he would now make the more haſte and ſpeed to the matter in hand: or that becauſe it was but a poor Carter, there was not any thing to be gotten by theſe formalities which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon the rich. I ſay, what-ever the cauſe was, the matter is not great, nor indeed any thing material to the <hi>Medicinal Obſervation.</hi> But I ſee if men will be wiſe, they muſt be wiſe unto themſelves, for on a Death-bed, others will leave us to our own Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, touching this, we alone muſt anſwer for our ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Accuſtomed to govern and drive forward a Cart with four Horſes.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:50464:22"/>How this Author came ſo well skilled in the Carters Trade I cannot tell; but from him I learn, that our Engliſh Phraſe, To drive a Cart, is in a manner as prepoſterous, as to place the Cart before the Horſe; the Hind may whip the Cart long enough before it will drive, but he muſt firſt drive the Horſes; and whilſt they draw forward the Cart, it is his office to guide and govern it in its progreſſive motion.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe obſervable that although this Carter fell but from one Horſe, (and it would have been an Obſervation of Obſervations, if he had fallen from more) yet forſooth this Carter had three more which he uſed to water, for he had four Horſes to his Cart, and yet all four little enough to draw this one remark into a <hi>Medicinal Obſervation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A ſure ſign if we may believe</hi> Hippocrates.]</p>
               <p>This inference is true, but trivial, and it doth not reach the caſe in hand. The Carter's Diſeaſe was a Fiſſure in the Skull, a part containing, this ſpeaks of a concuſſion of the Brain, and the breaking of a Vein, parts contained, and yet how formally are theſe Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions made; they are verities almoſt as plain as the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, Truths that no Body hears mentioned, but he forthwith grants them; ſo evident and beyond all doubt, that methinks it is ridiculous to go about to prove them by Authority, and yet our grave Author brings in the Name of the great <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to confirm their Truth. Theſe ſort of conſequences, are much like thoſe which make up a merry Ballad, which ſerves not to teach, but to cauſe laughter.

                  <hi>There was called with me a Chirurgion, one skilful in his Art and an honeſt man.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:50464:23"/>I perceive then that every one is not a pittiful Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion in this <hi>Author's</hi> account, ſo he be not likewiſe a Phyſician, one thought ſo well of, as to be joyned with him in a Medicinal Conſultation. All his ſpight is at another Phyſician; and I think he never gave ſo honeſt a character of any Phyſician that was his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, much worſe I am ſure he hath: neither do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he doth deſerve it himſelf; for ſure I am, I had never been put to this trouble of writing <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions</hi> on him and his Book, if he had quitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as one skilful in his Art, and an honeſt man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having made diligent ſearch.</hi>]</p>
               <p>What ſearch might have been made with diligence, and to what good purpoſe I ſhall anon declare: and indeed now was the time, now the opportunity for this ſo to have been done, as that the poor Patient might have received benefit thereby, and the neglect of this opportunity was for ought I know, the miſcarriage of the Carter; for had not our Obſervator been a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Artiſt, one wholly taken up with the ſcratch in the forehead, he might eaſily have reflected with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that it was impoſſible that theſe bad Symptoms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned, which befel this Patient by and by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his fall, could ever have proceeded from ſo ſlight a wound only in the forehead, as was hardly skin-deep; and if he had conſidered the Patient's Age, and the probability of a Counter-cleft, he would never have reſted ſatisfied with ſo ſlight a ſearch, and yet this muſt paſs for a diligent enquiry: What could be more form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſaid, what could be leſs done to the purpoſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Binds up the Wound according to Art.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Not a ſcratch in the forehead, which any good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man might have dreſſed, but it is bound up according to Art, if this <hi>Obſervator</hi> hath the over-looking of it; ſo worſhipfully formal is he in all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In his Plethorick Body.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Believe it who will, that this poor old Man, that laboured hard every day and fared hard, was yet over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50464:23"/>
with good Blood in his Body; I rather think that this is another piece of the ſame formal Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who knew well that <hi>Plethora indicat venae ſectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> and therefore being to tell the world that he bled an Old man, whoſe Age was otherwiſe a Contra-indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Venaeſection, he makes up the reaſonableneſs of his Act, by telling us, that his Body was Plethorick; whereas good man, whether his Body had been Pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick or not Plethorick, the bleeding of him might have been requiſite for Revulſion from the Head; and to prevent as much as might be, the Inflammation of the Brain, and the coming on of the Feaver, and other Symptoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From the Cephalick Vein.</hi>]</p>
               <p>And what more proper in a Diſeaſe of the Head, than to bleed the Patient in the Cephalick Vein? That which indeed carries the name and ſhew of ſome Art, but as far as I can yet underſtand, it is but a ſhew only, and may therefore paſs for another piece of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide skill in our formal Obſervator; for ſince the Head-Vein, the Liver-Vein, and the Median, are all Branches of one and the ſame Trunk, what reaſon can there be given, why one ſhould more reſpect the Head than the other?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The next day we find all things worſe, and plainly deadly.</hi>]</p>
               <p>As negligent and ignorant as our Obſervator was yeſterday, when the poor Man's life was only in hazard, and required ſome effectual and ſpeedy means for his recovery; for beyond the binding up the ſcratch accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Art, and the exhibiting of a Glyſter, and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the Cephalick-vein, all which was but as a Bulruſh inſtead of a Leaver; yet to day, now that his own credit was in hazard, he deſires to appear very diligent and knowing; to ſalve therefore his own repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when he ſaw the Patient was going, he is not only content to acknowledg that all things were worſe; for what efficacy could there be in his inefficacious
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50464:24"/>
means? which came far ſhort of the Diſeaſe? But he ſays plainly the caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was deadly, that the World might think, that it was not want of skill in him the Phyſician that the Patient died, but becauſe there was an impoſſibility of his recovery; and to prove this, he huddles together as many bad Symptoms as he thought might ſerve the turn; though he doth it without either Method or Reaſon: and to uſe his own Words againſt <hi>Medicus alius; <gap reason="foreign">

We have already ſeen how ſimply he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the Oracles of <hi>Hippocrates</hi>: but, he is at it now again, and tells us, that he had not put this old and ſick Patient to the trouble of a ſecond ſearch in his forehead, and a further dilating of the Wound, but that he had the beſt Authority for what he did: for <hi>Hippocrates</hi> had bid him be afraid of a Fracture there, or ſome other hurt than he could yet meet with. But any one may juſtly admire and wonder, how it's poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for this Gentleman, be he of never ſo great parts, thus eaſily to gather things out of <hi>Authors,</hi> that were never in them. Let him name the place in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> out of which he was thus adviſed or inſtructed; that there was ſome hurt in the forehead-bone, for aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there was no ſuch matter; Even by his own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the forehead-bone was without hurt. One would think that this Obſervator did not yet know, that the forehead might be knockt, and yet the forehead-bone not hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There was great conjecture of a broken Skull.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Now firſt doth our Obſervator mention ſomething of a Fractured Skull; but even now it is only by way of Conjecture, and not abſolutely concluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore we took counſel about opening it with a Trepan.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Was not this a wiſe Conſultation? wherein our <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervator,</hi> upon a Conjecture alone that there was a Fracture, without examining what ſort of Fracture it was, whether ſuch as requires a Trepan or Raſpatories
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50464:26"/>
only, without being ſatisfied of the place where this Fracture ſhould be? For he had hunted for it in a manner until he was weary, but could not find it; always like himſelf, <hi>a ſafe Phyſician.</hi> He was about, and could have found in his heart to have Trepan'd this poor old Man, but where, who can tell? Moſt likely in the forehead; for that was the place he had been twice ſo buſie about, and ſo much concerned and unſatisfied with; whilſt yet there was no mention made of any ſuſpicion of a Cleft behind. This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, Artiſt-like, having Mr. <hi>Olivian's</hi> Practice in the next Obſervation for his preſident, he would let out the Gore, but where to go to work he knew not; though by a good Chance he might have hit on't, if he had done it likewiſe in the ſame place as <hi>Olivian.</hi> But this forward Gentleman could not forget the forehead, Hippocratis <hi>Oraculo admonitus.</hi> But what falls out? This poor Patient that had already too much of miſery, was in this only happy, <hi>non tam claritate vitae, quam opportunitate mortis.</hi> That his death was ſo oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that it prevented the further Torture of this grave Conſultation held to Trepan him, before ever the Diſeaſe was nearer known than by Conjecture; and not ſo neither as a Counter-cleft, but only as a Fracture in the Skull, whoſe place yet was wholly to ſeek.</p>

               <p>A Fiſſure or Countercleft are not words ſynominous, the latter being a ſpecies of the former; and there may be a Fiſſure or chink without a Counter-cleft.</p>
               <p>Now at length the great Conjecture was come unto a direct knowledg of the thing, and not before. After the Patient's death, when the Chirurgeon had opened the Skull, and ſhewed unto this knowing Phyſician,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50464:26"/>
what the matter was that had ſo puzzled him, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him as it were with his finger where the place of the Contra-fiſſura was, then at laſt, firſt began our moſt intelligent <hi>Obſervator,</hi> to underſtand a Counter-cleft, and to light upon the ſubject of this firſt grand Obſervation, which marcheth indeed in the front of all the reſt, as having much to do with the forehead of the Carter, but little with the brain of the Phyſician, except that with ſome help thereof, this Gentleman having the bleſſing of his Eye-ſight, did then and there when it was ſhewed him, behold a Contrafiſſura.</p>
               <p>Having thus given ſome piece-meal Animadverſions on this firſt Obſervation, I ſhall from the whole draw ſome Concluſions, and ſo diſmiſs it.</p>

               <p>WE have an Engliſh Proverb, that a <hi>Diſeaſe once known is half cured,</hi> but it turns little to the reputation of that Phyſician whoſe Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is throughly cured of all Diſeaſes, before his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be half known: neither will a ſeeming hard word, Contrafiſſura perhaps ſought out ſince, mend the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much; or excuſe this Gentleman who after ſo great a blow which an old man, heavy and helpleſs, received by a violent fall from his Horſe, upon his bare fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head daſh't againſt a ſtony place, whereby he became forthwith ſpeechleſs and almoſt lifeleſs; by and by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting up choler, and bleeding at noſe, paſſeth none other judgment upon the Diſeaſe, than <hi>that the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's Brains were ſhaken, and ſome ſmall Vein broke; Certo indicio ſi</hi> Loſſio <hi>fides adhibenda,</hi> that he knew not yet what the Diſeaſe was: and this appears further in that the firſt day, the Wound in the forehead being bound up according to Art, there was no further ſearch
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50464:27"/>
made, nor any intimation of a ſuſpicion, as if there were any where elſe any hurt done. The ſecond day there is mention made of ſuch Symptoms, as <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> ſays are bad when the Head is hurt; and every one that knew he had the fall, knew alſo that his Head was hurt. And what more doth Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> mention yet of the Diſeaſe? Yea, ſo little did he think of the <hi>os occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitis,</hi> that it was cleft, that the ſecond time, though he had once diligently ſearched it before, he directs his enquiry after the Diſeaſe, in the <hi>os frontis.</hi> But what need we any further proof of this point, for after this ſecond ſearch likewiſe, <hi>habemus confitentem reum,</hi> and he ſays plainly, <hi>neque quicquam animadvertere potui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, quanquam fracti cranei multa erat Conjectura</hi>: ſo that the neareſt that he came unto the Knowledg of his Patient's Diſeaſe before he was dead and his Skull opened, was a general Conjecture only of a Fracture, but no direct Knowledg of a Counter-cleft.</p>

                  <hi>2.</hi> That Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> might have underſtood his Patient's Diſeaſe before he was dead, if he had been more an Artiſt.</head>
               <p>FOraſmuch as this Propoſition will be more doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than the former, and ſome may be apt to plead an invincible ignorance in vindication of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, I ſhall therefore take ſomewhat more pains to prove it, than I did to prove the former; and I ſhall do it gradually by theſe three Aſſertions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He might have abſolutely concluded, that this Carter had ſome Fracture or Fiſſure in his Skull at firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know of but three Fountains of ſigns from whence a Phyſician may have the knowledg of a Diſeaſe, and they are its <hi>Eſſence, Cauſes, and Effects.</hi> Diſeaſes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50464:27"/>
are ſometimes ſo plain and evident of themſelves, that every one can tell them; thus any one as well as Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> might have told that this old man had a Cleft in his Skull, when they ſaw it; but then is it, that a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian's skill is ſeen, when by its Cauſes and Effects he makes diſcovery of a Diſeaſe, whoſe Eſſence by it ſelf doth not appear. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Here were the Cauſes of a Fracture or Fiſſure in the Skull,</hi> as fully and clearly ſet down as if any one had made it his buſineſs to deſcribe them: <hi>viz.</hi> Here was <hi>a ſudden violent blow upon the head with ſome hard thing.</hi> Had this Carter walked only, and tripping faln with his head upon a ſtone he might have broke his Skull, much more then, by a blow more violent at a greater diſtance from the ground, and by a fall from a Horſe, his feet being wholly from the ground; ſo that by them, he was not able to help himſelf, by ſtepping forward, or otherwiſe bearing up part of his Body, that it might not have faln with its whole weight in a lump. His hands likewiſe, whilſt he was in the Air leſſer time than to bethink himſelf where he ſhould fall, and whilſt his eyes could not direct him, nor but probably ſo providentially ſtrecth't forth as toward the blow and keep off the violence of the ſtroke upon his Head. Beſides, he was an old and therefore impotent man, and being ſlung off with a force from a Cart-Horſe, he muſt needs fall heavy; thus the blow was both <hi>ſudden</hi> and <hi>violent,</hi> and it was likewiſe upon his <hi>bare</hi> forehead; for if he had an Hat on, its probable that it fell off: and laſtly it was with an <hi>hard thing,</hi> for he daſh't his forehead againſt the ſtones.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Here were alſo the Effects of a crack't Skull</hi>; which I ſhall reduce to theſe two Heads, <hi>Immediate</hi> and <hi>Subſequent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Here were the <hi>Immediate</hi> Effects which are wont preſently or by and by to fall out after a Skull is crack't, for preſently upon the blow his eyes failed of their ſight, his ſpeech was taken from him, and if he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50464:28"/>
had not faln before, he muſt needs have faln upon the blow, for he could not riſe, but was taken up by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers half dead, and ſo brought home. By and by alſo he vomited up choler, and his Noſe fell a bleeding.</p>
               <p>Theſe Symptoms are of ſo great concern in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, that from them we may not only <hi>Conjecture</hi> that the Skull is Fractured, but likewiſe <hi>abſolutely conclude</hi> it. And becauſe this makes home to my purpoſe, I ſhall back it with the authority of <hi>Celſus,</hi> an Author not only generally approved of by Phyſicians, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly quoted by Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> in this Obſervation; and (which is ſtrange, for why then did he not read or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him?) in the ſame Chapter, <hi>viz. the</hi> 4<hi>th of the</hi> 8<hi>th Book,</hi> he writes thus; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi calvaria percuſſa, protinus requirendum eſt, num bilem is homo vomuerit, num oculi ejus obcaecati ſint, num obmutuerit, num per nares, aureſve ſanguis ei effluxerit, num concide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, num ſine ſenſu quaſi dormiens jacuerit, haec enim non niſi oſſe fracto eveniunt.</hi> If the Skull be crack't, you muſt forthwith make enquiry, whether the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vomited, whether his eyes failed of their ſight, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was dumb, whether blood came from him at his noſe or ears, whether he fell with the blow and lay without ſenſe as one aſleep: (all which are plain and evident in this Carter's caſe) for theſe things cannot be, except the bone be broken. An evident proof that Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> might at his firſt viſiting this Patient, have abſolutely concluded, that he had ſome Fracture in his Skull. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here were the <hi>Subſequent</hi> Symptoms, which are wont to follow a Fractured Skull ſome time after it's done; and which Authors do make mention of, as a Feaver, a Stupidneſs, a Sleepineſs, and a Convulſion. And thus much for my firſt Aſſertion. That Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> might at firſt have abſolutely concluded that this Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had ſome Fracture in his Skull.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> had ſo far wiſely underſtood the Caſe, as at the firſt viſit, by the Immediate Effects to have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50464:28"/>
abſolutely concluded, that ſomewhere there was a Fracture in the Skull; he muſt of neceſſity have known before his Patient's death, that the Diſeaſe was a Counter-cleft: for, although the word ſeems to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate a Fracture in a part oppoſite to that which receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the blow, yet it is a Counter-cleft if it be in any place elſe beſides there where the blow was given. And Dr. <hi>Read</hi> in his Treatiſe of Wounds <hi>Lecture</hi> 22. writes thus. <hi>A Reſonitus or Contrafiſſura falls out when the Craneum is ſtricken upon one part, and Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured in another; and this happens either in the ſame bone, or in divers; in the ſame bone either ſideways on the right hand, or on the left, or perpendicularly from the upper to the lower part; in divers bones, as when the right ſide of the head is beaten, and the left Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured, or when the left ſide is beaten and the right Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured; or,</hi> as in the Caſe in hand, <hi>when the forepart is ſtricken, and the hinder part cleft.</hi> But that there was no Fracture in this Carter's forehead, the place where the blow was given, Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> himſelf witneſſeth after a double ſearch; had he therefore known there was a Fracture, he muſt neceſſarily have known like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that the Diſeaſe was a Counter-cleft.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay it had been a very eaſie buſineſs, to have found out poſitively where the Fracture was, for whilſt the skin is unbroken, the cleft may ſo ly lurking under it, eſpecially if it be Capillary or ſmall, as may puzzle a very good Artiſt to find it out. And had Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> ſhewed himſelf ſo skilful, as poſitively to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before his Patient dyed, that it was his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that this Carter had a Counter-cleft, he had much ſaved his credit, though in the ſhortneſs of the warning, and hurry of the danger of his life, he could not have well found where it was: and yet, becauſe this Gentleman boaſts that nothing was omitted which in theſe caſes Art is wont to preſcribe, I ſhall add this third Aſſertion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If Mr.</hi> Loſs <hi>had known that there was a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-cleft,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50464:29"/>
moſt probably he might have alſo found out the place where, before his Patient's death</hi>: if he had wiſely conſidered his Patient, and made uſe of all means which Art is wont to preſcribe to find out a Fracture. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He would have found his Patient a very fit ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in whom he ought to have reaſonably expected an oppoſite Counter-cleft. For,</p>
               <p>This ſort of Fracture happens when the party ſtruck, hath no ſutures at all, or as good as none, they be ſo cloſe, and ſo very obſcure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herodotus</hi> and ſome others do write, that Skulls have been found in <hi>Perſia</hi> undiſtinguiſhed with ſutures. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo ſpeaks of one ſuch found in his time, at neither of which ſaith <hi>Veſalius</hi> do I admire, for very old mens Skulls ſhew nothing of the figure of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and but very obſcurely ſo much as the place where they have been. That which we may the more eaſily believe, if we know and take notice that even the very backbones of aged people do unite and grow together, that old men cannot move them as formerly. Whether this Patient's Skull had ſutures or no, I do not know, that Mr. <hi>Loſs,</hi> (curious enough in impertinencies) did ſo much as enquire after. This I know, here was one near three-ſcore years old, and in ſuch a dry Skull, drier yet by hard labour, and it may be harder fare; what could Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> upon ſuch a fall, after a double ſearch in the forehead bone, which both times was found whole, more reaſonably have expected, than a Counter-cleft behind? the force of the blow ſtrongly forcing the Air and Spirits within the minute parts of his Skull from his forehead on both ſides, by an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine violent motion to change their places and paſs forward, that is, backward towards the hinder-part of his head. Theſe little bodies or <hi>globuli,</hi> like theſe that from a Gun driven violently by the blow on each ſide his Skull, and having little or no vent given them at the ſutures, did paſs on unto the fartheſt place they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50464:29"/>
could recede unto in the <hi>os occipitis,</hi> and there meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other full-butt, and forcing each other vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and ſuddainly back in their Receſſion or Reſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they cleft the bone, and with it ſome Veſſels of the <hi>dura mater</hi> appended to it, ſome of whoſe blood came forth after by the Noſe. I ſay, what leſs in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> have expected than all this? But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are ſeveral means whereby Art will help us to find out a Fracture, which will not ſhew it ſelf. Dr. <hi>Read</hi> in his newly cited Lecture, ſays thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>If ſigns of a fracture do appear <hi>(as here they did)</hi> and no chink appear in the wounded part, <hi>(as here there did not)</hi> then you are to take a view of the oppoſite part; if you find any tumor there or ſoftneſs, you may be ſure that the Fracture is in the Skull ſubjacent: If you find no tumor, then you muſt ſhave the head, and apply ſuch a plaiſter, <hi>as he there preſcribes;</hi> ſpreading it upon Leather, and applying it to the oppoſite part to that place where the knock was given; if when you take it away the <hi>cutis muſculoſa</hi> be in any place more ſoft than other, moiſt, or ſwelled, it is likely that there is the Fracture.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Theſe things ought to have been done in this Caſe very ſpeedily, but I queſtion whether any of them were done at all. But beſides theſe, I ſhall offer at two things more that might have been done for the diſcovering of the Fractured place.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a ſlight and familiar way, ſpeedy and eaſie, known almoſt to every Chirurgeon, though not practiſed in this Caſe by this grave Phyſician, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Lute-ſtring might have been faſtned to this Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents Teeth in his upper Jaw, that Jaw which moves not, and is therefore not only contiguous but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with the Skull: if the Chirurgion ſtraining this ſtring with one hand, had as it were plaid upon it with the other, the continuation of that vibration, motion, or ſound, which the fingers would give the ſtring, and which the ſtring would communicate to the Teeth, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50464:30"/>
they to the upper Jaw, and that again <hi>per motum nex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> unto the Skull, might at length have arrived unto the Fractured place, and there jarring by an unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant rough and interrupted motion, it would have given ſuch a diſturbance to the weak, yet ſenſible part; and cauſed ſo much pain, as might have forced the Patient, mute though he was, to have ſpoken by ſigns, and by putting his fingers to the place, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi enim dolor ibi digitus,</hi> he might have told or at leaſt himſelf point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out where the Fracture was.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> had been ſure there was a Fracture in the <hi>os occipitis,</hi> and upon view or feeling could not have found it, becauſe the <hi>cutis muſculoſa</hi> was whole, He might have been ſo couragious, having a skilful Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion by him, to have commanded him to have made inciſion unto the <hi>os occipitis,</hi> about the middle of it, and the wound as occaſion required might have been dilated this way or that; and the bone laid more open for further ſearch. Such a wound would not likely have been mortal, nor could any juſtly have called this cruelty upon ſo neceſſary an account, in ſo ſtupid a Patient. And if the Cleft had been inviſible, by being ſo hair-like and ſmall; it might have yet been made viſible by applying a rag dipt in Ink, or done with Ivory half burnt, and mixed with a little Vinegar to make it more penetrating, and after a while taking it off, and gently waſhing or wiping away the black, for the Cleft part of the skull, would have yet retained ſo much black in its chink, as would have diſcovered the place. But thus much ſhall ſuffice for my ſecond general Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> might have underſtood this Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's Diſeaſe before his Death.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">

               <head>
                  <hi>3.</hi> That Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> did little or nothing material towards the Cure of this Patient's Diſeaſe.</head>
               <p>ANd indeed how ſhould he? whilſt he had no other knowledg of the Diſeaſe, than that his Brains were ſhaken, ſome ſmall Vein broke, his Head hurt, and great Conjecture of a Fracture; but where it ſhould be he knew not.</p>
               <p>All that I read of what he did, was a Glyſter, a ſearching the forehead-bone twice, a feeling about his Head, the letting him blood in the Cephalick Vein; and the binding up of the ſcratch.</p>
               <p>I do not deny that a Glyſter and Bleeding are good general Remedies for hurts in the Head, but there was little reaſon to expect that they ſhould bring away the Gore and extravaſated blood, which lying upon the <hi>aura mater,</hi> perhaps penetrating both <hi>dura</hi> and <hi>pia,</hi> and obſtructing not only the Veſſels, but the very pores of the brains themſelves, thus infecting, contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating, irritating, and yet ſtopping the free paſſages of the Spirits, cauſed thoſe direful Symptoms above mentioned, and in ſhort time death it ſelf. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therefore Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> did; <hi>Ne nihil feciſſe videre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> to uſe his own words of <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> who had yet better ſucceſs with his Patient. But that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was in effect nothing, for the next day he was found no whit the better, yea much worſe, and at night died.</p>

               <p>THis Gentleman is reputed to have a very ready faculty of cenſuring other Phyſicians when their Patients dye, that they took a wrong courſe with them, though he was not there, nor knew any thing more than by hear-ſay of what was done. What he did for this Patient is by himſelf put in print; and I have proved that it was nothing to the purpoſe: I now add, that he might have done ſomething to the purpoſe, if he had taken a right courſe. If he had firſt ſpeedily ſatisfied himſelf that he knew the Diſeaſe, and the part affected (as I have proved he might) and had then cauſed a ſection to be made through the ſoft parts over the middle of the <hi>os occipitis,</hi> to diſcover the Cleft, and what place would be convenient for the Trepan, and had then by opening of the Skull let forth that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſated blood and filth, which himſelf ſays was his death.</p>
               <p>It's true, the warning was very ſhort, and the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of Cure quickly gone, but the Cure was not therefore impoſſible, and the greatneſs and fearfulneſs of the Symptomes ſhould not have diſcouraged but quickned an intelligent Phyſician, to have ſet about it, and not to have put up the firſt day with the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up according to Art the ſcratch in the forehead, and the ſecond day, with a pretence of doing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Art in ſuch caſes is wont to preſcribe, when he did little elſe but fumble about the head of him, by which himſelf confeſſeth he could diſcover nothing: thus letting ſlip the opportunity of action, and deferring the conſultation of the <hi>Trepan,</hi> until the Patient was a dying. That in which Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> was the more to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50464:31"/>
blame, becauſe he had before this ſeen a Patient ſo Cured, as appears in his next Obſervation, where the Gentleman's caſe, in the moſt eſſential circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, is parallel with this of the Carter's. And this alſo is a further Argument to prove this fourth Concluſion, for <hi>ab eſſe ad poſſe valet conſequentia.</hi>

Sutures, leſt being ſtruck on one place, a great portion of the Skull ſhould be broke, which is prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Intervening Sutures ſtopping the violence of the blow from paſſing over theſe lines, and doing hurt on the other ſide of them; yet probably <hi>Gorraeus</hi> did not know that ſome Skulls have had no Sutures; and that Age many times obliterates them in theſe that had them: and perhaps he did not conſider, that the ſame force of a violent blow upon the Skull, which would quite break it, if it had no Sutures, in ſome diſtant place, may yet inſtead of a Fracture, make a Fiſſure there, though there be Sutures, if by old age thoſe Sutures are more than ordinary united, and dried up. So that beſides the authority of numerous Authors, Reaſon alſo ſeems ſo well ſatisfied with the poſſibility of a Counter-cleft, that it would be almoſt as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for any one to queſtion or doubt it, as it would be in me, to doubt whether there be any ſuch place as <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> becauſe I never yet ſaw it: and indeed, what elſe doth Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> in all this Obſervation, but carry Coals to <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> tells us what we knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and brings us the proof of his Teſtimony, for that which I know no Body doubts of: and this very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly having prepared a Book of <hi>Medicinal Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> for a Treat and Banquet to be ſet before Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as a Taſte of the fare which they are to expect after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he preſents them for the firſt diſh of the Feaſt, with a <hi>Colewort</hi> more than twice ſodden.</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50464:34"/>
a difficulty of breathing, a cough, and ſpitting of blood. Being called unto her, and conſidering what has been ſaid, I judged that this noble Maid was ſick of a Pleuriſie, whoſe external cauſe was by catching cold, ſeeing that in a cold ſeaſon late in the evening, ſhe had gone forth a walking, with naked breaſts, as is the manner of Noble Virgins. For as heat melting the humors eaſily cauſeth a Pleuriſie, ſo doth cold like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by compacting them, the Blood being gathered by reaſon of cold about the Intercoſtal Veſſels, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an Inflammation in the Membrane compaſſing the Ribs called the <hi>Pleura,</hi> and the neighbouring internal Muſcles. Preſently therefore, for as much as her ſtrength was yet pretty good, I was thinking of opening a Vein, as being that which uſes to give great relief in a Pleuriſie. But becauſe <hi>Galen</hi> adviſeth hardly to admit of bleeding in Children not yet <hi>14</hi> years old, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in a body ſoft and ſpare, and prone to diſſolve, ſuch as this Damſels was; for theſe bodies have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and plentiful internal evacuation, cauſed by the action of their innate heat, which eaſily digeſts and conſumes their moiſt Subſtance; ſo that there was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be afraid leſt her ſtrength ſhould fail, if to this liberal evacuation an other ſhould be added: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, following therein the command of the moſt learned <hi>Sennertus,</hi> I took care to evacuate by Leeches five oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Blood from the Internal Vein of the left Arm, having firſt ordered an emollient and cooling Glyſter. Afterwards I made it my buſineſs by fomentation and unction to aſſwage the pain of her ſide. My Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a Decoction of Mallows, Chamomile-flowers, Line-Seeds, and Dill; after which ſhe was anointed with Althaea and pectoral Ointments, and oil of ſweet Almonds; and this Cataplaſm was applyed. Take of Mallows, Camomile-flowers, of each one handful; of Dill and Violet-Leaves, of each half one handful; of Violet-flowers a pugil, of Faenugreek and Line-Seed of each half an ounce: boil them in Water, and when
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50464:34"/>
hey are bruiſed, add to them one ounce of Oil of ſweet Almonds, half an ounce of Hens-greaſe, and as much Meal of Barley and Beans as is enough. Make a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs. Theſe things being continued the pain was much aſſwaged, applying my ſelf therefore to promote expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoration, I gave her in the morning in her Broth, oil of ſweet Almonds freſh-drawn without fire, by which She was alſo more ſoluble; and a ready and eaſie expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoration followed. But in the day She uſed a <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus</hi> of Syrup of Violets, Maiden-hair, Diatragacanth, frig. Diaireos, Sugar Candy and Penidice. In the beginning of the Diſeaſe ſhe took a Tincture of Wild Poppy-flowers extracted with Waters of Card. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and Scabioſo, Spirit of Sulphur, and a pugil or two of Violet-flowers. Afterwards ſhe drank the pectoral Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſhops, and for her ordinary drink, a decoction of Barley with Raiſins, Loquorice, and Aniſeeds. Theſe things being moſt diligently made uſe of by the bleſſing of God and cooperation of Nature, within few days this Virgin was freed from the pain of her ſide and ſpitting of Blood, ſo that ſhe could riſe out of her bed; a Cough remaining, but not very troubleſom; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move which out of a vain fear of a Conſumption it ſeemed good to the moſt noble Mother, through the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, to call into Counſel another Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, who after the manner of many others accuſing what had been done, and eſpecially that a Vein had not been opened, and that her having been bled by Leech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es was of no moment; orders on the ſixth day of the Diſeaſe, that a vein ſhould be opened, then when the Fever and other Symptoms were gone. So taking away ſome four ounces of Blood that he might not ſeem to do nothing, from the Baſilick Vein of the oppoſite ſide, that which by the moſt learned <hi>Fuchſius</hi> is accounted an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in Phyſicians, who alledgeth many reaſons to the contrary. The ſeventh day he gives her Powder of Sena, by which ſhe was purged ſix or ſeven times. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Evening of the ſame day, ſhe fell into a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50464:35"/>
voluntary Sweat, by which ſhe grew altogether well, excepting that for ſome time afterwards ſhe took Balſam of Peru. Though theſe things were ordered without method or reaſon, yet they did the Patient no harm; for ſtrength when it is good, as it was in this Virgin, it contemns and tolerates all things, but when it is weak, every thing offends it.</p>

               <p>This 15<hi>th</hi> Obſervation is more than ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, in that there is a double caſe to be taken notice of in it.</p>

               <p>The firſt of theſe Patients, by the bleſſing of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, grew well in a ſhort time, and ſhe may now ſay to me, <hi>Phyſician cure thy ſelf.</hi> To which my Anſwer ſhall be, the very ſame that when ſhe lay ſick it was unto her honoured Mother, upon ſomewhat the like queſtion. <hi>The Caſe is indeed very dangerous, but I'll do the beſt I can for the Cure.</hi> And although it is not in my power to perſwade any one, contrary to what they themſelves pleaſe, yet it ſhall be my fault, if what I have writ and proved, be not enough to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate me to any indifferent Reader. And I hope, that the Almighty, who knows the wrongs and injuries, which for ſeveral years laſt paſt I have ſuffered by this Gentleman's means, will ſo far favour the innocency of the Cauſe, now that it muſt needs become publick, that he will proſper me in this Cure alſo.</p>

               <p>THere is little in this Title remarkable that ſhould invite the Reader to take the pains of peruſing the Obſervation, and when examined, let any one judg if there be not as many errors in it, as there are words. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Patient's Diſeaſe, to ſpeak properly, was not a Pleuriſie, but an acute Fever; whereupon Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatically followed a Pleuriſie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Pleuriſie that was, was rather Malign than Benign.</p>

               <p n="3">3. This Title doth not anſwer the Obſervation unto which it is prefixt; for according unto that, it ſhould have been thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Pleuriſie and no Pleuriſie cured before the ſixt day, and yet laſting until the ſeventh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe pretty Contradictions of our off and-on, in-and-out Gentleman, would have made any Reader admire the Writer; and above all his Book to have
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50464:38"/>
pitch't upon this Obſervation, where (to prove what I have ſaid) in his Judgment on the Diſeaſe, he ſays, <hi>Conſidering what hath been ſaid, I judged that this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Maid was ſick of a Pleuriſie</hi>; and his Method of Cure, and Medicaments do all ſpeak the ſame thing. But in his <hi>Narrative of the Caſe,</hi> he ſays, <hi>After a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent rigour, ſhe was taken with a Fever, mild in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but continual, and worſe every day towards E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, with a pricking pain in the Left ſide, &amp;c.</hi> A plain demonſtration that the Diſeaſe was not a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie with a Fever, but a Fever with a Pleuriſie. And yet again, on the ſixth day of the Diſeaſe, the Diſeaſe was no <hi>Pleuriſie</hi>; no, nor <hi>Fever</hi> neither: for before <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> was ſent for, Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> tells us, <hi>Theſe things being moſt diligently made uſe of, by the bleſſing of God, and Cooperation of Nature, within few days this Virgin was freed from the pain of her Side, and ſpitting of Blood; ſo that ſhe could riſe out of her Bed, a Cough only remaining, but not very troubleſome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Gentleman had cunningly packt away the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe before I was ſent for, (<hi>that I might have nothing to do, and that if I did any thing, he might ſay of me, that I did it, that I might not ſeem to do nothing</hi>) not the Pleuriſie only, but the Fever alſo and other Symptoms; for ſo he ſays: <hi>Medicus Alius orders on the ſixth day of the Diſeaſe, that a Vein ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, then when the Fever and other Symptoms were gone.</hi> This augments the Contradiction, and makes the Obſervation ſtill more wonderful; That there ſhould be a Pleuriſie and no Pleuriſie, a Fever and no Fever, a Diſeaſe and no Diſeaſe: for how could there be a ſixth day of the Diſeaſe, when the pain of her Side, her ſpitting of Blood, the Fever and other Symptoms were gone? But our Obſervator is ſtill more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; He ſays, this Pleuriſie was reſolved within a Week, if he means that it did not laſt a week, but was gone before the ſixth Day, he contradicts himſelf in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, About the Evening of the Seventh day ſhe fell into
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50464:38"/>
a plentiful voluntary Sweat, by which ſhe grew alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether well; a proof that ſhe was not well before. If it be ſaid, that ſome remains only laſted until the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day at Night, but the Pleuriſie it ſelf was gone before the ſixth, I deny this Aſſertion; for the Pleuriſie was not gone on the ſixth day, much leſs the Fever, which was her principal Diſeaſe; and whoſe conjunct Cauſe was not yet diſcuſſed until after the Sweat; and whilſt the Cauſe remained, the Effect did alſo remain.</p>
               <p>If he means, that it did laſt a Week and no longer, how doth he contradict himſelf in this again by ſaying, he had cured this Pleuriſie before the ſixth day? This Gentleman, that hath been noted for one that almoſt perpetually contradicts what another Phyſician, or his Patient offers to have done, though many times ſoon after he preſcribes the ſame thing himſelf; and in ſo much, that ſome play with him as with a Child, and work him to conſent, by urging for that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what they would have. I ſay this Gentleman, that hath many times uncivilly contradicted others, is ſo civil, as here and elſewhere to contradict himſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Pleuriſie was not reſolved within a week, for the great Sweat which did reſolve it, befel not the Patient until the Evening of the ſeventh day, and the ſeven days were out before the ſweat was off.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is no news nor worthy Obſervation, That a Benign Pleuriſie ſhould be reſolved within a Week; for of all the five ways by which a Tumor may terminate, Reſolution is not only the ſafeſt, but the nimbleſt; for the Morbiſick matter is not probably very great in quantity, if it paſſes off by diſcuſſion, nor very thick; for then it would rather end in ſuppuration, or indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; neither doth it make any great ſtop of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Blood in the part affected; and Nature is ſtill Miſtreſs in this way of Termination, neither is ſhe wont then to be long about her work.</p>
               <p>If he had told us of a Pleuriſie that ended by Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or Corruption of the Part, and yet paſſed off
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50464:39"/>
in ſeven days, he had given us an Obſervation indeed, but to tell us of a Benign Pleuriſie reſolved in ſeven days, is trivial. There is ſcarce any Diſeaſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of ſo ſpeedy a Cure, as this doth ſometimes. I have heard a Patient preſently upon bleeding, before yet his Arm was tyed up, tell with rejoycing how he plainly felt his pain go off, and ſuch a diſcuſſion of the Diſeaſe hath followed, that it returned no more: what then is the great obſervable, that this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſeems ambitious that the World ſhould take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of from him; Is it, that of his certain Knowledg a Pleuriſie was reſolved within ſeven days? Alas! Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every Body can tell, that ſuch a thing may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen in leſs than ſeven hours.</p>

This Patient had but two names, and he hath hit right in one of them; and hath ſome reaſon why he miſtook the other, for the Mother's Name being Mrs. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> who would have thought that her eldeſt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Name ſhould have been Mrs. <hi>Bridget</hi>? But he recovers himſelf a little from this ominous ſtumbling in the beginning; he tells us truly, whoſe Daughter ſhe was, and how ſhe was his eldeſt Daughter, things very Medicinal no queſtion: that ſhe was about ten years old, and ſhe might have been 12, or 20, or almoſt of any other age, and yet have been taken with a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie. That ſhe was thin and cholerick, and of a very rare Conſtitution; this Diſeaſe might have befaln her, had ſhe been full and fat, phlegmatick, and of a very thick Conſtitution, as he will have it, taking Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution for the Skin. It's true alſo that ſhe was at a Boarding-School for her better education, but little to our better notification; and that this School was in <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> a place he could not eaſily forget, for he hath lived in it above thirty years.

               <p>This cold ſhrug in the beginning or firſt on-ſet of a Fever, is one of the ſigns that ſhew that it's putrid; for when the Blood begins to boil through Putrefaction, the ſowr, crude, and nitrous parts of it, which have not yet arrived unto maturity and ſweetneſs, the bond of mixtion being much looſned, naturally they get to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as Birds of a Feather, and unite particles, and ſo make up a body of Crudity and Sowrneſs, which at firſt ſmothers the fire in the Blood, and hinder much the Circulation of it; in which yet, thoſe cold ſowr particles do aſſociate themſelves moſt willingly to the comparatively cold Membranous parts of the Body; which Membranes, partly through the abſence of the influential natural heat, which the Heart, all this time oppreſſed, cannot ſend forth vigorouſly enough; and partly by the over-much preſence of theſe cold ſharp Particles, do ſuffer that chill and general vellication, which I ſuppoſe is the Rigour, or cold ſhrug. But why ſhould Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> I pray, be ſo buſie to inform us
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50464:40"/>
that this Fever was a Putrid Fever, which in its very Eſſence is dangerous, though not always mortal; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in the Title, he tells us that the Diſeaſe was Benign?</p>

               <p>It is no hard task for any Phyſician to reckon upon his fingers the five Pathognomonick ſigns of a Pleuriſie, but then the Spitting of Blood is none of them; and why the <hi>Pulſus durus,</hi> which is one of them, ſhould not be here mentioned, Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> can tell.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen ſomething of the Narrative of the Caſe, there is yet one thing more taken notice of by Mr. <hi>Loſs,</hi> but both miſtaken and miſplaced; it appertains unto the Patient's Non-naturals, her Walking late in the Evening in a cold Time with naked Breaſts.

               <p>Amongſt other Rules which Phyſicians give to know what Part is principally affected, theſe three are very conſiderable.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>That which ſuffers moſt grievous Symptoms, is the part principally affected.</hi> But it is plain that the Effects of this young <hi>LADY</hi>'s putrid Fever, were much more grievous in her Heart, than theſe from the Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie in her Side.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That Part which is continually affected, and never at eaſe, is the part principally affected</hi>; but her Side was much at eaſe: and if you will believe Mr. <hi>Loſs,</hi> her Pleuriſie was gone, then, when <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> was ſent for, and then, when all the Family where She lay Sick deſpaired of her Life. And her Heart was never at eaſe, but ſtill troubled more or leſs with a continual Fever, until at length the Univerſal Sweat compleated the Cure; and the Fever once gone, there was no news of the Pleuriſie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That Part which receives no benefit by theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which do help another Part, is the Part prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally affected</hi>; but her heart was but little benefited by all Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> his Emperical Cure of her Side.</p>

               <p>

               <p>A Benign Diſeaſe, is ſuch an one <hi>as goes on in a gentle mild manner, not much troubleſom or offenſive to Nature, nor yet ſo dangerous as to hazard Life.</hi> And I do admire that Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> ſhould title this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe Benign, for I am ſure that before I was ſent for, the good Lady the Patients Mother was ſent unto, that She might make haſte to come twenty miles out of the Country, to ſee her Daughter that lay very ſick in Town; ſo little belief was there then of the Benignity of the Diſeaſe: and I am ſure, that when I propounded to purge her, after She had been bled; Madam <hi>Moore</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:50464:42"/>
told Mr. <hi>Loſs,</hi> who was againſt it, that She would try the Purge; for my Child, ſaid She, is a dead Child in your account. But afterwards, when Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> ſaw that the Patient was able to bear both Bleeding, Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Sweating, and in few days was ſtrangely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, to my credit, and his no little diſturbance; being to write this Obſervation, which I think he put forth on purpoſe to honour himſelf, and ſhame me what he could in this particular Caſe, the good Man chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Note of the great danger our little Patient was in, and out of a Malignity to the other Phyſician, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigns the Diſeaſe. That which is alſo the more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, becauſe this Gentleman in the immediately preceding Obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> the 14<hi>th</hi> of his 2<hi>d Book,</hi> ſays thus of a Pleuriſie in general; <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The Nature of an Acute Diſeaſe conſiſts in two things, in its being a great Diſeaſe, and in its moving nimbly with vehemency and danger.

               <head>Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> his Judgment of the Cauſe of this Patient's Pleuriſie, Examined.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Conjunct</hi> Cauſe of her Pleuriſie was Inflamed Blood. The <hi>Antecedent</hi>-Cauſes were of two ſorts, ſome did cauſe the Blood to be inflamed, as her <hi>Pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra quoad vires,</hi> and her <hi>Cacochymia</hi>: Some did cauſe her inflamed Blood to fall upon her left Side, as the the weakneſs and debility thereof, that Side being weakned firſt by an Iſſue, and afterwards by an Afflux of Humors cauſing a ſoreneſs in her left Breaſt ſome years before her ſickneſs. The <hi>Procatarctick</hi> Cauſes were her being obnoxious to Catarrhs, her Cholerick Conſtitution, her over-heating her Blood by play, and her drinking cold Beer whilſt ſhe was hot; that which <hi>Sennertus</hi> takes eſpecial notice of for a Cauſe of a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie. But Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> mentions no other Cauſe, but <hi>an External only, her catching cold by walking forth late in the Evening, in an Autumnal cold Seaſon, with her Breaſts naked, as is the manner of moſt Noble Virgins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is but a vulgar account, any one that comes in to ſee ſuch a ſick Patient, can readily ſuggeſt that She might get her ſickneſs by taking ſome cold, and being too late out in the Evening.</p>
               <p>It is too general an account, and although it gives ſometimes very good ſatisfaction unto ordinary Perſons, that underſtand little of Phyſick or Philoſophy; yet, how will any wiſe man acquieſce, if asking after the Cauſe of a Particular Diſeaſe, his Phyſician tells him he hath got cold, which is in a manner a general Cauſe of all Diſeaſes?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:50464:43"/>It is an illogical Inference; She got cold, therefore She got a Pleuriſie: for we may predicate of an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, the <hi>Species,</hi> and next <hi>Genus,</hi> and ſo upwards; For example, <hi>Peter</hi> is a Man, A Man is an Animal, an Animal is a Corporeal Subſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we cannot invert this order, and go downwards, ſaying, A Corporeal Subſtance is an Animal, An Animal is a Man, A Man is <hi>Peter.</hi> Thus we may ſay, That a Pleuriſie may be cauſed by catching of cold, but we cannot ſay, catching of cold is the cauſe of a Pleuriſie; becauſe a <hi>Genus</hi> cannot be confined to one <hi>Species,</hi> and catching of cold might as well have cauſed other Diſeaſes, as a Pleuriſie.</p>
               <p>The Conſideration of ſuch a Cauſe, is uſeleſs to a Phyſician, he can make no benefit of it: for, <hi>Cauſa tranſiens non indicat,</hi> becauſe it is one of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of an <hi>Indicans,</hi> that it be <hi>Manens in corpore,</hi> for how elſe can it indicate its ablation from thence? What though this young Lady did catch cold? that was paſt before Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> was ſent for; and the need a Patient hath of a Phyſician is to find out and remove the Cauſe that doth actually cauſe the ſickneſs, not to talk of that which is already gone.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> had underſtood, that the diviſion of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Diſeaſes into External and Internal, is an error among ſome Phyſicians; becauſe it may ſo fall out, that againſt the Rules of Logick, both Members of the diviſion may be predicated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of one and the ſame thing; as when a Dagger is ſtuck into the fleſh, He would not have called the cold Air an External, but a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catarctick Cauſe of her Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides all that hath been ſaid, this only account which Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> gives of this Patient's Sickneſs, is alſo falſe; either this young Lady was too hard for this old Gentleman, by concealing her over-heating her ſelf at play, and then drinking cold Beer; or elſe our truſty Obſervator, according unto his manner of ſeeing and proving things in his Obſervations, never troubles
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50464:44"/>
himſelf to examine the buſineſs, but eaſily takes upon truſt, what as eaſily he puts forth in Print.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe we that what he ſays were true, let's a little dive into his profound Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>I know this old Gentleman is no friend to the new Philoſophers, he had rather that thoſe that went before him ſhould be accounted wiſer, than any that come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. Antiquity he reverenceth, but he doth not conſider that the younger generation of Men is the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er World; and that as all things elſe here below, ſo Knowledg and Learning cannot but grow and increaſe by time and the daily experiments and inventions by which it is improved and advanced; or elſe (for which I ſee no reaſon) he muſt conclude that Learning is paſt its <hi>Zenith,</hi> and upon the decline. I ſhall not therefore trouble him with queſtioning whether Heat be an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or a Subſtance: I mean that Heat, which he ſaith ſo eaſily cauſeth a Pleuriſie, by melting the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; but I ask him in what Subject it is? It's plain that he means by Cold, the cold Air, that which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as he ſays this Gentlewoman's ſickneſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I preſume he means by Heat the hot Air. But how hot Air can inſinuate it ſelf into, and ſingle out the <hi>Pleura,</hi> a membranous and colder part, and yet there by melting the Humors eaſily cauſe a Pleuriſie, I cannot eaſily underſtand; I acknowledg it may help to increaſe Choler in the Body, which abounding may take fire and inflame the Blood: and I can eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that ſome of this inflamed Blood may ſtrike to the <hi>Pleura</hi> and inflame that; but then this is contrary to what Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> would have, for thus the Fever muſt needs precede the Pleuriſie, whereas he ſays poſitively that the Fever is a Symptom of the Pleuriſie, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by theſe words; <hi>Sexto morbi die, cum Febris &amp; reliqua Symptomata ceſſaſſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Humors be melted by the hot Air, then they were not melted before, and if not, how were they fluid and Humors?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:50464:44"/>One would think that heat ſhould rather dry up and conſume moiſture, than make it more fluid; and that if it did make humors more fluid, they ſhould therefore the rather paſs more eaſily within their own Veſſels, than break forth into the <hi>Pleura</hi>: why ſhould hot Air cauſe a Pleuriſie ſo eaſily, and not as well a Phrenſy or any other hot Diſeaſe? If it cauſeth any other hot Diſeaſe as eaſily as a Pleuriſie, Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> is but a pitty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Philoſopher, that can, or doth give, none other but a general Cauſe for a particular Effect.</p>
               <p>If he means by melting of the Humors, nothing elſe but their rarefying by the ingreſs of hot Air, whereby they cannot now be contained within their former bounds, what directs them to break forth in the <hi>Pleura</hi>? and what Philoſophy calls the rarefaction of humors, their Colliquation? <hi>Frigus humores compingens, Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritidem facilè introducere ſolet.</hi> Cold (ſaith he) eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſeth a Pleuriſie by compacting the Humors.</p>
               <p>Who can imagine that the cold ambient Air can compact and congeal the Humors in a living Body, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the Breaſt or Side, parts ſo neighbouring unto the Heart? Why did not the extreme parts grow rigid and ſtiff with cold at the ſame time? how can the Humors be ſuppoſed to be an Ice, and the ſolid parts yet be warm and move? How can ſuch a cold do leſs than quite ſtifle the inſenſible tranſpiration, eſpecially in the part moſt expoſed thereunto? and if ſo, why did not her naked Breaſts gangrene, the natural heat being wholly ſuffocated? And beſides, who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that a freezing cold ſhould cauſe a melting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, eſpecially in a cold Membranous part? His meaning ſure was, that the cold by conſtipation of the pores, by accident cauſed heat. But this falls out then only, when the pores of the Skin are leſſened, but not quite ſhut with the cold; but ſuch a cold as can congeal the Humors within, muſt needs quite ſhut the pores without, and ſo ſtifle and put out the innate heat, not raiſe it into a flame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:50464:45"/>Laſtly, Who can underſtand the reaſon of this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis? As Heat, ſays Mr. <hi>Loſs,</hi> makes the Humors get out of their Veſſels into the Pleura, by Colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo inflames it; ſo Cold makes them get thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo (for ſo they muſt if they cauſe a Pleuriſie) by Congelation, and alſo inflames it?</p>

               <p>The <hi>Method is,</hi> by attending unto the <hi>Indicantia,</hi> to find out the <hi>Indicata</hi>; what it is that muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or deſigned to be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Means</hi> are all thoſe Remedies which will help to bring theſe things to paſs, whether they belong to Dyet, Chirurgery, or Phyſick.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> ſeems to have been a meer Emperick, in reſpect of the Method he made uſe of for this Patient's Cure; as will appear in theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He did not concern himſelf what Part was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally affected, or what was the principal Diſeaſe, it was enough to him She had a Pleuriſie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He did nothing material towards the removing of the antecedent Cauſes, for he was wholly againſt bleeding of her by Lancet, and Purging her.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All his applications were to a Symptomatical Diſeaſe, and without ſatisfying firſt the Indications from the Cauſe, his firſt and whole buſineſs was after a few Leeches applied to the Arm, which did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Cauſe, to cure the Diſeaſe, by his <hi>Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> of her Side, his <hi>Cataplaſm, Linctus, Tincture, Barley-water, Oil of Sweet-Almonds, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Decoction,</hi> &amp;c. of all which Medicines he hath
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50464:45"/>
given us not only a Narrative, but their Recipes. I do not blame his Medicines, had they been with Art applied; neither yet do I know any thing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in them, for which they deſerved to have been printed: But I do blame his playing the Emperick, and his labour in vain, attempting to cure a Diſeaſe, without firſt removing the Cauſe; and I do ſay, that for ought I know, if no other Method had been made uſe of for her Cure, this Patient muſt have periſhed.</p>
               <p>The Event of what he did; I ſhall refer unto the now following Preface of the Second Caſe.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preface Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> makes unto the Second Caſe.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THeſe things being moſt diligently adminiſtred, by the bleſſing of God, and the cooperation of Nature, this Damſel was freed from the pain in her Side and ſpitting of Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One would almoſt laugh at this Gentleman, to ſee with how much gravity and formality, he ſets forth at large, his doing of little, or not much to the purpoſe, for this his Patient. But I dare not make ſport of, or laugh at his mockery, in calling as it were God and Nature to witneſs an untruth, that She was freed from the pain in her Side; whereas Mrs. <hi>Moore</hi> ſays poſitively, the pain in her Side continued very violent.</p>
               <p>Some one may think perhaps that this untruth was ſome miſtake, or came ſome-ways inconſiderately from him; but it would be ſtrange that he ſhould light by accident upon that, than which nothing though deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and plotted, could make more for his purpoſe: for if She was freed from the pain in her Side, the Reader takes it eaſily for granted, that her Pleuriſie, her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, was gone; and then he eaſily conſents that the ſending for <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> might be upon ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50464:46"/>
as Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> tells him; and that <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> was guilty of the faults are laid to his charge, and that he did nothing to the Cure, <hi>for that was done before he was ſent for</hi>; and that what he did was without Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod or Reaſon, and done only becauſe he would ſeem to do ſomething. Thus the Relation of the Event in the firſt Caſe, is a very convenient Preface to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; for it argues the great Art and Skill made uſe of, beſides the bleſſing of God upon it, to the honour of Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> who ſo ſpeedily and ſafely had wroughte Cure; and <hi>è contra,</hi> the ignorance and madneſs of <hi>Alius Medicus,</hi> that ſhould bleed and purge a Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that had no need of either, but was recovered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The main buſineſs Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> had to do in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, was, how he ſhould ſo handſomly and convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> upon the ſtage, as to rob him of the credit he had got of this Cure, and to take it to himſelf, and caſt dirt upon him. Firſt therefore, he gives the Reader a plauſible ſtory of what he had done, and for the better credit of the buſineſs, he tells him what intentions he followed to cure this Pleuriſie, and ſets down alſo the Recipes of his Medicines; both which, an indifferent Phyſician might have eaſily tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from many Books, that write the <hi>Praxis</hi> of a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie, into his own. Then he boldly and poſitively ſays, that by theſe means She was in effect cured: but thinking with himſelf that it might be objected, Why then was another Phyſician ſent for? Surely ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet a Lady as this Patient's Mother is, and held ſo by me that know her, will not eaſily be thought one ſo empty i'th brain, though full i'th purſe, as to take ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily a Journey from <hi>Spargrave</hi> to <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> and after She comes there, to ſend for another Phyſician, when her Daughter was recovered.</p>
               <p>To Obviate this, he is forced to recede a little from his firſt brag; and to acknowledg that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that he had done, there remained yet a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50464:46"/>
Cough, but this muſt not be thought to argue any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Diſeaſe in being, which ſhould make this ſhadow or Symptom; and therefore, leſt this ſhould take from his Cure, he takes from it, and ſays, Though there was a Cough, yet it was not very troubleſom. And yet to remove this forſooth, it pleaſed the Mother, who might do what She pleaſed in this Caſe, to ſend for another Phyſician. But he ſeems to fear and doubt that this motive was yet too weak by it ſelf, and therefore he ſtrengthens it with a double prop: on the one ſide he ſuggeſts, that the Mother was afraid of a Conſumption, but he tells the Reader, this was a needleſs fear; and indeed the Mother ſays plainly that at that time She had no fear of a Conſumption: on the other ſide, he ſays, that the Mothers ſending for another Phyſician, was becauſe of the Inſtigation of her Uncle. Now what elſe can be the meaning of all this winding and turning, this ſtudied and forged pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, but only to ward off and fence himſelf from having the Impoſture diſcovered of his pretended Cure, as alſo the diſſatisfaction of the Mother in what he had done; which might reflect either want of Care, or Art in him: and laſtly, to bring in with advantage the ſcroll of Accuſations againſt <hi>Alius Medicus,</hi> who yet (ſay ſome) muſt not anſwer them.</p>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50464:47"/>
to publiſh me in print for one that had neither Skill in a Diſeaſe, nor did underſtand the Method of Cure; but is it unſeemly for me to ſhew my skill and method, if I have any? No man can deny, but that it was very unhandſom in him, to throw dirt upon me, either privately, or publickly; and is it any unhandſomneſs in me to wipe it off? He ought not to have vented ſlanders; but will any one ſay, that I ought not to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate my Reputation, or that it is unſeemly, becauſe by doing it I write againſt another Phyſician? which of neceſſity I muſt do, if I will write for my ſelf. I confeſs, it is with much regret that I come forth at all, and I have given my Adverſary the advantage of ſome ſeeming reproach, though it deſerves rather commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that my Anſwer was not out ſooner; it might have been, but my unwillingneſs to write againſt him that I knew was obnoxious, made me wait many months, to ſee if he would uſe any means to prevent me, but in vain; and therefore now at laſt that I do write againſt him, it is the leſs unſeemly. And ſince there is no Profeſſion whatſoever, that can boaſt of all its Profeſſors, that they are good, I hope no man will think the worſe of Phyſick if by this Book I make diſcovery, that even amongſt Phyſicians themſelves, there are ſome ſometimes ſick of this Epidemick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; whoſe cauſe yet doth not belong unto the Art they ſtudy, but unto the corrupt and depraved nature of mankind in general.</p>

This is it that he would be at: he would have me beholden, to him forſooth, to ſave my credit, who ſeems to me the only Adverſary that hath made it his buſineſs to ruin it. <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> is a Vizard-Mask of his making, and he wiſheth none other than that I ſhould be ſo much a Fool, as to wear it, for when he pleaſe he can look under it, and when he liſts he can pull it off, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover who this <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> himſelf hath made this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſeveral of his Friends at <hi>Dorcheſter</hi>; I ſhall be ſomewhat large in my Anſwer thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Had Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> named Truth, and not named Me, I ſhould have had good reaſon to have acknowledged his great civility, in ſuffering my guiltineſs to have paſſed <hi>incognito</hi>; but if any one commends his charity, for thinking thus to conceal my reproach; let him if he can, excuſe his folly in ſo doing. He names the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50464:48"/>
and her Parentage, the Town, yea the Houſe where She lay ſick; and with what wit could he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to cover me with this Net, which every one could look through? He ſhould not have medled with me at all; for, faintly to ſhadow me over, was the only way to make the people the more inquiſitive, and the diſcovery the more acceptable; for publick ſlanders, as well as private whiſperings, never ſpread more, than when they are delivered by way of ſecret.</p>
                  <p>If this <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> were as much a ſtranger to me, as is he whom I never ſaw or heard of, yet being I am able to prove, that the Matters of Fact whereof he is accuſed, are falſe, and that the errours laid againſt him in his Art, are falſe likewiſe; I ought in charity to him, and out of a juſt indignation againſt Mr. <hi>Loſs,</hi> to write againſt him, if it were but only to defend Truth, and to be vertuouſly angry with Falſehood, and with ſo baſe an act and injury, as is not ſufferable to be offered, no not to the ſhadow of another Phyſician, though he had in him no ſubſtance to defend himſelf. But I find that <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> is very near me, and my very good friend; one that I am confident would have ſcorn'd to have dealt thus with Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi>; and therefore I have no reaſon to ſee him injured, neither ought I to deſert his Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>If Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> was ſo civil to name me <hi>Alius Medicus,</hi> I have likewiſe been as civil to put forth my Book un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Name, and I think the Courteſy of each is much alike.</p>
                  <p>There are many reaſons why, out of reſpects unto himſelf, Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> would not name me.</p>
                  <p>It would have been too groſs and palpable, and have ſmelt over-rankly of his own malice, if he ſhould have told the World by Name which of his Neighbours was ſo ignorant in his Art.</p>
                  <p>It would have ſome-ways neceſſitated him to have named my Degree alſo, with which probably he did not care to honour me; becauſe himſelf had never
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50464:48"/>
taken any; and formerly ſaid ſo of me alſo.</p>
                  <p>It would have been too high a provocation, not to have been ſuffered without a Reply. It puts courage even into a very Coward to fight, when there is no way to eſcape; leſt therefore I ſhould be forced to anſwer, and might diſcover his falſehood and diſhoneſty, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done my work for me as he thought, that he might hear no more of me nor be troubled with me, he craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily leavs open a Rat-hole, for me and my credit diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourably to creep out at, and this was in not-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming me.</p>
                  <p>It would have made his Accuſations, which probably he knew too weak to bide a Teſt, more ſtrictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and enquired into; whereas laying them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an <hi>ignotum Caput,</hi> they are better paſſed over, and eaſier conſented unto.</p>
                  <p>It might have diſobliged others as well as me; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentlemen, Juſtices of the Peace, and Perſons of good Repute and Eſtate, many of them in and about <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> to whom I have had the honour to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the Marriage of my Wife, and for whoſe ſakes, (<hi>not leaving the City, before that firſt left me no houſe or home</hi>) I have been contented with a retired life. I ſay, ſome of theſe, upon ſuch an open and bare-fac't affront, might not only have been angry with him, but have ſit upon his skirts for the abuſe.</p>
                  <p>But beſides all this, I ask any one that would not have me anſwer Mr. <hi>Loſs,</hi> whether then, my ſilence will not more condemn me with moſt, that have or may take notice of it, than his ſpeech? for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Accuſations, I may yet anſwer for my ſelf and be heard; but if I do not appear to anſwer, I therein bear witneſs for him, againſt my ſelf; either that his Accuſations are true, or that I am as pittiful as he repreſents me, if having Truth on my ſide, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet anſwer for my ſelf: for who will not ſay I would, if that I could?</p>

                  <p>It's true, to write Latin well is an accompliſhment very deſireable and commendable, and that by which Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> I think hath principally got the credit of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Scholar, ſending abroad upon all occaſions his Latin Epiſtles, to ſuch as he thought might underſtand better than anſwer them; and hereby publiſhing himſelf, for no low hedg-Doctor, or pittiful pretender to Phyſick, that knows not well perhaps how to write true Engliſh; but for an Highdutch-Man rather, that can write true Latin. But for all this, I ſay, that it is not the <hi>Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boleth</hi> or <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> of a Scholar or no Scholar, to be able to write Latin, witneſs any one that pleaſe to read this Gentleman's Latine Medicinal Obſervations.

                  <p>A grave Profeſſor of Phyſick, that was my Tutor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, told me, That he had once a Patient which in her Sickneſs when the heat of her Fever had elevated her Spirits, talked ſo elegantly and learnedly about va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

ſubjects, as they came into her phantaſie, that he went many times on purpoſe to ſit by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hear her, who when ſhe grew well again, was a very Dolt. And which is yet ſtranger, I am told of one in <hi>Dorſet-ſhire,</hi> that in a Fever ſpake a Language never underſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor ſince, nor then I think: and look, as I am not able to give a full and rational account of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, no more can I deſcribe that particular <hi>Craſis</hi> or Temperament of Brain, whereby <hi>Germans</hi> do ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally more naturally as it were write and ſpeak La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.

                  <p>Is an honeſt Traveller uncharitable, that purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a diſhoneſt Thief that robb'd him of the beſt of his goods, ſuch as he had no mind to loſe; brings him to open ſhame and condign puniſhment?</p>
                  <p>Is a Defendent uncharitable, if by telling his Story, and producing his witneſs to clear himſelf, the injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Plaintif, that perhaps hath paſſed many years for a very honeſt and godly Man, be proved to be quite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in open Court?</p>

                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:50464:50"/>Is a Chirurgeon uncharitable, that finding an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume ripe, Lanceth it; becauſe forſooth by this means the corruption comes forth, appears, and ſhews it ſelf, even to the nauſeouſneſs of the Beholders?</p>
                  <p>If any of theſe be uncharitable, then am I. But if this Gentleman ſuffers no more than his guilt deſerves, if he falls into that very Pit which he digged for another; if with his own hands he hath pulled down upon his own head, that miſchief which no man intended him, and which no man could have brought upon him, but with his own aſſiſtance; if climbing higher than his reach, he hath miſſed his footing and got a fall; if talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too eagerly and too open-mouth'd againſt another, he hath let ſlip the bead and his Vizard-Mask be fallen off: If by robbing the neigbouring Bees of their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, ſweeter unto them than Honey, he hath got a Swarm about his Ears, and whilſt ſome others buz only and ſtrike at him, ſome one perchance Stings him; Whom hath he to thank for all this but himſelf? For my part, I do not think that Charity unto my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour doth in all caſes oblige me to be uncharitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſelf, and ſuffer my own Reputation unvindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; what Charity requires of me, to ſacrifice my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and my Practice, as an <hi>Offa</hi> unto <hi>Cerberus,</hi> as a morſel to be devoured, and eaten up by the envy of an ill-natur'd Perſon?</p>
                  <p>Charity ſays I muſt not vaunt my ſelf, but muſt I not therefore vindicate my ſelf?</p>
                  <p>I muſt think no evil, what, not when I ſee it in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible characters and in print? When I hear it, and know it, and feel it?</p>
                  <p>I muſt be without diſſimulation; therefore as real Love needs no Counterfeit, ſo real Hatred of evil Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices needs no cover, and I publickly own it.</p>
                  <p>I muſt not ſeek my own, not by a huckſtering kind of way projecting for gain, without love to vertue; but may I not ſeek my own when it is loſt, or keep my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit

                  <p>I muſt not envy. But here I preſume ought to be remembred, that there is a double Envy, the one a Vertue, the other a Vice, and yet both are compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſorrow and hatred.</p>

                  <p>The Wicked Envy is a ſorrow at, and a hatred of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man's happineſs, be it never ſo much deſerved, or honeſtly acquired.

               <p>The Particulars againſt what he ſaid are three.</p>

               <p n="3">3. That he ſhould ſay, the bleeding of her by Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches was of no moment.</p>
               <p>The Particulars againſt what he did, are theſe that do relate either to his Bleeding or Purging of her.</p>

               <p n="3">3. That the Manner was Erroneous; it ought to have been done by Leeches, and he did it by Lancet.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Quantity of the Blood taken away, was either too much or too little.</p>
               <p>In his Purging of her were theſe faults.</p>

               <p>HAving ſeriouſly conſidered, gravely and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly weighed all thoſe bad Symptoms above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Narrative, Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> paſſeth a double Judgment upon <hi>Alius Medicus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Diſeaſe he was ſick of, was the Simples; for he had neither Method nor Reaſon for what he did.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the External Cauſe, was, <hi>Ne nihil feciſſe videretur.</hi> The Motive was, that he might not ſeem to do nothing.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, This Gentleman loſt the reputation of curing this Patient, both in the Family where She lay ſick, and with her Mother and other Relations; and therefore to heal himſelf, he makes <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> to be ſick, and this he doth in Latin, which he wot well few or none of them that knew my Innocency could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. His deſign ſeems to have been to make out to Scholars, the unreaſonableneſs of their opinion who attributed the Cure to <hi>Alius Medicus,</hi> and did not ſide with him in his Judgment; for this purpoſe he pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth up a Relation according to his phantaſie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing ſome things, and forging others, that it might paſs plauſibly with Perſons that knew no more of the Caſe, than what he hath ſet down: and I muſt confeſs ingenuouſly, that if I were my ſelf a ſtranger to theſe matters, and had known no more than what Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> hath told, I could not deny, but that <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> muſt paſs for an Aſs; for what leſs can he be, that practiſeth <gap reason="foreign">

In the <hi>Interim</hi> let him read over that of the Wiſe Man: <hi>He that is firſt in his own Cauſe ſeemeth juſt, but his Neighbour cometh and ſearcheth him out.</hi>

Medicus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> fetcheth it from one of the ſix Non-naturals, his paſſionate deſire to appear to do ſomething, and his great unwillingneſs to ſeem to do nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ne nihil feciſſe videretur,</hi> hath in the belly of it the ſpawn of many other accuſations; as if <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> was ſo covetous, that rather than not let in a Fee into his own Purſe, he would let out his Patient's Blood, though the Fever and other Symptoms, and Pleuriſie were gone; and rather hazard her Life, than her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: As if <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> had ſuch baſe and low thoughts of this Patient's Friends, who were nobly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, that he feared being ſent for, that if he did nothing he ſhould have nothing: As if he were in a manner Knaviſhly cunning; ſome ſlying report or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had encouraged Mrs. <hi>Moore</hi> to ſend for him, and leſt ſhe ſhould repent herſelf, by finding that he was a Perſon that could neither ſay nor do, craftily he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves upon both, and ſays this and that againſt Mr. <hi>Loſs,</hi> and does this and that, and tampers with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient when there was no need, <hi>for ſhe was cured before</hi>: As if, as cunning as he would ſeem, he was in truth but a ſimple fool that would venture Gold againſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, his Patient's Life and his own Credit, to have the Reputation of a Cure which was wrought before he was ſent for: As if he were croſs-grain'd and ſelf-will'd, and loved to be oppoſite; <hi>Galen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> ſaid, ſhe muſt not be bled by Lancet; but therefore he will have her bleed by Lancet, and put her to the trouble and ſmart of it, without any need: As if he were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome, if not right-down diſhoneſt towards Mr. <hi>Loſs.</hi> He good Man, with great diligence and lucky ſucceſs upon his induſtry, had upon the matter cured this Patient; the Mother indeed, out of a miſtaken fear of a Conſumption, and to gratify the importunity and inſtigation of her Uncle, did ſend for another Phyſician; but there was nothing for him to do, and yet to leſſen Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> his reputation, and cunningly to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50464:53"/>
to ſhare in the Cure, if not alſo to run away with all the credit of it; <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> under a pretence of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething, unworthily undoes what Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> had done, and no queſtion had injured the Patient as well as the Phyſician; but that her ſtrength of Body, and his ſtrength of Wit and Parts, ſcorned it.</p>
               <p>I do not doubt but Mr. Schoolmaſter thought that this was a Rod made up of many Twigs, a Whip of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Cords, and that with it he hath laſhed and paid off <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> to the purpoſe. But the beſt is he doth not feel it ſmart yet, for in theſe Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> hath only beaten the Air and himſelf. <hi>Ne nihil feciſſe videre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> in all theſe ſenſes is ſtill ſenſleſs by being falſe.

               <p>HE could not help it, he was forced to paſs this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable report of what <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> had done, that it did the Patient no harm: for he could not well invent what harm to name it; and he thought he could not eaſily be believ'd, becauſe in leſs than a Week, the Patient that was thought dying when <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> was ſent for, was ſo well as to come down into the dauncing-School, and her Mother carried her home in the Country, where for ought I know ſhe hath been well ever ſince.</p>
               <p>But Mr, <hi>Loſs</hi> is by no means willing that the Reader ſhould miſtake this Event, as if it were cauſed by any thing that <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> did; and therefore he hath
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50464:53"/>
provided a treble Bolt and double Lock to ſhut him out from any ſuch Interpretation, as is obſervable in theſe five particulars following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He Benigns the Diſeaſe, and is content rather to abate a little of the brag of his own Cure than that this Patient's recovery ſhould be an occaſion whereby <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> ſhould by any body be thought worthy of being taken notice of. The Nature, ſaith he, of this Diſeaſe was Benign, and it was ſo mild and gentle, that in a manner it went off of it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He attributes the main of that Cure which was unto himſelf, and that before he makes any mention of <hi>Alius Medicus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He will have the great Sweat, which indeed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the Cure, to be ſpontaneous; forgetting that it was occaſioned by his allowing her to drink Beer after her purging, againſt my order, and that there-upon ſhe fell ſick again, and that by Bleeding and Purging a great portion of the burden which ſhe groaned under being remov'd, Nature became Miſtreſs of the Diſeaſe, and drove the remains forth by Sweat.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He paſſeth a direct ſentence againſt <hi>Alius Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> that all his proceedings were Immethodical and Irrational, enough to ſatisfie the Reader fully, that he had no ſhare in the Cure.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He magnifies the ſtrength of Nature in this young Lady; had it not been for this, <hi>Alius Medicus</hi> was ſo far from doing good, that he had done her hurt. It ſeems he would have hurt her but ſhe would not be hurt. It ſeems alſo that by continuation of her ſickneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as others grow weaker and weaker, until they be upon recovery; ſhe wonderfully grew ſtronger and ſtronger: for in the beginning of her ſickneſs Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> ſays ſhe was too weak to bear bleeding by Lancet; and yet on the ſixth day, though it was done Irrationally, her ſtrength was greater than to prize it. On the ſeventh by no means would he admit, if he could have helpt it, that ſhe ſhould be purged; no queſtion he thought
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50464:54"/>
it very dangerous for ſo weak a Body, and in ſuch a Diſeaſe, and at ſuch a time; but afterwards, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch mad bleeding, and purging, and ſuch voluntary large ſweating, enough one would think to have made a well body ſick; ſhe was ſo ſtrong, ſhe contemned all, and of ſick grew well. If here be not Contradictions, let the Reader judg.</p>

But I little dreamt of making this further advantage in my Journal of this Caſe of young Mrs. <hi>Moore,</hi> as by it to help to prove particulars very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial unto my own Caſe; and to ſatisfie both my ſelf and others that what I depoſe, is not out of my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, whoſe unfaithfulneſs might betray me unto mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, but out of my Papers, which I then writ, even the day when I was firſt called unto this Patient, which was Thurſday the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1669. Examining them and Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> his Book, I find our Notes did not agree, and although I do not know why my Papers produced, ſhould not be as Authentick for me, as is a Shop-book for a Trades-man; yet in this Caſe, I thought it more prudent to get ſome other Teſtimony,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50464:54"/>
than to confide in the evidence of my own Papers alone. For I did not know but Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> might have taken Notes too, and if ſo, what ſtranger could judg whether his or mine were true? Knowing therefore that it would be to no purpoſe to go about to build without a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and to vindicate my ſelf from his ſlanders, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out I could produce ſufficient witneſs for matters of Fact; I bethought my ſelf of writing this Letter to Mrs. <hi>Moore</hi> to whom I have Dedicated my Book, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe is a witneſs not to be excepted againſt, as appears by what I have ſaid of her in my Epiſtle Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> may well think me very ungrateful, that I have ſo long been ſilent; had I received your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſooner than laſt night, I ſhould have before this time anſwered your reaſonable deſire.</p>
                     <p>My Daughter's Name, which the Lord made you an Inſtrument of preſerving from the Grave, is <hi>Bridget.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Her Sickneſs to my beſt remembrance, was either in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The pain in her Side continued extreamly violent, her Cough as thoſe that have a touch of a Pleuriſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued very much, in ſo much as I was highly diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that She had never had any Pectoral drinks; and I ordered the Apothecary's Servant to make ſome and bring it me, before I got any reſt my ſelf.</p>
                     <p>My ſending for you, was not to ſatisfy my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle; but to diſcharge my duty: not being ſatisfied with what had been done before your coming.</p>
                     <p>I did not at all at that time fear a Conſumption.</p>
                     <p>I muſt profeſs you never to my knowledg Cenſured Mr. <hi>Loſs,</hi> or accuſed him of any thing: but did very modeſtly deſire me not to employ you, telling me you feared what would happen.</p>
                     <p>I know you met with ſome diſcouragements by lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but you granted my requeſt in taking no notice of it.</p>
                     <p>The day when you Bled her, She was ſo ill, as I and all the Family deſpaired of her Life; and I remember I asked both your ſelf and Mr. <hi>Loſs,</hi> if no more were to be done? you told me, that unleſs a Purge relieved her, you could not tell what to ſay; only you had hopes that the Scurvy was much of her Distemper, and that gave you hopes that ſhe might do very well again, if Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> would conſent unto a gentle one, that you might try
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50464:55"/>
her. He was very ſtifly againſt it, and I remember I thus ſaid, I will try it, my Child is a dead Child in your account, and I will do my utmoſt for her.</p>
                     <p>The Purge was a ſmall quantity of Holland powder, with half an ounce of Manna (in a draught of Pectoral Decoction) Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> was ſo angry that he went from me and left her when ſhe had taken it, which was no ſmall trouble to me; you ſtayed with me. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half an hour ſhe fell into a quiet ſleep, and ſlept one hour and a half; ſhe then awoke, and vomited and purged, and then ſlept again; and ſo after that ſhe had two or three ſtools more: ſhe preſently revived, but being admitted to drink a draught of Beer with a Toaſt, <hi>(this ſhe hath told me ſince her Letter, was by Mr.</hi> Loſs <hi>his order</hi>) grew ill again for two or three hours, then fell into a very great Sweat, and did never burn after, or had any light ſpeeches; and her <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rin was much better. I bleſs the Lord I brought her home with me in one Week: She hath confeſſed ſince, that ſhe got her Diſtemper, by an extraordinary over-much heating of her Blood at Play, and drinking cold Beer. She is yet alive, and with my ſelf gives you her thankful ſervice for your very great Care of her.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>HE After the manner of many others, Accuſing all that had been done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conceive that there may be two Reaſons, why he hath ſet this in the front of all his other Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he might imitate the craft of ſome Females, who cry Whore firſt, and thereby make me the Aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor and firſt beginner of the quarrel; which is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no ſmall conſequence in the Caſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That diſarming me of my Innocence, he might uſher in a more eaſie belief of my being guilty of what he had to ſay againſt one that was ſo undeſerving a Perſon.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch as Backbiting and Slander, were the true impulſive Cauſe that drove me with indignation to write this Book; not only againſt this Gentleman, but all other high, and yet low-ſpirited falſe and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Phyſicians, that are guilty of this uncharitable and baſe Practice. Before I give my direct Anſwer to this firſt Accuſation, I ſhall take leave;</p>
               <p n="1">1. To Aggravate the fault, and ſhew a little its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomneſs and unworthineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To give ſome Inſtances of Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> his thus deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me; whom yet he thus accuſeth.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The unhandſomneſs of any one Phyſician's Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting or Slandering another Phyſician.</head>
                  <p>It was but a little ſince urged, that it is unſeemly for one Phyſician to write againſt another; but how
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50464:56"/>
great is the unſeemlineſs when they Backbite and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one another?</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak ill of another behind his back;</p>
                  <p>It is a cowardly trick, it comes behind a man and ſtrikes him, as thoſe do that are fuller of malice than manhood; with this advantage, a Coward may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the ſtouteſt Champion, and be ſole Victor when he thus fights alone; though indeed this is not to fight but to deſtroy.</p>
                  <p>It is a Treacherous perfidious Trick, this Gentleman tells me in his Latin Letter, that he loves me, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours me, and what not? and yet behind my back, he not only ſlights, but ſlanders me.</p>
                  <p>An open and bare-faced hoſtility, is like it ſelf, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways held commendable, for its fortitude and valour, ſtrength and proweſs; but whiſperings and backbitings are a Treacherous Poiſon, deadly, but not ſeen; felt to the purpoſe in the evil effects, but not eaſily found out; for what is delivered as a ſecret, muſt be kept as ſuch; and thoſe that are willing to entertain evil thoughts of any one, will never go and tell him out of Love, who ſuggeſted them; and if by bandying, it comes about to the ears of him that is ſlandered, they that tell it him, probably cannot, at leaſt commonly will not, prove it, and produce witneſs for what they hear ſay: for who will be ſo faithful as to give himſelf the trouble or inconvenience of making the ſlanderer his Enemy, by diſcovering and proving him ſuch to his Face for another's good; for few I think are ſo conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious as to think themſelves concerned in their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Credit; and that in Charity they are bound when they can, as much to vindicate his Reputation as their own.</p>
                  <p>It's below a Gentleman of any Parts or Abilities. He that can work out his own Fortune and raiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, what need he take the advantage-ground to ſtand upon another's Ruine?</p>
                  <p>It's below a Phyſician that hath but common honeſty
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50464:57"/>
and ingenuity; his buſineſs is to do what he can to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſaving of his Patient's Life, not to do what he can towards the ſtabbing of another Phyſician's Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; his Practice ſhould lead him to the Charity of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Sick Bodies, not to the uncharitableneſs of making Sick Minds, by wounding Men in their Reputation.</p>
                  <p>It's infinitely below a Chriſtian, and gives that man the lye, notwithſtanding all his loud noiſe and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Godlineſs and Piety, that thus wants Charity to his Neighbour. It is unreaſonable; for why ſhould one condemn another before he hath anſwered for himſelf? And what doth the Cenſurer know what worth may be in the Cenſured? If he be ſure he be ignorant, is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable therefore to divulg it, and to ſhame him for that which perhaps he cannot help? No; Let him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pitty him, and help him up, than ſtamp upon him becauſe he is already on the ground; let him commend him in what is commendable, and let the other alone; he wants buoying up of his Reputation, which of it ſelf without loading will ſink faſt enough. If one doth not well, well is it for the other if he can do better in the Profeſſion; let him mend the others faults what he can, not make them worſe: If he be ſo able, let him rectify the other in his judgment, that he may do more good in his Calling, not vilify him that he may be able to do none at all, neither to himſelf nor others. And why ſhould it not be as well one mans due to live by his Profeſſion as anothers? why ſhould not either, have as good a repute in the World as he can get? And he that will Labour doth he not deſerve his Bread? and why ſhould he not eat it? If either be the better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, it ſhould be ſo in others opinion, not in their own; and he that hath received moſt ſhould be moſt humble, as being moſt endebted, and as ſitting higher than thoſe that deſerve as well. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Every ſin is an act of Ignorance: and it is pitty, but it cannot be help't, that any Phyſician ſhould be eſteem'd of as the better Phyſician for being the worſer Man;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50464:57"/>
for bragging and vapouring of himſelf, and vilifying others; whereby he plainly manifeſts that he is more wickedly ignorant.</p>
                  <p>It is a Villanous Trick. Private Slander is a ſort of Civil Gun-powder, that blows up whole Families at once; He that thus robs a Man of his Practice, (though I thank God it is not my Caſe) may ſometimes with him famiſh his Wife and Children; and he deſerves their curſes againſt him, as well as their cryes.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is a dangerous Trick both to the Slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and to the Slanderer.</p>
                  <p>To the Slandered, becauſe it ſtrikes at his Credit, which is precious, eaſily loſt, and hardly if ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It's Precious; Life is Precious, but a good Name is better than Life, eſpecially if Livly-hood alſo goes away with it, as it is many times ſeen, when a ſlander falls upon a Man in a Profeſſion, and for it: for exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal repute is many times of far greater conſequence than internal worth. How many are there that with ſmall parts make a great buſtle in the World; if their reputation ſtands but fair, and they themſelves be but induſtrious in their way, affable and obliging in their carriage; whereas great parts if they be once cried down by ſlanders, they can hardly hold Boat to Wind, or keep their Heads above Water.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's eaſily loſt. Credit is indeed of great worth, but it is very delicate. It is like a Flower, delightful to look on, pleaſant to ſmell to, and it may be of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Medicinal uſe, but it is eaſily ſullied and deflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and when once whithered, for</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The moſt part it is gone, and lives no more: It is like a <hi>Venice</hi>-Glaſs, bright and clear; but withal fragile, and if once crackt, though it may be ſodred or plaiſtred and ſerve for ſome uſe, yet it is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, undervalued, and in a manner fit for nothing. Credit to men in a Profeſſion, is like Virginity to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; it enhanſeth their price and juſt eſteem mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50464:58"/>
but if it once be loſt, how ſhall it be retriev'd?</p>
                  <p>People are as ready to catch at ſlanders, as ſlies are to light upon a gal'd place; and they have their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to come again, be they never ſo often beaten off.</p>
                  <p>When a Slander hath once taken Air, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, who is able to ſtop or ſtay its wild-fire from doing miſchief? It's like a poiſoned Arrow, if it once fetcheth blood, who can keep it from infecting or taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Heart? A Man can never therefore be too careful of his credit, he muſt keep it as the apple of his Eye, many times guarding it when there is no hurt near, but always defending it when it is in danger.</p>
                  <p>To the Slanderer; for it's fourty to one, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time or other Murder will out, and Slander alſo.</p>
                  <p>I cannot eaſily ſit down and imagine with my ſelf any Perſon ſo impregnable, ſo next to impoſſible to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and convicted, as was Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi>: for being near fourty years a Practiſer of Phyſick in one place, he hath had the opportunity of doing Courteſies and Kindneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to moſt about him, and hath thereby gained their good will, and being all along a great Profeſſor of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion amongſt thoſe that are perhaps really good, and apt to think others ſo likewiſe, he hath gained an eaſie belief, that whatſoever he ſays is true; And yet this Oracle of Phyſick, this piece of ſtarch't Honeſty and Religion, to ſpeak againſt whom one told me, was all one as to ſet my ſhoulders to heave an houſe-end, will probably in any place beſides <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> and poſſibly there alſo be reputed for another Perſon than he was taken for; for if I miſtake not, his paſſions have ſo at length befool'd him, that his <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Some ſix years ſince I was ſent for to a Perſon of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity not far from <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> his Patient; who notwithſtanding all that was done for her, continued many days under the torturing pains of a Scorbutick Collick; I then told him, that in my opinion it was high time to give her ſome eaſe by an Opiate Medicin, for which ſhe was not yet too weak: he oppoſed my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for fear forſooth that any thing which had <hi>Opium</hi> in it ſhould further impact the Morbifick Matter. I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued that <hi>Symptoma urgens</hi> did indicate as a Cauſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing her ſtrength, which without eaſe given could not well hold out, until the conjunct cauſe of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſhould be removed; and beſides, that whilſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was thus on the rack and in a rage, no Phyſick that ſhould remove the Peccant Humor, could work or have its due operation; for Nature muſt firſt work on it, and ſhe was at preſent otherwiſe employed: but to take off all doubt, I told him that my purpoſe was to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect at once both to her ſtrength &amp; the Morbifick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for I purpoſed that ſhe ſhould take the <hi>Laudanum</hi> in a Purging <hi>Bolus</hi>; with ſome reluctancy he at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; the Event was, that it calmed the enraged <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus,</hi> as the Chymiſts love to ſpeak, and ſtopped the violent fermentation of the humors, and having firſt given her great eaſe, it afterwards gently carried off good part of the Morbifick Matter, but not all; for within a ſmall time, the remains, and what was new ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, began again to ferment afreſh, and her Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did return, inſomuch, that early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whilſt we were both of us in bed together, ſhe ſent up her ſervant to acquaint us with the ſadneſs of her condition; Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> that had intimated unto me a little before, that I need not be too diligent, my pay would not be anſwerable, ſpeaking thus of a Family he hath

                     </gap>ietly and at his eaſe in bed and let me get up in a cold Winter-Morning, though it was to mind our Patient's eaſe more than my own. I found her very ill, and by ſuch means as were at hand in her Cloſet next her Chamber, repoſited there I ſuppoſe chiefly for charitable uſes, ſhe her ſelf by the bleſſing of God received ſuch help and ſo great benefit in this her extremity, as pleaſed her ſo well, that ſhe bade me write down her Name in my Book for the beſt Patient I ever had, being a ſort of promiſe that ſhe would be ſo: and ſome hours after, when Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> was got up and come into her Chamber, in my hearing, ſhe bade him get out of her ſight, ſhe could not endure him; If this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſaid ſhe, had not aroſe and come to me, I might have periſhed for all you. And this I think was the foundation and firſt beginning of his quarrelling with me: For finding how things went, and what an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt I had gained in this Patient, he begins to think it high time to look about him; and reflecting with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that ſome of her neareſt Relations were ſtill his faſt Friends as well as old Acquaintance, for he had been about twenty years a Phyſician to the Family, and I never there before; he takes the opportunity of the next returning of her pains, for neither yet was the Diſeaſe wholly extirpated, and then when grief and ſadneſs had again ſeized the Family, whilſt I was yet in the houſe, behind my back he makes his complaint to the Husband and Mother-in-Law, of my irrational proceedings; inſinuating, as if what I had done that Morning when he kept his bed, was the repeating of ſome Opiate which had impacted the Morbifick Matter, and was the cauſe of theſe her returning torments, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more expreſly words to this purpoſe, that I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done more than I could anſwer, and that if they did not ſet a ſpy upon me, I would kill her, I was ſo
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50464:59"/>
venturous: and accordingly forthwith a ſpy was ſet to ſee that I medled not, or mixed any thing for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. No queſtion but this good man ſaw in his Bed, if not in his ſleep, what Medicines I took down in the Ladies Cloſet, and how I ordered them; or elſe the Nurſe gueſſed at them, and told him. But a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of good Credit, whom I can Name, told me, that he heard him ſpeak to the Husband and Mother, theſe things he ſaid of me behind my back. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I went to her Mother, and told her, that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> had ſaid of me, and that as her Daughters Life was in hazard, which was dear to her, ſo was my Credit alſo which was dear to me; upon both accounts I deſired her to ſend for a third Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. He when he came approved of what I had done, but the Husband would not believe him, ſo much had Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> frighted him with my venturouſneſs, until that third Phyſician brought with him the next day Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> his Book <hi>de Scorbuto</hi> then newly come forth, and ſhewed therein the Medicine in effect which I had given, with this commendation, that nothing was like it in ſuch a caſe as this was, to preſerve Life; and then the Husband told me I was in the right, but ſtill my ſpy was continued upon me, though it's like the young Lady knew it not, ſo much I think were her Relations afraid, leſt the Phyſician, whom yet probably for the Patients ſake who applauded me, they would not let go, ſhould yet hurt her by his ſtay. But although Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> had thus manacled my hands, yet I was not ſo disingenuous towards him, but helped to contrive a way how to give him his liberty of acting what he had a mind to, which otherwiſe he could not have had. Nothing was ſo proper in his Judgment, as Foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Part; I asked him, in what time he thought this would give her eaſe? In four or ſix hours replied he, if ſhe will lie quiet, who yet, alas, would hardly lie ſtill ſo many minutes. But to further his ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to help forward the uſe of his Fomentation,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50464:60"/>
I uſed this Stratagem. The young Lady had found ſo much eaſe by the Opiate Medicine, that nothing now would ſatisfie her, but ſhe muſt have <hi>Opium.</hi> I asked therefore her Mother, if ſhe had no Pills in the houſe, and ſhe brought me ſome <hi>Maſtich-Pills,</hi> of ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I made very little Pills, ſuppoſing with my ſelf that the young Lady would take them for <hi>Laudanum</hi>; as ſoon therefore as the Fomentation was laid on, I gave her a Pill, enjoyning her to lie as quiet as poſſibly ſhe could, and compoſe her ſelf to ſleep, promiſing her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Pill, if within one hour ſhe ſlept not. Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all expectation we kept her tolerably quiet, but not finding the effects of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> ſhe did find out I preſume the honeſt cheat, and afterwards was diſguſted with me alſo, as I then thought. Not long after, the Fomentations were again prepared, and that night Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> watch't; the next morning very early, her ſervant comes up and awakes me, and tells me po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively that her Miſtreſs was dead, but however I muſt riſe and come to her Maſter, and finding him not in his own Chamber, I went unto his Ladies, where I find the Mother ſtaying her Daughter's Head, which was quite limber, with one hand, and with the other rubbing her Temples. Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> ſtanding at the beds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, and dooming that this was not <hi>Syncope</hi> but <hi>Mors.</hi> I that was prepoſſeſſed with her being dead, though I ſaw ſome little life; yet looking upon it as the glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only of the Sun going down: I took her Husband aſide into the next Chamber, uſing ſuch diſcourſes as I thought I had been called unto: after a good while re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, and finding all things in their poſtures as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; I began to think with my ſelf that the Caſe was not altogether deſperate, and therefore went about to the other ſide of the bed and felt her Pulſe, and called up Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> and told him, if this were the pulſe of a dying Lady, I would never truſt pulſe more. He own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it was not ſo very bad, but yet this was <hi>Mors.</hi> I then asked leave, to lay my hand where her pain uſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50464:60"/>
to be, and ſhe ſtarted; calling therefore for two Silver-Spoons and the Glaſs of Cordial, I got ſome of it into her Mouth, and by degrees ſhe revived and is yet alive; but neither She nor her Husband did ever make uſe of me afterwards, though they had ſeveral times occaſion for two Phyſicians.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, I was called to a young Maid in <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> not quite ten years old: when I came there, I learned that ſhe was Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> his Patient, but the Mother would fain have had me undertaken her cure alone, but I would not do any thing before he was firſt ſent for. Her Diſeaſe was a Pleuriſie, and I was for Bleeding her, to which he would not give conſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was not fourteen years old, perhaps becauſe it was his fault it had not been done already. I modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urg'd my reaſons, but he uncivilly broke from me, and left me with this threat; That I ſhould take it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my own Shoulders. She did bleed, and did recover, but when he could not faſten any ill Event upon me in the Caſe, he yet poſſeſſes the Parents with the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of my Practice, and how that their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would hardly ever recover my bleeding of her; and I was never made uſe of more in that Family.</p>
                  <p>Within a ſhort time hapned this Caſe of young Mrs. <hi>Moore,</hi> in which I met with ſome Diſcouragements by Language from Mr. <hi>Loſs,</hi> but I paſſed them by; yet after this Patient was recovered, in which ſtill he could not faſten any unluckineſs of ſucceſs behind my back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he tells Mrs. <hi>Moore,</hi> (for ſhe her ſelf told it me again, and will witneſs it,) that ſhe had great reaſon to give God thanks that her Daughter fell into her great Sweat, (<hi>mark the Piety of the Man</hi>) for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I had killed her, (<hi>mark his Charity unto his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> in one and the ſame breath): but ſhe, better like a Chriſtian and a Phyſician too, made this anſwer; <hi>Nay Doctor I am not of your opinion, for if my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had not been Bled and Furg'd, how ſhould Nature have been able to have diſcharged the remains by Sweat?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:50464:61"/>Theſe Caſes, and another of a young Gentleman, whom he had given over, that was afterward my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and is yet alive, following one the other ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully, made Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> ſo heartily angry with me, that a while after, Mr. <hi>Baynard</hi> of <hi>Cliff</hi> being ill, and not finding ſo much benefit as he wiſhed for by what Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> had done for him, told him, (for Mr. <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> himſelf told it to me again) that upon a ſettlement of but one piece of Land, he uſed to have the advice of two or three Lawyers; and his Life being more dear to him than his Eſtate, he did deſire, having heard a good report of me, that I might be joined in Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with him: He anſwered, that he would not joyn with me any more, I had ſo abuſed him in the Caſe of Mrs. <hi>Moore</hi>'s Daughter; he added alſo ſuch vilifying words as Mr. <hi>Baynard</hi> cannot deny, and which I do not think fit to print, having by this Book I hope ſufficiently proved them falſe: But they prevailed then ſo, as to make me loſe my Patient.</p>
                  <p>I could add other inſtances, but theſe are ſufficient to prove Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> his ſlanderings of me, and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage I ſuſtained by them in my Practice, though I do not much matter that, for elſe I would never have lived thus retired; and in my reputation alſo, but this I will not ſo eaſily part with, except I loſe it in my Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.</p>
                  <p>And now after all this, to Anſwer directly to this firſt Accuſation, I ſay;</p>
                  <p>I am not conſcious of any unworthy ſlandering of this Gentleman, and I have now owned in print more againſt him, than ever I related to any one in private, and I am ready to anſwer unto any particular wherein he ſhall ſay I have wronged him. Touching this Caſe, I knew his temper by thoſe experiences above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, which were before this young Gentlewoman was ſick, and therefore was ſo far from provoking him, that I deſired Mrs. <hi>Moore</hi> to have me excuſed from medling in the Caſe, for I was rather willing to have loſt the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50464:61"/>
profit of ſo generous a Patient, than to have to do with her firſt Phyſician: but it being the Mother's earneſt deſire we ſhould conſult, I modeſtly propoſed, and not Magiſterially, what I thought beſt, and told Mrs. <hi>Moore</hi> that I ſhould not be honeſt, if being ſent for to conſult, I ſhould not freely deliver what my judgment was; but having ſo done, I did not deſire that my opinion ſhould out-ballance his, yea I preſſed her not to follow my Advice, but rather his; urging that he was both an elder Phyſician, and her old Acquaintance: but ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting before us both that in her Judgment, I ſpoke more reaſon than he, ſided with me againſt him whether I would or no, telling him then unto his face, that he muſt lay aſide his prejudice; which angred him I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the more, and put him upon falling thus upon me in print.</p>
                  <p>But this firſt Accuſation is evidently and plainly proved to be falſe, by witneſſe, for it is matter of Fact; and who can better tell, whether I accuſed all that Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> had done than Mrs. <hi>Moore</hi> her ſelf, who was preſent, and would be ſo to all our Conſultations; and who ſays in her Letter which I have yet to ſhew: <hi>I muſt profeſs, that you never to my knowledg cenſured Mr.</hi> Loſs, <hi>or accuſed him of any thing</hi>; that is, of what had been done.</p>

                  <p>Therefore a Child under fourteen years old may be bled by Lancet.</p>
                  <p>If the ſtrength do not contraindicate by being too weak, the Age cannot, for that is a conſideration ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to ſtrength, and it never prohibits bleeding but upon this account, that a perſon of ſuch an Age, is not able to bear ſo noble a Remedy as bleeding by Lancet.

                  <p>Strength in Children is ſo weak that they can hardly bear opening of a Vein: for Children have a ſoft, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and patent Body; which daily and of it ſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts and diſſolves: Therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his 4<hi>th</hi> of Dyet in acute Diſeaſes, commands that there be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the opening of a vein a flouriſhing Age with the greatneſs of the Diſeaſe and the ſtrength of Nature: and <hi>Galen</hi> following him in his 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Meth.</hi> the 14<hi>th Chapter,</hi> forbids ſuch bleeding before fourteen years of age. But ſaith <hi>Riverius</hi> this is to be underſtood of that large bleeding ſo much in uſe amongſt the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50464:63"/>
For almoſt every Age can bear that moderate bleeding, which is equal if not inferiour to the ſtrength and <hi>Plethora</hi> in the Patient, if he be ſtrong and luſty of his Age. For Age is not ſo much to be reckoned by the number of the years, as by the habit of Body, and its ſtrength. That which <hi>Celſus</hi> elegantly confirms in <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>Book</hi> 2. The Ancients (<hi>ſays he</hi>) were of opinion, that the firſt Age of Man could not bear this ſort of Remedy, but uſe afterward ſhewed, that there were other conſiderations more eligible, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto which the advice of the Phyſician ought to be directed. For the concern is not what a Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's Age is, but what his ſtrength is: Therefore a ſtrong Child is ſafely Cured. Thus <hi>Avenzoar</hi> makes mention of his ſucceſsful bleeding his own Son at three years old; and we find by experience, that Children of four or five years old do by bleeding moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcape dangerous Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Author likewiſe, in his <hi>Praxis</hi> and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Pleuriſie, ſays thus:
<q>Adeo neceſſaria eſt Venaeſectio in principiò, ut nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam omitti debeat, nedum in ſene, puero, gravidâ puerpera, &amp; menſtruas purgationes Patienti, docuit ènim Experientia, hiſce omnibus utiliſſimam fuiſſe Venaeſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem preſente hoc morbo.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So neceſſary is opening of a Vein in the beginning of a Pleuriſie, that it muſt never be omitted, no not in an old Man, or Child, or Woman with Child, or that hath her Terms: for Experience doth teach us, that in all theſe in this Diſeaſe, opening of a Vein hath been moſt profitable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By Experience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not long ſince that I knew a Girle not five years old, that fell into an <hi>Atrophy,</hi> a meer waſting and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away, without any Symptoms of a Conſumption or <hi>Phthiſis</hi>; ſhe was too young forſooth to be bled, and all other means were to no purpoſe, for ſhe died, and upon the opening of her Body, her Liver was found
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50464:63"/>
ſo largely grown, as to out-weigh the Spleen ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen times. Now whether the Liver be the <hi>Fons San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis,</hi> or the Heart, or neither, but that every Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el contributes its office towards the making of the Blood, yet ſince the Liver by ſeparating the Choler into the Gall, ſweetens the Blood much, and that ſweetneſs helps to increaſe both Liver and Blood, as alſo doth the abſence of the acid ferment from the Spleen; and I am prone to think, that the <hi>Helluo</hi> the Blood eat her up, and cauſed ſuch an over-faſt grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Liver, as ſtarved the Spleen and other parts. Should another ſuch a Caſe offer it ſelf of ſuch a <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora,</hi> would any rational man forbid bleeding until the Child were fourteen years old, of which there is no likelyhood it ſhould live until ſeven? I am ſure I did not in a Brother to this Siſter, about ſeven years old, that not long after was treading in her ſteps, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king haſte apace unto the ſame end; but being forwarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I bled him, and I never ſaw more advantage by bleeding befal a Man, than hapned unto this Child; his recovery was ſo ſpeedy and his health ſo good ever ſince, as thoſe then about him can witneſs.</p>
                  <p>I might inſtance alſo in the two above-mentioned Experiences, wherein Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> himſelf can bear me witneſs of ſucceſsfulneſs of bleeding under fourteen years of Age.</p>
                  <p>Yet by all this which I have ſaid, I do not mean that I would encourage any Phyſician to be raſh and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous, one that ſhould hand-over-head pell-mell bleed all younger Patients as readily as Men, without due conſideration of their tender Age: but I only urge from what I have written, That there may be a time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it may be neceſſary to bleed a Child by Lancet under fourteen years old.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here was <hi>Plethora quoad vires,</hi> ſuch a fulneſs of Humors in the Maſs of her Blood, as Nature could not rule well or manage, ſo as to preſerve them in their due Temperament and Mixture, from ſeparating and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting, and therefore to remove this Morbifick Cauſe, and to disburden the Body of a good ſhare of that load it was preſſed under, that ſo Nature might the better comport with the remainder, and by degrees maſter and ſubdue the Diſeaſe; opening of a Vein was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite.</p>
                  <p>Here was alſo need of <hi>Revulſion from a weak Part,</hi> and Revulſion did Indicate Bleeding: for this Patient was repreſented to me when I firſt viſited her, as a Child always Sickly, Splenetick, and Scorbutick; and having her left Side weak by being Splenetick, and pained in her left Breaſt more or leſs for two years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe fell ſick. Formerly ſhe was obnoxious to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs, and now alſo there was a flux of Humors in the maſs of Blood flowing to her left Side, part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed Blood had already got thither, and lodging it ſelf within the <hi>Pleura</hi> and Vicine Muſcles, cauſed in her a Symptomatical Pleuriſie, and there was great fear leſt that inflammation ſhould increaſe farther, and therefore as bleeding was principally Indicated by the <hi>Plethora,</hi> ſo was it likewiſe accidentally Indicated by <hi>Revulſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here was <hi>Heat</hi> likewiſe, that did Indicate acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally the opening of a Vein, in order unto the cooling her whole Body which was in a flame, ſhe having a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Scorbutick Feaver for her principal Diſeaſe. Now
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50464:64"/>
this Preternatural Heat and Fire was to be put out, and bleeding would help upon two accounts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By it, part of the Fire, even part of the Inflamed Blood might be taken away.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By it, Inſenſible Tranſpiration (whoſe Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alone, is greater far than all the ſenſible together, as <hi>Sanctorius</hi> obſervs in his <hi>Medicina Statica</hi>) might be promoted, the Pores of the skin opened, whereby the Heat might breath forth, and perhaps the cold Air get ſome ways in. Theſe Pores were before as it were wedged up with the plenty of Humors, as is ſometimes a Church-door by a throng of People, each hindering another from getting forth; but bleeding might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wedg them, by letting ſome out another way, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature room to drive forth what was ſuperfluous by an open and free Tranſpiration, as was alſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done in this Patient, who not long after fell into a great univerſal Sweat, which completed her Cure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Coindications.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some were taken from her Naturals, and ſome from her Non-Naturals.</p>
                  <p>To her <hi>Naturals</hi> did belong her</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Strength</hi>: This was good even Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> himſelf being Judg: ſo good, as nothing could hurt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Habit of Body</hi>: For lean people are generally fuller of Blood, and have larger veſſels than thoſe that are fat and groſs; their Blood alſo wants more ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Her Age</hi>: Though it was not fourteen, yet was it about four.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems noways unagreeable to Reaſon, to aſſert that one and the ſame thing, may both Contraindicate and Coindicate bleeding, as it is diverſly conſidered. For example; He that conſiders of age under fourteen years that it is tender, and waſts very much by the pores, or habit of Body, may ſo far look upon it as a <hi>Contraindicans,</hi> as not to bleed in ſuch an age, except there be great need and good ſtrength, for fear the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50464:65"/>
ſhould not be able to bear two large Evacuations at once.

And this ſtage of Childhood is ſubdivided into four parts: Infancy laſts till four years old, ſome ſay until ſeven: <hi>Pueritia</hi> or Boy-hood laſts from ſeven to fourteen: <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> from fourteen to eighteen, and <hi>Adoleſcency</hi> from eighteen to twentyfive. <hi>Pueritia</hi> therefore from ſeven to fourteen years old, is an efficient Cauſe of the bloods Predominancy in the Body, for the Temperament now is hot and moiſt, and ſo is the Bloods; Children alſo do eat much, and being full of play and exerciſe, they generally digeſt well, and they have neither cares nor fears nor any inordinate paſſions to waſte or drink up their Blood, at leaſt its Life and Spirits; ſo that this Patient's not being fourteen years old, at which Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> hath ignorantly made all this ſtir, did in truth more Coindicate than Contraindicate her bleeding.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Her <hi>Part Affected,</hi> which beſides her Heart, was her <hi>Pleura</hi> or Side; which being a Membranous part, in its Subſtance and Temperament <hi>Spermatick,</hi> not <hi>Sanguifick,</hi> having exquiſite Senſe, and in its ſituation being neighbour unto the Heart, a part that upon all theſe accounts was very unfit to have any Blood, much leſs inflamed Blood poured out upon it, did alſo Coindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Bleeding; partly that it might be relieved from what it already ſuffered, by having ſtrength to diſcuſs

or concoct it whilſt it was not much; partly that it might be delivered from the imminent danger of new hot Blood flowing unto it, by a Revulſion of it with bleeding.</p>
                  <p>To her <hi>Non-Naturals</hi> did belong;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Air</hi> to which belongs the time of the year when ſhe lay ſick, It was in the Spring, a Seaſon moſt ſeaſonable for bleeding; for like the Sap riſing in the Trees, our Blood alſo Ferments afreſh; the Time it ſelf being hot and moiſt, and the return of the Sun to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us gives us a ſort of new Life and Spirits. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, The approaching Summer gives ſomething of encouragement to venture bleeding, becauſe in it we may the better hope for a fit Time to recover in, if we ſhould loſe a little ſtrength by bleeding.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I have already above ſhewed, that the Diſeaſe, and the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe did Indicate bleeding by Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet; let Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> ſhew how either of them did Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indicate bleeding by Lancet in this Patient.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Coindicantia</hi> and <hi>Correpugnantia,</hi> do belong to things Natural or Non-natural, even unto all ſuch as are either Cauſes or Signs of a Patient's Strength.

                  <p>But this Patient's Diſeaſe did require opening a Vein. Therefore Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> was to blame, it was not done before the ſixth day.</p>
                  <p>I do not know that the <hi>Major</hi> needs any Proof.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> hath been proved already.

                  <p>In the beginning of this young Ladie's ſickneſs, there was none other Phyſician but Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi>: there was then no animoſity or prejudice againſt any other Phyſician, for to his Cure alone her Life was recommended, and no body diſturbed or hindred him from doing what he thought beſt; that he did not therefore bleed her by Lancet, cannot be well attributed unto any thing elſe, but to his ignorance; he did not know that a Vein might be opened in a Child under fourteen years old, or if he did, he was yet more to blame.

               <head>To his Third Accuſation. That the bleeding of her by Leeches, which had been appointed, was of no moment.</head>
               <p>WE have an Engliſh Proverb, <hi>Better is half a Loaf than no Bread</hi>; and it is true alſo, if we cannot do as we would, we muſt do as we can: Where the Lancet may not be had, I never ſaid bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Leeches was of no moment; but I do ſay in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50464:67"/>
this Caſe it was but of little moment. For it was not a Salve large enough for the Sore, nor a Remedy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable and proportionable to the Diſeaſe, whoſe greatneſs and nimbleneſs did not require bleeding for ſimple Evacuation only, but for ſpeedy Revulſion alſo; which could not ſo anſwerably be performed by the faint droppings of a Leech, as by the full ſtream of a Lancet. The inflamed Blood was in a carreir, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on apace with a full tide, to this Patient's weak Side; ſome had got already into the <hi>Pleura,</hi> and there cauſed a Pleuriſie, and more was following, called thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the anguiſh of a pricking pain in a very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Membrane, ſent thither by the opening of a vent that way; would any one think that the fleabite of a Leech in the Arm, would turn ſuch a courſe of Blood? or that Nature (though in a miſtake) being in her haſte upon an errand of life and death, would probably ſtay to take notice of the little barkings or bitings of the ſmall Curs the Leeches. No, but if by a Lancet ſuch a breach be made, or ſo wide a door opened, that within a ſmall time the blood, and with it the life, might quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run out; upon ſuch an Alarm indeed it may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſuppoſed, that by letting forth but four or five ounces, the ſtream may turn, and Nature be ſo highly concerned, as to neglect a leſſer danger, the relieving of the ſide, to prevent a greater, the loſing of life; or <hi>quà data porta ruit</hi>; the Blood running out faſter by the Arm, than into the Side, the ſtream muſt needs go that way where there is moſt vent: whereas by Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, a man's life may leiſurely and inſenſibly drop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without any notice almoſt. And I pray of what great benefit could be Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> his bleeding of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient by Leeches, when-as notwithſtanding ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſo ill, that all the Family deſpaired of her Life?</p>

               <p>IT is evident that he condemns me for not obſerving that requiſite in bleeding, a due Quantity; but it is not ſo evident whether he finds fault that it was <hi>too much</hi> or <hi>too little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Fever and other Symptoms were gone the ſixth day before I bled her, there was no need of bleeding at all, and then four ounces was too much; but it lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> to prove that the Fever and other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were then gone.</p>

That Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> himſelf the day before did acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in ſo ſmall a quantity as five ounces, taken away by the Leeches which he applied to the left Arm.

               <p n="2">2. For the ſame Reaſons for which Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> durſt not bleed her at all by Lancet, it was reaſonable that I ſhould not by bleeding take any great quantity from one that was not yet fourteen years old.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As little as four ounces ſeems to be, being let out by Lancet in the right Arm, it is reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they might make ſome <hi>Revulſion</hi> from the left <hi>Pleura,</hi> which was the very Intention for which they were, there, and ſo let out.</p>

               <head>To his Sixth Accuſation That the Manner of bleeding was amiſs. It ought to have been done by Leeches, but it was done by Lancet.</head>
               <p>THere needs none other Anſwer to this, than what is already given to the Third Accuſation: for if his bleeding by Leeches, neither in Reaſon could, nor in Fact did do much good, the Lancet was evidently more eligible and preferable.</p>

               <head>To his Fourth Accuſation. That the time of bleeding her was not ſeaſonable, it was on the ſixth day of the Diſeaſe, when the Fever and other Symptoms were gone.</head>
               <p>THE time of Bleeding a Patient, ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the preſence of the <hi>Indicantia,</hi> and by the abſence of the <hi>Prohibentia</hi>; for one may then bleed a Patient, when bleeding is requiſite and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, when ſtrength will bear it, and when nothing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it, ſo as to threaten a likelyhood of more hurt than good by it.</p>
               <p>It's true, nearer the beginning of the ſickneſs, had been the beſt time to have bled this Patient upon ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al accounts, and Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> might have done it, but I was not called before this ſixth day; and therefore could not do it earlier. But bleeding in a Pleuriſie is not forbidden after the firſt five days, as if it might not be done ſo late as the ſixth day: for ſaith <hi>Riverius</hi> in his Chapter of a Pleuriſie.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Bleeding eſpecially profits in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, but if it be then omitted, or not enough per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, you may bleed after the ſeventh, ninth, or eleventh day: that is, if the Patient be able to bear it.</p>
               <p>Now this ſixth day ſhe had not at all been bled by Lancet, and Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> his bleeding her by Leeches was not ſufficient, the <hi>Indicantia</hi> and <hi>Coindicantia</hi> did ſtill remain, and there was no ſuch decay in her ſtrength as to forbid bleeding; therefore even now the ſixth day ſhe might be bled, unleſs a <hi>Criſis</hi> had been towards health expected the next day, but there was no reaſon to hope for any ſuch thing, the <hi>dies Indices</hi> did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn, nor Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> mention, that he expected a <hi>Criſis,</hi> for indeed Nature ſtill groaned under the burden of the Diſeaſe, ſo far ſhe was from being Miſtreſs of it; for the Diſeaſe was likely to grow ſtronger every day, and more and more to threaten the hazard of the Patient's Life.

               <p>Touching the other part of this Accuſation, That I bled her then when the Diſeaſe was gone.

                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:50464:69"/>For my part, I do not intend to trouble my ſelf or the Reader, with a diſpute ſo well and ſo largely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>Sennertus,</hi> who hath taken the pains to relate the opinions of near thirty ſeveral Authors touching this point, and amongſt them <hi>Fuchſius</hi> is one, and yet <hi>Sennertus</hi> holds for me.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only tell the Reader what Reaſon I had to bleed this Patient in the contrary Arm.</p>
               <p>I took my Indication for bleeding her, from the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Fever which was her principal Diſeaſe, and not principally from her Pleuriſie which was Symptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</p>
               <p>Now the Putrid Fever did not Indicate bleeding, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>Revulſion</hi> or <hi>Derivation,</hi> but <hi>Evacuation</hi> only; That part of the putrid and corrupt Blood might be carried off, which did burden Nature, and make her unable to manage the maſs of Humors in the Veſſels: and this Evacuation might be performed as well in the right Arm as in the left. But beſide the Putrid Fever, I had to conſider of in this Patient a Symptomatical Pleuriſie in her left Side, and that which made Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> ſo fierce for bleeding on that Side was in my judgment a main reaſon for the contrary: for ſeeing bleeding for the Fever, might be indifferently done in either Arm, who would have choſen to have done it in the left, thereby drawing the Humors more to the weaker ſide, weak formerly as hath been mentioned, and now much more ſo, by the inflammation of the <hi>Pleura</hi> on that Side, and not rather in the right Arm, by which at once <hi>Revulſion</hi> was made from the <hi>Pleura</hi> inflamed, and <hi>Evacuation</hi> of the putrid and inflamed Blood fully as well, if not better performed, than in the left Side: ſo that what Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> alledgeth as my fault that I bled her in the right Arm, would have been my fault, if following his counſel I had done it in the left.</p>
               <p>I know well that bleeding in a Pleuriſie is uſually in the ſame Side, and I have many times ſo Practiſed, when I had no fear of any great <hi>Plethora,</hi> or of the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50464:70"/>
flowing of Humors to the part eſpecially weak before, and when the Pleuriſie was more urgent than the Fever. But at this time, here was no Pleuriſie at all, if we may believe Mr. <hi>Loſs,</hi> and yet angry he is, that I would not help to bring it again, by drawing the Humors what I could to her weak Side,</p>
               <p>I could fill up much Paper upon this ſubject, but I am not willing to anticipate Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> his Reply, he may perhaps pick much meat out of this Gooſe-Eye: yet My comfort is, that although I am for the oppoſite Side, hitherto, as luck would have it, it hath been for the right.</p>

                     <hi>Obj 1.</hi> The Diſeaſe it ſelf inasmuch as he judged that it was a Pleuriſie, did forbid purging.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> I do readily acknowledg that a Pleuriſie as ſuch doth forbid purging; for that is not the immediate way to remove the inflamed Blood from the <hi>Pleura,</hi> nor yet any corruption that is there gathered. The Conjunct Cauſe of a Pleuriſie muſt be either evacuated by bleeding, diſperſed or expectorated, and purging ſeems a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary motion. But yet I ſay, That in the Cure of all Diſeaſes, the firſt <hi>Indication</hi> that is to be ſatisfied by them that underſtand the Art, though ſillily neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here by Mr. <hi>Loſs,</hi> is the removing of the Antecedent Cauſe. He ſpent all his ſhot at the conjunct cauſe, the aſſwaging of the pain in her Side, and the helping of her expectoration, and was ſo far from bleeding her by Lancet and purging her, that he did not only neglect them himſelf; but was ſo ignorant, as to find fault with another in print for doing them; &amp; thereby diſcover his own want of skill. Had he underſtood himſelf aright, he would not have been ſo mad, as to have hazarded his Patient's Life, by acquieſcing in his ſafe Medicines; his <hi>Emollient and cooling Glyſter, Fomentation, Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm, Linctus, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; in the <hi>interim</hi> to ſuffer the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of Cure, and the ſtrength of his Patient worn out by ſickneſs, to paſs away. But this is his ſafe way of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice for which he hath been long famous; ſtoring his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient with <hi>Juleps, Almond-Milks, Pearle-Water,</hi> that is, a little Cordial-water with a little Cinnamon-water, &amp; ſweetned with <hi>Manus Chriſti perlata:</hi> and let theſe that thus admire him, uſe him ſtill. But with what reaſon can any Phyſician approve his this way curing of a Pleuriſie,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50464:71"/>
whilſt the Fever was yet permitted to rage? or who beſides him, could have been ſo confident of ſucceſs in expectorating the Conjunct Matter, whilſt yet the Antecedent Cauſe was ſo buſie? When Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocts, ſhe is at leaſure, and is Miſtreſs of the Diſeaſe, that which I cannot underſtand imaginable, until the burden of Humors be firſt taken off by purging. And therefore it is, that they which pleaſe to read the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Phyſicians in the Cure of a Pleuriſie, will find that in it they many times preſcribe purging as well as bleeding, though it be not the principal Remedy, and reſpect not the Conjunct Cauſe but the Antecedent.</p>

               <head>To his Ninth Accuſation. The Seventh day he Purged her.</head>
               <p>IT is confeſſed Purging is forbid on a Critical day. When Nature is both buſie and able about her own work, ſhe ought not to be interrupted and diſturbed by Art, which like an handmaid ought to wait upon her motions, and not to preſcribe her which way ſhe ſhall walk. But it is not confeſſed that the ſeventh day of every Diſeaſe is Critical; for in many Diſeaſes there is no Criſis at all; and although the ſeventh day of a Fever is many times Critical, it is not therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuch a <hi>Sabboth</hi> that it is a profaning of it, if a Phyſician gives then his Patient working Phyſick; for if Nature on a ſeventh day be not able but impotent, and the Diſeaſe prevails, what diſturbance I pray is it to help her off with her burden, eſpecially whilſt ſhe is able to comport with the trouble of removing it? other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe indeed a Phyſician ought not to defame ſo noble a Remedy, but to leave that Patient to his <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> whom to help it is as much in vain, as it is to pull-up a ſnuff in a Lamp that will go out if you touch it. But that was not the caſe here, for here was excellent and invincible ſtrength; only the number of the Enemies that were upon the Patient were too many. But we muſt not forſooth help Nature, no not on her own day when ſhe would willingly help her ſelf if that ſhe could, but then, when ſhe moſt needs, treacherouſly leave her unto her ſelf, and the enemies with all their force upon her and againſt her.</p>
               <p>Had Nature had the better of the Diſeaſe, ſo that this ſeventh day I was to have expected a <hi>Criſis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> ſhould have told me, that on the fourth <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

were ſigns of concoction, and a forewarning of a <hi>Criſis,</hi> and that therefore I muſt not purge her: but not a word of any ſuch thing in the Conſultation; and had there been, the bleeding of her the day before, might have altered the caſe; only he had a mind to publiſh me for ſo ignorant a Practicant, as on the ſeventh day to give a Purge, as if Critical or not Critical, all days were alike to me, that had neither Method nor Reaſon in my Practice, as Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> obſerves.</p>

               <p>THE precedent Accuſation reſpected the Time when, this Medicine wherewith; all whoſe fault is, that I know of, that it's ſo ſimple: for this Gentleman ſeems to have deſigned to have ſet me forth every way for a moſt pittiful Phyſician, one that had neither me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod nor reaſon in his Practice, and as to the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> the height of his skill was to arrive unto no more knowledg, than that a little Powder of <hi>Sena</hi> would purge; which weighed with the many Recipes, which himſelf hath ſet down at large in his Book, and which particularly he preſcribed for this Patient, are in no ways comparable. My Anſwer is, that how mean ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, it did the work, and the ſlighter the means, I think the greater was the Art. <hi>Fruſtra fit per plura, quod fieri poteſt per pauciora.</hi> And in my opinion, that Phyſician is moſt judicious and beſt underſtands him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and learns more experience by his own Practice, that confines himſelf ordinarily to a few Medicines, and that never makes uſe of a compound, where a ſimple will ſerve turn. It's true, People are apt to ſlight all things which they know, and to admire thoſe things only which they do not underſtand, and this fills the

And Mr. <hi>Loſs</hi> hath no great reaſon over much to ſlight ſo ſimple a Medicine as <hi>Sena</hi>; for beſides that it hath helped him to get many a Fee from others, he may alſo chance to want it to purge away his own Melancholy.</p>
