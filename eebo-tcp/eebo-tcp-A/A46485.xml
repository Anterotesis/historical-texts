            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>VVHen we ſaw that it was no longer ſafe for us to remain within our Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that thereupon we had taken our reſolutions to withdraw for ſome time; we left to be communicated to you and to all our Subjects the Reaſons of our withdrawing, and were likewiſe reſolved at the ſame time to leave ſuch Orders behind us to you of our Privy Council, as might beſt ſuite with the preſent State of Affairs; but that being altogether unſafe for us at that time, We now think fit to let you know, that tho it has been our conſtant Care ſince our firſt acceſſion to the Crown to Govern our People with that Juſtice and Moderation, as to give, if poſſible, no occaſion of Complaint; yet more particularly upon the late Invaſion, ſeeing how the Deſign was laid, and fearing that our People, who could not be deſtroyed but by themſelves, might by little imaginary Grievances be cheated into a certain Ruin: To prevent ſo great Miſchief, and to take away not only all juſt Cauſes, but even Pretences of Diſcontent, we freely and of our own accord redreſſed all thoſe things that were ſet forth as the Cauſes of that Invaſion, and that we might be informed by the Counſel and Advice of our Subjects themſelves, which way we might give them a further and a full Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, we reſolved to meet them in a Free Parliament; and in order to it, we firſt laid the foundation of ſuch a Free Parliament in reſtoring the City of <hi>London</hi> and the reſt of the Corporations to their ancient Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Priviledges, and afterwards actually appointed the Writs to be iſſued out for the Parliaments meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the 15th of <hi>January.</hi> But the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſeeing all the ends of his Declaration anſwered, the People beginning to be undeceived, and returning apace to their ancient Duty and Allegiance, and well fore-ſeeing that if the Parliament ſhould meet at the time appointed, ſuch a Settlement in all probability would be made both in Church and State, as would totally defeat his ambitious and unjuſt Deſigns; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by all means poſſible to prevent the meeting of the Parliament; and to do this the moſt effectual way, he thought fit to lay a Reſtraint on Our Royal Perſon; for as it were abſurd to <hi>call</hi> that a Free Parliament where there is any force on either of the Houſes, ſo much leſs can that Parliament be ſaid to act freely, where the Sovereign, by whoſe Authority they meet and fit, and from whoſe Royal Aſſent all their Acts receive their Life and Sanction, is under actual Confinement. The hurrying of us under a Guard from our City of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe returning Loyalty he could no longer truſt, and the other Indignities we ſuffered in the perſon of the Earl of <hi>Feverſham,</hi> when ſent to him by us, and in that barbarous Confinement of our own Perſon, we ſhall not here repeat, becauſe they are, we doubt not, by this time very well known, and may, we hope, if enough conſidered and reflected upon, together with his other violations and breaches of the Laws and Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> which by this Invaſion he pretended to reſtore, be ſufficient to open the Eyes of all our Subjects, and let them plainly ſee what every one of them may expect, and what Treatment they ſhall find from him, if at any time it may ſerve his purpoſe, from whoſe hands a Sovereign Prince, an Uncle, and a Father could meet with no better Entertainment. However the ſenſe of theſe Indignities and the juſt apprehenſion of further Attempts againſt our Perſon, by them who already endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to murther our Reputation by infamous Calumnies (as if we had been capable of ſuppoſing a Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>) which was incomparably more injurious than the deſtroying of our Perſon it ſelf, together with a ſerious reflection on a Saying of our Royal Father of bleſſed memory, when he was in the like circumſtances, that <hi>There is little diſtance between the Priſons and the Graves of Princes</hi> (which afterwards proved too true in his Caſe) could not but perſwade us to make uſe of that Right which the Law of Nature gives to the meaneſt of our Subjects, of freeing our ſelves by all means poſſible from that unjuſt Conſinement and Reſtraint. And this we did not more for the Security of our own Perſon, than that thereby we might be in a better capacity of tranſacting and providing for every thing that may contribute to the Peace and Settlement of our Kingdoms: For as on the one hand no Change of Fortune ſhall ever make us forget our ſelves ſo far as to condeſcend to any thing unbecoming that high and Royal Station in which God Almighty by Right of Succeſſion has placed us, ſo on the other hand, neither the Provocation or Ingratitude of our own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, nor any other Conſideration whatſoever ſhall ever prevail with us to make the leaſt ſtep contrary to the true Intereſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, which we ever did and ever muſt look upon as our own. Our Will and Pleaſure therefore is, That you of our Privy Council take the moſt effectual care to make theſe our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Intentions known to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in and about our Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> to the Lord Mayor and Commons of our City of <hi>London,</hi> and to all our Subjects in general, and to aſſure them that we deſire nothing more than to return and hold a Free Parliament, wherein we may have the beſt opportunity of undeceiving our People, and ſhewing the Sincerity of thoſe Proteſtations we have often made, of Preſerving the Liberties and Properties of our Subjects and the Proteſtant Religion, more eſpecially the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as by Law eſtabliſh'd, with ſuch Indulgence for thoſe that diſſent from her, as we have always thought our ſelves in Juſtice and Care of the general Welfare of our People bound to procure for them: And in the mean time, you of our Privy Council (who can judge better by being upon the place) are to ſend us your Advice, what is fit to be done by us towards our returning and the accompliſhing theſe good Ends. And we do require you in our Name and by our Authority to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſo to ſuppreſs all Tumults and Diſorders, that the Nation in general, and every one of our Subjects in particular, may received the leaſt Prejudice from the preſent Diſtractions that is poſſible. So not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your dutiful Obedience to theſe our Royal Commands, we bid you heartily farewel. Given at S. <hi>Germans en Laye</hi> the 4/14 <hi>January</hi> 1688/9 and of our Reign the Fourth Year.</p>
