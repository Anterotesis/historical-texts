            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And, if it fall out to be so great, as it not only well suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth to mantaine the Inhabitants thereof, but also to supply the wants of their bordering neighbours: It serueth our purpose so much the better. And, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as all Soyles produce not all things; How
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6590:12"/>
much more rich and more able a country shalbe to produce diuers and sundry things of profit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie: So much the more sufficient and fyt it will be found to rayse a great citty. For, by that meanes it shall haue the lesse need of others, (which enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth people other while to leaue their habitations,) and be able to afford the more to others (which draweth our neighbors the sooner to our country.)</p>
               <p>But, the fruitfulnes of the Land, sufficeth not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of it selfe alone to rayse a citty vnto greatnes: For many Prouinces there are, and they very rich, that haue neuer a good citty in them. As for Example, <hi>Premont</hi> is one: And there is not a country through<note place="margin">Premont.</note> out all Italy, that hath more plenty of Corne, Cattell, Wine, and of excellent fruits of all sorts, than it hath. And it hath mainteined for many yeares, the Armies and forces both of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Fraunce.</hi> And in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (London</hi> excepted,) although the country do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound<note place="margin">England.

As also in <hi>Fraunce (Paris</hi> excepted) which notwithstanding,<note place="margin">Fraunce. Paris.</note> is not seated in the fruitfullest country of that great kingdome. For, in pleasantnes, it giueth place to <hi>Turen;</hi> in abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of all things, to Xanton and Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; In varyety of Fruites, to <hi>Languedock;</hi> in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnes of the Seas, to <hi>Normandie;</hi> In store of wine, to <hi>Burgundie;</hi> in abundance of Corne, to <hi>Campagna;</hi> In eyther of both, to the country of <hi>Orliens;</hi> in Cattell, to <hi>Brittaine</hi> and the territorie of <hi>Burges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all which it doth appeare, that to the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of a city vnto greatnes, it sufficeth not simply of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6590:12"/>
it selfe alone, that the territorie be fruitfull. And the reason thereof is plaine; For, where a countrie doth plentifullie abound with all maner of good things, the Inhabitants finding all those things at home that are fit, necessary, and profitable for their vse; neyther care, nor haue cause to goe any where else to seeke them, but take the benefit and vse of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ease where they grow.

And this reason prooues the more stronge, where the people affect and long least after vaine and idle delights and pleasures.</p>
               <p>It sufficeth not therefore to the gathering of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of people together, to haue abundance of wealth and substance alone; But there must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, some other forme &amp; matter to vnite and hold them in one place together.

Which of nature is such a substance, that through the grossenes thereof, it is apt to beare great burdens: And through the liquidnes, holpen with the windes, or the oares, fit to carry them to what place they list. So that by such a good meane, the West is ioyned with the East, and the South with the North. And a man might say, that what so growes in one place, growes in all places, by the easie meanes prouided to come by them.</p>
               <p>Now without doubt, the Sea, for her infinit great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and grosnesse of the water, is much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable than the Lakes, or the Riuers. But, the Sea serues you to little purpose, if you haue not a large and safe Port to ride into: I say large, either for the greatnes, or for the depth in the entrie thereat, the middest and the extreames. And I say safe, either from all, or from many windes, or at least from the most blustering and most tempestuous.</p>
               <p>It is held, that, amongst all windes, the Northerne is most tollerable, and that the Seas that are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on the Greekish coast, cease their rage and wax quiet assoone as the winde is laide, But the Southern windes trouble them, and beate them so sore (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Gulfe of <hi>Venice</hi> is an vndoubted witn) esthar euen after the winde is laid, they swell and rage a great while after.</p>

But this take withall, that forasmuch as the sayd Riuers, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the shortnesse of their course, enter and meet together with a mightie rage and violence, they wax great otherwhile, and swell and runne with such a raging course, as they make the strongest Citties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide of them, much more the Country thereabout.

               <p>The thickenesse of the water, is also a verie good helpe in this case. For, it cannot be denied, that the water of one Riuer, beareth great and waighty bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens much better, than the water of some other.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6590:16"/>
And in particuler, when the Obelisk (set vp in the time of <hi>Sextus</hi> the fift) which is to be seene at this day in Saint Peters street, was brought to Rome; It is well knowen by good experience, the water of <hi>Tiber</hi> was of more strength and of more force and<note place="margin">Tiber.

               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Seina</hi> a meane riuer in <hi>France,</hi> beareth ships of such bulke, and carieth burdens so gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e is not a riuer in the world, that for proportion, is able to beare the like burden. So that, although it exceede not a mediocritie, and be but a small riuer; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, it suplieth wonderfully all the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and wants of <hi>Paris,</hi> a citie that in people and in abundance of all things exreedeth far all other cities whatsoeuer within the scope of Christendome.</p>
               <p>Here a man might aske me how it comes to passe,<note place="margin">Questio.</note> that one water should beare more burden than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?</p>
               <p>Some will, that this proceedeth from the nature of the earth that thickneth the water and maketh it stiffe, and by consequence firme and solide. This reason hath no other opposition but <hi>Nilus,</hi> the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Nilus.</note> whereof is so earthie and so muddie, that the Scripture calleth it the Troubled riuer. And it is not to be dronke before it be purged and setled well in the Cesterne. And it doth not only water &amp; mellow all Egipt ouer with its liquidnes, but more than that maketh it fertile, and mucketh as it were the ground with its satnes. And yet it is not of the fittest nor the strongest to susteine and beare shipps, boats, or barks
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:6590:16"/>
of any good burden, wherevpon I should thinke, that for such effect and purpose, wee should not so much preferre the muddinesse of the water, as the sliminesse thereof: for that doth glew it, as it were together, and thicken it the better, and maketh it more fit, and more apt to beare good burden.</p>
               <p>But some man might aske me here again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce cometh this quality, this diuersity (I mean) of waters? I must answere, it comes of 2. causes. First, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very breaking or bursting of it out, and passage along tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough<note place="margin">Resolutio.</note> rich, rank, &amp; fat Countreys. For, riuers partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating of the nature of the grounds that make them their beds &amp; banks, become therby the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues also fat and slimy, &amp; of quality much like to oyle. The next cause, proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the swiftnes &amp; the shortnes of the course. Forasmuch as the lengh of a voiage, &amp; the rage of the Riuers maketh thin, &amp; subtileth the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and breaks &amp; cuts in sunder the slimines of the water: (which happeneth in <hi>Nilus</hi>) For, running in a maner as it doth, 2000. miles by a direct line, (for by an oblique &amp; crooked line, it would be a great deale more) and falling from places exceeding steepe and headlong, where (through the vehemency &amp; violent force of the course, &amp; by the inestimable rage of the fall, it breaketh &amp; dissolueth all into a very small and fine raine as it were) it waxeth so fine and subtile, and so tyreth his waters, that they loose all their slimie properties, which resteth all at the Riuers of <hi>Almaigne</hi> and of <hi>Fraunce.</hi> For, they grow and walke thorough most rich and pleasant Countreys, and they be not ordinarily swift nor violent. Now, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6590:17"/>
this is the true reason thereof: the water of <hi>Senna</hi> shall make a true proofe of it: for if you wash your hands with it, it scowreth like soape, and clenseth you of all manner of spots.</p>
               <p>But let vs now passe to the widenesse: and that is necessarie to beginne withall in Riuers, and in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of which we speake of, that they should be wide and large, that Shippes may commodiouslly winde and turne heere and there at their will and pleasure, and giue way each to other. But the widenesse of a Riuer without depth, serues not for our purpose: for it dissipateth and disperseth the water in such sort, that it maketh it vnfit for nauigation, which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the riuer of <hi>Plate,</hi> which through ouer much widenesse, is for the most part lowe, and of vneuen bottome, and full of rocks and little Ilands. And for the selfe same cause, the riuers of <hi>Spaine,</hi> are not gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nauigable; for they haue large bellies, but they spread wide, and vneuen they are, and vncertaine. And thus much sufficeth to haue sayd of Riuers.</p>
               <p>Now, forasmuch as the commodities and profits are such and so great which the water bringeth to aduance the greatnesse of a Cittie: of consequent those citties must be the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rest and the richest that haue the most store of nauigable Riuers. And euen such are those citties that are seated vpon good Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens of the Seas, riuers, or lakes, that are commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, apt and fit for sundrie nauigations</p>
               <p>It may seeme to some, that with the easinesse of conduct, the foundation is now found out, and full complement and perfection of the greatnesse of a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6590:17"/>
cittie. But it is not so, for it behoues besides that, that there be some matter of profite, that may draw the people, and cause them to repaire to one place more than to another. For where there is no commoditie of conduct, the multitude of people cannot bee great, which the Hils and Mountaines teacheth vs; on which wee may well see many Castles and little townes, but no store of people, that we might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by call them great. And the reason is, because of the craggidnesse and steepnesse of their scites, such things as are necessarie and commodious for a ciuile life, cannot bee brought vnto them without an infinite<note place="margin">Fiesole.</note> toyle and labour. And <hi>Fiesole</hi> became desert, and<note place="margin">Florence.</note> 
                  <hi>Florence</hi> frequented vpon none other cause, than that <hi>Fiesole</hi> standeth on too steepe, and too high a place almost vnaccessible: &amp; <hi>Florence</hi> in a verie plaine, easie to haue accesse vnto it. And in <hi>Rome</hi> we see the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note place="margin">Rome.</note> haue forsaken the <hi>Auentine</hi> and other hils there, &amp; drawne themselus altogether downe to the plaine and places neerest vnto <hi>Tyber,</hi> for the commoditie which the plaine and the water affordeth to the conduct of goods and traffique.</p>
               <p>But where conduct and carriage is easie, you see not for all that, a notable and famous cittie by and by. For without question, the port of <hi>Messina</hi> is farre<note place="margin">Messina.</note> much better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than the port of <hi>Naples,</hi> that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>Naples,</hi> if you behold the people, exceedeth<note place="margin">Naples.</note> more than two <hi>Messinas.</hi> The port of <hi>Carthagena</hi>

               <p>What shall I say of Riuers? In <hi>Perù,</hi> there is the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<note place="margin">Perù. Maragnone a riuer in Perù.</note>

               <p>In <hi>Asia,</hi> although <hi>Menan,</hi> which in their language<note place="margin">Riuers. <hi>Menan. Meicon. Indus. Obuius.</hi>

               <p>After this, another question also ryseth; how it comes, if the commodious meanes of conduct doe at full accomplish the greatnes of a citie; How, I say it comes to passe, where vpon the Shoare of one selfe riuer, the conduct is euen easie, and a like; that one Citie yet, is greater than an other?

Rome might by that meanes, be the sooner peopled through the benefite of their safety they were sure to finde there, neither was he therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a whit; for thither flockt with their goods a number of people that were either thrust out of their habitations, or vnsafe and vnsure of their liues in their countreys. But when they found afterward a want of women necessarie for propagation; <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Romulus.</note> proclaimed certaine great and solemne feasts, at which he stole and held away by force, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of the youngest women that did resort to see them: so that it is no maruaile, if out of so fierce and stoute a people, there rose so fierce and stoute an yssue.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6590:20"/>
necessity, that haue power to make a citie frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or to rayse it vnto greatnes. For a people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forst, and violently driuen to rest in one place: is like vnto seede sowen in the Sands, wherein it neuer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth root to grow vnto ripenes.</p>
               <p>But let vs returne vnto our sanctuarie. It cannot be denyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that a moderate libertie and a lawfull place of safetie, very greatly helpeth to draw a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of people to a resting place. And, hereof it comes, that free Cities are (in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison of other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) more famous &amp; more replenished with people, then Cities subiect vnto Princes &amp; to monarchies.</p>
               <p>The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d means wherwith Rome increased was, that they made the townes that well deserued of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (which they after called <hi>Municipia</hi>) to be partakers<note place="margin">Municipiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. is euery City or towne hauing the liberty that Rome had.</note> of their Franchises and of their offices. For, these honors, to be Citizens of Rome, and to enioy the great priuiledges annexed to their enfranchiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, drewe into the City all such, as through adherencie, through fauour, or through seruice done vnto the common weale, might haue any hope to beare of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or rule therein: and such as lookt not so high, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted yet thither, to serue their kinsmens turnes or their friends with their voices, to aduance them to some good office. And, thus Rome was frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and enriched with concourse of an infinit sight of people, both noble and rich, that in particular or in common were honored with the enfra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chisement and freedome of Rome.</p>
               <p>The third meanes, was the continuall entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Romaines gaue to curiositie. And, that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6590:20"/>
was the great number of admirable things they did in Rome: The triumphes of the victorious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines; the wonderfull buildings; the battailes on the water; the fights of sword players; the hunting of wilde beastes; the publique shewes and sights; the playes of <hi>Apollo:</hi> the Seculars &amp; others, which were performed with vnspeakable pompe and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and many other such like things that drew the curious people vnto Rome. And for asmuch as these alluring sights, were as it were perpetuall: Rome was also as it were perpetually full of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and forreine people.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat shall we say of <hi>Colonies?</hi> were they a good help to the greatnes of Rome, or no? That they were a great helpe to the encrease of the power, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted: But, that they multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed also the number of the Inhabitants, it is a thing somewhat doubtfull. How beit for mine owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I should think they were a great helpe &amp; meanes vnto it. For, if any man thinke, by taking the people out, &amp; sending them to <hi>Colonies</hi> else where, that the Cittye thereby comes rather to diminish then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease: happely for all that, the contrary may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6590:21"/>
For, as plants cannot prosper so well, nor multiply so fast in a nurserie, where they are set and planted nere together, as where they are transplanted into an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ground: euen so men make no such fruitfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of children, where they are inclosed and shut vp within the walles of the Cittie, they are bred and borne in; as they doe abroad in diuers other parts, where they are sent vnto. For, sometimes the Plague, or other contagious sicknesse or disease con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth them; sometimes Famine enforceth them to change their habitations; sometimes forraine Warres takes out of the world the stowtest men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest them; sometimes ciuile warres make the quietest sort forsake their dwellings; And, from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, pouertie and miserie taketh away the minde, the meanes, and the spirite to wedde, or thinke on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p>Now, they that might haue died in Rome, with the aforesayd euills, &amp; without children; being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued to other places, escape the foresayd perils; And, bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g bestowed in <hi>Colonies,</hi> &amp; prouided for both of house &amp; ground to it; betake themselues to wiues and children, &amp; to propagate &amp; breede them vp, and so increase infinitely, &amp; of ten, become an hundred.</p>
               <p>But, what is this to the purpose (may some man say?) Let vs suppose that they that are sent into <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,</hi> would not encrease their Countrey, if they tarried at home? How should they then encrease it, when they are sent thence abroad to other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? well vno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>gh. First, because <hi>Colonies</hi> with their mother, out of which they yssued, make, as it were,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6590:21"/>
but one bodie. Then next, because the loue of our originall Countrey, which euerie man affecteth, and the dependencie thereof (which many waies help) and the desire and hope to aspire to dignitie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which euermore draw vnto it the worthiest &amp; most noble minds. By which meanes the Countrey growes to be more populous and rich.</p>
               <p>Who can denie, but that the 30. Colonies, that ys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued as it were out of one stocke, from <hi>Alba Longa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Alba longa,</note> and so many desides as Rome hath sent out; brought not much magnificencie and greatnesse, both to the one and the other? And, that the Portugalls yssued out of <hi>Lysbone,</hi> to possesse and inhabit the Ilands of <hi>Astori, Capo Verde, Medera,</hi> and others; haue not am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified and encreased <hi>Lys bone</hi> a great deale more, than if they had neuer remooued thence to those same Ilands?</p>
               <p>How beit, true it is, if <hi>Colonies</hi> must increase their mother; It is verie necessarie then they beeneere neighbors: otherwise, through longe distance of place, loue waxeth cold, and all commerce is cut off cleane.

But, it is written by a man that

might haue perfect knowledge of it, and had no cause to lye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> when he was chosen King of <hi>Israel,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly considering his subiects could not liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exercise of religion &amp; vse of sacrifice, and that, if they should repayre to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to celebrate and make their sacrifice, his people wold soon vnite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For, loue and charitie fayling in all places; the violence &amp; couetousnes of wicked men doth daily the more encrease: from whome, if the iudges doe not defend vs, our busines what soeuer we do, will ill go forward. For this cause, Cities that haue royall audience, Senators, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or other sorts and kindes of Courts of Iustice, must needes be much frequented; aswell for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of people that haue cause of Suite vnto it, as also for the execution of iustice. For, it cannot be ministred without the helpe of many presidents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I meane, Senators, Aduocates, Proctors, Sollicitors, Notaries and such like. Nay more then that (which it greeues me to thinke on) Expedition of iustice cannot be had in these our daies, without ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. For nothing in the world doth make men run so fast as currant money. For, the Adama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is not of such force to draw Iron vnto it, as gold is to turne the eyes &amp; the mindes of men, this way, &amp; that way and which way they list. And the reason is plaine, bycause gold, euen thorough the very vertue thereof, conteineth in it all greatnes, all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, and all earthly good
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6590:27"/>
whatsoeuer: To be short, he that hath money, hath, you may say, all worldly things that are to be had.</p>
               <p>In these dayes, through the plenty of money, which the administration of iustice doth carry with it, the Metropolitan Cities, if they may not haue the whole administration of Ciuile and Criminall causes: they will yet reserue at least vnto them, the chiefest causes, and all appeales. Which is well done for matter of State (whereof the iudiciall authority is a principall member; by the meanes whereof, they are the patrones and protectors of the life and goods of the Subiect:) But there must be a regard to the proffit that we haue poynted at.</p>
               <p>This goes currant in all places, especially where in iudiciall causes they do proceed, according to the common vse and cours of the lawes of the Romans: For, that course and forme is longer, and requireth more Ministers than the other.</p>
               <p>In <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> but especially in <hi>Turky,</hi> where a short course is taken in tryall of causes, euen as it were, at the first sitting of the Iudge: It profiteth little, to encrease the greatnes of a Citie, to hold pleas there. Forasmuch as difficult and hard cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, are in an after none, as it were, decided there and ended, if sufficient witnes be produced at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the cause. These adiornaments and many Termes, are there cut off: And Instruments, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, Officers and Mediators, haue there no place. Within a few blowes giuen, they come to the halfe Sword. So that the time, the expence, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of persons, are far lesse and much fewer, then

the ciuile Lawes do require.</p>
               <p>I speake not these things, to the end I would haue causes prolonged, and suites made eternall. For, they are to long already without more a doe: And in doing iustice; delay (which receiueth no excuse, by colour or pretence of warines and care to commit no error) is very plaine Iniustice. And therefore in our Citie we speake of here, it shalbe very necessary and expedient, to haue in it a principall seate of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and course of suites and pleas depending in it.</p>

such things as are wrought by the cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning hand of man, are of much more, and of far greater price and estimation, then such things as nature doth produce.

And the Princes reuenew comes to be much greater, by the exstraction of the worker, than by the stuffe or matter: As for example by the <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uets,</hi> then by the <hi>Silkes;</hi> by the <hi>Rash,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the <hi>Woolles;</hi> by the <hi>Linnen,</hi> then by the <hi>Flaxe;</hi> by the <hi>Cordage,</hi> than by the <hi>Hempe.</hi>

prouinces abounding with an infinite deale of fine <hi>Wooll,</hi> they had not so many workemen, as could ouer come it all. And although the Princes afore said happely made this law for their owne particuler good, bycause the profit and the custome that ryseth of the clothes, is far greater then that, which riseth of the wooll alone: yet notwithstanding, this lawe was good for the benefit of the whole countrie; inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of people more, doe liue vpon the wrought cloathes, then vpon the rude and vnwrought <hi>Wooll,</hi> out of which, growes the riches and the greatnes of the King.

Whereof the Martes, Faiers and Markets beare good witnesse, which are frequented with a mighty concourse of trades men, marchants and people of all sorts, not for any respect else, but that they are there free and franke from
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6590:31"/>
customes and exactions.</p>
               <p>In our daies, the Princely Citie of <hi>Naples,</hi> through the exemptions and freedomes granted to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, is most notably encreased, both in buildings and in people: And it would haue encreased a great deale more, if through the greeses and suits of the Barons there, whose la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds were vnfurnished of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or for some other peculiar reason; the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> had not seuerely forbidden to enlarge it with further buildings.</p>
               <p>The Cities in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> are the most merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and the most frequented Cities for commerce and traffique, that are in all <hi>Europe.</hi> Yf you require the cause: surely, the exemptions from custome is the cheefest cause of it. For, the merchandize that is brought in, and carried out (and it is infinit that is brought in, and carryed out) payd but a very small custome.</p>
               <p>All such as haue erected new Cities in times past; to draw concourse of people to it; haue graunted of necessitie, large Immunities and priuiledges, at least, to the first Inhabitants thereof. The like haue they done, that haue restored Cities emptied with the plague, consumed with the warres, or afflicted otherwise with some other scourge of God.</p>
               <p>The plague mencioned by <hi>Boccas,</hi> that languished all <hi>Italie</hi> neere 3. yeares together, was so fierce; that from March to Iuly, it tooke out of the world about an hundred thousand soules within <hi>Florence.</hi> It slew also such a number within <hi>Venice,</hi> as in a maner it became a desert. So that the Senat, to haue it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6590:31"/>
reinhabited, caused proclamation to be made, that all such as would come thither with their families, and dwell there two yeares together, should haue the freedome of the Citie. The same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale of <hi>Venice,</hi> hath been also more than once deliuered out of extreame necessitie of victualls, by promising priuiledge and freedome to such as brought them corne.</p>

So that, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they are borne, as it were, with a resolute minde to follow their fathers Art, &amp; the fathers hide not from them any thing, but teach them &amp; instruct them with all affection, assiduity, diligence and care: workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ship is by this meanes there growen to that fulnes of excellency and perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that may be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly desired.

               <p>There are also some other Cities, maisters of some commodities; not bycause the goods do growe in their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, or be wrought by their inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; but bycause they haue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund either of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, or of the Sea that is neere them: the commaund of the Countrie, as <hi>Siuil,</hi> vnto which infinit wealth and riches are brought from <hi>Noua Hispania</hi> &amp; <hi>Perù:</hi> the commaund of the Sea, as <hi>Lisborne,</hi> which by this meanes draweth to it the Pepper of <hi>Cocin,</hi> and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6590:32"/>
which cannot be brought by Sea, but by them, or vnder their leaue and lycence.</p>
               <p>After the same sort in a manner, <hi>Venice,</hi> about a fower score and tenne yeares agone, was Lady of the Spyceries. For, before the Portugalls possessed the Indies, these things being brought by the Red Sea to <hi>Suez,</hi> and from thence vpon Camells backes to <hi>Cayrus,</hi> and after that by <hi>Nilus,</hi> into <hi>Alexandria;</hi> there were they bought vp by the Venetians, who sent thither their great Argosyes, and with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proffit to them, caryed them in a manner, into all the partes of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all this commerce and trade, is now quite turnde to <hi>Lisborne;</hi> vnto which place, by a new way, the Spiceries, (taken as it were, out of the hands of the Moores and the Turkes) be yearely brought by the Portugalls, &amp; then sold to the Spaniards, French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Englishmen, and to all the Northerne partes. This commerce and trade is of such Importance, as it alone is inough to enrich all Portugall, &amp; to make it plentifull of all things.</p>
               <p>There are some other Cities also, Lords as it were, of much merchandize and Traffique, by meanes of their commodious Scituation to many Nations, to whome they serue of warehouse Roome and stoare houses; such are <hi>Malacca</hi> and <hi>Ormuze</hi> in the East; <hi>Alexandria, Constantinople, Messina,</hi> and <hi>Genoa</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, <hi>Andwerpe, Amsterdam, Danske,</hi> and the <hi>Narue</hi> in the Northerne Seas; and <hi>Franckford</hi> and <hi>Norimberg</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> In which Cities, many and great merchants exercise their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffique

and make their ware houses; vnto the which the nations thereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to adioyning vse to resort to make their prouisions of such things as they neede, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue commodious meanes for transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it. And this consisteth in the largenes and the safenes of the Ports; in the opportunitie and fytnesse of the Gulphes and Creekes of the Seas; in the nauigable Riuers that come into the Cities, or runne by or neere them; in the Lakes and the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels: As also where the wayes be playne and safe.<note place="margin">King of Cusco.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And heere to the purpose, bycause I speake of wayes, I cannot passe ouer those two wayes, which the Kings of <hi>Cusco</hi> (called in their language, <hi>Inghe,</hi>) in longe processe of time cut out throughout their dominion, about 2000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> miles in length, so pleasant, so commodious, so plaine, and so leuell; as they giue no place to the magnificent workes of the Romans. For, there shall you see steepe and high hylles, layd euen with the plaine; and deepe valleyes filled vp; and horrible huge stones cut in peeces: There shall you see the trees, that are planted heere and there, in excellent good order euen by a lyne, yeald both with their shade, a comfort; and with the charme of the birds, that there abound in great plenty, a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous delight and pleasure to the trauailers that passe those waies. Neither are there wanting on those waies, many good Innes for lodging &amp; for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, plentifull of all necessary things; Nor Pallaces and goodly buildings, that in eminent and open places, as it were to meete you, present you with a pleasant and bewtifull shew of their excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6590:33"/>
and rarenes; nor pleasant Towne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, nor sweete countries, nor a thousand other delights and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures to feede both the eye with varietie, and the minde with admiration at the infinit effects, partly wrought by nature, and partly by the handy worke of man. But, to returne to our purpose.</p>
               <p>It is a good matter and a great helpe to a Prince, to know the naturall Scite of his countrie, and with iudgment to haue an vnderstanding how to amend it by art and industrie. As for example, to defend his Ports with Rampiers and with Bulwarkes; to make the Ladyng and vnladyng of Merchandize both quick and easie; to scoure the Seas of <hi>Pyrates</hi> and of <hi>Rouers;</hi> to make the Riuers nauigable; to build storehouses apt and large ynough to conteine great quantitie of wares; and to defend and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the wayes, aswell on the plaines, as on the mountaynes and hilly places.</p>
               <p>In this poynt, the Kings of <hi>China</hi> haue deserued all prayse that may be. For, they haue with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible expence and charge, paued with stone all the highe waies of that most famous Kingdome; and haue made stone bridges ouer mighty great Riuers; And cut in sunder hilles and mountaines of inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heigth and craggednes; They haue also strewd the plaines and bottomes with very fayer stone: So that a man may there passe either on horse or a foote, aswell in the Winter as in the Sommer time, and merchandize may be easily carryed too and fro there, by loade, eyther on Cartes, or on Horse, Mules or Camels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:6590:34"/>And in this point no doubt, some Princes in <hi>Italy</hi> are much to blame; in whose countries in the winter time, horses are bemired in sloughes vp to the bellie, and carts are stabled and set fast in the tough durte and myre. So that cariadges by cart or horse, are thereby very combersome: And a iorney that might be well dispatched in a day, can hardlie be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in three or fower. And the wayes are as bad in many parts of France, as in the country of Poytiers, Santongia, Beaussia, and in <hi>Burgondy.</hi> But this is no place to censure so famous Preuinces. And therefore let vs proceed.</p>

For, where the Prince is resident, there also the Parliaments are held; and the supreame place of iustice is there kept; all matters of importance haue recourse to that place; all Princes and all persons of account, Embassadors of Princes and of common weales, and all Agents of Cities that are subiect, make their repaire thither; all such as aspire and thirst after offices and honors run thither amaine with emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and disdaine at others; thither are the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes brought that appertain vnto the state; &amp; there are they disposed out againe. By all which meanes, Cities must needs encrease a pace it may easiely be conceiued by the examples in a maner, of all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Importance and of name.</p>
               <p>The ancientest kyngdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, was that of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> whose<note place="margin">Egipt the ancientest Kingdome. Thebes.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:6590:37"/>
and was beautified with prowd &amp; stately buildings, both publique and priuate, and also full of people. And <hi>Memphis</hi> was but little lesse.</p>
               <p>In after ages, other kings succeding (which were called <hi>Ptolomei</hi>) they kept their court in <hi>Aelxandria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</note> which did by that meanes mightilie increase in buildings, in people, in reuerent reputation taken of it, and in inestimable wealth and riches; and the other two Cities afforesaid, that by the ruine of that kingdome, falling first vnder the <hi>Caldaeians,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vnder the <hi>Persians,</hi> were exceedingly decaied, are now vtterly defaced</p>
               <p>The Soldanes after that forsaking <hi>Alexandria,</hi> drew themselues to <hi>Cayrus,</hi> which, euen for this very cause<note place="margin">Cayrus.</note> became (within a little time to speake of) a Citie so populous, as it hath gotten, not without good cause, the name of the great <hi>Cayrus.</hi> But the Soldanes, bycause they thought themselues not to be secure, in respect of the innumerable multitude, if so great a people should perchance rise vp in armes against them; deuided it with large and many dicthes filled full of water, so that it might appeare not to be one Citie alone, but many little townes vnited and ioyned together. 
<q>At this daie it is deuided into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

as we do, but for the most part within the ground, stowed vp as it were, and crowded and thrust toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; there is such an infinit multitude of them, as they cannot be numbred.</p>
               <p>The plague in a manner, neuer leaueth them; but euerie seaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th yeare they feele it most exceedingly. And, if it dispatch not out of the way aboue 3. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand, they count it but a flea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>byt. In the time of the Soldanes, that Citie was accounted to stand to health, when as there died not in it aboue a thousand persons in a daye. And let this suffice that I haue said of <hi>Cayrus,</hi> which is of so great a fame in the world at this day.</p>
               <q>In <hi>Assiria,</hi> the Kings made their residence in <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niue:</hi>

The Suburbes thereof no doubt, must needs besides that, be very large. For the Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that <hi>Niniue</hi> was great; three dayes iorney to passe it ouer. <hi>Diodorus</hi> writeth, there was neuer<note place="margin">Draudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> any Citie after that, set vp of so great a circuit and of so huge a greatnes. For, the heighth of the walles was a hundred foote, the breadth able to conteine 3. cartes a brest together; Towers in the walles a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and fiue hundred, in heighth an hundred foot as <hi>Viues</hi> saith.</q>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:6590:38"/>
                  <hi>Aristotile</hi> maketh it much greater. For, he writes that it was said in his time, that when Babilon was taken, it was three daies eare one part tooke knowledge of the conquest. The people thereof were such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as they durst offer battell vnto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the greatest and the mightiest King for power that euer was of <hi>Persia. Semiramis</hi> did build it; but <hi>Nabucodonoser</hi> did mightely encrease it. When it was ruinated afterward at the comming in of the Scythians and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people in those countries, it was reedified by<note place="margin">Califfe.</note> one <hi>Bugiafar</hi> Emperor of the <hi>Saracines,</hi> who spent vpon it, 18.

But there are not only woodes to hunt in, and fieldes for tilladge, but also orchardes and large gardens in it.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>Media,</hi> made their residence in <hi>Ecba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana:</hi>

               <p>Now, <hi>Chyna</hi> comes the neerest to the East of any part of the world. And therefore doth she enioye all those perfections that are attributed to the East. And first, the Ayer (which, of all things importeth the life of man so much as nothing more) is very temperat; whereunto the neerenes of the Sea, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a great helpe, which imbraceth as it were, with armes cast abroad, a great part thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lookes it in the face with a cheerefull aspect, and with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand creekes and gulfes penetrateth far, within the very Prouince.</p>
               <p>Next that: The countrie is for the most part plaine, and of nature very apt to produce not onely things necessarie for the vse and sustenance of the life of man; but also all sorts of daintie things for mans delight and pleasure. The Hilles and Mountaines
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6590:41"/>
are perpetually arrayed with trees of all sorts, some wilde, and some fruitfull: The plaines manured, tilled and sowen with rise, barley, wheate, peaze and beanes: The Gardens, besides our common sortes of fruites, doe yeald most sweet Mellons, most delicat Plommes, most excellent Figges, Pomeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, and Orenges of diuers formes and excellent taste.</p>
               <p>They haue also an herbe, out of which they presse a delicate iuyce, which serues them for drincke in stead of wyne. It also preserues their health, and frees them from all those euills, that the immoderat vse of wyne doth breed vnto vs.</p>
               <p>They also abound in cattell, in sheepe, in fowle, in deere, in wooll, in rich Skinnes, Cotton, Linnen, and in infinit store of Sylke. There are Mines of Gold and Siluer, and of excellent iron. There are most pretious pearles. There is abundance of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Honny, Rewbarbe, Camphire, red Leade, Woad, Muske, and Aloes; and the Porcelan earth is knowen no where but there.</p>
               <p>More then this: The Riuers and the waters of all sorts, runne gallantly through all those countries, with an vnspeakeable profit and commoditie for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation and for tillage. And, the waters are as plentifull of fish, as the land is of fruites. For, the Riuers and the Seas yeild thereof an infinite abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>Vnto this so great a fertilitie and yeild both of the land &amp; water, there is ioyned an incredible cultùre of both these elements. And that proceedeth out
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:6590:42"/>
of two causes, whereof the one dependeth vpon the inestimable multitude of the inhabitants (for it is thought that <hi>China</hi> doth conteyne more then three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score Millions of Soules,) and the other consisteth in the extreame diligence and paines that is taken, aswell of priuat persons in the tillage of their grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, and well husbanding their farmes; as also of Magis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, that suffer not a man to leade an idle life at home. <hi>S</hi>o that there is not a little scratt of ground that is not husbandly and very well manured.</p>
               <p>Now, for their Mechanicall Artes, should I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them heere to <hi>S</hi>ilence? When as there is not a countrie in the world, where they do more florish both for varietie and for excellencie of skill and workmanship? Which proceedeth also out of two causes, whereof the one I haue commended before, in that idlenes is euery where forbidden there, and euery man compeld to worke; no man suffered to be idle, no not the blinde, nor the lame, nor the maimed, if they bee not altogether impotent and weake. And the women also, by a law of <hi>Vitei</hi> King<note place="margin">Vitei.</note> of <hi>China,</hi> are bound to exercise their fathers trades and Artes, and how noble or how great soeuer they be, they must at least attend their distaffe and their needell. The other cause is, that the sonnes must of necessity follow their fathers mysteries. <hi>S</hi>o that hereupon it comes, that Artificers are infinit; and that children, aswell boyes as gyrles, euen in their infancy, can skill to worke, and that Artes are brought vnto most excellent and hygh perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>

Of ragges and cloutes, they make paper; To be short, such is the plentie and varietie of the fruites of the earth, and of mans industrie and labor, as they haue no need of forreine helpe to bring them any thinge: For, they giue away a great quantite of their owne, to forreine countreys. And, (to speake of no things else) the quantitie of Silke that is caried out of <hi>China,</hi> is almost not credible. A thousand quintals of silke are yerely caried thence for the <hi>Portugalls Indies;</hi> for the <hi>Philippinaes</hi> they lade out fifteene shippes.

By meanes whereof, the traffique with the <hi>Philippinaes,</hi> fals out to bee rather hurtfull then profitable vnto the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> For, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the cheapnes of things, is it, that makes the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Mexico</hi> (who heretofore haue vsde to fetch their commodities from <hi>Spaine</hi>) to fetch them at the <hi>Philippinaes.</hi> But the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> for the desire
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:6590:43"/>
he hath to winne vnto familiarity and loue, and by that meanes to draw to our christian faith and to the bosome of the catholique church, those people that are wrapt in the horrible darkenes of idolatrie; esteemeth not a whit of his losse, so he may gayne their soules to God.</p>
               <p>By these things I haue declared, it appeareth plaine, that <hi>China</hi> hath the meanes, partly by the benefit of Nature, and partly by the industry and Art of man, to susteine an infinit sight of people. And that for that cause, it is credible ynough, that it becometh so populous a countrie as hath been said. And I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this much more vnto it, that it is necessarie it should be so, for two reasons; the one, for that it is not lawfull for the King of <hi>China</hi> to make warre to get new countries, but onely to defend his owne, and thereupon it must ensue, that he enioyeth in a manner, a perpetuall peace. And what is there more to be desired or wisht, than peace? VVhat thing can be more profitable than peace? My other reason is, for that it is not lawfull for any of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naes</hi> to goe out of their country, without leaue or lycence of the Magistrates. So that, the nomber of persons continually encreasing, and abyding still at home; it is of necessity, that the nomber of people do become inestimable, and of consequence, the Cities exceeding great, the townes infinit, and that <hi>China</hi> it selfe should rather in a manner, be but one bodie and but one Citie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To</hi> say the truth, wee Italians do flatter our selues too much, and do admire too partially those things
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:6590:43"/>
that do concerne our selues; especially when we will preferre <hi>Italy,</hi> and her Cities beyond all therest in the world. The shape and figure of <hi>Italy,</hi> is long and streyte, deuided withall in the middest with the <hi>Apenine Hills.</hi> And the pancitie and rarenes of Nauigable Riuers, doth not beare it, that there can be very great and populous Cities in it. I will not spare to say, that her riuers are but little brookes in comparison of <hi>Ganges, Menan, Meacon,</hi> and the rest: And that the <hi>Tyrrhenian</hi> and the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Seas are but gullets in respect of the <hi>Ocean.</hi> And of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence our trade and traffique is but poore, in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the Marts and fayres of <hi>Cantan, Malacca, Calicut, Ormuze, Lisbon, Siuill,</hi> and other Cities that bound vpon the <hi>Ocean.</hi>

               <p>The residence of Princes is so powerfull and so mighty, as it alone is sufficient ynough to set vp and forme a Citie at a trice. In <hi>Aethiop (Francis Alua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi>

To conclude, the Citie is for the beawty of the Scite, for the opportunity of the Portes, for the commodity of the Sea, for the multitude of the Inhabitants, for the greatnes of the traffique, for the residence of the great Turke, so conspicuous and so gallant; as without doubt, amongst the Cities of <hi>Europe,</hi> the chiefest place is due to it.

The one, is the streete made throughout the whole Citie, which, for streyghtnes, breadth, length, and beautifulnes of buildings is such, as I know not in what Citie of <hi>Italy</hi> a man should finde the like.

If with an infinit number of people, that serue both him and his ministers, he did not reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and fill the Citie?

If amongst so many riche and stately works, belonging aswell to Gods glory, as the seruice of the common weale, he spent not there a great part of the reuenewes of the church? And, in a word, if with all these meanes, he did not draw and entertaine withall, such a number of Marchants, trades men, Shop-keepers, Artificers, workmen, and such a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of people, for labor and for seruice?</p>

And therefore let vs now consider.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. II.</hi> What the reason is, that Cities once growen to a greatnes, encrease not onward according to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et no man thinke, the wayes and meanes aforesaid, or any other that may bee any waye deuised, can worke or effect it that a Citie may go on in increase, without ceassing. And therefore it is in truth a thing worth the consideration, how it comes to passe, that Cities growen to a poynt of greatnes and power, passe no further; but either stand at that staye, or else returne backe againe. Let vs take for our example <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> at her begynning, when she was founded and built by <hi>Romulus</hi> (as <hi>Dionisius Halicarnasse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) was able to make out 3300. fit men for the warres. <hi>Romulus</hi> reigned thirty seauen yeares, with
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:6590:49"/>
in the compas of which time, the Citie was encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed euen to 47000. persons fit to beare armes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 150. yeares after the death of <hi>Romulus,</hi> in the time of <hi>Seruius Tullius,</hi> there were numbred in Rome 80. thousand persons fit for armes. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the end, by little and little grew to 450. thousand.</p>
               <p>My question therefore is, how it comes to passe, that from three thousand and three hundred men of warre, the people of Rome grew to 450. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand; and from 450. thousand, they went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And in like manner, syth it is 400. yeares, since <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> made as many people as they do at this day; How it doth also come to passe, that the multiplycation goes not onward accordingly.</p>
               <p>Some answere, the cause hereof, is, the plagues, the warres, the dearthes and other such like causes. But this giues no satisfaction. For, plagues haue euer been: And, warres haue been more common and more bloody in former times, than now. For, in those dayes they came to hand strokes by and by, and to a maine pictht battayle in the field, where there were within three or foure houres more peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple slaine, than are in these dayes in many yeares. For, warre is now drawen out of the field to the walles, and the mattock and the spade, are now more vsed than the sword. The world besides, was neuer without alteration and change of plenty and of dearth, of health, and of plagues. Whereof I shall not need to bryng examples, bycause the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories are full.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:6590:49"/>Now, if Cities with all these accidents and chances begun at first with few people, encrease to a great number of inhabitants; How comes it that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably, they do not encrease accordingly?</p>
               <p>Some others say, it is, bycause God the gouernor of all things, doth so dispose, no man doth doubt of that. But, forasmuch as the infinit wisedome of God, in the administration and the gouernment of nature, worketh secondary causes: My question is, with what meanes that eternall prouidence maketh little, to multiply; and much, to stand at a stay, and go no further.</p>
               <p>Now, to answere this propounded question; I say, the selfe same question may be also made of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: Forasmuch as within the compasse of three thousand yeares, it multiplyed in such sort from one man and one woman, as the prouinces of the whole continent, and the Ilands of the Seas, were full of people: Whence it doth proceed, that from those three thousand yeares to this day, this multiplycati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath not exceeded further.</p>
               <p>Now, that I may the better resolue this doubt; I purpose so to answere it; As, mine answere, may not only serue for the Cities, but also for the vniuersal theater of the world.</p>
               <p>I say then, that the augmentation of Cities, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth partly out of the vertue generatiue of men, and partly out of the vertue nutritiue of the Cities. The vertue generatiue, is without doubt to this day, the very same, or at least, such as it was before three thousand yeaeres were past. Forasmuch as men
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6590:50"/>
are at this day as apt for generation, as they were in the times of <hi>Dauid</hi> or of <hi>Moses.</hi> So that if there were no other impediment or let therein, the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man kinde, would encrease without end, and the augmentation of Cities would bee without terme. And, if it do not encrease in infinit; I must needs say, it proceedeth of the defect of nutriment and sustenance sufficient for it.</p>
               <p>Now, nutriment and victualls are gotten, eyther out of the Territories belonging to the Citie, or out of forreine cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tryes. To haue a City great &amp; popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; It is necessary that victualls may be brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> far vnto it. And that victuals may be brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote &amp; forraine parts vnto it; It behooues that her vertue attractiue bee of such power &amp; strength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it be able to ouercome the hardnes &amp; the sharpnes of the regions, the heigth of the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines, the descent of the valleies, the swiftnes of the Riuers, the rage of the Seas, the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers of the Pyrats, the vncerteinty of the windes, the greatnes of the charge, the euill pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of the waies, the enuie of the bordering neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, the hatred of enemies, the emulation of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors, the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the time that is required for trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, the dearthes &amp; necessities of the places fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they must be brought, the naturall dissension of nations, the contrariety of sects &amp; opinions in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and other such like things, all which encrease as he people increase and the affaires of the Citie. To conclude, that it grow to be so mighty and so great, as it can ouercome all the diligence and all the indus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie that man can vse whatsoeuer. For, how shall
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:6590:50"/>
Merchants be peeswaded they can bring corne, for exaple, out of the <hi>Indies</hi> or <hi>Cataia</hi> to Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, or the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes expect to haue it thence? But, admit that either of them could so perswade themselues; who can yet assure them, the seasons wilbe alwayes good for corne, that the people stand to peace &amp; quietnes, that the passages be open, and the waies be safe? Or what forme, or what course can be taken to bring prouision to Rome, by so long a way by land, in such sort and manner as the conductors thereof may bee able to endure the trauaile and to wyeld the charge thereof? Now, any one of these impediments or lettes, without adding moe, to ouertwhart and crosse it more; is ynough to dissipate and scatter quite a sonder the people of a City destitute of helpe and subiect to so many accidents and chances. Euen one dearth one famine, one violence of warre, one interruption or staye of trade and traffique; one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon losse to the Marchants, or other such like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, will make (as the winter doth the Swallowes) the people to seeke an other country.</p>
               <p>The ordinary greatnes of a Citie, consisteth in these termes, with which it can hardly be contented. For, the greatnes that depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vpon remote causes or hard meanes cannot long endure. For euery man will seeke his commoditie and ease, where he may finde it best. We must also adde to these things aforesayd, that great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ities are more subiect vnto dearthes then the little For, they neede more sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and victualles. The plague also, afflicteth them more sorely and more often, with greater losse
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:6590:51"/>
of people. And to speake in a word, great Cities are subiect to all the difficulties and hardnes wee haue before declared, bycause they need a great deale more.</p>
               <p>So that, although men were as apt to generation in the height and pride of the Romanes greatnes, as in the first beginning thereof: Yet for all that, the people encreased not proportionably. For, the vertue nutritiue of that Citie, had no power to go further. So that in successe of time, the Inhabitants finding much want, and lesse meanes to supply their lacke of victuall, either forbare to marry, or, if they did marry, their children opprest with penury, their parents affording them no reliefe, fled their country, and sought abroad for better fortune. To the which inconuenience, the Romanes willing to prouide a remedy; they made choyse of a number of poore Citizens, and sent them into <hi>Colonies;</hi> where, like trees transplanted, they might haue more roome to better themselues both in condition and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and by that meanes encrease and multiply the faster.</p>
               <p>By the selfe same reason, man kinde growen to a certaine compleate number, hath growen no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And it is three thousand yeares agone and more, that the world was replenished as full with people, as it is at this present. For, the fruites of the earth, and the plenty of victuall, doth not suffice to feede a greater number. In <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> man kinde did first beginne to propagate. From thence by successe of time, it increased and spred apase daily
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:6590:51"/>
both far and neere. And hauing replenished the firme land, they transported themselues into the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of the Sea; &amp; so from our countries, they haue at length arriued by little and little, to the countries we call the new world. And what is there vnder the Sunne, that doth make man, with more horrible effusion of blood to fight for, and with more cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than the earth, foode, and commodity of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion? The <hi>Sueuians</hi> accounted it an honour and a glory to them, to bring their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fines by many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles into a wast and wildernes. In the new world, in the Ile of Saint <hi>Dominick</hi> and the borders thereabout, the people chase and hunt men, as wee do deere and hares. The like doe many of the people of <hi>Brasill,</hi> especially they, whome we call <hi>Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murij:</hi> Who teare in peeces and deuour young boyes and young gyrles aliue, and open the bellies of the women great with childe; And take the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures out, and in the presence and sight of the fathers themselues, eate them roasted vpon the coales; a most horrible thing to heare, much more to see it.</p>
               <p>The people of <hi>Ghynea</hi> for the most part, liue so poore and needy, as they dayly sell their owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for very vile price to the Moores, who carry them into Barbary, and to the Portugals, who send them to their Ilands, or sell them to the Castiglians for the new world. The people of <hi>Perù</hi> do the like, who for little more than nothing, giue their children to them will haue them: which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of misery, and of the impotency they haue to bring them vp, and to maintaine them. The Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:6590:52"/>
and the Arabians, liue vpon stealth and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine. The Nasomonj, and the Cafrj; the most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage and barbarous people of all <hi>Aethyop,</hi> liue vpon the spoyles of others Shipwrackes, as the Portugalls haue many times felt.</p>
               <p>It is also a thing knowen to all men, how oft the French, the Dutche, the Gothes, the Hunnes, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarj, the Tartars, and diuers other nations, vnable, through their infinit multitude of people to liue in their ownes countries, haue left their confines, and possessed themselues with other mens countries, to the vtter ruine and destruction of the inhabitants therein. Hence it came to passe, that within few Ages, all the Prouinces of <hi>Europe</hi> and of <hi>Asia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came possessed in a manner, of strange people, fled and run out of their countries and habitations, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the mightie multitude of people their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie could not sustaine; or for desire they had to lead a more commodiouse and easie life else where, in greater plenty of good things.</p>
               <p>The multitude againe of theeues and murderers, whence doth it I pray you, for the most part grow, but of necessitie and want? differences, Suites, and quarelles, whence do they proceede, but out of the streightnes and the scantnes of confines? bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>daries, ditches, hedges, and enclosures, which men make about their Farmes and Manors: watchmen of the viniardes and of ripe fruites, Gates, Lockes, Bolltes, and Mastiues kept about the house; what do they argue else<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that the world is hard, apd either mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth not sufficient to our necessities, or satisfieth
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:6590:52"/>
not our greedy couetous desires? And what shall I rememberarmes, of so many kindes, and of so cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell sortes? what shall I speake of continuall warres both on Sea and Land, that bringeth all things vnto vtter ruine? what of fortes on passages? what of Garrysons, Bulwarkes and Munition?</p>
               <p>Neither doth this Lake of mischeifes containe all. For, I must adde to these, the barrennes of Soyles, the Scarcitie and dearthes of victuall, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill influence of the ayre, the contagiouse and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diseazes, the Plagues, the Earthquakes, the Inundacions both of Seas and Riuers, and such other accidents which destroy and ouerthrow, now a <hi>C</hi>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, now a kingdome, now a people, now some other thing, and are the let and stay, that the number of men cannot encrease and grow immoderatly.</p>

               <p>It is no wisedome yet, to set vp <hi>Colonies</hi> far off, in places too remote from your state and gouernment. For, in that case, it being no easie thing for you to succor them; they must either become a praye to their enemies, or else gouerne themselues as the occasion and time doth offer, without respect had of their originall beginning, or of whome they depend. A number of the <hi>Colonies,</hi> of the <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> which they had planted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the regions almost of the <hi>Mediterranean Seas,</hi> haue done the like. But, the Romanes considering this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience, established more iudicially, more <hi>Colonies</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> then in all the rest of their Empire else besides. And out of <hi>Italy</hi> they carryed none, till after the sixt hundred yeare that <hi>Rome</hi> was built: And the first were <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> and <hi>Narbona</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>

For, not being vsed to the lawes of iust matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, nor to the charge of education of children, they left their houses without posteritie.</p>
               <p>This mischiefe grew, bycause the entier legions with Tribunes, with Centurions, and with Soldiers, each in his order, were not sent, as in ancient times past was wont to be, to the end that common weales might be founded and maintained with concord and with charitie; But men, that kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
