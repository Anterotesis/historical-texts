            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My most Honoured Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>FRom the principal parts of Nature, Reason and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have proceeded two kinds of Learning, <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi> and <hi>Dogmatical</hi>: the former is
<pb facs="tcp:44255:3"/>
free from Controversie and Dispute, because it consisteth in comparing Figure and Motion only; in which things, <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>the Interest of Men,</hi> oppose not each other: but in the other there is nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputable, because it compareth Men, and medleth with their Right and Profit; in which, as oft as Reason is against a Man, so oft will a Man be against Reason. And from hence it cometh, that they who have written of Justice and Policy in General, do all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade each other and themselves with Contradictions. To reduce this Doctrine to the Rules and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of Reason, there is no way but, first, put such Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples down for a Foundation, as Passion, not mistrusting, may not seek to displace; and afterwards to
<pb facs="tcp:44255:3"/>
build thereon the Truth of Cases in the Law of Nature (which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to have been built in the Air) by degrees, till the whole have been inexpugnable. Now, my Lord, the Principles fit for such a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, are those which heretofore I have acquainted your Lordship withal in private Discourse, and which by your Command I have here put into a Method. To exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Cases thereby between <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi> and <hi>Soveraign,</hi> or between <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign</hi> and <hi>Subject,</hi> I leave to them that shall find Leasure and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement thereto: For my part, I present this to your Lordship for the true and only Foundation of such Science. For the Stile, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the worse, because, whilest I was writing, I consulted more with Logick than with Rhetorick: But
<pb facs="tcp:44255:4"/>
for the Doctrine, it is not slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved; and the Conclusions thereof of such Nature, as, for want of them. Government and Peace have been nothing else, to this day, but mutual Fears: And it would be an incomparable benefit to Commonwealth, that every one held the Opinion concerning <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Policy</hi> here delivered. The am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition therefore of this Book, in seeking by your Lordships counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to insinuate it self with those whom the matter it containeth most nearly concerneth, is to be excused. For my self, I desire no greater honour than I enjoy already in your Lordship's favour, unless it be that you would be pleased, in Continuance thereof, to give me more Exercise in your commands; which, as I am bound by your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               <p>10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The main Deception of Sense.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. HAving declared what I mean by the Word <hi>Conception,</hi> and other Words e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent thereunto, I come to the <hi>Conceptions</hi> themselves, to shew their <hi>Differences,</hi> their <hi>Causes,</hi> and the <hi>Manner of the Production,</hi> so far as is necessary for this Place.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Originally all <hi>Conceptions</hi> proceed from the <hi>Action</hi> of the thing it self, whereof it is the Conception: Now when the Action is <hi>present,</hi> the Conception it produceth is also called <hi>Sense</hi>; and the Thing by whose Action the same is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, is called the <hi>Object of the Sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 By our several <hi>Organs</hi> we have several <hi>Conceptions</hi> of several Qualities in the Objects; for by <hi>Sight</hi> we have a Conception or Image com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of <hi>Colour</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> which is all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and Knowledge the Object imparteth to us of its Nature by the Eye. By <hi>Hearing</hi> we have a Conception called <hi>Sound,</hi> which is all the Knowledge we have of the Quality of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44255:9"/>
from the Ear. And so the rest of the Senses are also Conceptions of several Qualities, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of their Objects.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Because the <hi>Image</hi> in Vision consisting of <hi>Colour</hi> and <hi>Shape</hi> is the Knowledge we have of the Qualities of the Object of that Sense; it is no hard matter for a Man to fall into this Opinion, that the same <hi>Colour</hi> and <hi>Shape</hi> are the <hi>very Qualities themselves</hi>; And for the same cause, that <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Noise</hi> are the <hi>Qualities of the Bell,</hi> or of the Air. And this Opinion hath been so long received, that the <hi>contrary</hi> must needs appear a great Paradox; and yet the Introduction of <hi>Species visible</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi> (which is necessary for the Maintenance of that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) passing to and fro from the <hi>Object,</hi> is <hi>worse</hi> than any Paradox, as being a plain <hi>Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility.</hi> I shall therefore endeavour to make plain these Points:</p>
            <p>That the Subject wherein Colour and Image are inherent, is <hi>not</hi> the <hi>Object</hi> or thing seen.</p>
            <p>That there is nothing <hi>without us</hi> (really) which we call an <hi>Image</hi> or Colour.</p>
            <p>That the said Image or Colour is but an <hi>apparition</hi> unto us of the <hi>Motion,</hi> Agitation, or Alteration, which the <hi>Object</hi> worketh in the <hi>Brain,</hi> or Spirits, or some internal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Head.</p>
            <p>That as in <hi>Vision,</hi> so also in Conceptions that arise from the <hi>other Senses,</hi> the Subject of their <hi>inherence</hi> is not the <hi>Object,</hi> but the <hi>Sentient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44255:10"/>5. Every Man hath so much Experience as to have seen the <hi>Sun</hi> and the other visible Objects by Reflection in the <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Glasses</hi>; and this alone is sufficient for this Conclusion, that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi> and <hi>Image</hi> may be there where the <hi>Thing seen</hi> is <hi>not.</hi> But because it may be said that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the <hi>Image</hi> in the Water be not in the Object, but a Thing meerly <hi>Phantastical,</hi> yet there may be <hi>Colour</hi> really in the Thing it self: I will urge further this Experience, that divers Times Men see directly the <hi>same</hi> Object <hi>double</hi>; as <hi>two Candles</hi> for <hi>one,</hi> which may happen from Distemper or otherwise without Distemper if a Man will, the Organs being either in their right Temper, or equally distempered, the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> in two such Images of the same Thing <hi>cannot be inherent</hi> therein, because the Thing seen cannot be in <hi>two Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>One</hi> of these Images therefore is <hi>not inherent</hi> in the Object: but seeing the Organs of the Sight are then in equal Temper or Distemper, the <hi>one</hi> of them is no more inherent than the <hi>other</hi>; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>neither</hi> of them both are in the Object; which is the First Proposition, mentioned in the precedent Number.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Secondly, that the Image of any Thing by <hi>Reflection</hi> in a <hi>Glass</hi> or <hi>Water</hi> or the like, is <hi>not</hi> any Thing <hi>in</hi> or <hi>behind</hi> the Glass, or <hi>in</hi> or <hi>under</hi> the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, every Man may grant to himself; which is the Second Proposition.</p>
            <p n="7">7. For the Third, we are to consider, First that every <hi>great Agitation</hi> or <hi>Concussion</hi> of the <hi>Brain</hi> (as it happeneth from a Stroak, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the Stroak be upon the Eye) whereby the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44255:10"/>
Optick Nerve suffereth any great Violence, there <hi>appeareth</hi> before the <hi>Eyes</hi> a certain <hi>Light,</hi> which Light is <hi>nothing without,</hi> but an Apparition only, all that is real being the Concussion or Motion of the Parts of that Nerve; from which Experience we may conclude, That <hi>Apparition of Light is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally nothing but Motion</hi> within. If therefore from <hi>lucid Bodies</hi> there can be derived <hi>Motion,</hi> so as to affect the Optick Nerve in such manner as is proper thereunto, there will follow an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> of Light somewhere in that Line by which the Motion was last derived to the Eye; That is to say, In the Object, if we look directly on it, and in the Glass or Water, when we look upon it in the Line of Reflection, which in Effect is the Third Proposition; namely, That Image and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is but an Apparition to us of that Motion, Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or Alteration which the Object worketh in the Brain or Spirits, or some <hi>internal</hi> Substance in the Head.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But that <hi>from all lucid,</hi> shining and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Bodies, there is a <hi>Motion produced</hi> to the Eye, and, through the Eye, to the <hi>Optick</hi> Nerve, and so into the <hi>Brain,</hi> by which that Apparition of <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Colour</hi> is affected, is not hard to prove. And first, it is evident that the <hi>Fire,</hi> the only lucid Body here upon Earth, worketh by <hi>Motion</hi> equally every Way; insomuch as the Motion thereof <hi>stopped</hi> or inclosed, it is presently <hi>extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished,</hi> and no more Fire. And further, that that Motion whereby the Fire worketh, is <hi>Dilation,</hi> and <hi>Contraction</hi> of it self <hi>alternately,</hi> commonly called <hi>Scintillation</hi> or Glowing, is manifest also by Experience. From such <hi>Motion</hi> in the Fire
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44255:11"/>
must needs arise a <hi>Rejection</hi> or casting from it self of that part of the <hi>Medium</hi> which is <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous</hi> to it, whereby that part also rejecteth the <hi>next,</hi> and so successively one part beateth back another to the very <hi>Eye</hi>; and in the same manner the <hi>exteriour</hi> part of the Eye pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the <hi>interiour,</hi> (the Laws of Refraction still observed.) Now the interiour coat of the Eye is nothing else but a piece of the <hi>Optick</hi> Nerve; and therefore the Motion is still continued thereby into the <hi>Brain,</hi> and by <hi>Resistance</hi> or Re-action of the Brain, is also a <hi>Rebound</hi> into the Optick Nerve again; which we <hi>not conceiving</hi> as Motion or Rebound from <hi>within,</hi> do think it is <hi>without,</hi> and call it <hi>Light</hi>; as hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy shewed by the Experience of a Stroak. We have no Reason to doubt, that the Fountain of Light, the <hi>Sun,</hi> worketh by any other Ways than the <hi>Fire,</hi> at least in this Matter. And thus all <hi>Vision</hi> hath its Original from such <hi>Motion</hi> as is here described: for where there is no Light, there is no Sight; and therefore <hi>Colour</hi> also must be the same Thing with <hi>Light,</hi> as being the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the lucid Bodies: their <hi>Difference</hi> being only this, that when the Light cometh <hi>directly</hi> from the Fountain to the Eye, or <hi>indirectly</hi> by Reflection from <hi>clean</hi> and <hi>polite</hi> Bodies, and such as have <hi>not</hi> any particular Motion internal to alter it, we call it <hi>Light</hi>; but when it cometh to the Eye by Reflection from <hi>une<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en, rough,</hi> and coarse Bodies, (or such as are affected with internal Motion of their own that may alter it) then we call it <hi>Colour</hi>; Colour and Light differing only in this, that the one is <hi>pure,</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44255:11"/>
the other <hi>perturbed</hi> Light. By that which hath been said, not only the Truth of the Third Proposition, but also the whole Manner of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Light and Colour, is apparent.</p>
            <p n="9">9. As Colour is not inherent in the Object, but an Effect thereof upon us, caused by such Motion in the Object, as hath been described: so neither is <hi>Sound</hi> in the Thing we hear, but in our selves. One manifest Sign thereof, is, that as a Man may <hi>see,</hi> so also he may <hi>hear dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> or <hi>treble,</hi> by Multiplication of <hi>Echoes,</hi> which Echoes are Sounds as well as the Original; and <hi>not</hi> being in one and the <hi>same Place,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>inherent</hi> in the Body that maketh them: Nothing can make any Thing which is not in it self: the <hi>Clapper</hi> hath no <hi>Sound</hi> in it, but <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and maketh Motion in the internal Parts of the Bell; so the <hi>Bell</hi> hath Motion, and not Sound, that imparteth <hi>Motion</hi> to the <hi>Air</hi>; and the <hi>Air</hi> hath Motion, but not Sound; the <hi>Air</hi> imparteth Motion by the <hi>Ear</hi> and <hi>Nerve</hi> unto the <hi>Brain</hi>; and the Brain hath Motion, but not Sound: from the <hi>Brain,</hi> it reboundeth back into the Nerves <hi>outward,</hi> and thence it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an <hi>Apparition without,</hi> which we call <hi>Sound.</hi> And to proceed to the <hi>rest</hi> of the <hi>Senses,</hi> it is apparent enough, that the <hi>Smell</hi> and <hi>Taste</hi> of the <hi>same Thing,</hi> are <hi>not</hi> the <hi>same</hi> to <hi>every Man</hi>; and therefore are <hi>not</hi> in the Thing <hi>smelt</hi> or <hi>tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> but in the <hi>Men.</hi> So likewise the <hi>Heat</hi> we feel from the Fire is manifestly in <hi>us,</hi> and is quite <hi>different</hi> from the Heat which is in the <hi>Fire:</hi> for <hi>our</hi> Heat is <hi>Pleasure</hi> or <hi>Pain,</hi> according as it is <hi>great</hi> or <hi>moderate</hi>; but in the <hi>Coal</hi> there is no
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44255:12"/>
such Thing. By this the Fourth and last Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is proved, <hi>viz.</hi> That as in Vision, so also in Conceptions that arise from <hi>other</hi> Senses, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Inherence is not in the Object, but in the Sentient.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And from hence also it followeth, that <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Accidents</hi> or Qualities our Senses make us think there be in the <hi>World,</hi> they be <hi>not</hi> there, but are <hi>Seeming</hi> and <hi>Apparitions</hi> only: the Things that really <hi>are</hi> in the World without us, are those <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> by which these Seemings are caused. And this is the <hi>great Deception of Sense,</hi> which also is to be by Sense <hi>corrected</hi>: for as Sense telleth me, when I see <hi>directly,</hi> that the Colour seemeth to <hi>be</hi> in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; so also Sense telleth me, when I see by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, that Colour is in the Object.</p>

            <p n="1">1. AS standing Water put into Motion by the Stroak of a <hi>Stone,</hi> or blast of Wind, doth <hi>not presently</hi> give over moving as soon as the Wind ceaseth, or the Stone setleth: so <hi>neither</hi> doth the <hi>Effect</hi> cease which the <hi>Object</hi> hath wrought upon the <hi>Brain,</hi> so soon as ever, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aside of the Organs the <hi>Object ceaseth</hi> to work; that is to say, Though the <hi>Sense</hi> be <hi>past,</hi> the <hi>Image</hi> or Conception remaineth; but more <hi>obscure</hi> while we are <hi>awake,</hi> because some <hi>Object</hi> or other continually <hi>plieth</hi> and sollicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our Eyes, and Ears, <hi>keeping</hi> the Mind in a <hi>stronger</hi> Motion, whereby the <hi>weaker</hi> doth <hi>not</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily <hi>appear.</hi> And this obscure Conception is that we call <hi>Phantasie,</hi> or <hi>Imagination: Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> being (to define it) <hi>Conception re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44255:13"/>
and by little and little decaying from and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Act of Sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But when <hi>present</hi> Sense is <hi>not,</hi> as in <hi>Sleep,</hi> there the <hi>Images</hi> remaining after Sense (when there be many) as in Dreams, are <hi>not obscure,</hi> but <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>clear,</hi> as in Sense it self. The Reason is, That which obscured and made the Conceptions weak, namely Sense, and present <hi>Operation</hi> of the Object, is <hi>removed:</hi> for <hi>Sleep</hi> is the <hi>Privation of the Act of Sense,</hi> (the Power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining) and <hi>Dreams</hi> are the <hi>Imagination</hi> of them that <hi>sleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Causes</hi> of Dreams (if they be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) are the <hi>Actions</hi> or Violence of the <hi>inward</hi> Parts of a man upon his <hi>Brain,</hi> by which the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages</hi> of Sense by Sleep <hi>benummed,</hi> are <hi>restored</hi> to their Motion. The Signs by which this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be so, are the <hi>Differences</hi> of Dreams (old Men commonly dream oftener, and have their Dreams more painful than young) proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>different</hi> Accidents of Mans Body; as Dreams of <hi>Lust,</hi> as Dreams of <hi>Anger,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Heart, or other Parts within, work more or less upon the Brain, by more or less <hi>Heat</hi>; so also the Descents of different <hi>sorts of Flegm</hi> maketh us a Dream of different Tastes of Meats and Drinks; and I believe there is a <hi>Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procation</hi> of Motion from the Brain to the Vital Parts, and back from the Vital Parts to the Brain; whereby not only <hi>Imagination</hi> beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Motion</hi> in those Parts; but also Motion in those Parts begetteth Imagination like to that by which it was begotten. If this be true, and that <hi>sad</hi> Imaginations nourish the <hi>Spleen,</hi> then we
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44255:13"/>
see also a Cause, why a strong <hi>Spleen</hi> recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally causeth <hi>fearful Dreams,</hi> and why the Effects of <hi>Lasciviousness</hi> may in a Dream produce the Image of some person that had <hi>caused</hi> them. Another Sign that Dreams are caused by the Action of the inward Parts, is the <hi>Disorder</hi> and casual Consequence of one Conception or Image to another: for when we are <hi>waking,</hi> the <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> thought or Conception introduceth, and is cause of the <hi>Consequent,</hi> (as the Water followeth a mans Finger upon a dry and level Table (but in <hi>Dreams</hi> there is commonly <hi>no Coherence,</hi> (and when there is, it is by Chance) which must needs proceed from this, That the <hi>Brain</hi> in Dreams is <hi>not restored</hi> to its Motion in every Part alike; whereby it cometh to pass, that our Thoughts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like the Stars between the flying Clouds, not in the Order which a Man would chuse to observe them, but as the uncertain Flight of broken Clouds permits.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As when the <hi>Water,</hi> or any liquid Thing moved at once by <hi>divers</hi> Movents, receiveth <hi>one</hi> Motion compounded of them all; so also the <hi>Brain</hi> or Spirit therein, having been stirred by <hi>divers</hi> Objects, composeth an Imagination of <hi>divers</hi> Conceptions that appeared single to the Sense. As for Example, the Sense sheweth at one Time the Figure of a <hi>Mountain,</hi> and at another Time the Colour of <hi>Gold</hi>; but the Imagination af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards hath them both at once in a <hi>golden Mountain.</hi> From the same Cause it is, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto us <hi>Castles</hi> in the <hi>Air, Chimaera's,</hi> and other Monsters which are <hi>not</hi> in <hi>Rerum Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura, but</hi> have been conceived by the Sense in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44255:14"/>
Pieces at several Times. And this Composition is that which we commonly call <hi>Fiction</hi> of the Mind.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is yet another Kind of Imagination, which for <hi>Clearness contendeth</hi> with <hi>Sense,</hi> as well as a <hi>Dream</hi>; and that is, when the <hi>Action</hi> of Sense hath been <hi>long</hi> or <hi>vehement</hi>: and the Experience thereof is more frequent in the Sense of Seeing, than the rest. An Example where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, the <hi>Image</hi> remaining before the <hi>Eye</hi> after looking upon the <hi>Sun.</hi> Also, those little Images that appear before the Eyes in the <hi>dark</hi>; whereof I think every Man hath Experience, (but they most of all, who are <hi>timorous</hi> or superstitious) are Examples of the same. And these, for Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-sake, may be called <hi>Phantasms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. By the <hi>Senses,</hi> which are numbred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Organs</hi> to be <hi>five,</hi> we take Notice (as hath been said already) of the Objects <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> us; and that <hi>Notice</hi> is our <hi>Conception</hi> thereof: but we take <hi>Notice</hi> also some Way or other <hi>of our Conceptions</hi>: for when the Conception of the same Thing cometh <hi>again,</hi> we take Notice that is <hi>again</hi>; that is to say, that we have had the same Conception <hi>before</hi>; which is as much as to imagine a Thing <hi>past</hi>; which is impossible to the <hi>Sense,</hi> which is only of Things <hi>present.</hi> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be accounted a <hi>Sixth Sense,</hi> but <hi>internal,</hi> (not <hi>external,</hi> as the rest) and is commonly called <hi>Remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. For the <hi>Manner</hi> by which we take Notice of a Conception <hi>past,</hi> we are to remember, that in the <hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>Imagination,</hi> it is said to be a Conception by <hi>little</hi> and <hi>little decaying,</hi> or

growing more <hi>obscure.</hi> An <hi>obscure</hi> Conception is that which representeth the <hi>whole Object</hi> together, but <hi>none</hi> of the <hi>smaller Parts</hi> by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and as <hi>more</hi> or <hi>fewer</hi> Parts be represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, so is the Conception or Representation said to be <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less clear.</hi> Seeing then the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi> which when it was <hi>first</hi> produced by Sense, was <hi>clear,</hi> and represented the <hi>Parts</hi> of the 0bject <hi>distinctly</hi>; and when it cometh <hi>again</hi> is <hi>obscure,</hi> we find <hi>missing</hi> somewhat that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; by which we judge it <hi>past</hi> and <hi>decayed.</hi> For Example, a Man that is present in a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>City,</hi> seeth not only <hi>whole</hi> Streets, but can also distinguish particular <hi>Houses,</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> of Houses; but departed thence, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not distinguish them so particularly in his Mind as he did, some <hi>House</hi> or Turning escaping him: yet is this to <hi>remember</hi>; when <hi>afterwards</hi> there escape him <hi>more</hi> Particulars, this is also to <hi>remember,</hi> but <hi>not</hi> so well. In Process of Time, the <hi>Image</hi> of the City <hi>returneth</hi> but as a <hi>Mass</hi> of Building <hi>only,</hi> which is <hi>almost</hi> to have <hi>forgotten</hi> it. Seeing then Remembrance is <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less,</hi> as we find more or less <hi>Obscurity,</hi> Why may not we well think <hi>Remembrance</hi> to be nothing else but the <hi>missing of Parts,</hi> which every man expecteth should suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed after they have a Conception of the Whole? To see at a great Distance of Place, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member at great Distance of Time, is to have like Conceptions of the Thing: for there wanteth Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of Parts in both; the one Conception being weak by Operation at Distance, the other by Decay.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:44255:15"/>8. And from this that hath been said, there followeth, That a Man can <hi>never know</hi> he <hi>dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>; he <hi>may</hi> dream he <hi>doubteth,</hi> whether it be a Dream or no: but the Clearness of the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation representeth every Thing with as many Parts as doth Sense it self, and consequently, he can take Notice of nothing but as present; whereas to think he dreameth, is to think those his Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that is to say, obscurer than they were in the Sense: so that he must think them both as clear, and not as clear as Sense; which is impossible.</p>
            <p n="9">9. From the same Ground it proceedeth, that Men <hi>wonder not</hi> in their Dreams at Place and Persons, as they would do waking: for waking, a Man would think it strange to be in a Place where he never was before, and remember nothing of how he came there; but in a Dream, there cometh little of that kind into Consideration. The <hi>Clearness</hi> of Conception in a Dream, taketh away <hi>Distrust,</hi> unless the <hi>Strangeness</hi> be <hi>excessive,</hi> as to think himself fallen from on high without hurt, and then most commonly he <hi>waketh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Nor is it <hi>possible</hi> for a Man to be so far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as when his Dream is <hi>past,</hi> to think it real: for if he dream of such Things as are ordinarily in his Mind, and in such Order as he useth to do wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and withal that he laid him down to sleep in the Place were he findeth himself when he awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth; all which may happen: I know no <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Mark by which he can discern whether it were a Dream or not, and therefore do the less wonder to hear a Man sometimes to tell his Dream for a Truth, or to take it for a Vision.</p>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Succession</hi> of Conceptions in the Mind, Series or Consequence of one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may be <hi>casual</hi> and incoherent, as in Dreams for the most part; and it may be <hi>orderly,</hi> as when the former Thought introduceth the latter; and this is <hi>Discourse</hi> of the Mind. But because the Word Discourse is commonly taken for the <hi>Coherence</hi> and Consequence of Words, I will, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Aequivocation, call it <hi>Discursion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>Coherence</hi> or Consequence of one Conception to another, is their first <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence</hi> or Consequence at that <hi>Time</hi> when they are produced by Sense: As for Example, from St. <hi>Andrew</hi> the Mind runneth to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> because their Names are read together; from
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44255:16"/>
S. <hi>Peter</hi> to a <hi>Stone,</hi> for the same Cause; from <hi>Stone</hi> to <hi>Foundation,</hi> because we see them together; and for the same Cause, from Foundation to <hi>Church,</hi> and from Church to <hi>People,</hi> and from People to <hi>Tumult</hi>: and according to this Example, the Mind may run almost from any Thing to any Thing. But as in the <hi>Sense</hi> the Conception of Cause and Effect may succeed one another; so may they after Sense in the <hi>Imagination</hi>: And for the most part they do so; the <hi>Cause</hi> whereof is the <hi>Appetite</hi> of them, who, having a Conception of the <hi>End,</hi> have next unto it a Conception of the next <hi>Means</hi> to that End; As, when a Man, from a Thought of <hi>Honour</hi> to which he hath an Appetite, cometh to the Thought of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> which is the next Means thereunto; and from thence to the Thought of <hi>Study,</hi> which is the next Means to Wisdom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To omit that kind of Discursion by which we proceed from any Thing to any Thing, there are of the <hi>other</hi> Kind <hi>divers</hi> Sorts: As first, in the <hi>Senses</hi> there are certain Coherences of Conceptions, which we may call <hi>ranging:</hi> Examples whereof are; A Man casteth his <hi>Eye</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Ground,</hi> to look about for some <hi>small</hi> Thing lost; the <hi>Hounds</hi> casting about at a Fault in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the <hi>Ranging</hi> of Spaniels: and herein we take a Beginning arbitrary.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another sort of Discursion is, when the <hi>Appetite</hi> giveth a Man his Beginning, as in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample before, where Honour to which a Man hath Appetite, maketh him think upon the next Means of attaining it, and that again of the next, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this the Latines call <hi>Sagacitas</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:44255:16"/>
and We may call <hi>Hunting</hi> or <hi>Tracing,</hi> as Dogs trace Beasts by the Smell, and Men hunt them by their Footsteps; or as Men hunt after Riches, Place, or Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is yet another Kind of Discursion beginning with the Appetite to <hi>recover</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lost, proceeding from the <hi>present backward,</hi> from Thought of the Place where we <hi>miss</hi> at, to the Thought of the Place from whence we came last; and from the Thought of that, to the Thought of a Place <hi>before,</hi> till we have in our Mind some Place, wherein we had the Thing we miss: and this is called <hi>Reminiscence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The <hi>Remembrance</hi> of Succession of one Thing to another, that is, of what was <hi>antecedent,</hi> and what <hi>consequent,</hi> and what <hi>concomitant,</hi> is called an <hi>Experiment</hi>; whether the same be made by us <hi>voluntarily,</hi> as when a Man putteth any Thing into the Fire, to see what Effect the Fire will produce upon it: or <hi>not</hi> made by us, as when we remember a fair Morning after a red Evening. To have had many <hi>Experiments,</hi> is that we call <hi>Experience,</hi> which is nothing else but <hi>Remembrance</hi> of what Antecedents have been followed by what Consequents.</p>
            <p n="7">7. No man can have in his Mind a Conception of the <hi>future</hi>; for the future is <hi>not yet:</hi> but of our Conceptions of the past, we make a <hi>future</hi>; or rather, call <hi>past, future</hi> relatively. Thus after a Man hath been accustomed to see like Antecedents follow by like Consequents, whensoever he seeth the like come to pass to any Thing he had seen before, he looks there should follow it the same that followed then:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44255:17"/>
As for Example, because a Man hath often seen Offences followed by Punishment, when he seeth an Offence in present, he thinketh Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be consequent thereto; but consequent unto that which is present, Men call future: And thus we make <hi>Remembrance</hi> to be the <hi>Prevision</hi> of Things to come, or <hi>Expectation</hi> or Presumption of the future.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In the same Manner, if a Man seeth in present that which he hath seen before, he thinks that that which was antecedent to that which he saw before, is also antecedent to that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently seeth: As for Example, He that hath seen the Ashes remain after the Fire, and now again seeth ashes, concludeth again there hath been Fire: And this is called again <hi>Conjecture</hi> of the past, or Presumption of the Fact.</p>
            <p n="9">9. When a Man hath <hi>so often</hi> observed like Antecedents to be followed by like Consequents, that <hi>whensoever</hi> he seeth the Antecedent, he looketh again for the Consequent; or when he seeth the Consequent, maketh account there hath been the like Antecedent; then he calleth both the Antecedent and the Consequent, <hi>Signs</hi> one of another, as Clouds are Signs of Rain to come, and Rain of Clouds past.</p>
            <p n="10">10. This taking of Signs by <hi>Experience,</hi> is that wherein Men do ordinarily think, the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence stands between Man and Man in <hi>Wisdom,</hi> by which they commonly understand a Mans whole Ability or <hi>Power cognitive</hi>; but this is an <hi>Errour</hi>: for the Signs are but <hi>conjectural</hi>; and according as they have often or seldom failed, so their <hi>Assurance</hi> is more or less; but <hi>never full</hi> and <hi>evident</hi>: for though a Man have always seen
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44255:17"/>
the Day and Night to follow one another hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; yet can he not thence conclude they shall do so, or that they have done so eternally: <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience concludeth nothing universally.</hi> If the Signs hit twenty times for one missing, a Man may lay a Wager of Twenty to One of the Event; but may not conclude it for a Truth. But by this it is plain, that they shall <hi>conjecture best,</hi> that have <hi>most Experience,</hi> because they have most Signs to conjecture by; which is the Reason <hi>old Men</hi> are <hi>more prudent,</hi> that is, conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture better, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> than young: for, being old, they remember more; and Experience is but remembrance. And <hi>men</hi> of <hi>quick</hi> imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> are more <hi>prudent</hi> than those whose Imaginations are slow: for they observe <hi>more</hi> in <hi>less</hi> Time. Prudence is nothing but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture from Experience, or taking of Signs from Experience warily, that is, that the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments from which he taketh such Signs be all remembred; for else the Cases are not alike that seem so.</p>
            <p n="11">11. As in Conjecture concerning things past and future, it is Prudence to conclude from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, what is like to come to pass, or to have passed already; so it is an errour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from it, that <hi>it is</hi> so or so <hi>called</hi>; that is to say, We cannot from Experience conclude, that any Thing is to be called <hi>just</hi> or <hi>unjust, true</hi> or <hi>false,</hi> or any Proposition <hi>universal</hi> whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, except it be from Remembrance of the Use of Names imposed arbitrarily by Men: For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to have heard a Sentence given in the like Case, the like Sentence a thousand times is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44255:18"/>
not enough to conclude that the Sentence is just; though most Men have no other Means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude by: But it is <hi>necessary,</hi> for the drawing of such Conclusion, to <hi>trace</hi> and <hi>find out,</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Experiences, what Men do mean by calling Things just and unjust. Further, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Caveat</hi> to be taken in concluding by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, from the tenth Section of the second Chapter; that is, That we conclude such Things to be without, that are within us.</p>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. SEeing the <hi>Succession</hi> of Conceptions in the <hi>Mind</hi> are caused, as hath been said before, by the Succession they <hi>had</hi> one to another when they were produced by the <hi>Senses,</hi> and that there is no Conception that hath not bin produced imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before or after innumerable others, by the innumerable Acts of Sense; it must needs follow, that one <hi>Conception</hi> followeth <hi>not</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to our <hi>Election,</hi> and the need we have of them, <hi>but</hi> as it <hi>chanceth</hi> us to hear or see such Things as shall bring them to our Mind.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44255:19"/>
The Experience we have hereof, is in such Brute Beasts, which, having the providence to hide the Remains and Superfluity of their Meat, do nevertheless want the Remembrance of the Place where they hide it, and thereby make no Benefit thereof in their Hunger: but Man, who in this Point beginneth to rank himself some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above the Nature of Beasts, hath observed and remembred the Cause of this Defect, and to amend the same, hath imagined or devised to set up a visible or other sensible Mark, the which, when he seeth it again, may bring to his Mind the Thought he had when he set it up. A <hi>Mark</hi> therefore is a <hi>sensible Object</hi> which a Man erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth voluntarily to himself, to the End to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> thereby somewhat past, when the same is objected to his Sense again: As men that have past by a Rock at Sea, set up some Mark, thereby to remember their former Danger, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Number of these <hi>Marks,</hi> are those <hi>Humane Voices,</hi> which we call the <hi>Names</hi> or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations of Things sensible by the Ear, by which we recall into our Mind some Conceptions of the Things to which we gave those Names or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations; as the Appellation <hi>White</hi> bringeth to remembrance the Quality of such Objects as produce that Colour or Conception in us. A <hi>Name</hi> or Appellation therefore is the <hi>Voice</hi> of a Man <hi>arbitrary,</hi> imposed for a <hi>Mark</hi> to bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Mind some Conception concerning the thing on which it is imposed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Things named, are either the <hi>Objects</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as a Man; or the <hi>Conception</hi> it self that we
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44255:19"/>
have of Man, as Shape and Motion: or some Privation, which is when we conceive that there is something which we conceive not, in him; as when we conceive he is not just, not finite, we give him the Name of unjust, of infinite, which signifie Privation or Defect; and to the Privations themselves we give the Names of Injustice and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteness: so that here be <hi>Two Sorts</hi> of Names; One of <hi>Things,</hi> in which we conceive something; or of the Conceptions themselves, which are called <hi>positive</hi>: the other of Things wherein we conceive <hi>Privation</hi> or Defect, and those Names are called <hi>Privative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. By the Advantage of <hi>Names</hi> it is that we are capable of <hi>Science,</hi> which Beasts, for want of them are not; nor Man, without the Use of them: for as a Beast misseth not one or two out of many her young Ones, for want of those Names of order, One, Two, and Three, and which we call <hi>Number</hi>; so neither would a Man, without repeating orally or mentally the Words of Number, know how many Pieces of Money or other Things lie before him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Seeing there be <hi>many</hi> Conceptions of <hi>one</hi> and the same Thing, and for <hi>every</hi> Conception we give it a <hi>several</hi> Name; it followeth that for one and the same Thing, we have many Names or Attributes; as to the same Man we give the Appellations of <hi>Just, Valiant,</hi> &amp;c. for divers <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi>; of <hi>Strong, Comely,</hi> &amp;c. for divers <hi>Qualities</hi> of the <hi>Body.</hi> And again, because from divers Things we receive like Conceptions, many Things must needs have the same Appellation: as to all Things we <hi>see,</hi> we give the same Name of <hi>Visible</hi>; and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44255:20"/>
to all Things we <hi>see moveable,</hi> we give the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of <hi>Moveable</hi>: and those Names we give to <hi>many,</hi> are called <hi>universal</hi> to them all; as the Name of Man to every particular of Mankind: such Appellation as we give to <hi>one</hi> only Thing, we call <hi>individual,</hi> or singular; as <hi>Socrates,</hi> and other proper Names: or, by Circumlocution, he that writ the <hi>Iliads,</hi> for <hi>Homer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The Universality of <hi>one Name</hi> to many Things, hath been the Cause that Men think the <hi>Things</hi> are themselves universal; and so serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contend, that besides <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and all the rest of the Men that are, have been, or shall be in the World, there is yet something else that we call <hi>Man,</hi> viz. <hi>Man in general,</hi> deceiving themselves, by taking the universal, or general Appellation, for the thing it signifieth: For if one should desire the Painter to make him the Picture of a Man, which is as much as to say, of a Man in general; he meaneth no more, but that the Painter should chuse what Man he pleaseth to draw, which must needs be some of them that are, or have been, or may be, none of which are <hi>universal.</hi> But when he would have him to draw the Picture of the King, or any particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, he limiteth the Painter to that one Person he chuseth. It is plain therefore, that there is <hi>nothing universal</hi> but <hi>Names</hi>; which are therefore called <hi>indefinite</hi>; because we limit them not our selves, but leave them to be applied by the Hearer: whereas a singular Name is limited and restrained to one of the many Things it signifieth; as when we say, This Man, pointing to him, or giving him his proper Name, or by some such other Way.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44255:20"/>7. The Appellations that be <hi>universal,</hi> and common to many Things, are <hi>not</hi> always given to all the <hi>particulars,</hi> (as they ought to be) for like Conceptions, and like Considerations in them all; which is the Cause that many of them are <hi>not</hi> of <hi>constant</hi> Signification, but bring into our Mind other Thoughts than these for which they were ordained, and those are called <hi>aequivocal.</hi> As for Example, the Word Faith signifieth the same with Belief; sometimes it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth particularly that Belief which maketh a Christian; and sometime it signifieth the keeping of a Promise. Also all <hi>Metaphors</hi> are by Profession <hi>aequivocal:</hi> and there is scarce any Word that is not made <hi>aequivocal</hi> by divers Contextures of Speech, or by Diversity of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation and Gesture.</p>
            <p n="8">8. This <hi>Aequivocation</hi> of Names maketh it <hi>difficult</hi> to recover those Conceptions for which the Name was ordained; and that not only in the Language of other Men, wherein we are to consider the <hi>Drift</hi> and <hi>Occasion,</hi> and <hi>Contexture</hi> of the Speech, as well as the <hi>Words</hi> themselves; but also in our Discourse, which being derived from the Custom and common Use of Speech, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth unto us not our own Conceptions. It is therefore a great Ability in a Man, out of the Words, Contexture, and other Circumstances of Language, to deliver himself from <hi>Aequivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and to find out the true Meaning of what it said: And this is it we call <hi>Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Of two <hi>Appellations,</hi> by the Help of this little Verb <hi>is,</hi> or something equivalent, we make
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44255:21"/>
an <hi>Affirmation</hi> or <hi>Negation,</hi> either of which in the Schools we call also a <hi>Proposition,</hi> and consisteth of two Appellations joyned together by the said Verb <hi>is</hi>: As for Example, Man is a living creature; or thus, Man is not righteous: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the former is called an <hi>Affirmation,</hi> because the Appellation, Living Creature is <hi>Positive</hi>; the latter a <hi>Negative,</hi> because not righteous is <hi>Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
            </p>

In <hi>every Proposition,</hi> be it Affirmative or Negative, the latter Appellation either compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth the former, as in this Proposition, Charity is a Vertue, the Name of Vertue compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth the Name of Charity, and many other Vertues beside; and then is the Proposition said to be <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>Truth:</hi> For, <hi>Truth,</hi> and a <hi>true Proposition,</hi> is all one.

In what manner of two Propositions, whether <hi>both</hi> Affirmative, or <hi>one</hi> Affirmative, the <hi>other</hi> Negative, is made a <hi>Syllogism,</hi> I forbear to write. All this that hath been said of Names or Propositions, though <hi>necessary,</hi> is but <hi>dry</hi> Discourse: and this Place is not for the whole Art of Logick, which if I enter further into, I ought to pursue: Besides, it is not needfull; for there be few Men which have not so much natural
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44255:21"/>
Logick, as thereby to discern well enough, whether any Conclusion I shall make in this Discourse hereafter, be well or ill collected: Only thus much I say in this Place, that <hi>Making of Syllogisms</hi> is that we call <hi>Ratiocination</hi> or <hi>Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>

Now when a man <hi>reasoneth</hi> from <hi>Principles</hi> that are <hi>found</hi> indubitable by Experience, all Deceptions of Sense and Aequivocation of Words avoided, the Conclusion he maketh is said to be <hi>according to right Reason:</hi> But when from his Conclusion a Man may, by good Ratiocination, derive that which is <hi>contradictory</hi> to any evident Truth whatsoever, then he is said to have concluded <hi>against Reason</hi>: And such a Conclusion is called <hi>Absurdity.</hi>

As the <hi>Invention</hi> of <hi>Names</hi> hath been <hi>necessary</hi> for the drawing Men <hi>out of</hi> Ignorance, by calling to their Remembrance the necessary <hi>Coherence</hi> of one Conception to another; so also hath it on the other side precipitated Men into <hi>Errour:</hi> Insomuch, that whereas by the Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nefit of <hi>Words</hi> and Ratiocination they exceed <hi>brute Beasts</hi> in Knowledge, and the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that accompany the same; so they exceed them also in <hi>Errour</hi>: For, <hi>true</hi> and <hi>false</hi> are Things not incident to Beasts, because they adhere not to Propositions and Language; nor have they Ratiocination, whereby to multiply one Untruth by another, as Men have.</p>
            <p n="14">14. It is the <hi>Nature</hi> almost of every <hi>Corporal</hi> Thing, being <hi>often moved</hi> in one and the same Manner, to receive continually a <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>greater Easiness</hi> and Aptitude to the <hi>same</hi> Motion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44255:22"/>
as in Time the same becometh so <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual,</hi> that, to <hi>beget</hi> it, there needs no more than to <hi>begin</hi> it. The <hi>Passions</hi> of Man, as they are the Beginning of <hi>voluntary</hi> Motions; so are they the Beginning of <hi>Speech,</hi> which is the Motion of the Tongue. And Men desiring to shew others the Knowledge, Opinions, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and Passions which are in themselves, and to that End having invented <hi>Language,</hi> have by that Means transferred all that <hi>Discursion</hi> of their <hi>Mind</hi> mentioned in the former Chapter, by the <hi>Motion</hi> of their <hi>Tongues,</hi> into <hi>Discourse</hi> of <hi>Words</hi>: And <hi>Ratio</hi> now is but <hi>Oratio,</hi> for the most part, wherein Custom hath so great a Power, that the Mind suggesteth only the first Word; the rest follow <hi>habitually,</hi> and are not followed by the Mind; as it is with Beggars, when they saw their <hi>Pater noster,</hi> putting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether such Words, and in such manner, as in their Education they have learned from their Nurses, from their Companies, or from their Teachers, having <hi>no Images</hi> or <hi>Conceptions</hi> in their Mind, answering to the Words they speak: and as they have learned themselves, so they teach Posterity. Now if we consider the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of those <hi>Deceptions</hi> of the Sense, mentioned Chap 2.

that it is impossible to <hi>rectifie</hi> so many Errours of any one Man, as must needs proceed from those Causes, without beginning <hi>a-new</hi> from the very first Grounds of all our Knowledge and Sense; and instead of Books, reading o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver orderly ones own Conceptions: In which Meaning, I take <hi>Noste teipsum</hi> for a Precept wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the Reputation it hath gotten.</p>

               <p>1. Of the two Kinds of Knowledge</p>

               <p>9. Belief, in some Cases, no less from Doubt than Knowledge.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. THere is a Story somewhere, of one that pretends to have been miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously cured of Blindness (wherewith he was born) by St. <hi>Albane</hi> or other Saints, at the Town of St. <hi>Albans</hi>; and that the Duke of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> being there, to be satisfied of the Truth of the Miracle, asked the Man, What Colour is this? Who, by answering, It was Green, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered himself, and was punished for a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit: for though by his Sight newly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he might distinguish between Green, and Red, and all other Colours, as well as any that should interrogate him, yet he could not possibly know at first Sight which of them was called Green, or Red, or by any other Name. By this we may understand, there be <hi>two Kinds</hi> of Knowledge, whereof the <hi>one</hi> is nothing else
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44255:23"/>
but <hi>Sense,</hi> or Knowledge <hi>original,</hi> as I have said in the Beginning of the second Chapter, and <hi>Remembrance</hi> of the same; the <hi>other</hi> is called <hi>Science</hi> or Knowledge of the <hi>Truth of Propositions,</hi> and how Things are called; and is derived from <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi> Both of these Sorts are but <hi>Experience</hi>; The former being the Experience of the Effects of Things that work upon us from <hi>without</hi>; and the latter Experience Men have from the proper Use of <hi>Names</hi> in Language: and all Experience being, as I have said, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, all Knowledge is Remembrance: and of the <hi>former,</hi> the Register we keep in Books, is called <hi>History</hi>; But the Registers of the <hi>latter</hi> are called the <hi>Sciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There are <hi>two Things</hi> necessarily implied in this Word <hi>Knowledge</hi>; the one is <hi>Truth,</hi> the other <hi>Evidence</hi>: for what is not Truth, can never be known. For, let a Man say he knoweth a Thing never so well, if the same shall afterwards appear false, he is driven to Confession, that it was not Knowledge, but O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. Likewise, if the Truth be not evident, though a Man holdeth it, yet is his Knowledge thereof no more than theirs who hold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: for if Truth were enough to make it Knowledge, all Truth were known; which is not so.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What <hi>Truth</hi> is, hath been defined in the <hi>precedent</hi> Chapter; What <hi>Evidence</hi> is, I <hi>now</hi> set down: and it is the Concomitance of a Mans <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> with the <hi>Words</hi> that signifie such Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Act of Ratiocination: for when a Man reasoneth with his Lips only, to which the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44255:24"/>
Mind suggesteth only the Beginning, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not the Words of his Mouth with the Conceptions of his Mind, out of Custom of so speaking; though he begin his Ratiocination with True Propositions, and proceed with certain Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisms, and thereby make always true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions; yet are not his Conclusions <hi>evident</hi> to him, for Want of the <hi>Concomitance</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> with his Words: for if the Words alone were sufficient, a <hi>Parrot</hi> might be taught as well to know Truth, as to speak it. Evidence is to Truth, as the Sap to the Tree, which, so far as it creepeth along with Body and Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, keepeth them alive; where it forsaketh them, they die: for this Evidence, which is Meaning with our Words, is the Life of Truth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Knowledge therefore which we call <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> I define to be <hi>Evidence of Truth,</hi> from some Beginning or Principle of <hi>Sense</hi>: for the Truth of a Proposition is never evident, until we conceive the Meaning of the Words or Terms whereof it consisteth, which are always Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the Mind: Nor can we remember those Conceptions, without the Thing that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the same by our Senses. The <hi>first</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Knowledge is, that we have such and such <hi>Conceptions</hi>; the <hi>second,</hi> that we have thus and thus <hi>named</hi> the Things whereof they are Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the <hi>third</hi> is, that we have <hi>joyned</hi> those <hi>Names</hi> in such Manner as to make true Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the <hi>fourth</hi> and last is, that we have <hi>joyned</hi> those <hi>Propositions</hi> in such Manner as they be concluding, and the Truth of the Conclusion said to be known. And of these two Kinds of Knowledge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44255:24"/>
the former is <hi>Experience of Fact,</hi> and the later of <hi>Evidence of Truth</hi>; as the <hi>former,</hi> if it be great, is called <hi>Prudence</hi>; so the <hi>latter,</hi> if it be much, hath usually been called, both by Ancient and Modern Writers, <hi>Sapience</hi> or Wisdom: and of this <hi>latter, Man</hi> only is capable; of the <hi>former, brute Beasts</hi> also participate.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A Proposition is said to be <hi>supposed,</hi> when, being <hi>not evident,</hi> it is nevertheless <hi>admitted for a Time,</hi> to the End, that, joyning to it other Propositions, we may <hi>conclude</hi> something; and to <hi>proceed</hi> from Conclusion to Conclusion, for a <hi>Trial</hi> whether the same will lead us into any <hi>absurd</hi> or impossible Conclusion; which if it <hi>do,</hi> then we know such Supposition to have been false.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But if, running thorow <hi>many</hi> Conclusions, we come to <hi>none</hi> that are <hi>absurd,</hi> then we think the Proposition <hi>probable</hi>: likewise we think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable whatsoever Proposition we <hi>admit</hi> for Truth by Errour of Reasoning, or from trusting to other Men: And all such Propositions as are admitted by <hi>Trust</hi> or errour, we are not said to <hi>know,</hi> but <hi>think</hi> them to be true; and the Admittance of them is called <hi>Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. And particularly, when the Opinion is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted out of <hi>Trust</hi> to <hi>other</hi> Men, they are said to <hi>believe</hi> it; and their Admittance of it is called <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. It is either <hi>Science</hi> or <hi>Opinion</hi> which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly mean by the Word <hi>Conscience</hi>: for Men say that such and such a thing is true in or upon their Conscience; which they <hi>never</hi> do, when they think it <hi>doubtful</hi>; and therefore they <hi>know,</hi> or <hi>think</hi> they know it to be true. But Men, when
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44255:25"/>
they say Things upon their Conscience, are not therefore presumed certainly to know the Truth of what they say: It remaineth then, that that Word is used by them that have an <hi>Opinion, not</hi> only of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Thing, <hi>but</hi> also of their <hi>Knowledge</hi> of it, to which the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is consequent. <hi>Conscience</hi> I therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine to be <hi>Opinion of Evidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Belief,</hi> which is the admitting of Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions upon <hi>Trust,</hi> in many Cases is no less free from <hi>Doubt,</hi> than perfect and manifest <hi>Knowledge</hi>: for as there is nothing whereof there is not some Cause; so, when there is Doubt, there must be some Cause thereof conceived Now there be many Things which we receive from <hi>Report of others,</hi> of which it is impossible to imagine any Cause of <hi>Doubt</hi>: for what can be opposed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Consent of all Men, in Things they can know, and have no Cause to report other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than they are, (such as is great Part of our <hi>Histories</hi>) unless a Man would say that all the World had <hi>conspired</hi> to deceive him. And thus much of <hi>Sense, Imagination, Discursion, Ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which are the Acts of our <hi>Power cognitive,</hi> or <hi>conceptive.</hi> That Power of the <hi>Mind</hi> which we call <hi>motive,</hi> differeth from the Power <hi>motive</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi>: for the Power <hi>motive</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> is that by which it <hi>moveth other Bodies,</hi> and we call <hi>Strength</hi>; but the Power motive of the <hi>Mind,</hi> is that by which the Mind giveth <hi>animal Motion</hi> to that <hi>Body</hi> wherein it existeth: the Acts hereof are our <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Passions,</hi> of which I am to speak in general.</p>

               <p>Sensual Delight, and Pain; Joy and Grief.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN the eighth Section of the second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is shewed, that <hi>Conceptions</hi> and <hi>Apparitions</hi> are nothing <hi>really,</hi> but <hi>Motion</hi> in some internal Substance of the <hi>Head</hi>; which Motion <hi>not stopping</hi> there, but proceeding to the <hi>Heart,</hi> of Necessity must there either <hi>help</hi> or <hi>hinder</hi> the Motion which is called <hi>Vital</hi>: when it <hi>helpeth,</hi> it is called <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, Contentment,</hi> or <hi>Pleasure,</hi> which is nothing really but Motion about the Heart, as Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is nothing but Motion in the Head; and the <hi>Objects</hi> that cause it are called <hi>pleasant</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful,</hi> or by some Name equivalent; The <hi>Latines</hi> have <hi>Jucundum, à juvando,</hi> from helping; and the same Delight, with Reference to the Object, is called <hi>Love</hi>: but when such Motion <hi>weakeneth</hi> or hindereth the vital Motion, then it is called <hi>Pain</hi>; and in Relation to that which causeth it, Hatred, which the <hi>Latines</hi> express
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44255:26"/>
sometimes by <hi>Odium,</hi> and sometimes by <hi>Taedium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This Motion in which consisteth <hi>Pleasure</hi> or <hi>Pain,</hi> is also a <hi>Solicitation</hi> or Provocation ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to draw <hi>near</hi> to the Thing that pleaseth, or to <hi>retire</hi> from the Thing that displeaseth; and this Solicitation is the <hi>Endeavour</hi> or internal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>animal</hi> Motion, which when the Object <hi>delighteth,</hi> is called <hi>Appetite</hi>; when it <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaseth,</hi> it is called <hi>Aversion,</hi> in Respect of the Displeasure <hi>present</hi>; but in Respect of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure <hi>expected, Fear.</hi> So that <hi>Pleasure, Love,</hi> and <hi>Appetite,</hi> which is also called Desire, are <hi>divers Names</hi> for divers Considerations of the <hi>same Thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Every Man, for his own Part, calleth that which <hi>pleaseth,</hi> and is delightful to himself, <hi>Good</hi>; and that <hi>Evil</hi> which <hi>displeaseth</hi> him: insomuch that while every Man <hi>differeth</hi> from other in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> they differ also from one another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the common Distinction of Good and Evil. Nor is there any such Thing as Absolute Goodness, considered without Relation: for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Goodness which we apprehend in God Almighty, is <hi>his Goodness to us.</hi> And as we call <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> the <hi>Things</hi> that please and displease; so call we <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Badness,</hi> the <hi>Qualities</hi> or Powers whereby they do it: And the Signs of that Goodness are called by the <hi>Latines</hi> in one Word <hi>Pulchritudo,</hi> and the Signs of Evil, <hi>Turpitudo</hi>; to which we have no Words precisely answerable.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As all Conceptions we have immediately by the <hi>Sense,</hi> are, <hi>Delight,</hi> or <hi>Pain,</hi> or <hi>Appetite,</hi> or <hi>Fear</hi>; so are all the <hi>Imaginations</hi> after Sense. But as they are weaker Imaginations, so are they also weaker Pleasures, or weaker Pain.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:44255:26"/>5. As <hi>Appetite</hi> is the Beginning of <hi>animal</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards something that pleaseth us; so is the <hi>attaining</hi> thereof, the <hi>End</hi> of that Motion, which we also call the <hi>Scope,</hi> and Aim, and final Cause of the same: and when we attain that End, the Delight we have thereby is called the <hi>Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>: So that <hi>Bonum</hi> and <hi>Finis</hi> are different Names, but for different Considerations of the same Thing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And of <hi>Ends,</hi> some of them are called <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinqui,</hi> that is, near at hand; others <hi>remoti,</hi> far off: but when the Ends that be nearer attaining, be compared with those that be further off, they are called not Ends, but <hi>Means,</hi> and the <hi>Way</hi> to those. But for an <hi>utmost</hi> End, in which the ancient <hi>Philosophers</hi> have placed <hi>Felicity,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted much concerning the Way thereto, there is no such Thing in this World, nor Way to it, more than to <hi>Vtopia</hi>: for while we live, we have Desires, and Desire presupposeth a further End. Those Things which please us, as the Way or <hi>Means</hi> to a further End, we call <hi>profitable</hi>; and the <hi>Fruition</hi> of them, <hi>Vse</hi>; and those Things that profit not, <hi>vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Seeing all <hi>Delight</hi> is <hi>Appetite,</hi> and presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a <hi>further</hi> End, there can be <hi>no Contentment</hi> but in <hi>proceeding</hi>: and therefore we are not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, when we see, that as Men attain to more Riches, Honour, or other Power; so their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite continually groweth more and more; and when they are come to the utmost Degree of some Kind of Power, they pursue some other, as long as in any Kind they think themselves behind any other: of those therefore that have attained to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44255:27"/>
the highest Degree of Honour and Riches, some have affected Mastery in some Art; as <hi>Nero</hi> in Musick and Poetry, <hi>Commodus</hi> in the Art of a Gladiator; and such as affect not some such Thing, must find Diversion and Recreation of their Thoughts in the Contention either of Play or Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness: and Men justly complain of a great Grief, that they know not what to do. <hi>Felicity</hi> therefore, by which we mean continual Delight, consisteth <hi>not</hi> in <hi>having</hi> prospered, but in <hi>prospering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. There are few Things in this World, but <hi>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> have <hi>Mixture</hi> of Good and Evil, <hi>or</hi> there is a Chain of them so necessarily linked together, that the one cannot be taken without the other: As for Example, the Pleasures of Sin, and the Bitterness of Punishment, are inseparable; as is also Labour and Honour, for the most part. Now when in the <hi>whole Chain,</hi> the <hi>greater Part</hi> is good, the <hi>Whole</hi> is called <hi>Good</hi>; and when the <hi>Evil</hi> over-weigheth, the <hi>Whole</hi> is called <hi>Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9.

HAving in the first Section of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Chapter presupposed, that Motion and <hi>Agitation of the Brain</hi> which we call Conception, to be continued <hi>to the Heart,</hi> and there to be called <hi>Passion</hi>; I have therefore obliged my self, as far forth as I am able, to search out and declare <hi>from what</hi> Conception <hi>proceedeth</hi> every one of those <hi>Passions</hi> which we commonly take notice of: for, seeing the Things that please and displease, are innumerable, and work innumerable Ways, Men have not taken notice but of a very few, which also are many of them without Name.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And first, we are to consider, that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions there are <hi>three Sorts,</hi> whereof one is of that which is <hi>present,</hi> which is <hi>Sense</hi>; another, of that which is <hi>past,</hi> which is <hi>Remembrance</hi>; and the third, of that which is <hi>future,</hi> which we call <hi>Expectation</hi>: all which have been manifestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the second and third Chapters; and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44255:28"/>
every of these Conceptions is <hi>Pleasure</hi> or <hi>Pain present.</hi> And first for the Pleasures of the <hi>Body</hi> which affect the Sense of <hi>Touch</hi> and <hi>Tast,</hi> as far forth as they be <hi>Organical,</hi> their Conceptions are <hi>Sense</hi>: so also is the Pleasure of all <hi>Exonerations</hi> of Nature: All which Passions I have before named, <hi>Sensual Pleasures</hi>; and their contrary, <hi>Sensual Pains</hi>: to which also may be added the Pleasures and Displeasures of <hi>Odours,</hi> if any of them shall be found Organical, which for the most Part they are not, as appeareth by this Experience which every Man hath, that the same Smells, when they seem to proceed from others, displease, though they proceed from our selves; but when we think they proceed from our selves, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please not, though they come from others: the Displeasure of this is a Conception of Hurt thereby from those Odours, as being unwholesom, and is therefore a Conception of Evil to come, and not present. Concerning the Delight of <hi>Hearing,</hi> it is diverse, and the Organ it self not affected thereby: <hi>Simple Sounds</hi> please by <hi>Aequality,</hi> as the Sound of a Bell or Lute: insomuch as it seems, an Equality continued by the Percussion of the Object upon the Ear, is Pleasure; the Contrary is called <hi>Harshness,</hi> such as is Grating, and some other Sounds, which do not always affect the Body, but only sometime, and that with a Kind of Horrour beginning at the Teeth. <hi>Harmony,</hi> or many Sounds together agreeing, please by the same Reason as the <hi>Vnison,</hi> which is the Sound of equal Strings equally stretched. Sounds that differ in any <hi>Height,</hi> please by <hi>Inequality and Aequality alternate,</hi> that is to say, the higher
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44255:28"/>
Note striketh twice, for one Stroke of the other, whereby they strike together every second Time; as is well proved by <hi>Galileo,</hi> in the first Dialogue concerning local Motion: where he also shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that two Sounds differing a <hi>fifth,</hi> delight the Ear by an <hi>Aequality</hi> of striking <hi>after two Inequalities</hi>; for the higher Note striketh the Ear thrice, while the other strikes but twice. In like Manner he sheweth wherein consisteth the Pleasure of Concord, and the Displeasure of Discord, in other Difference of Notes. There is yet <hi>another</hi> Pleasure and Displeasure of Sounds, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in <hi>Consequence of one Note after another, diversified</hi> both by <hi>Accent</hi> and <hi>Measure</hi>; whereof that which pleaseth is called <hi>Air</hi>; but for what Reason Succession in Tone and Measure is more Air than another, I confess I know not; but I conjecture the Reason to be, for that some of them imitate and revive some Passion which otherwise we take no Notice of, and the other not; for <hi>no Air pleaseth but for a time,</hi> no more doth Imitation. Also the Pleasures of the <hi>Eye</hi> consist in a certain <hi>Aequality</hi> of <hi>Colour:</hi> for <hi>Light,</hi> the most glorious of all Colours, is made by <hi>equal</hi> Operation of the Object; whereas <hi>Colour</hi> is <hi>perturbed,</hi> that is to say, unequal Light, as hath been said, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. And therefore Colours, the more Equality is in them, the more resplendent they are: and as <hi>Harmony</hi> is pleasure to the <hi>Ear,</hi> which consisteth of <hi>divers Sounds</hi>; so perhaps may some Mixture of <hi>divers Colours</hi> be <hi>Harmony</hi> to the <hi>Eye,</hi> more than another Mixture. There is yet another Delight by the <hi>Ear,</hi> which happeneth onely to Men of skill in Musick, which is of another Nature, (and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44255:29"/>
not as these) Conception of the present, but rejoycing of their own Skill; of which nature are the Passions of which I am to speak next.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conception of the <hi>future,</hi> is but a <hi>Supposition</hi> of the <hi>same,</hi> proceeding from <hi>Remembrance</hi> of what is past; and we so far <hi>conceive</hi> that any Thing <hi>will be hereafter,</hi> as we <hi>know</hi> there is <hi>something at the present</hi> that hath Power to produce it: and that any Thing hath Power now to produce another Thing hereafter, we cannot conceive, but by Remembrance that it hath produced the like heretofore. Wherefore all Conception of future, is Conception of Power able to produce some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Whosoever therefore expecteth Pleasure to come, must conceive withal some Power in himself by which the same may be attained. And because the Passions, whereof I am to speak next, consist in Conception of the future, that is to say, in Conception of Power past, and the Act to come; before I go any further, I must in the next Place speak somewhat concerning this Power.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By this Power I mean the same with the Faculties of the <hi>Body, Nutritive, Generative, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and of the <hi>Mind, Knowledge</hi>; and besides these, such <hi>further</hi> Power as by them is acquired, <hi>viz. Riches, Place</hi> of Authority, <hi>Friendship</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> and <hi>Good Fortune; which</hi> last is really nothing else but the Favour of God Almighty. The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries</hi> of these are <hi>Impotencies, Infirmities,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of the said Powers respectively. And because the Power of one Man resisteth and hindereth the Effects of the Power of another, <hi>Power</hi> simply is no more, but the <hi>Excess</hi> of the Power of one above that of another: for equal Powers op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44255:29"/>
destroy one another; and such their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is called Contention.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Signs</hi> by which we know our own <hi>Power,</hi> are those <hi>Actions</hi> which proceed from the same; and the Signs by which <hi>other Men</hi> know it, are such <hi>Actions, Gesture, Countenance</hi> and <hi>Speech,</hi> as usually such Powers produce: and the <hi>Acknowledgement</hi> of Power is called Honour; and to honour a Man inwardly, is to conceive or acknowledge that that Man hath the odds or Excess of that Power above him with whom he contendeth or compareth himself. And ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable are those Signs for which one Man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth Power or Excess above his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current in another: As for Example, <hi>Beauty</hi> of Person, consisting in a lively Aspect of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and other <hi>Signs</hi> of <hi>Natural Heat,</hi> are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, being Signs precedent of Power <hi>genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and much Issue; as also, general Reputation among those of the other Sex, because Signs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent of the same. And Actions proceeding from <hi>Strength of Body,</hi> and open Force, are honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as Signs consequent of Power <hi>motive,</hi> such as are Victory in Battel or Duel; <hi>A d'avoir tué son homme.</hi> Also to adventure upon great Exploits and Danger, as being a Sign conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of Opinion of our own Strength, and that Opinion a Sign of the Strength it self. And to teach or perswade are honourable, because they be Signs of <hi>Knowledge.</hi> And Riches are honourable; as Signs of the Power that acquired them: And Gifts, Cost, and Magnificence of Houses, Apparel, and the like, are honourable, as Signs of Riches. And <hi>Nobility</hi> is honourable
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44255:30"/>
by Reflection, as a Sign of Power in the Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors: And <hi>Authority,</hi> because a Sign of the Strength, Wisdom, Favour or Riches by which it is attained. And <hi>Good Fortune</hi> or casual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity is honourable, because a Sign of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, to whom is to be ascribed all that cometh to us by Fortune, no less than that we attain unto by Industry. And the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Defects of these Signs are dishonourable; and according to the Signs of Honour and Dishon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, so we estimate and make the Value or Worth of a Man: for so much worth is every Thing, as a Man will give for the Use of all it can do.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The <hi>Signs</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> are those by which we perceive that one Man acknowledgeth the Power and Worth of another; such as these, to <hi>praise,</hi> to <hi>magnifie,</hi> to <hi>bless,</hi> to call happy, to pray or supplicate to, to thank, to offer unto or present, to obey, to hearken unto with Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to speak to with Consideration, to approach unto in decent Manner, to keep Distance from, to give way to, and the like, which are the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Inferior giveth to the Superiour.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Signs</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> from the Superiour to the Inferiour, are such as these; to <hi>praise</hi> or prefer him before his Concurrent, to hear more willingly, to speak to him more familiarly, to admit him nearer, to employ him rather, to ask his advice rather, to take his opinions, and to give him <hi>any Gifts rather than Money</hi>; or if Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, so much as may <hi>not</hi> imply his <hi>Need</hi> of a <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>: for Need of a little is greater Poverty than Need of much. And this is enough for Examples of the Signs of Honour and Power.</p>

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:44255:30"/>7. <hi>Reverence</hi> is the Conception we have concerning another, that he hath the <hi>Power</hi> to do unto us both <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Hurt,</hi> but <hi>not</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> to do us <hi>Hurt.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>GLory,</hi> or internal Gloriation or Triumph of the Mind, is the Passion which proceedeth from the Imagination or Conception of our <hi>own Power</hi> above the Power of him that contendeth with us; the <hi>Signs</hi> whereof, besides those in the Countenance, and other Gestures of the Body
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44255:31"/>
which cannot be described, are, <hi>Ostentation</hi> in Words, and <hi>Insolency</hi> in Actions: and this Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of them whom it displeaseth, is called <hi>Pride</hi>; by them whom it pleaseth, it is termed a <hi>just Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation</hi> of himself. This Imagination of our Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or Worth, may be from an assured and certain <hi>Experience</hi> of our own Actions; and then is that Glory <hi>just,</hi> and well grounded, and begetteth an Opinion of <hi>increasing</hi> the same by other Actions to follow; in which consisteth the Appetite which we call <hi>Aspiring,</hi> or Proceeding from one Degree of Power to another. The same Passion may proceed <hi>not</hi> from any <hi>Conscience</hi> of our own Actions, but from Fame and Trust of <hi>others,</hi> whereby one may think well of himself, and yet be deceived; and this is <hi>false Glory,</hi> and the Aspiring consequent thereto procureth ill Success. Further, the <hi>Fiction</hi> (which is also Imagination) of Actions done by our selves, which never were done, is <hi>Glorying</hi>; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it begetteth no Appetite nor endeavour to any further Attempt, it is meerly <hi>vain</hi> and unprofitable; as when a Man imagineth himself to do the Actions whereof he readeth in some <hi>Romance,</hi> or to be like unto some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man whose Acts he admireth: And this is called <hi>Vain Glory</hi>; and is exemplied in the Fable, by the Fly sitting on the Axletree, and saying to himself, What a Dust do I make rise! The expression of <hi>Vain Glory</hi> is that Wish, which some of the School mistaking for some Appetite distinct from all the rest, have called <hi>Velleity,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a new Word, as they made a new Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was not before. <hi>Signs</hi> of <hi>Vain Glory</hi> in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44255:32"/>
the <hi>Gesture</hi>; are, <hi>Imitation</hi> of others, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting and Usurping the Signs of Vertue they have not; Affectation of Fashions, Captation of Honour from their Dreams, and other little Stories of themselves, from their Country, from their Names, and from the like.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Passion <hi>contrary to Glory,</hi> proceeding from Apprehension of our own Infirmity, is called <hi>Humility</hi> by those by whom it is approved; by the rest, <hi>Dejection</hi> and Poorness: which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception may be well or ill grounded; if well, it produceth Fear to attempt any Thing rashly; if ill, it utterly cows a Man, that he neither dares speak publickly, nor expect good Success in any Action.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It happeneth sometimes, that he that hath a <hi>good</hi> Opinion of himself, and upon good ground, may nevertheless, by Reason of the <hi>Froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> which that Passion begetteth, discover in himself some <hi>Defect</hi> or Infirmity, the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance whereof dejecteth him; and this Passion is called <hi>Shame</hi>; by which being cooled and checked in his Forwardness, he is more wary for the Time to come, This Passion, as it is a Sign of <hi>Infirmity,</hi> which is <hi>Dishonour</hi>; so also it is a Sign of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which is <hi>Honour.</hi> The Sign of it is <hi>Blushing,</hi> which appeareth less in Men conscious of their own Defect, because they less betray the Infirmities they acknowledge.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Courage,</hi> in a <hi>large</hi> Signification, is the <hi>Absence</hi> of <hi>Fear</hi> in the Presence of any evil what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever: but in a <hi>Strict</hi> and more common Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>Wounds</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> when they oppose a Man in the Way to his End.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Anger</hi> or sudden Courage is nothing but
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44255:32"/>
the <hi>Appetite</hi> or desire of <hi>overcoming present</hi> Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. It hath been defined commonly to be Grief proceeding from an Opinion of Contempt; which is confuted by the often Experience which we have of being moved to anger by things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate, and without Sense, and consequently incapable of contemning us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Revengefulness</hi> is that Passion which ariseth from an Expectation or <hi>Imagination</hi> of <hi>making</hi> him that hath <hi>hurt</hi> us, <hi>find</hi> his <hi>own Action hurtful</hi> to himself, and to <hi>acknowledge</hi> the same; and this is the Height of Revenge: for though it be not hard, by returning Evil for Evil, to make ones Adversary displeased with his own Fact; yet to make him acknowledge the same, is so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, that many a Man had rather die than do it. Revenge aimeth not at the Death, but at the Captivity or Subjection of an Enemy; which was well expressed in the Exclamation of <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Caesar,</hi> concerning one, that, to frustrate his Revenge, had killed himself in Prison; <hi>Hath he escaped me</hi>? To <hi>kill,</hi> is the aim of them that <hi>hate,</hi> to <hi>rid</hi> themselves out of Fear: <hi>Revenge</hi> aimeth at <hi>Triumph,</hi> which over the Dead is not.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Repentance</hi> is the Passion which proceedeth from <hi>Opinion</hi> or Knowledge that the <hi>Action</hi> they have done is <hi>out of the Way</hi> to the <hi>End</hi> they would attain: the Effect whereof is, to pursue that Way no longer, but, by the Consideration of the End, to direct themselves into a better. The first Motion therefore in this Passion is <hi>Grief</hi>; but the Expectation or Conception of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again into the Way, is <hi>Joy</hi>; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Passion of <hi>Repentance</hi> is compounded
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44255:33"/>
and allayed of both: but the <hi>predominant</hi> is <hi>Joy</hi>; else were the Whole Grief, which cannot be, forasmuch as he that proceedeth towards the End, he conceiveth Good, proceedeth with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; and Appetite is Joy, as hath been said, Chap. 7. Sect. 2.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Hope</hi> is <hi>Expectation</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> to come, as Fear is the Expectation of Evil: But when there be Causes, some that make us expect Good, and some that make us expect Evil, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately working in our Mind; if the Causes that make us expect Good, be greater than those that make us expect Evil, the whole Passion is Hope; if contrarily the Whole is Fear. Absolute <hi>Privation</hi> of hope is <hi>Despair,</hi> a degree whereof is <hi>Diffidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Trust</hi> is a Passion proceeding from the <hi>Belief of him</hi> from whom we <hi>expect</hi> or <hi>hope</hi> for Good, so <hi>free</hi> from <hi>Doubt</hi> that upon the same we pursue no other Way to attain the same Good: as <hi>Distrust</hi> or Diffidence is <hi>Doubt</hi> that maketh him endeavour to provide himself by other Means And that this is the Meaning of the Words Trust and Distrust, is manifest from this, that a Man never provideth himself by a second Way, but when he mistrusteth that the first will not hold</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Pity</hi> is <hi>Imagination</hi> or <hi>Fiction</hi> of <hi>future</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity to our <hi>selves,</hi> proceeding from the Sense of <hi>another</hi> Mans Calamity. But when it light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on such as we think have not deserved the same, the Compassion is greater, because then there appeareth more Probability that the same may happen to us: for, the Evil that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44255:33"/>
happeneth to an innocent Man, may happen to every Man. But when we see a Man suffer for great Crimes, which we cannot easily think will fall upon our selves, the Pity is the less. And therefore Men are apt to pity those whom they love: for, whom they love, they think wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Good, and therefore not worthy of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. Thence it is also, that Men pity the Vices of some Persons at the first Sight only, out of Love to their Aspect. The Contrary of Pity is <hi>Hardness of Heart,</hi> proceeding either from <hi>Slowness</hi> of Imagination, or some extreme great <hi>Opinion</hi> of their own <hi>Exemption</hi> from the like Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, or from hatred of all or most Men.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Indignation</hi> is that <hi>Grief</hi> which consisteth in the Conception of <hi>good Success</hi> happening to them whom they think <hi>unworthy</hi> thereof. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore Men think all those unworthy whom they hate, they think them not only unworthy of the good Fortune they have, but also of their own Vertues. And of all the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Mind, these two, Indignation and Pity, are most raised and increased by Eloquence: for, the <hi>Aggravation</hi> of <hi>the Calamity,</hi> and <hi>Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation</hi> of the <hi>Fault,</hi> augmenteth <hi>Pity</hi>; and the <hi>Extenuation</hi> of the <hi>Worth</hi> of the Person, together with the magnifying of his Success, which are the Parts of an Orator, are able to turn these two Passions into <hi>Fury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>Emulation</hi> is <hi>Grief</hi> arising from seeing <hi>ones self exceeded</hi> or excelled by his <hi>Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> together with <hi>Hope</hi> to <hi>equal</hi> or exceed him in Time to come, by his own Ability. But, <hi>Envy</hi> is the same <hi>Grief</hi> joyned with <hi>Pleasure</hi> conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44255:34"/>
in the Imagination of some <hi>ill</hi> Fortune that may befall him.</p>
            <p n="13">13. There is a Passion that hath <hi>no Name</hi>; but the Sign of it is that Distortion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance which we call <hi>Laughter,</hi> which is always <hi>Joy:</hi> but what joy, what we think, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we triumph when we laugh, is not hitherto declared by any. That it consisteth in <hi>Wit,</hi> or, as they call it, in the <hi>Jest,</hi> Experience <hi>confuteth</hi>: for Men laugh at Mischances and Indecencies, wherein there lieth no Wit nor jest at all. And forasmuch as the same Thing is no more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous when it groweth stale or usual, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be that moveth Laughter, it must be <hi>new</hi> and <hi>unexpected.</hi> Men laugh often (especially such as are greedy of Applause from every Thing they do well) at their <hi>own</hi> Actions perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed never so little beyond their own Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as also at their own <hi>Jests:</hi> And in this Case it is manifest, that the Passion of Laughter proceedeth from a <hi>sudden conception</hi> of some <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in himself that laugheth. Also Men laugh at the <hi>Infirmities</hi> of others, by Comparison where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with their own Abilities are set off and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated. Also Men laugh at <hi>Jests,</hi> the <hi>Wit</hi> whereof always consisteth in the elegant <hi>Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering</hi> and Conveying to our minds some <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity</hi> of <hi>another:</hi> And in this case also the Passion of Laughter proceedeth from the <hi>sudden</hi> Imagination of our own Oddes and Eminency: for what is else the Recommending of our selves to our own good Opinion, by Comparison with another Mans Infirmity or absurdity? For when a Jest is broken upon our selves, or
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44255:34"/>
Friends of whose Dishonour we participate, we never laugh thereat. I may therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Passion of Laughter is nothing else but <hi>sudden Glory</hi> arising from some sudden <hi>Conception</hi> of some <hi>Eminency</hi> in our selves, by <hi>Comparison</hi> with the <hi>Infirmity</hi> of others, or with our own formerly: for Men laugh at the follies of themselves past, when they come suddenly to Remembrance, except they bring with them any present Dishonour. It is no wonder therefore that Men take hainously to be laughed at or derided, that is, triumphed over. Laughing <hi>without Offence,</hi> must be at <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities</hi> and Infirmities <hi>abstracted</hi> from Persons, and when all the Company may laugh together: for, laughing to ones self putteth all the rest into Jealousie, and Examination of themselves. Besides, it is Vain-Glory, and an Argument of little Worth, to think the Infirmity of another, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Matter for his Triumph.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The Passion opposite hereunto, (whose Signs are another Distortion of the Face with Tears) called <hi>Weeping,</hi> is the <hi>sudden Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out with</hi> our selves, or sudden Conception of Defect; and therefore <hi>Children</hi> weep often: for seeing they think that every Thing ought to be given them which they desire, of Necessity every Repulse must be a Check of their Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and puts them in mind of their too much Weakness to make themselves Masters of all they look for. For the same Cause <hi>Women</hi> are more apt to weep than men, as being not only more accustomed to have their Wills, but also to measure their Powers by the Power and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44255:35"/>
Love of others that protect them. Men are apt to weep that prosecute Revenge, when the Revenge is suddenly stopt or frustrated by the Repentance of their Adversary; and such are the Tears of <hi>Reconciliation.</hi> Also revengeful Men are subject to this Passion upon the beholding those Men they pity, and suddenly remember they cannot help. Other weeping in Men proceedeth for the most part from the same Cause it proceedeth from in Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The Appetite which Men call <hi>Lust,</hi> and the Fruition that appertaineth thereunto, is a <hi>Sensual</hi> Pleasure, but <hi>not only</hi> that; there is in it also a Delight of the Mind: for it consisteth of two Appetites together, to <hi>please,</hi> and to <hi>be pleased</hi>; and the Delight Men take in delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is not sensual, but a Pleasure or joy of the Mind consisting in the Imagination of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they have so much to please. But the Name <hi>Lust</hi> is used where it is condemned; otherwise it is called by the general Word <hi>Love</hi>: for the Passion is one and the same indefinite Desire of different Sex, as natural as Hunger.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Of <hi>Love,</hi> by which is understood the Joy Man taketh in the Fruition of any <hi>present</hi> Good, hath been already spoken of in the first Section, Chap. 7. under which is contained the <hi>Love</hi> Men bear to one <hi>another,</hi> or Pleasure they take in one anothers Company; and by which Nature, Men are said to be sociable. But there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kind of Love, which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and is that which we mean, when we say that a Man is in Love: Forasmuch as this Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44255:35"/>
cannot be without Diversity of Sex, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied but that it <hi>participateth</hi> of that indefinite <hi>Love</hi> mentioned in the former Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But there is a great Difference betwixt the Desire of a Man <hi>indefinite,</hi> and the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire <hi>limited ad hunc</hi>; and this is that <hi>Love</hi> which is the great Theme of Poets: But notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Praises, it must be defined by the Word <hi>Need</hi>: for it is a Conception a Man hath of his Need of <hi>that one Person</hi> desired. The Cause of this Passion is <hi>not</hi> always <hi>nor</hi> for the most part <hi>Beauty,</hi> or other Quality in the Beloved, unless there be withall <hi>Hope</hi> in the Person that loveth: which may be gathered from this, that in great Difference of Persons, the <hi>greater</hi> have often faln in love with the <hi>meaner</hi>; but not contrary. And from hence it is, that for the most part they have much better Fortune in Love, whose Hopes are built upon something <hi>in their Person,</hi> than those that trust to their <hi>Expressions</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>; and they that <hi>care less,</hi> than they that <hi>care more</hi>: which not perceiving, many Men cast away their Services, as one Arrow after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till, in the End, together with their Hopes, they lose their Wits.</p>
            <p n="17">17. There is yet another Passion sometimes called <hi>Love,</hi> but more properly <hi>good Will</hi> or <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> There can be no greater Argument to a Man, of his own Power, than to find himself able not only to accomplish his own Desires, but also to <hi>assist</hi> other Men in theirs: and this is that Conception wherein consisteth <hi>Charity.</hi> In which, first, is contained that <hi>natural Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Parents to their Children, which the <hi>Greeks</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:44255:36"/>
call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>also,</hi> that Affection wherewith Men seek to <hi>assist</hi> those that adhere unto them. But the Affection wherewith Men many times bestow their Benefits on <hi>Strangers,</hi> is not to be called Charity, but either <hi>Contract,</hi> whereby they seek to purchase friendship; or <hi>Fear,</hi> which maketh them to purchase peace. The Opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> concerning honourable Love, delivered according to his Custom in the Person of <hi>Socrates,</hi> in the Dialogue intituled <hi>Convivium,</hi> is this, That a Man full and pregnant with Wisdom and other Vertues, naturally seeketh out some beautiful Person, of Age and Capacity to conceive, in whom he may, without sensual Respects, ingender and produce the like. And this is the <hi>Idea</hi> of the then noted <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Socrates</hi> wise and continent, to <hi>Alcibiades</hi> young and beautiful: In which, Love is not the sought Honour, but the Issue of his Knowledge; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the common Love, to which though Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue sometimes follows, yet Men seek not that, but to please, and to be pleased. It should be therefore this Charity, or Desire to assist and advance others. But why then should the Wise seek the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or be more charitable to the Beautiful than to others? There is something in it savouring of the Use of that time: in which Matter though <hi>Socrates</hi> be acknowledged for continent, yet the <hi>Continent</hi> have the Passion they <hi>contain,</hi> as <hi>much</hi> and more than they that <hi>satiate</hi> the Appetite; which maketh me suspect this <hi>Platonick</hi> Love for meerly sensual; but with an honourable Pretence for the Old to haunt the Company of the young and beautiful.</p>
            <p n="18">
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:44255:36"/>18. Forasmuch as all <hi>Knowledge</hi> beginneth from <hi>Experience,</hi> therefore also <hi>new Experience</hi> is the Beginning of <hi>new Knowledge,</hi> and the Increase of Experience the Beginning of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Knowledge. Whatsoever therefore happeneth new to a Man, giveth him Matter of <hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>knowing</hi> somewhat that he knew <hi>not before.</hi> And this Hope and Expectation of future Knowledge from any Thing that happeneth new and strange, is that Passion which we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call <hi>Admiration</hi>; and the same considered as Appetite, is called <hi>Curiosity,</hi> which is Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of Knowledge. As in the discerning of Faculties, <hi>Man leaveth</hi> all Community with <hi>Beasts</hi> at the Faculty of <hi>imposing Names</hi>; so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so doth he surmount their Nature at this <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of <hi>Curiosity.</hi> For when a Beast seeth any Thing new and strange to him, he considereth it so far only as to discern whether it be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to serve his turn, or hurt him, and accordingly approacheth nearer to it, or fleeth from it: Whereas Man, who in most Events remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in what manner they were caused and begun, looketh for the Cause and Beginning of every Thing that ariseth new unto him. And from this Passion of Admiration and Curiosity, have ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen not only the Invention of Names, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Supposition of such Causes of all Things as they thought might produce them. And from this Beginning is derived all <hi>Philosophy</hi>; as <hi>Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> from the Admiration of the Course of Heaven; <hi>Natural Philosophy</hi> from the strange Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Elments and other Bodies. And from the Degrees of Curiosity, proceed also the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44255:37"/>
Degrees of Knowledge amongst Men: For, to a Man in the Chace of Riches or Authority,) which in Respect of Knowledge are but Sensuality) it is a Diversity of little Pleasure, whether it be the Motion of the Sun or the Earth that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Day, or to enter into other Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of any strange Accident, than whether it conduce or not to the End he pursueth. Because <hi>Curiosity</hi> is <hi>Delight,</hi> therefore also <hi>Novelty</hi> is so, but especially that Novelty from which a Man conceiveth an <hi>Opinion</hi> true or false of <hi>bettering</hi> his own Estate; for, in such Case, they stand affected with the Hope that all Gamesters have while the Cards are shuffling.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Divers other Passions there be, but they want Names: whereof some nevertheless have been by most Men observed: For Example; from what Passion proceedeth it, that Men take <hi>pleasure</hi> to <hi>behold</hi> from the Shore the <hi>Danger</hi> of them that are at Sea in a Tempest, or in Fight, or from a safe Castle to behold two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies charge one to another in the Field? It is certainly, in the whole Summ, <hi>Joy</hi>; else Men would never flock to such a Spectacle. Nevertheless there is in it both <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi>: for as there is Novelty and Remembrance of our own Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty present, which is <hi>Delight</hi>: so there is also <hi>Pity,</hi> which is Grief: But the Delight is so far predominant, that Men usually are content in such a Case to be Spectators of the Misery of their Friends.</p>
            <p n="20">20. <hi>Magnanimity</hi> is no more than <hi>Glory,</hi> of the which I have spoken in the first Section; but <hi>Glory well grounded</hi> upon certain Experience of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44255:37"/>
a Power sufficient to attain his End in open Manner. And <hi>Pusillanimity</hi> is the <hi>Doubt</hi> of that. Whatsoever therefore is a Sign of <hi>Vain Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the same is also a Sign of <hi>Pusillanimity</hi>: for sufficient Power maketh Glory a Spur to ones End. To be <hi>pleased</hi> or <hi>displeased</hi> with <hi>Fame true</hi> or <hi>false,</hi> is a <hi>Sign</hi> of that same, because he that relieth on Fame hath not his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in his own Power. Likewise <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy</hi> are Signs of Pusillanimity, because they depend not upon our own Power, but the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of others. Also <hi>Proneness</hi> to <hi>Anger,</hi> because it argueth Difficulty of proceeding. Also <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation</hi> of <hi>Ancestors,</hi> because all Men are more inclined to make shew of their own Power when they have it, than of anothers. To be at <hi>Enmity</hi> and Contention with <hi>Inferiours,</hi> is a Sign of the same, because it proceedeth from Want of Power to end the War. To <hi>laugh</hi> at others, because it is an Affectation of Glory from other Mens Infirmities, and not from any Ability of their own. Also <hi>Irresolution,</hi> which proceedeth from Want of power enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the little Difficulties that make Deliberations hard.</p>
            <p n="21">21. The Comparison of the Life of Man to a Race, though it hold not in every Part, yet it holdeth so well for this our Purpose, that we may thereby both see and remember almost all the Passions before mentioned. But this <hi>Race</hi> we must suppose to have no other <hi>Goal,</hi> nor other <hi>Garland,</hi> but being formost, and in it</p>

            <head>CHAP. X.</head>
            <p n="1">1. HAving shewed in the precedent Chapters, that Sense proceedeth from the Action of external Objects upon the <hi>Brain,</hi> or some inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Head</hi>; and that the <hi>Passions</hi> proceed from the Alteration there made, and continued to the <hi>Heart</hi>: It is consequent in the next Place, seeing the Diversity of Degrees in Knowlege in divers Men, to be greater than may be ascribed to the divers <hi>Tempers</hi> of their Brain, to declare <hi>what other Causes</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce such <hi>Oddes,</hi> and Excess of <hi>Capacity,</hi> as we daily observe in one Man above another. As for that Difference which ariseth from <hi>Sickness,</hi> and such accidental Distempers, I omit the same, as impertinent to this Place, and consider, it only in such as have their <hi>Health,</hi> and <hi>Organs</hi> well disposed. If the Difference were in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Temper of the Brain, I can imagin no Reason why the same should not appear first and most of all in the Senses, which being equal both in the wise and less wise, infer an equal Temper in the common Organ (namely the Brain) of all the Senses.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But we see by Experience, that <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi> proceed <hi>not</hi> in <hi>all</hi> Men from the <hi>same Causes,</hi> and that men differ very much in the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44255:39"/>
of the Body; whereby, that which helpeth and furthereth <hi>vital Constitution</hi> in one, and is therefore delightful, hindereth it and crosseth it in another, and therefore causeth Grief. The <hi>Difference</hi> therefore of <hi>Wits</hi> hath its Original <hi>from</hi> the <hi>different Passions,</hi> and from the <hi>Ends</hi> to which the Appetite leadeth them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And first, those Men whose Ends are <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual</hi> Delight, and generally are addicted to <hi>Ease, Food, Onerations</hi> and <hi>Exonerations</hi> of the Body, must needs be the <hi>less</hi> thereby delighted with those <hi>Imaginations</hi> that <hi>conduce not</hi> to those Ends, such as are Imaginations of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> which, as I have said before, have Respect to the future: For Sensuality consisteth in the Pleasure of the Senses, which please only for the present, and take away the Inclination to observe such Things as conduce to Honour, and consequently maketh Men less curious, and less ambitious, whereby they less consider the Way either to Knowledge or other Power: in which two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth all the Excellency of Power cognitive. And this is it which Men call <hi>Dulness,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the Appetite of sensual or bodily Delight. And it may well be conjectured, that such Passion hath its Beginning from a <hi>Grossness</hi> and <hi>Difficulty</hi> of the <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> about the <hi>Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Contrary hereunto, is that <hi>quick Range<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of Mind described, Chap. 4. Sect. 3. which is joyned with <hi>Curiosity</hi> of comparing the Things that come into the Mind, one with another: in which Comparison, a Man delighteth himself either with finding unexpected <hi>Similitude</hi> of Things, otherwise much unlike, in which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44255:39"/>
Men place the Excellency of <hi>Fancy,</hi> and from whence proceed those grateful Similies, Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors, and other Tropes, by which both <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Orators</hi> have it in their Power to make Things please or displease, and shew well or ill to others, as they like themselves; or else in discerning suddenly <hi>Dissimilitude</hi> in Things that otherwise ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the same. And this Vertue of the Mind is that by which Men attain to exact and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Knowledge</hi>; and the Pleasure thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in continual Instruction, and in Distinction of Places, Persons, and Seasons, and is commonly termed by the Name of <hi>Judgement</hi>: for, to judge is nothing else, but to distinguish or discern: And both <hi>Fancy</hi> and <hi>Judgement</hi> are commonly comprehended under the Name of <hi>Wit,</hi> which seemeth to be a Tenuity and Agility of Spirits, contrary to that Restiness of the Spirits suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in those that are dull.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is another Defect of the Mind, which Men call <hi>Levity,</hi> which betrayeth also <hi>Mobility</hi> in the Spirits, but in Excess. An Example where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is in them that in the midst of any serious Discourse, have their Minds diverted to every little Jest or witty Observation; which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them depart from their Discourse by a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis, and from that Parenthesis by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till at length they either lose themselves, or make their Narration like a Dream, or some studied Nonsence. The Passion from whence this proceedeth, is <hi>Curiosity,</hi> but with <hi>too much E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality</hi> and Indifference: for when all Things make equal Impression and Delight, they equally throng to be expressed.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:44255:40"/>6. The Vertue opposite to this Defect, is <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> or Steadiness; in which the End being the great and Master-Delight, directeth and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Way thereto all other Thoughts.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The <hi>Extremity</hi> of Dulness is that <hi>natural Folly</hi> which may be called <hi>Stolidity</hi>: But the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream of <hi>Levity,</hi> though it be natural Folly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the other, and obvious to every Mans Observation, I know <hi>not</hi> how to call it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. There is a Fault of the Mind called by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is <hi>Indocibility,</hi> or <hi>Difficulty</hi> of being taught; the which must needs arise from a <hi>false Opinion</hi> that they <hi>know already</hi> the Truth of that is called in question: for certainly Men are not otherwise so unequal in capacity as the <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> is unequal between what is taught by the Mathematicians, and what is commonly discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of in other Books: and therefore if the Minds of Men were all of white Paper, they would all most equally be disposed to acknowledge whatsoever should be in right Method, and by right Ratiocination delivered to them: But when Men have once acquiesced in untrue Opinions, and registred them as Authentical Records in their Minds, it is no less impossible to speak intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to such Men, than to write legibly upon a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per already scribled over. The immediate <hi>Cause</hi> therefore of <hi>Indocibility,</hi> is <hi>Prejudice</hi>; and of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, false Opinion of our own Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Another, and a principal Defect of the Mind, is that which Men call <hi>Madness,</hi> which appeareth to be nothing else but some <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of some such <hi>Predominancy</hi> above the <hi>rest,</hi> that we have <hi>no Passion but from it</hi>; and this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44255:40"/>
Conception is nothing else but excessive <hi>vain Glory,</hi> or <hi>vain Dejection</hi>: which is most propable by these Examples following, which proceed in Appearance every one of them from <hi>Pride,</hi> or some <hi>Dejection</hi> of Mind. As first, we have had the Example of one that preached in <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side</hi> from a Cart there, instead of a Pulpit, that he himself was Christ, which was <hi>spiritual</hi> Pride or Madness. We have had also divers Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Learned Madness, in which Men have manifestly been distracted upon any Occasion that hath put them in Remembrance of their own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. Amongst the learned Men, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred (I think also) those that determine of the Time of the Worlds End, and other such the Points of Prophecy. And the gallant Madness of <hi>Don Quixotte</hi> is nothing else but an Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of such Height of vain Glory as reading of <hi>Romance</hi> may produce in pusillanimous Men. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Rage and Madness of Love, are but great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignations of them in whose Brains is predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant Contempt from their Enemies, or their Mistresses. And the <hi>Pride</hi> taken in <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,</hi> hath made divers Men run mad, and to be so accounted, under the Name of Fantastick.</p>

            <p n="1">1. HItherto of the Knowledge of Things <hi>natural</hi> and of the Passions that arise naturally from them. Now forasmuch as we give Names not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Things natural, but also to <hi>supernatural</hi>; and by all Names we ought to have some Meaning and Conception: It followeth in the next Place, to consider what Thoughts and Imaginations of the Mind we have, when we take into our Mouths the most blessed Name of GOD, and the Names of those <hi>Vertues</hi> we attribute unto him; as also, what <hi>Image</hi> cometh into the Mind at hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Name of <hi>Spirit,</hi> or the Name of <hi>Angel,</hi> good or bad.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And forasmuch as God Almighty is <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible,</hi> it followeth, that we can have <hi>no</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> and consequently, all <hi>his Attributes</hi> signifie our <hi>Inability</hi> and Defect of Power to <hi>conceive</hi> any Thing concerning his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not any Conception of the same, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only this, That <hi>there is a God</hi>: For the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects we acknowledge naturally, do include a Power of their producing, before they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; and that Power presupposeth something existent that hath such Power: And the Thing so existing with Power to produce, if it were not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, must needs have been produced by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what before it, and that again by something else be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, till we come to an Eternal (that is to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44255:42"/>
say, the first) Power of all Powers, and first Cause of all Causes: And this is it which all Men conceive by the Name of GOD, implying Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Incomprehensibility, and Omnipotency. And thus all that will consider, may know <hi>that</hi> God is, though not <hi>what</hi> he is: even a Man that is born blind, though it be not possible for him to have any Imagination what Kind of thing Fire is; yet he cannot but know that somewhat there is that Men call Fire, because it warmeth him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And whereas we attribute to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, <hi>Seeing, Hearing, Speaking, Knowing, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> and the like, by which Names we understand something in <hi>Men</hi> to whom we attribute them, we understand <hi>nothing</hi> by them in the Nature of God: For, as it is well reasoned, <hi>Shall not the God that made the Eye, see; and the Ear, hear</hi>? So it is also, if we say, Shall God, which made the Eye, not see without the Eye; or that made the Ear, not hear without the Ear; or that made the Brain, not know without the Brain; or that made the Heart, not love with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Heart? The <hi>Attributes</hi> therefore given unto the <hi>Deity,</hi> are such as <hi>signifie</hi> either <hi>our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity</hi> or our <hi>Reverence</hi>: Our Incapacity, when we say Incomprehensible and Infinite; our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, when we give him those Names, which amongst us are the Names of those Things we most magnifie and commend, as Omnipotent, Omniscient, Just, Merciful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when God Almighty giveth those Names to himself in the Scriptures, it is but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is to say, by descending to our Manner of speaking; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we are not capable of understanding him.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:44255:42"/>4. By the Name of <hi>Spirit,</hi> we understand a <hi>Body natural,</hi> but of such <hi>Subtilty,</hi> that it worketh not upon the Senses; but that filleth up the Place which the Image of a visible Body might fill up. Our Conception therefore of Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of <hi>Figure without Colour</hi>; and in Figure is understood Dimension, and consequently, to conceive a Spirit, is to conceive something that hath Dimension. But <hi>Spirits supernatural</hi> commonly signifie some <hi>Substance without</hi> Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; which two Words do flatly contradict one another: and therefore when we attribute the Name of Spirit unto God, we attribute it not as the Name of any Thing we conceive, no more than we ascribe unto him Sense and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but, as a Signification of our Reverence, we desire to abstract from him all corporal Gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Concerning other Things, which some Men call <hi>Spirits incorporeal,</hi> and some <hi>corporeal,</hi> it is not <hi>possible</hi> by <hi>natural</hi> Means only, to come to <hi>Knowledge</hi> of so much, as that <hi>there are such</hi> Things. We that are Christians <hi>acknowledge</hi> that there be Angels good and evil, and that there are Spirits, and that the Soul of Man is a Spirit, and that those Spirits are immortal: <hi>but,</hi> to <hi>know</hi> it, that is to say, to have natural Evidence of the same, it is <hi>impossible</hi>: For, all <hi>Evidence</hi> is <hi>Conception,</hi> as it is said, Chap. 6. Sect. 3. and all Conception is <hi>Imagination,</hi> and proceedeth from <hi>Sense,</hi> Chap. 3. Sect. 1. And <hi>Spirits</hi> we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be those Substances which work <hi>not</hi> upon the <hi>Sense</hi>; and therefore not conceptible. But though the Scripture acknowledge Spirits,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44255:43"/>
yet doth it no where say, that they are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, meaning thereby, without Dimension and Quality: Nor, I think, is that Word Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal at all in the Bible; but it is said of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that it abideth in Men; sometimes that it dwelleth in them, sometimes that it cometh on them, that it descendeth, and goeth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and that Spirits are Angels, that is to say, Messengers: all which Words do imply <hi>Locality</hi>; and Locality is <hi>Dimension</hi>; and whatsoever hath Dimension, is <hi>Body,</hi> be it never so subtil. To me therefore it seemeth, that the Scripture fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth them more, who hold Angels and Spirits corporeal, than them that hold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And it is a plain <hi>Contradiction</hi> in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Discourse, to say of the Soul of Man, that it is <hi>tota in toto, &amp; tota in qualibet Parte Corporis,</hi> grounded neither upon Reason nor Revelation, but proceeding from the Ignorance of what those Things are which are called <hi>Spectra,</hi> Images, that appear in the dark to Children, and such as have strong Fears, and other strange Imaginations, as hath been said, Chap. 3. Sect. 5. where I call them Phantasms: For, taking them to be Things real, without us, like Bodies, and seeing them to come and vanish so strangely as they do, unlike to Bodies; what could they call them else, but <hi>incorporeal Bodies</hi>? which is not a Name, but an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity of Speech.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is true, that the Heathens, and all Nations of the World, have acknowledged that there be <hi>Spirits,</hi> which for the most part they hold to be incorporeal; whereby it might be thought, that a Man by natural Reason, may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44255:43"/>
without the Scriptures, to the Knowledge of this, <hi>That Spirits are</hi>: But the erroneous Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereof by the Heathens, may proceed, as I have said before, from the Ignorance of the Cause of Ghosts and Phantasms, and such other Apparitions. And from thence had the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans their Number of Gods, their Number of <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> good or bad, and for every Man his <hi>Genius</hi>; which is not the Acknowledging of this Truth, <hi>That Spirits are</hi>; but a false Opinion concerning the Force of Imagination.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And seeing the <hi>Knowledge</hi> we have of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> is <hi>not natural</hi> Knowledge, but <hi>Faith</hi> from supernatural Revelation given to the holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Scriptures; it followeth, that of Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations also, which is the Operation of Spirit in us, the Knowledge which we have, must all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Scripture. The <hi>Signs</hi> there set down of <hi>Inspiration,</hi> are <hi>Miracles,</hi> when they be great, and manifestly above the Power of Men to do by Imposture: As for Example, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of <hi>Elias</hi> was known by the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Burning of the Sacrifice. But the <hi>Signs</hi> to <hi>distinguish</hi> whether a <hi>Spirit</hi> be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> are the same by which we distinguish whether a Man or a Tree be good or evil, namely, <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Fruit</hi>: For there are <hi>lying</hi> Spirits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Men are inspired sometimes, as well as with <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi> And we are commanded in Scripture, to judge of the Spirits by their Doctrine, and not of the Doctrine by the Spirits. For Miracles, our Saviour hath forbidden us to rule our Faith by them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Though an Angel from Heaven
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44255:44"/>
preach to you otherwise,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>let him be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi> Where it is plain, that we are not to judge whether the Doctrine be true or not, by the Angel; but whether the Angel say true or no, by the Doctrine. So likewise, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Believe not every Spirit: for false Prophets are gone out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World.</hi> Vers. 2. <hi>Hereby shall ye know the Spirit of God.</hi> Vers. 3. <hi>Every Spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the Flesh, is not of God: and this is the Spirit of Antichrist.</hi> Vers. 15. <hi>Whosoever confesseth that Jesus is the Son of God, in him dwelleth God, and he in God.</hi> The <hi>Knowledge</hi> therefore we have of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> Inspiration, cometh <hi>not</hi> by <hi>Vision</hi> of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel that may teach it, <hi>nor</hi> by a <hi>Miracle</hi> that may seem to confirm it; <hi>but</hi> by <hi>Conformity</hi> of Doctrine with this Article and Fundamental Point of Christian Faith, which also Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith is the sole Foundation, <hi>That Jesus Christ is come in the Flesh,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.11</p>
            <p n="8">8. But if <hi>Inspiration</hi> be discerned by <hi>this</hi> Point, and <hi>this</hi> Point be acknowledged and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures; How</hi> (may some Men ask) know we that the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture deserveth</hi> so great <hi>Authority,</hi> which must be no less than that of the lively Voice of God; that is, how we know the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God?</hi> And first, it is manifest, that if by Knowledge we understand Science infallible and natural, as is defined, Chap. 6. Sect. 4. proceeding from Sense, we cannot be said to know it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it proceedeth not from the Conceptions ingendered by Sense. And if we understand Knowledge as supernatural, we cannot have it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44255:44"/>
but by Inspiration: And of that <hi>Inspiration</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge, but by the <hi>Doctrine</hi>: It followeth, that we have not any Way, natural or supernatural, of the <hi>Knowledge</hi> thereof, which can properly be called <hi>Infallible Science</hi> and <hi>Evidence.</hi> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, that the Knowledge that we have that the Scriptures are the Word of God, is only <hi>Faith,</hi> which Faith therefore is also by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> defined, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. to be <hi>the Evidence of Things not seen</hi>; that is to say, not otherwise e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident but by Faith: for, whatsoever either is evident by Natural Reason, or Revelation super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, is not called Faith; else should not Faith cease, no more than Charity, when we are in Heaven; which is contrary to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Scripture. And, we are <hi>not</hi> said to <hi>believe, but</hi> to <hi>know</hi> those Things that be <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Seeing then the Acknowledgment of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be the Word of God, is not Evidence, but Faith, and Faith (Chap. 6. Sect. 7.) consisteth in the Trust we have of other Men, it appeareth plain, that the Men so trusted, are the holy Men of Gods Church succeeding one another from the Time of those that saw the wondrous Works of God Almighty in the Flesh. Nor doth this imply that God is not the Worker or Efficient Cause of Faith, or that Faith is begotten in Man without the Spirit of God: for, all those good Opinions which we admit and believe, though they proceed from Hearing, and Hearing from Teaching, both which are natural, yet they are the Work of God: for, all the Works of Nature are his, and they are attributed to the Spirit of God: As
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44255:45"/>
for Example, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.3. <hi>Thou shalt speak unto all cunning Men, whom I have filled with the SPIRIT of Wisdom, that they may make Aaron's Garments for his Consecration, that he may serve me in the Priests Office.</hi> Faith therefore wherewith we believe, is the Work of the Spirit of God in that Sense, by which the Spirit of God giveth to one Man Wisdom and cunning in Workmanship more than another, and by which he effecteth also in other Points pertaining to our ordinary Life; that one Man believeth that, which, upon the same Grounds, another doth not; and one Man reverenceth the Opinion, and obeyeth the Commands of his Superiour, and others not.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And seeing our Faith, that the Scriptures are the Word of God, began from the Confidence and Trust we repose in the <hi>Church</hi>; there can be no Doubt but that their <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the same Scriptures (when any Doubt or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie shall arise, by which this Fundamental Point, <hi>That Jesus Christ is come in the Flesh,</hi> may be called in question) is <hi>safer</hi> for any Man to trust to, than his <hi>own,</hi> whether <hi>Reasoning</hi> or <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> that is to say, his own <hi>Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. Now concerning Mens <hi>Affections</hi> to <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> they are not the same always that are described in the Chapter concerning Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons There, for to love, is to be delighted with the Image or Conception of the Thing loved; but God is unconceivable: <hi>To love God</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the Scripture, is to <hi>obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> and to <hi>love one another.</hi> Also to <hi>trust God,</hi> is different from our <hi>trusting</hi> one <hi>another</hi>:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44255:45"/>
for, when a Man trusteth a Man, (Chap. 9. Sect. 8.) he layeth aside his own Endeavours: but if we do so in our Trust to God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we disobey him; and how shall we trust to him whom we know we disobey? To <hi>trust</hi> to <hi>God Almighty</hi> therefore, is to <hi>referr</hi> to his <hi>good Pleasure</hi> all that is <hi>above our</hi> own Power to effect: and this is <hi>all one</hi> with <hi>Acknowledging one</hi> only God, which is the first Commandment. And to trust <hi>in Christ,</hi> is no more but to acknowledge him for God; which is the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Article of our Christian Faith: And consequently, to trust, rely, or, as some express it, to cast and roll our selves on Christ, is the same Thing with the Fundamental Point of Faith, namely, that <hi>Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. To <hi>honour</hi> God internally in the Heart, is the same Thing with that we ordinarily call Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour amongst Men: for it is nothing but the <hi>Acknowledging</hi> of his <hi>Power</hi>; and the Signs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the same with the Signs of the Honour due to our Superiours, mentioned Chap. 8. Sect. 6. <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>praise,</hi> to <hi>magnifie,</hi> to <hi>bless</hi>; to pray to him, to thank him, to give Oblations and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to him, to give Attention to his Word, to speak to him in Prayer with Consideration, to come into his Presence with humble Gesture, and in decent Manner, and to adorn his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with Magnificence and Cost: and these are natural Signs of our honouring him internally: And therefore the Contrary hereof, To neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect prayer, to speak to him <hi>extempore,</hi> to come to Church slovenly, to adorn the Place of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44255:46"/>
worse than our own Houses, to take up his Name in every idle Discourse, are the manifest Signs of Contempt of the Divine Majesty. There be other Signs which are arbitrary; as, to be unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, (as we be here); to put off their Shooes, as <hi>Moses</hi> at the fiery Bush, and some other of that Kind, which in their own Nature are indifferent, till, to avoid Indecency and Discord, it be otherwise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by common Consent.</p>

            <p n="1">1. IT hath been declared already, how <hi>external</hi> Objects cause <hi>Conceptions,</hi> and Conceptions, <hi>Appetite</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> which are the <hi>first unperceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beginnings of our Actions:</hi> for <hi>either</hi> the Actions immediately follow the first Appetite, as when we do any Thing upon a sudden; <hi>or else</hi> to our first Appetite there succeedeth some Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Evil to happen to us by such Actions, which is Fear, and which holdeth us from proceeding. And to that Fear may succeed a new Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and to that Appetite another Fear alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, till the Action be either done, or some Accident come between, to make it impossible; and so this alternate Appetite and Fear ceaseth. This <hi>alternate Succession of Appetite and Fear</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the time the Action is in our Power to do or not to do, is that we call <hi>Deliberation</hi>; which Name hath been given it for that Part of the Definition wherein it is said that it last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth so long as the Action, whereof we deliberate, is in our Power: for, so long we have Liberty to do or not to do; and Deliberation signifieth a Taking away of our own Liberty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Deliberation</hi> therefore requireth in the Action deliberated <hi>two Conditions</hi>; one, that it be <hi>future</hi>; the other, that there be <hi>Hope</hi> of doing it, or possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of not doing it; for, <hi>Appetite</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> are <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations</hi> of the future; and there is no Expectation

of Good, without Hope; or of Evil, without Possibility: of <hi>Necessaries</hi> therefore there is <hi>no Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration.</hi> In Deliberation, the last Appetite, as also the last Fear, is called <hi>Will, viz.</hi> the last Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, Will to do, or Will to omit. It is all one therefore to say <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>last Will</hi>: for, though a Man express his present Inclination and Appetite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the disposing of his Goods, by Words or Writing; yet shall it not be counted his Will, because he hath still Liberty to dispose of them other ways: but when Death taketh away that Liberty, then it is his Will.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Voluntary</hi> Actions and Omissions are such as have Beginning in the <hi>Will</hi>; all other are <hi>involuntary,</hi> or <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <hi>voluntary,</hi> such as a Man doth upon Appetite or Fear; <hi>involuntary,</hi> such as he doth by Necessity of Nature, as when he is pushed, or falleth, and thereby doth Good or hurt to another: <hi>mixt,</hi> such as participate of both; as when a Man is carried to Prison, Going is voluntary, to the Prison, is involuntary: The Example of him that throweth his Goods out of a Ship into the Sea, to save his Person, is of an Action altogether volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for, there is nothing therein involuntary, but the Hardness of the Choice, which is not his Action, but the Action of the Winds: what he himself doth, is no more against his Will, than to flee from Danger is against the Will of him that seeth no other Means to preserve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Voluntary</hi> also are the Actions that proceed from sudden <hi>Anger,</hi> or <hi>other</hi> sudden <hi>Appetite</hi> in such Men as can discern Good or Evil: for, in them the Time precedent <hi>is</hi> to be judged Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44255:48"/>
for then also he deliberateth in what Cases it is good to <hi>strike,</hi> deride, or do any other Action proceeding from Anger or other such sudden Passion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Appetite, Fear, Hope,</hi> and the rest of the Passions are <hi>not</hi> called <hi>voluntary</hi>; for they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>not from, but are the Will,</hi> and the Will is not voluntary: for, a Man can no more say he will will, than he will will will, and so make an infinite Repetition of the Word [<hi>will</hi>]; which is absurd, and insignificant.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Forasmuch as <hi>Will to do</hi> is <hi>Appetite,</hi> and <hi>Will to omit, Fear</hi>; the <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>Appetite</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> is the <hi>Cause</hi> also of our <hi>Will</hi>: But the propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Benefits and of Harms, that is to say, of Reward and Punishment, is the Cause of our Appetite, and of our Fears, and therefore also of our Wills, so far forth as we believe that such Rewards and Benefits as are propounded, shall arrive unto us; and consequently, our <hi>Wills</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our <hi>Opinions,</hi> as our <hi>Actions</hi> follow our <hi>Wills</hi>; in which Sense they say truly, and properly, that say the World is governed by Opinion.</p>
            <p n="7">7.

               </hi>; it will fall fitly into <hi>this</hi> Chapter, to speak of the Effects of the same Power <hi>one upon another</hi>; which Effects are also the Signs, by which one taketh notice what another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth and intendeth. Of these Signs, <hi>some</hi> are such as <hi>cannot</hi> easily be <hi>counterfeited</hi>; as Actions and Gestures, especially if they be sudden, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have mentioned some; (for Example, look in Chap. 9.) with the several Passions whereof they are Signs: <hi>Others</hi> there are which <hi>may</hi> be <hi>counterfeited</hi>; and those are <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Speech</hi>; of the Use and Effects whereof, I am to speak in this Place.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The first Use of Language, is the <hi>expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of our <hi>Conceptions,</hi> that is, the begetting in one another the same Conceptions that we have in our selves; and this is called <hi>Teaching</hi>; wherein, if the <hi>Conception</hi> of him that teacheth continually accompany his Words, <hi>beginning</hi> at something true in <hi>Experience,</hi> then it begetteth the like Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Hearer that understandeth them, and maketh him to <hi>know</hi> something, which he is therefore said to <hi>learn</hi>: but if there be <hi>not such Evidence,</hi> then such teaching is called <hi>Perswasion,</hi> and begetteth no more in the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44255:50"/>
than what is in the Speakers bare <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And the <hi>Signs</hi> of two Opinions contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory one to another; namely, <hi>Affirmation</hi> and <hi>Negation</hi> of the same Thing, is called <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi>: but <hi>both Affirmations,</hi> or <hi>both Negations, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>infallible</hi> Sign of <hi>teaching exactly,</hi> and without errour, is this, that <hi>no Man</hi> hath <hi>ever taught</hi> the <hi>Contrary:</hi> Not that few, how few soever, if any; for commonly Truth is on the side of a few, rather than of the Multitude: But when in Opinions and Questions considered and discussed by many, it happeneth that not any one of the Men that so discuss'd them differ from another, then it may be justly inferred, they know what they teach, and that otherwise they do not. And this appears most manifestly to them that have considered the divers Subjects wherein they have exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their Pens, and the divers Ways in which they have proceeded, together with the Diversity of the Success thereof: for, those Men who have taken in hand to consider nothing else but the Comparison of <hi>Magnitudes, Numbers, Times,</hi> and <hi>Motions,</hi> and how their Proportions are to one another, have thereby been the Authors of all those Excellencies by which we differ from such savage People as now inhabit divers places in <hi>America</hi>; and as have been the Inhabitants here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore of those Countries where at this day Arts and Sciences do most flourish: for, from the Studies of these Men, have proceeded whatsoever cometh to us for Ornament by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,</hi> and whatsoever we have beneficial
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44255:50"/>
to humane Society by the <hi>Division, Distinction,</hi> and <hi>Portraicting the Face of the Earth</hi>; whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever also we have by the <hi>Account of Times,</hi> and <hi>Foresight of the Course of Heaven</hi>; whatsoever by <hi>Measuring Distances, Plains,</hi> and <hi>Solids</hi> of all Sorts; and whatsoever either <hi>elegant</hi> or <hi>defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> in <hi>Building</hi>: All which supposed a Way, what do we differ from the wildest of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>? Yet to this day was it never heard of, that there was any <hi>Controversie</hi> concerning any Conclusion in this Subject; the Science whereof hath nevertheless been continually amplified and enriched by the Conclusions of most difficult and profound Speculation. The <hi>Reason</hi> whereof is apparent to every Man that looketh into their Writings; for they proceed from most <hi>low</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> Principles, evident even to the meanest Capacity; going on <hi>slowly,</hi> and with most <hi>scrupulous Ratiocination</hi>; viz. from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Names, they inferr the Truth of their <hi>first</hi> Propositions; and from two of the first, a <hi>third</hi>; and from any two of the three, a <hi>fourth</hi>; and so on, according to the Steps of Science, mentioned Chap. 6. Sect. 4. On the other side, those Men who have written concerning the Faculties, Passions, and Manners of Men, that is to say; of <hi>Moral Philosophy,</hi> and of <hi>Policy, Government,</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> whereof there be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Volumes, have been so <hi>far from removing Doubt</hi> and Controversie in the Questions they have handled, <hi>that</hi> they have very much <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the same: Nor</hi> doth any Man at this day so much as pretend to <hi>know</hi> more than hath been delivered Two thousand Years ago by <hi>Aristotle</hi>:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44255:51"/>
and yet every Man thinks that in this Subject he knoweth as much as any other; supposing there needeth thereunto no Study but that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crueth unto them by natural Wit; though they play, or imploy their Mind otherwise in the Purchace of Wealth or Place. The Reason whereof is no other, than that in their Writings and Discourses they take for Principles those Opnions which are already vulgarly received; whether true or false, being for the most part false. There is therefore a great deal of <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> between <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Perswading</hi>; the Sign of <hi>this</hi> being <hi>Controversie</hi>; the Sign of the <hi>former, no Controversie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. There be <hi>two Sorts</hi> of Men that common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called <hi>learned</hi>: One is that Sort that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth <hi>evidently</hi> from humble Principles, as is described in the last Section; and those Men are called <hi>Mathematici: The other</hi> are they that <hi>take up</hi> Maxims from their <hi>Education,</hi> and from the <hi>Authority</hi> of Men, or of Custom, and <hi>take the habitual Discourse of the Tongue for Ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; and these are called <hi>Dogmatici.</hi> Now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the last Section those we call <hi>Mathematici</hi> are absolved of the Crime of breeding Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, and they that pretend not to Learning cannot be accused, the Fault lieth altogether in the <hi>Dogmaticks,</hi> that is to say, those that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly learned, and with Passion press to have their Opinions pass every where for Truth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any evident Demonstration either from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, or from Places of Scripture of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Interpretation.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:44255:51"/>5. The Expression of those Conceptions which <hi>cause</hi> in us the <hi>Experience</hi> of Good while we deliberate, as also of those which cause our Expectation of Evil, is that which we call <hi>Counselling,</hi> and is the internal Deliberation of the Mind concerning what we our selves are to do or not to do. The <hi>Consequences</hi> of our Actions are our <hi>Counsellors,</hi> by <hi>alternate Succession</hi> in the Mind. So in the Counsel which a Man taketh from <hi>other</hi> Men, the <hi>Counsellors alternately</hi> do <hi>make appear the Consequences</hi> of the Action, and do not any of them deliberate, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish among them all, him that is counselled with Arguments whereupon to deliberate with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another Use of Speech is <hi>Expression</hi> of <hi>Appetite, Intention,</hi> and <hi>Will</hi>; as the Appetite of Knowledge by <hi>Interrogation</hi>; Appetite to have a Thing done by another, as Request, <hi>Prayer,</hi> Petition: Expressions of our Purpose or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as <hi>Promise,</hi> which is the Affirmation or Negation of some Action to be done in the future: <hi>Threatning,</hi> which is the Promise of Evil; and <hi>Commanding,</hi> which is that Speech by which we signifie to another our <hi>Appetite</hi> or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire <hi>to have</hi> any <hi>Thing done,</hi> or <hi>left undone,</hi> for Reasons contained in the Will it self: For it is not properly said, <hi>Sic volo, sic jubeo,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that other Clause, <hi>Stet pro Ratione Voluntas</hi>: And when the Command is a sufficient Reason to move us to Action, then is that Command called a <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Another Use of Speech is <hi>Instigation</hi> and Appeasing, by which we increase or diminish
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44255:52"/>
one anothers Passion: It is the same Thing with <hi>Perswasion</hi>; the Difference not being real; for, the Begetting of <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> is the <hi>same.</hi> But whereas in <hi>Perswasion</hi> we aim at <hi>Getting Opinion from Passion; here,</hi> the End is, <hi>to raise Passion from Opinion.</hi> And as in raising an Opinion from Passion, any Premisses are good enough to inforce the desired Conclusion; so, in raising Passion from Opinion, it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whether the Opinion be true or false, or the Narration historical or fabulous: for, <hi>not</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> but the <hi>Image,</hi> maketh Passion: and a Tragedy, well acted, affecteth no less than a Murther.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Though words be the <hi>Signs</hi> we have of one anothers <hi>Opinions</hi> and Intentions, because the <hi>Aequivocation</hi> of them is so <hi>frequent according</hi> to the <hi>Diversity of Contexture,</hi> and of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany wherewith they go, which, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of him that speaketh, our <hi>Sight</hi> of his <hi>Actions,</hi> and <hi>Conjecture</hi> of his <hi>Intentions,</hi> must help to discharge us of; it must therefore be <hi>extream hard</hi> to find the <hi>Opinions</hi> and Meaning of those <hi>Men</hi> that are <hi>gone from us long ago,</hi> and have left us no other Signification thereof than their Books, which cannot possibly be understood without <hi>History,</hi> to discover those aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Circumstances, and also without great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to <hi>observe</hi> them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. When it happeneth that a Man signifieth unto us two <hi>contradictory</hi> Opinions, whereof the <hi>one</hi> is <hi>clearly</hi> and directly <hi>signified,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> either <hi>drawn</hi> from that by <hi>Consequence,</hi> or not known to be contradictory to it; then
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44255:52"/>
(when he is not present to explicate himself better) we are to take the <hi>former</hi> for his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; for that is clearly signified to be his, and directly; whereas the other might proceed from errour in the Deduction, or Ignorance of the Repugnancy. The like also is to be held in two contradictory Expressions of a Mans Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Will, for the same Reason.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Forasmuch as whosoever <hi>speaketh</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, intendeth thereby to <hi>make</hi> him <hi>understand</hi> what he saith, if he speak unto him either in a Language which he that heareth understandeth not, or use any Word in other Sence than he believeth is the Sence of him that heareth, he <hi>intendeth also not</hi> to make him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what he saith; which is a <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of himself. It is therefore always to be supposed, that he which intendeth not to deceive, alloweth the private Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Speech to him to whom it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Silence,</hi> in him that <hi>believeth</hi> that the same shall be taken for <hi>a Sign of his Intent, is</hi> a Sign there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of indeed: for, if he did not consent, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Speaking so much as to declare the same, is so little, as it is to be presumed he would have done it.</p>
