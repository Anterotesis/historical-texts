         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The Firſt Fallacy.</head>
               <p>THey oftentimes pretend, and almoſt every where lay
it for a ground, That the Right and Priviledges of
the <hi>Stillyard</hi> have no other foundation but the meer
Grace of the Kings in former Ages, not ſo well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
the Intereſt of the People; and therefore
at any time eaſily revocable.</p>
               <p>But this is a miſtake, As if the <hi>Hanſe-Towns</hi> had obtained theſe
Rights through the meer Grace of the Kings; for they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
to have merited the ſame,</p>
               <p>1 By Supplies and Aids at their great Expences, in former
Ages adminiſtred to <hi>England,</hi> againſt the French and
other Enemies.</p>
               <p>2 By many valiant Conflicts for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of their Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:30739:3"/>
3 In lieu of Damages unjuſtly in former times ſuſtained by
the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of and for all which <hi>England</hi> having in thoſe times confeſſed it
ſelf unable to make Payment and Reparation, theſe Rights obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the place of a Debt.</p>
               <p>And this is moſt evident, and in expreſs words from the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Conventions of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, the Treaty of
<hi>Utrecht</hi> with <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and many other Publick
Writings, the Originals whereof are kept amongſt the
Records of the <hi>Hanſes</hi> in their Chamber of <hi>Lubeck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it followeth,</p>
               <p>1 That it is not true, That (as the <hi>Informers</hi> ever and anon aſſert)
any of theſe Rights come to the <hi>Hanſe-Cities</hi> to the prejudice
and againſt the benefit of the people of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 But on the contrary it is moſt true, That theſe Rights and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are Obligatory on both ſides.</p>
               <p>3 And that indeed for ever; for as much as the Cauſes thereof are
mutual, and oblige reciprocally.</p>
               <p>4 And therefore cannot be revoked at the pleaſure, or for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the one party, the other not conſenting, without
breach of that Law which is between Nation and Nation; no
more then Goods once ſold and delivered, can be recovered or
claimed back by the Seller.</p>
               <p>5 And although even the ſaid Cities ſhould conſent to ſuch Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
yet unleſs firſt Reſtitution and Reparation were made
unto them of and for thoſe Expences and Services, by which
Ancient Merits they obtained theſe Rights, and of the Damages
by them ſuſtained, it were not juſt to deprive them thereof.
And then they ought to be refunded,</p>
               <p>1 Of thoſe Auxiliary and Warlike Charges expended for the
benefit of <hi>England,</hi> together with the Intereſt of Four
hundred years.</p>
               <p>2 Satisfaction ought to be given for the Services they did in
thoſe times of War.</p>
               <p>3 The Damages ought to be repaired which were ſuſtained by
the <hi>Hanſes</hi> ſo long ſince, with Intereſt for ſo long time paſt.</p>
               <p>Which Damages alone, even as they then were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
and calculated by the Parliament now above
Two hundred years paſt, did exceed the ſum of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30739:3"/>
200000 l <hi>Sterling.</hi> From which it may be eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
to what vaſt ſum of Debt the whole would
amount, if all three, together with the accruing Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
were to theſe times exactly computed.</p>
               <p>6 And therefore they having for ſo many Ages paſt borne the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
of ſo high an Obligation, and the <hi>Hanſe-Cities</hi> ſtill not
eſteeming the ſame ſo much as they do the Amity and Mutual
Correſpondence of <hi>England;</hi> they think it equal that they
ſhould be ſo much the more reciprocally favored, and their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
cheriſhed, maintained, and by all good means aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>
               <p>7 Much leſs beſeeming would it be for no Default or Crime on
their part, without recompence for ſo many Services and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
and that alſo upon falſe and frivolous Suggeſtions
againſt the Laws of Amity, to caſt them out either of their
Poſſeſſion, or thoſe Liberties, Exemption from Taxes, and other
their Rights by them obtained in perpetuity; as ſome <hi>Informers</hi>
do endeavor to deſpoil them.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="fallacy">
               <head>The Second Fallacy.</head>
               <p>AS often as theſe Men diſcourſe of the firſt Riſe, Title, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
by which the <hi>Hanſe-Cities</hi> poſſeſs the <hi>Stillyard;</hi> they
ſpeak as if they had obtained the ſame without the knowledge, and
againſt the conſent of the people; and therefore they mention only
the Kings Grants, but omit thoſe of the Parliaments: And this to
no other end, but to traduce and render the more odious their
whole Right before the people, and thoſe of the generality and all
others, who are unverſed in and ignorant of the Verity of their
Caſe. Whereas indeed,</p>
               <p>1 The Kings alone in their Private were not the ſole Authors
of theſe their Rights, but the ſame were alſo publickly ſeen,
conſidered, approved, ſolemnly ratified and confirmed by the
Parliaments: Of which Ratifications, the ſeveral Originals,
together with the Kings Letters Patents, are to be found
among the Records of the ſaid <hi>Hanſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 As moreover in the ſame are Extant in Authentick Form,
ſome Solemn Acts of the City of <hi>London,</hi> acknowledging and
accepting the ſame Rights and Priviledges.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:30739:4"/>
From hence it followeth,</p>
               <p>1 That it is not true which the <hi>Informers</hi> feign, as if our Right did
depend upon the ſole authority and grant of the Kings.</p>
               <p>2 But it is much leſs true, That the ſame were obtained without
conſent of the People; being the People is, and always will
be repreſentatively in the Parliaments.</p>
               <p>3 That it is moſt untrue (as ſometimes it is ſuggeſted) as if the
ſame had been obtained by any ſordid or unlawful means; yea
the Oppoſers of our Rights (when at any time there have
been ſuch) by abuſing the lenitie of the Kings, have indeed
rather prevailed in whatſoever they obtained againſt us in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, by ſiniſter diverſions of their grace and favor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And therefore the ſame having been detected, they have failed
in their attempts, and hitherto our right hath remained entire.</p>
               <p>4 Hence it appeareth, That our Right by the acceſſion of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Parliament is altogether become irrevocable: For
as the People can never die, but that the People is alwaies
judged to be the ſame, ſo alſo Parliaments meeting in the
place of the People, do always repreſent the ſame and one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
Wherefore however a lawful Parliament may abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the Acts of Kings, yet nevertheleſs it cannot revoke the
Acts of a Parliament alike equally lawful; Foraſmuch as <hi>Par in
parem non habeat imperium;</hi> And it is to be believed they will
not, as neither being conſiſtent with the Commonweal, nor
that one Parliament will eaſily do that to their predeceſſors,
which it would not have done to it ſelf by their ſucceſſors.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="fallacy">
               <head>The Third Fallacy.</head>
               <p>BUt it is ſaid, That all their Rights were granted under certain
conditions and for ſome certain end, amongſt which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
was the Exportation of Engliſh Clothes in ſuch abundance,
as the whole Nation ſhould be ſenſible of the benefit thereof.</p>
               <p>But that now no Clothes are any more exported by the <hi>Hanſes,</hi>
but that this Trade is reduced to the Merchants-Adventurers, and
that they oftentimes in one year have exported more then double
the number which the <hi>Hanſes</hi> formerly exported in two or three
years; And therefore the Condition and End ceaſing, thoſe Rights
alſo ought to ceaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:30739:4"/>
But, 1 As to what concerns <hi>England,</hi> the benefit of the Trade of
Clothing was not the ſole condition or cauſe of the <hi>Hances</hi>
Right, but rather alone that the Nation of <hi>England</hi> ſhould
be diſcharged of a vaſt Debt wherein it was obliged to the
<hi>Hanſes;</hi> And at that time it was to them a great advantage,
that the <hi>Hanſe-Cities</hi> would in ſatisfaction of this Debt
rather accept ſome Rights and Priviledges for ſo great a
Sum of money, which otherwiſe <hi>England</hi> was obliged to
pay them.</p>
               <p>2 So as there was not only regard had to the benefits which
in future times <hi>England</hi> might reap by theſe Priviledges,
but this principally was intended, that the <hi>Hanſes</hi> in the
the coemption and exportation of Clothes ſhould for ever
enjoy a prerogative above other Nations, and that for
their known merits and the damages by them ſuſtained.</p>
               <p>3 But moreover to clear this point, to what end or on what
condition this was contracted, if it were ſo, it ought to
have been expreſſed in the Convention it ſelf, being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
there might be many acceſſory Ends aſſigned of one
and the ſame thing; Neither can every Condition have
the force of a Reſolutive Agreement, but that alone which
is ſo eſpecially inſerted in the Contract, that the ſame
ceaſing, the Contract may be underſtood diſſolved, or ſuch
as was the ſole and only cauſe of the Contract.</p>
               <p>4 And this is worthy to be obſerved, That it is not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to the <hi>Hanſes,</hi> that they have not hitherto continued
in the Exportation of Clothes. And no man, without it
be by his own default, ought to be puniſhed.</p>
               <p>Hence it followeth,</p>
               <p>1 Being the <hi>Hanſes</hi> have obtained their Right by a very hard and
chargeable Title, the ſame ought to remain unto them for ever
and irrevocable.</p>
               <p>2 Nor can the ſame be revoked or altered by a Condition however
extrinſick and neceſſary.</p>
               <p>3 As likewiſe neither one other acceſſory End ceaſing.</p>
               <p>4 Much leſs for any cauſe of private benefit.</p>
               <p>5 Being it is neither lawful naturally, to recede from ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
on one party in reſpect of his own advantage againſt the
conſent of the other party, who eſpecially is ſo much damnified.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:30739:5"/>

               <head>The Fourth Fallacy—</head>
               <p>IS almoſt of the ſame ſtuff as the former. They would have it be
believed, that all the Right of the <hi>Hanſes,</hi> and ſo their Right to
the Houſe of the <hi>Stillyard</hi> are become void, becauſe forſooth the
Corporation it ſelf, (that is) the Body and Subject upon which
that Right was conferred, is no more a Corporation: And ſo the
Commerce of the ſaid Houſe ceaſing, being intended for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of <hi>England,</hi> the Right it ſelf ſhould withal ceaſe.</p>
               <p>But,
1 It is before ſhewn, that the <hi>Hanſes</hi> did not obtain the poſſeſſion
of the <hi>Stillyard,</hi> for this cauſe of Advantage to <hi>England</hi> only.</p>
               <p>2 Neither that as it may be advantagious or profitable to one
Party, a Contract can be preſently reſcinded or diſſolved.</p>
               <p>3 The objection it ſelf, if it relate to the <hi>Hanſe-Cities</hi> themſelves,
is manifeſtly falſe: For who can be ignorant, that the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the <hi>Hanſes</hi> between theſe principal Cities, viz. <hi>Lubeck,
Breme, Hamburgh, Brunſwick, Colen, Munſter, &amp;c.</hi> doth not
continue to this day? nor ever to have been extinguiſhed?
although of ſeventy two Cities (of which antiently they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted)
many, becauſe of their decaied and weak eſtate, have
withdrawn themſelves, and others through their own default
have been excluded the Society? There is nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
then that hitherto they obſerve their Conventions, and
jointly ſend forth their Ambaſſadors; and that in the publick
Conſtitutions of <hi>Germany,</hi> as well antient as modern, they
have an honorable place; and in <hi>France, Spain, Sweden, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
Moſco, Poland,</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> they both are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
under their common Denomination, and alſo
enjoy their Rights as a Body Confederate. But if this reflect
on the Merchants reſiding in the Houſe of the <hi>Stillyard,</hi> How
can it be that their paucitie, and any act of theirs, can be any
argument that the Houſe it ſelf ſhould be taken from the
<hi>Hanſe-Cities?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30739:5"/>
1 That thoſe Merchants are not the Proprietors of the ſaid
Houſe, but the ſaid Cities.</p>
               <p>2 Nor if they were, have we hitherto ever heard it proved,
that as yet they have committed or done any thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to deprive them of this Right in Law.</p>
               <p>3 And although they had committed any thing againſt the
Law, yet, <hi>Paena ſuos tenere debet Autores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 And for their ſmall Number, this alſo hath not come to
paſs through their own fault; For the truth is, that they
have by little and little been ſo diſcouraged by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
that the reſt have given place.</p>
               <p>5 The <hi>Informers</hi> themſelves uſe this for one principal Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<hi>Strangers are to be reſtrained of the Engliſh Comerce.</hi>
But theſe are contraries, both to require and plainly to
intend the exterminating of Foreign Merchants, and
yet at the ſame time to puniſh ours by taking away their
Rights for this cauſe, that being reduced to ſuch a pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie,
they do not exerciſe Trade here in greater number.
This certainly is againſt all reaſon of Natural Juſtice,
that he who for the benefit of another hath relinquiſhed
part of his Right, ſhould be deprived of all the reſt for
this onely cauſe, That he hath relinquiſhed a part.</p>
               <p>6 And laſtly it is a Rule in Natural Reaſon, That a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or Corporation which had its beginning in many,
may yet be conſerved in three or two perſons.</p>
               <p>Hence it followeth,</p>
               <p>1 That it is plainly falſe and contrary to the moſt evident truth of
the matter which is ſuggeſted, either of the taking away or
of the ceaſing of this Corporation.</p>
               <p>2 That it is not the queſtion, What profit at this day the Houſe
of the <hi>Stillyard</hi> contributeth either publickly or privately to
<hi>England,</hi> (for before the invalidity of this Argument is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated)
but whether the <hi>Hanſe-Cities</hi> for their own bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
will, and yet may enjoy the ſame to their own commodity.</p>
               <p>3 That even three or two, yea one Merchant in the name of the
<hi>Hanſe-Society,</hi> doth conſerve the right of the <hi>Hanſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 That the Delinquencies of any ſingle perſon (if any ſuch can be
proved) do not prejudice the <hi>Hanſes,</hi> but reacheth alone
the Authors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:30739:6"/>
5 That the Actions of ſingle perſons are to be diſtinguiſhed from
the Cauſe of an whole Society.</p>
               <p>6 And therefore theſe <hi>Informers</hi> both deceive themſelves, and alſo
would impoſe on the Parliament and people of <hi>England,</hi> ſo
often as they make uſe of this argument to impeach the Rights
of the <hi>Hanſe-Cities</hi> in the Houſe of the <hi>Stillyard.</hi>

               <head>The Fifth Fallacy—</head>
               <p>IS the common benefit to this Commonwealth of <hi>England</hi> and
the people, whilſt they ſay the Revenue would be augmented
yearly Two thouſand pounds ſterling, if the Houſe of the <hi>Stillyard</hi>
were ſeiſed: By which ſpecious inſinuation they not only deceive
the incautelous, but ſeek to ſet the mouth of the people on water
and to excite them againſt the <hi>Hanſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But,
1 It is before made appear, that between thoſe who are equal in
right, no Right can be taken away from the one party for any
conſideration of the commodity or profit of the other party.</p>
               <p>2 And what Reaſon did ever juſtifie this for a Law, That it ſhould
be lawful for me to take away that from another, which he
poſſeſſeth by a Right obtained in perpetuity?</p>
               <p>3 Alſo what profit can accrue by that which not only is repugnant
to the Rules of Honeſty, but alſo would be prejudicial to the
glory and renown of the Engliſh Nation?</p>
               <p>4 But yet this alſo by which they plainly inſinuate the Publick
Revenue to be impaired through the Houſe of the <hi>Stillyard,</hi>
and from which they make up the accompt of Two thouſand
pounds ſterl. <hi>per annum,</hi> hath never hitherto been proved, and
is of it ſelf evidently falſe.</p>
               <p>5 It is to be believed, that whatever profit from hence may be
gained, is rather aimed at by ſome private Perſons, to their
own Lucre, then for any intent to advance the Publick good.</p>
               <p>6 If any publick benefit ought to be in this caſe aimed at, the
moſt Renowned Parliament in their great wſdome, will rather
judge and diſcern this point, Whether it were better for ſo
ſmall and indeed unjuſt and inconſiderable a gain (for ſuch a
ſum would no more add to the increaſe of the Treaſury of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
then the ſmalleſt drop of water would to the Britiſh

with the hazard of the antient Amity and neighbouring
<hi>German</hi> Comerce, (for all the Maratine Comerce of <hi>Germany</hi>
is for the moſt part in thoſe Cities) or rather not to preſerve
intire the Amity, and the Rights and intercourſe of Trade of
above 400 years, not to ſay, to augment the ſame, which yet
might be done to the great and mutual benefit of both parties.</p>
               <p>Hence it followeth,</p>
               <p>1 That it is a deceit and a meer empty pretect, whatever is in this
Argument ſpeciouſly inſinuated, concerning publick profit.</p>
               <p>2 That on the other ſide it is more expedient, and for the Intereſt
of <hi>England,</hi> that the Right of the <hi>Hanſes</hi> ſhould be preſerved,
yea augmented.</p>

            <div n="6" type="fallacy">
               <head>The Sixth Fallacy—</head>
               <p>IS, that ſome deceaſed Kings have before this taken poſſeſſion of
the Houſe of the <hi>Stillyard,</hi> and that therefore the preſent poſſeſſion
of the <hi>Hanſe-Cities,</hi> as afterwards obtained by force and intruſion,
is unlawfull and unjuſt.</p>
               <p>But,
1 Here is manifeſt falſe dealing, whilſt the Publick Acts are neither
<hi>bona fide,</hi> nor fully alleadged, for they ſet forth the beginning
of the Fact, but the defences and iſſue of the matter they wholly
omit. They by peeces ſuggeſt that which one or other King, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
importune Petitions perhaps, before the Cauſe was fully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
did reſolve to doe; They ſmother and take no notice of
what followed thereupon, what reſolutions after hearing of
the Cauſe and diſcovery of the Injuſtice of thoſe Petitions
finally iſſued, and how this Cauſe ſuppreſſing all proceſs at the
Common Law, was alwaies remitted to ſpecial Conventions,
Conferences and Amicable Treaties.</p>
               <p>2 But yet it never came to that point, that in the time of any King
or Queen, the <hi>Hanſes</hi> were ever ejected out of their poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>3 For that the Queen did attempt to poſſeſs the Houſe of the
<hi>Stillyard,</hi> it was not long; for ſtill and nevertheleſs the Cities
did remain in continual and perpetual, as well Natural as Civil
poſſeſſion, which the Fact it ſelf proveth, and is known to the
whole World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:30739:7"/>
Hence it followeth,</p>
               <p>1 It is falſe'y and abſurdly aſſerted, That the <hi>Stillyard</hi> having been
formerly ſeiſed by the Kings, is devolved to the Demeans of
this Commonwealth, and at this day ſo remains.</p>
               <p>2 It is alſo a fable, that the <hi>Hanſes</hi> Repoſſeſſion is by force and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion.</p>
               <p>3 For how probable is it, that a few Merchants of the <hi>Stillyard</hi>
could repoſſeſs themſelves by force and intruſion of any Eſtate
in the face of Kings againſt their will, and particularly in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or againſt the Parliaments, the
City of <hi>London</hi> looking on and being Spectators? What
force, what Intruſion could defend them againſt theſe Kings,
Queen and Parliaments?</p>
               <p>4 The <hi>Hanſe-Cities</hi> therefore have remained alwaies, and are at this
day in lawful, perpetual and continued poſſeſſion of this Houſe:
Lawful, becauſe obtained from the beginning upon more then
valuable conſideration, and a moſt chargeable Title; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual,
becauſe continued; continued, becauſe never interrupted.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="fallacy">
               <head>The Seventh Fallacy.</head>
               <p>THat this Cauſe is the Cauſe of the Revenue and Demean of the
Commonwealth of <hi>England;</hi> that therefore of ſuch Cauſes the
Barons of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> are competent Judges.</p>
               <p>But,
1 Every cauſe whereby every Poſſeſſion and Right is pretended
to be in the Demean of the Commonwealth, doth not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to thoſe Judges, but only in Caſes where the Action lies
againſt either the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> or any private Stranger
uſurping againſt the Right of the Commonwealth: For theſe,
becauſe they are ſubject to the Courts and Ordinary Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of this Commonwealth, are rightly there convented;
but this is not the Caſe of the <hi>Hanſe-Society,</hi> which being as
to Comerce abſolutely free and at its own arbitrement, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is contracted is tranſacted as with a free Foreign people;
ſo that the Confederacies, Pactions and Conventions made
with them, and all Rights thereby obtained, cannot be brought
before the ordinary Judicatories of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:30739:7"/>
2 Otherwiſe it would follow from this Principle, That the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
and Contracts of all Kings and Republicks with this
Commonwealth might be queſtioned in the ſame, and that all
Foreign Nations hitherto have been bound to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto theſe Judicatories; which can with no more Equity
be done againſt Foreign Nations, then the People of <hi>England</hi>
would think it juſt that the ſame were done to them abroad.</p>
               <p>3 But moreover, theſe which are called the <hi>Hanſe-</hi> Priviledges, are
meer Contracts between this Commonwealth and thoſe Cities;
and therefore if any difference do ariſe about the ſame, the
Controverſie ought to be determined, not by the Private Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory
of any one Party, but by Commiſſioners of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="fallacy">
               <head>The Eighth Fallacy.</head>
               <p>LAſtly, They conceive that the Houſe of the <hi>Stillyard</hi> may be
with good reaſon taken away, becauſe the <hi>Hanſe-Cities</hi> have
planted other Reſidences of their Comerce, in <hi>Norway, Moſcovia,
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is grounded upon no Reaſon; For when their Anceſtors
obtained theſe Priviledges of <hi>England,</hi> they were not limited for
their Comerce to <hi>England</hi> alone, nor by any other condition were
prohibited to Traffick any where elſe; yea, never any King or
Parliament ever required, that they ſhould not Traffick in any other
place but <hi>England:</hi> And to ſay no more, Theſe objections can no
better be confuted, then by the notorietie of the fact, by which it
is evident, That for above Three hundred years paſt, the <hi>Hanſes</hi>
have conſtantly exerciſed their Comerce in the ſaid Countreys,
and yet nevertheleſs, in the mean time enjoyed their Trade in
<hi>England,</hi> with all Rights depending thereupon.</p>
               <p>From all which, it is concluded,</p>
               <p>1 That the pretences of the <hi>Informers</hi> are unjuſt againſt the <hi>Still<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi>
by which they ſeek to invade without juſt cauſe, a Right
due to another, againſt that moſt general Law of all others,
<hi>Quae tibi non vis fieri, alteri ne feceris;</hi> contrary to Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and repugnant even to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which never
deviate from the Laws of God and Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:30739:8"/>
2 And therefore their Arguments ought not to be heard, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
               <p>3 Yea to be eſteemed as prejudicial and derogatory to the Honor
of the Engliſh Nation; whileſt they are ſo bold under the falſe
Repreſentation of a ſmall lucre of Two thouſand pounds <hi>per an.</hi>
to violate an Amity of Four Ages, the entercourſe of the
Commerce of all <hi>Germany</hi> almoſt, and eſpecially the Faith and
Conſtancy of ſo many Treaties and Agreements: Not at all
obſerving (to omit many other) how much benefit the people
of <hi>England</hi> have thence reaped within few years paſt, in their
great neceſſitie, by the ſupply alone of all manner of Corn; and
how much <hi>Hamburgh</hi> to this day, and <hi>Lubeck</hi> now lately have
accommodated this Nation, by permitting them liberty to paſs
their Commodities and Merchandiſes by their Ports.</p>
               <p>4 And on the other ſide, That the <hi>Hanſe-Cities</hi> ought without any
violation be left peaceably in their Poſſeſſion and Right.</p>
               <p>5 And that no Man ought to be permitted to make any attempts
in prejudice thereof.</p>
               <p>6 Which if the Affair be rightly eſteemed, will be both glorious
to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and alſo as to the Publick of very great
advantage and benefit.</p>
               <p>And therefore I do in the name of the ſaid Cities, and the
whole Society of the Confederate <hi>Hanſes</hi> pray,</p>
               <p>1 THat ſuch Informations, and the like attempts againſt the
manifeſt and known Rights of the <hi>Stillyard,</hi> may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
rejected and ſuppreſſed.</p>
               <p>2 That if any Queſtion do ariſe touching the ſaid Houſe, or the
Rights thereof, the ſame may according to the Cuſtom of
Nations, and as hitherto hath been obſerved between <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and the ſaid <hi>Hanſe-Cities,</hi> be reſerved and referred to
amicable Treaty between this Commonwealth and the ſaid
Cities.</p>
               <p>3 That all things in the interim may remain intire and inviolate,
and in particular, That the Exemption from Taxes, both
Real and Perſonal, which the Inhabitants of the <hi>Stillyard</hi>
have hitherto enjoyed, may be preſerved unto them without
any breach, according to the Antient Priviledges.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:30739:8"/>
4 And laſtly, That the Freedom of Trade throughout the
Dominions of <hi>England,</hi> as hitherto, ſo alſo for the future,
without any Reſtriction, may peaceably be permitted to the
ſaid <hi>Hanſe-</hi> Merchants, as well for the preſervation as aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
of mutual Commerce between the People of
