         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Abilities were much greater than
even the Ignorant and Envious
believe them to be. You have,
therefore, more of reason to
blame me for Haste, than for
Delay; in that I now render You
so negligent an account of my
diligence in managing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
You assigned me: and if

on it as a <hi>Specimen</hi> rather of my
<hi>Obedience,</hi> than of my <hi>Learning.</hi> For,
had I not preferred the suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of my Duty, as a friend, to the
counsel of my Reason, as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer
into Nature; You may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
Your self, it would have been
very long, before I should have
been brought thus freely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
my Weakness to You, who
are so well able to discern it.
But my comfort is, though You
are sharp-sighted, You are also
Good-natured: not more apt to
discover than to conceal mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
and failings. Having
then the same excuse both for
my Tardity and for my Haste;
and confiding intirely in Your
Candor: behold, I put into Your
hands the following Discourse,
to which Your Command gave
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60736:10"/>
the first and sole <hi>Occasion,</hi> and in
which I have plainly and briefly

in the World, reduced to a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60736:11"/>
few Heads or Kinds: it would
be no hard matter for them to
find out the several Advantages
deducible from thence. First,
every one might contemplate,
as in a Mirrour, some part at
least of his <hi>own</hi> Image, and know
in what <hi>Classis</hi> to rank himself.
Then, by observing what is <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful</hi>
or <hi>deform</hi> in the picture of
another, he might the better
judge of what himself either <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires</hi>
or <hi>fears</hi> to be. Again, since
<hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi> mutually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
upon each others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines,
and that no <hi>Ingeny</hi> is so

a capacity of being kept
from Exorbitancy, and by the

neerly allied to this or that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
but may by imprudence be
corrupted, so as to swerve toward
some bordering Vice: it could
not be unprofitable to view the

by their good or evil <hi>Consequents,</hi>
and from thence to collect how
far they might <hi>benefit</hi> or <hi>hurt,</hi> if
followed. In fine, by such gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

how to moderate our <hi>Praises</hi> of

                        <p>Here, <hi>Sir,</hi> You have both the
true <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> of Docility
conveniently expressed; but yet
you are to seek, whether Wit
and Docility be alwaies one and
the same thing. For, Docility,
if restrained only to Arts and
Sciences, though it necessarily
implyes a good capacity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
in the Person, by the
bounty of Nature, therewith
enriched: yet can it not be thence
inferred, that all men who want
this Docility, want also wit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
then none could have wit,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60736:15"/>
but <hi>Scholars</hi> alone, and because
Experience sufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
that many laudable Wits
are naturally averse from the
study of Letters, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
perhaps also incapable of
proficiency in them. So that what
<hi>Anatomists</hi> generally say of the
signs of Virginity, namely that
the appearance of them is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
evidence of the Brides Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity;
but the non-appearance,
no proof of her deflowerment
before Marriage; may with
equal truth be said of this Doci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
it cannot be without a good
Wit, but a good Wit may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be without that. Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
You know, is but Wit culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated;
the seeds thereof are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and grow up of themselves,
and many times bring forth fruits
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60736:15"/>
both pleasant and useful, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of Art, especially
where their Luxuriancy is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by virtuous education,
and their maturity promoted by
ingenious conversation. If wit,
then, may subsist without <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
certainly it may subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Docility, i.e.</hi> a facility of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arts and Sciences.</p>
                        <p>Besides, if we divide <hi>Docility</hi>
into its three parts newly descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
and distribute them among
three Men, allowing to one quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Apprehension,</hi> to the second
<hi>Sagacity</hi> in hunting after conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
and strength of <hi>Memory</hi>
to the third: this will not be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to direct us to make a
judgement, which of the three
ought to have the praise of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60736:16"/>
best <hi>Wit:</hi> because therein they
may all be Equal. For, we
want not the testimony of daily
observation, that many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Wits have but weak Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and as many of admirable
Memories are yet dull of Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension;
and again many, who
are good at Ranging after Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
though it be necessary
that they remember well (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is from the reminiscence
of what they have known, that
they infer what they seek) are
yet but slow of Conception
Hereupon I am of opinion, that
Wit and Docility, though fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Concomitant, are yet
distinct Faculties, and therefore
require both Names and Notions
distinct.</p>

our selves; there being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
some other Reason or End
of such Variety, wherein Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
may be highly concerned.
I conceive, then, that the <hi>Creator</hi>
having one Eye directed to the
pleasure redounding to Him
from the manifestation of His
Power and Goodness; aimed
with the other at some general
benefit and favour to Man, to
whom He purposed to be singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
indulgent and gracious in
all things: and that fore-seeing
how much more securely, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously
and happily Men
might live in <hi>Societies,</hi> than single
and dispersed, as wild Beasts; He
ordained this great diversity of
<hi>Ingenies</hi> among them, as a means
to accommodate them to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60736:28"/>
assistance and association.
But this I deliver as only proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
not definitive: and leaving
it to Your better judgement to be
approved or rejected, I pass on
to the <hi>Natural</hi> Causes of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity

For, though it be sufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,

that such indeed was the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

You have lately not only
read a certain Book, <hi>de Proprieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus

<hi>Differences</hi> betwixt the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Brain, and those of all

other Animals; but also with
Your own eyes behold those Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
demonstrated by the

for that end made by him
at the command of the <hi>Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety:</hi>
and that therefore You
hope, if <hi>Anatomists</hi> proceed in
their discoveries, with the same
accurate scrutiny, and the like
happy success, as of late Years
they have done; some one of
them may at length be so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
as to find out the true
uses of all the several parts of
the Brain of Man, and so solve
all the difficulties that now
amuse those, who profoundly
consider the wonderful <hi>Oeconomy</hi>
thereof.</p>
                        <p>I <hi>reply,</hi> therefore; that grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                           <hi>Vesalius</hi> to have been much
mistaken in that his Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Brain; and that there
really are those Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Man and all other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,

I have here said concerning the

is nevertheless too true.
For, You cannot but remember,
that even the Author of that

of it ingenuously confess, that
notwithstanding his frequent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of those Differences,
he was still as ignorant of the

is very rarely conjoyn'd with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
fluency of speech. The
<hi>Reason</hi> may be this; that a
prompt, but turbulent Mind,
when in retirement (which all
know to be necessary to a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
it comes once to reflect
upon it self, and examine its
own strength; burdened with
multiplicity of things together
offering themselves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with variety of
thoughts, soon faints under the
weight: and having neither
judgement to <hi>select,</hi> nor patience
to <hi>digest,</hi> falls at length into Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction,
or Despondency. In
fine, the Faculty of writing well
is so different from that of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
volubly, and requires so
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60736:45"/>
much more of both Attention
and Deliberation; that most of
your <hi>Fine Speakers,</hi> when once
they find the wings of their Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
clipt, and their understanding
intangled in strong and knotty
Reasonings, are miserably at a
loss how to extricate themselves,
and despairing of success, return
to their former liberty. Yet
some of this <hi>Classis,</hi> either blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with self-conceit, or deluded
by adulation of their Admirers,
have adventured to publish
Books; and out of vain Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to enlarge and eternize
their Reputation by their

what they had acquired by
the nimbleness of their Tongue.

some considerable Volume from
them, and keep that expectation
alive as long as they can: but
be so wise as never to satisfie it
with so much as a single Sheet.
But Wits of this temper are
commonly too Hot to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
their Efforts; too opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
to take caution from the
Counsel of even their truest

Again, Time hath furnished us
with Examples of some, who
had acquired high estimation in
the Schools by extraordinary
acuteness in sundry kinds of
Learning, and yet proved very
weak, when they were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
into the more subtile and
fine region of Princes Courts
and Councils: their Reason
then confessing it self too dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted
to discern the Finesses

of Civil Prudence, to which
all other Learning must give
place.</p>
                        <p>You will not, <hi>Sir,</hi> I presume,
be long in determining which is
the truer <hi>Wisdom,</hi> his, who can
foresee discontents and Motions

and safe Remedies for them,
or his, who, after long contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
is able to predict Eclipses

the journeys and returns
of all the Planets; but cannot

felicity run through the whole

if a Man acquire excellency in
any <hi>one</hi> of them: for instance, if

in all the Exornations of

and <hi>Politicks</hi> and other parts of

therefore, which is due
from any one part of Learning,

why are they so partial, so unjust,
as to detract from that Science,
which is conversant in the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of whole Societies of Men,
and which in that very respect
ought to be preferred to all other
Human Knowledge? Think
they, that Wisdom speaks to her
Disciples only in <hi>Greek,</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi>

while, being disjoyned by mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
emulation and contention,
they endevoured to perswade the
People to favour and adhere to
one or the other side, they made
speeches to them to move their
Affections accordingly; that

the Monuments of History have

would habituate them to confine
their Cogitations within too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

their Curiosity upon Notions,
though perhaps of great subtlety
in speculation, yet of little use
in the occurrents of life: nor

their thoughts to other things,

the finer and acuter the Wit is,

perhaps is this; that Nature

robust Bodies; but for the most
part chooseth to lodge them in
delicate and tender Constitutions,

upon their whole Sex, calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
the most chast and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
to palliate their own disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
To this base end, they
rejoyce to expose the secret faults

they are sure to make use
of one, or more of these cunning
artifices. Having found an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to mention some evil,
whether true or only suspected,
in the Person, whose Merits they
intend to disparage; either they
industriously pretermit what
they know, and ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
towards the excuse thereof;
or they pretend (forsooth) not
to believe it, when yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
the memory of it for no
other end, but that it may be
more firmly believed by others.
Where they meet with notorious
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60736:67"/>
failings, there they seem to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate,
and as it were to compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sate
them with slight Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
only to disguise their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction:
as I have heard of a

to obstruct the preferment of a

not daring to oppose his Master,
King <hi>Iames</hi> his charitable incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
thereunto; said to the
King, <hi>Your Majesty may do well to

                           </hi>
Another of their tricks is this;
where they cannot blame the

<hi>Motives</hi> or inducements to the
doing of it, and deprave the <hi>Course</hi>
                           <pb n="117" facs="tcp:60736:67"/>
and intention. To these may
be added one more, no less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable;
where rumour hath
dispersed various conjectures
concerning one and the same
action of some Eminent Man,
omitting or suppressing the
more benign and favourable,
they select the <hi>worse</hi> and
more derogatory, and largely
comment thereupon; with
design to pervert the belief of
their Hearers, or Readers, <hi>in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorem

suspicions from the crooked rule
of their own insincere Mind and
depraved inclinations; they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to perswade themselves and
others, that there is among Men
no such thing as true Virtue, but
only a Shadow or artificial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of it: thereby vainly
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60736:68"/>
promising to themselves the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of singular acuteness of
judgement, and more than vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Wisdom. If they can Eclipse
the glory of Worthy Men, by
fomenting obscure and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
rumours concerning their

ascribing the same, not to

Whether this Venerable
Author, to whom the World is

hath deserved this accusation, or
not; I leave to Your judgement,

In the mean time, I am obliged,

one of his <hi>Accusers</hi> at least. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me, then, to referr You to

I think not without desert; but

whereby a Man modestly and
gently touches upon the Errours,
Indecencies, or Infirmities of
another, without any suspicion
of hate or contempt of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
pleasantly representing them
as only ridiculous, not odious: I
do not think it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as a vice of the Mind, but
allowed as a Quality consistent
both with Honesty and good
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60736:76"/>
Manners, as denoting the Alacrity
of his Disposition, and Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his Spirit (both signs of
Virtue) and often also the Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
of his Wit, in that he is able
to give a delightful and new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to the absurdity at which he
moves his company to smile.
Nor is it disingenuous to <hi>laugh,</hi>
when we hear the Jests of others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
nay some jests are so facete and
abstracted from Persons, that it
would savour of too much dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Morosity, not to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with their elegancy. But
when we our selves break a jest
it is more decent to abstain from
Laughter, as well lest what we
say seem to occurr to our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
unexpectedly, and by
chance rather than choice; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out that allusion, which had
escaped the notice of others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
both which are obnoxious
to dispraise; the <hi>former,</hi> as a mark
of <hi>slowness</hi> of Conception; the
<hi>latter,</hi> as an evidence of <hi>Self-love.</hi>
To which may be added two
other Reasons. First, whoever

rendring it less apt to surprise the
Hearers. Then again he puts all
the company into jealousie and
examination of themselves. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all this (as Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
observes, in his Book of
<hi>Humane Nature)</hi> it is Vain-glory,

our <hi>Vintners</hi> use to rack them

<hi>Renish,</hi> which commonly grows

they choose to do it in the wane

                  <p>Having thus succinctly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the most remarkable
Distempers of Wines, guessed at
their respective Causes, and
touched upon the times: it is
seasonable for me to proceed to
their usual <hi>Remedies,</hi> such at least
as I have been able to collect
from <hi>Wine-coopers</hi> and <hi>Vintners;</hi>
which is the <hi>Fourth</hi> and last part
of my Argment.</p>
                  <p>To begin therefore with some
of the <hi>Artifices</hi> used to Wines
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60736:89"/>
when yet in the <hi>Must;</hi> it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
that although to the
raising a Fermentation in them,
at that time, there be not so
much need of any additional
Ferment, as there is in the woo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
of <hi>Ale, Beer, Hydromel, Metheglin,</hi>
and other sorts of drinks fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to us in <hi>England;</hi> because the
juice of the Grape is replenished
with generous Spirits sufficient
of themselves to begin th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
work: yet it is usual in some
Countries to put quick <hi>Lime</hi> either
upon the Grapes, when
they are pressing, or into the
Must, to the end that by the
force and quickness of its Saline
and fiery particles, the liquor
may be both accelerated and
assisted in working. For the
same reason perhaps it is, that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60736:89"/>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> mix with their
Wines, while they are yet flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Press, a certain
thing they call <hi>Giesso,</hi> which I
guess to be a kind of <hi>Gypsum</hi> or
Plaistre; whereby the Wines are
made more durable, of a paler
colour, and more pleasant taste.
Others put into the Cask shavings
of <hi>Firr, Oak</hi> or <hi>Beech,</hi> for the same
purpose; and others Vinegar.</p>
                  <p>Again, though the first Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
succeeds generally
well, so that the whole mass of
liquor is thereby delivered from
the gross Lee; yet sometimes it
happens, either through scarcity
of Spirits at first, or through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
cold, that some part of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

and floating therein. Now in

That the use hereof is very <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi>
is manifest from that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of <hi>Plutarch (quaestion. natur.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Which is not improbable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60736:92"/>
Experience teacheth, that
such who make their Vintage
in a rainy season, cannot get their
Must to ferment well in a Vault,
unless they cause great fires to
be made neer the Casks; the rain
mixed with the Must, together
with the ambient cold, impeding
the motion of Fermentation,
which ariseth chiefly from Heat.</p>
                  <p>That the same is frequent at
<hi>this day</hi> also, may be collected
from what Noble Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> hath
been pleased to observe in his
incomparable <hi>History of Cold,</hi> on
the relation of a <hi>French man: viz.</hi>
that the way to keep wine long
in the Must (in which state the
sweetness makes many to desire
it) is to tunn it up immediately
from the Press, and before it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60736:93"/>
to work, to let down the
Vessels, closely and firmly stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
into a Well or deep River,
there to remain for 6. or 8. weeks.
During which time, the liquor
will be so confirmed in its state of
Crudity, as to retain the same,
together with its sweetness, for
many months after, without any
sensible Fermentation.</p>
                  <p>But (as I said) how can these
two so different Effects, the <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification
of new Wine,</hi> and the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Wine in the Must,</hi> be
derived from one and the same
Cause, the <hi>Cold</hi> of the Water?
without much difficulty, as I
conjecture. For, it seems not
unreasonable, that the same
Cold, which hinders Must from
fermenting, should yet accelerate
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60736:93"/>
and promote the Clarification
of Wine after fermentation: in
the <hi>first,</hi> by giving checque to the
spirit before it begins to move
and act upon the crude mass of
liquor, so that it cannot in a long
time after recover strength
enough to work; in the <hi>Latter,</hi>
by keeping in the pure and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
spirit, otherwise apt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale,
and rendring the flying lee
more prone to subside, and so
making the wine much sooner
clear, fine and potable. And
thus much concerning the <hi>Helps</hi>
of <hi>New</hi> wine.¶</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Praeternatural,</hi> or sickly
commotions incident to wines
after their first Clarification, and
tending to their impoverishment
or decay; the <hi>general</hi> and principal
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60736:94"/>
                     <hi>Remedy</hi> is <hi>Racking,</hi> i. e. drawing
them from their Lees into fresh
vessels. Which yet being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
insufficient to preserve
them, <hi>Vintners</hi> find it necessary to
pour into them a large quantity
of new <hi>Milk,</hi> as well to blunt the
sharpness of the Sulphureous
parts now set afloat and exalted,
as to precipitate them and other
impurities to the bottom, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hesion.
But taught by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that by this means, the
Genuine Spirits of the Wine also
are much flatted and impaired
(for, the <hi>Lee,</hi> though it makes the
liquor turbid, doth yet keep the
wine in heart, and conduce to it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For the same disease they have
divers other <hi>Remedies,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
accommodated to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Wine that needs them;
to instance in a few,</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Spanish</hi> Wines disturbed by
a <hi>Flying Lee;</hi> they have this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt.

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60736:95"/>
refined, and the Wine drink plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly,
but will not continue to

counsel to rack it from the Milky

lest otherwise it should

all night in two or three gallons
of the same wine, and having
strained the infusion through a

Hoggshead (sometimes they
suffer it first to fine of it self in a
Rundler) and then cover the
bung-hole with a tile, and so let
it stand for 2 or 3 dayes; in
which time the wine usually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
well-coloured and bright.</p>
                  <p>Some use only the tincture of
<hi>Turnsol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others take half a bushel of
full-ripe <hi>Elder-berries,</hi> pick them
from their stalks, bruise them, and
put the strain'd juice into a hoggs-head
of discoloured Claret; and

Others, if the Claret be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
sound, and the Lee good,
overdraw 3 or 4 gallons; then
replenish the vessel with as much
good <hi>Red Wine,</hi> and rowl him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his bed, leaving him reversed
all night: next morning turn
him again so as the bung-hole
may be uppermost, which stopt,
they leave the wine to fine. But
in all these cases they observe to
set such newly recovered wines
abroach, the very next day after
they are fined, and to draw them
for sale speedily.</p>
                  <p>To correct wines faulty in
<hi>Consistence, i. e.</hi> such as are <hi>lumpish,
foul,</hi> or <hi>Ropy;</hi> they generally
make use of the powders of burnt
<hi>Alum, Line, Chalk, Plaistre, Spanish

White, Calcined Marble, bay Salt,</hi> and
other the like bodies, which
cause a precipitation of the gross
and viscid parts of the wine then
afloat. For Example,</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Attenuation</hi> of <hi>Spanish</hi>
Wines, that are foul and lump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish;
having first rack'd them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a newly scented Cask, they
make a <hi>Parell</hi> of burn'd <hi>Alum,</hi> bay
<hi>Salt,</hi> and conduit <hi>Water:</hi> then
they add thereto a quart of <hi>Bean-Flower,</hi>
or powder of <hi>Rice</hi> (and
if the wine be also brown and
dusky, <hi>Milk,</hi> otherwise not) and
beating all these well together
with the wine, blow off the froth,
and cover the bung with a clean

the wine after a few dayes, and
put it into a Cask well Scented.</p>

                  <p>Here perhaps some, not well

this <hi>Scenting</hi> of Casks, will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me if I make a short stand
to explain it.</p>
                  <p>They take of <hi>Brimstone 4 ounces,</hi>
of burn'd <hi>Alum 1 ounce,</hi> of <hi>Aqua
vitae, 2 ounces;</hi> these they put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in an earthen pan, or
pipkin; and hold them over a
a Chausing dish of glowing coals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
till the <hi>Brimstone</hi> is melted and

sprinkle thereon the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>Nutmeggs, Cloves, Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andre</hi>

<hi>Canvas</hi> they fire, and let it burn
out in the bung-hole, so as the
fume may be received into the

                  <p>To cure the <hi>Ropiness</hi> of <hi>Claret,</hi>
the Vintners as well <hi>French</hi> as
<hi>English</hi> have many <hi>Remedies,</hi>
among which I have selected two
or three, as most memorable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
most usual.</p>
                  <p>One is this, <hi>First,</hi> they give the
Wine a <hi>Parell,</hi> then draw it from
the <hi>Lee,</hi> after the clarification by
that Parell; this done, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
2 <hi>pound</hi> of <hi>Turnsol</hi> in good
<hi>Sack</hi> all night, and the next day
putting the strain'd infusion into
a hoggshead of the Wine, with
a spring funnel, leave it to fine,
and after draw it for excellent
Wine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another</hi> this, They make a
Lee of the ashes of <hi>Vine-branches,</hi>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:60736:100"/>
or of <hi>Oaken leaves,</hi> and pour it
into the wine hot, and after stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
leave it to settle. The
quantity, a quart of Lee, to a
Pipe of Wine.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>third</hi> is only <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi>
which put into muddy Claret,
serves to the refining it effectually
and speedily: the proportion
being a pint of Spirit to a hoggs-head.
But this is not to be used
in sharp and eagre Wines.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>White</hi> wines grow foul
and tawny, they only rack them
on a fresh <hi>Lee,</hi> and give them time
to fine.</p>
                  <p>For the Emendation of Wines
offending in <hi>Taste, Vintners</hi> have
few other Correctives, but what
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60736:101"/>
conduce to <hi>Clarification.</hi> Nor do
they indeed much need variety
in the case; seeing all Unsavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness
of Wines whatever seems
to proceed from their impurities
set afloat, and the dominion of
either their Sulphureous, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
parts over the finer and
sweeter; which causes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
chiefly by <hi>Precipitation.</hi>
For, all <hi>Clarification</hi> of liquors
may be referred to one of these
three causes: (1.) <hi>Separation</hi> of
the grosser parts of the liquor
from the finer; (2.) The equal
<hi>distribution</hi> of the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
which alwayes rendreth
bodies clear and untroubled;
(3.) The refining of the <hi>Spirit</hi>
it self. And the two latter are
consequents of the first, which
is effected chiefly by <hi>Precipitation,</hi>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:60736:101"/>
the instruments whereof are
<hi>weight</hi> and <hi>viscosity</hi> of the body
admixt, the one causing it to
cleave to the gross parts of the
liquor flying up and down in it,
the other sinking them to the
bottom. But this being more
than Vintners commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
they rest not in Clarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
alone; having found out
certain <hi>Specifics</hi> as it were, to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate
the several Vices of Wines
of all sorts, which make them
disgustfull. Of these likewise
I shall recite two or three, of
greatest use and esteem among
them.</p>
                  <p>To correct <hi>Rankness, Eagerness</hi>
and <hi>Pricking</hi> of <hi>Sacks</hi> and other
sweet Wines, they take 20 or
30 of the whitest <hi>Lime-stones,</hi> and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60736:102"/>
slack them in a gallon of the
wine; then they add more wine,
and stir them together in a
Half-tubb, with a Parelling-staff;
next they pour this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
into the Hoggshead, and
having again used the Parelling
instrument, leave the Wine to
settle, and then rack it. This
Wine I should guess to be no ill
drink for gross bodies and rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Brains; but hurtfull to
Good Fellows of hot and dry
constitutions, and meagre ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.</p>
                  <p>Against the <hi>Pricking</hi> of <hi>French</hi>
Wines, they prescribe this easie
and cheap composition. Take
of the powder of <hi>Flanders Tile</hi>
1 pound, of <hi>Roch Alum</hi> half a
pound, mix them and beat them
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60736:102"/>
well with a convenient quantity
of the Wine, then put them into
the hoggshead, as the former.</p>
                  <p>When their <hi>Rhenish</hi> Wines
prick, they first rack them into
a clean and strongly-scented
Cask or Vate; then add to the
wine 8 or 10 gallons of clarified
<hi>Hony,</hi> with a gallon or two of
skim-<hi>milk,</hi> and beating all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
leave them to settle.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it happens, that
<hi>Claret</hi> loseth much of its briskness
and Picquantness; and in such
case they rack it upon a good
Lee of <hi>Red</hi> Wine, and put into
it a gallon of the juice of <hi>Slows</hi> or
<hi>Bullies,</hi> which, after a little fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
and rest, makes the
wine drink brisk and rough.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60736:103"/>
The like hath been sometimes
done, as I have been told by a
<hi>Drawer,</hi> with <hi>Virginian Pears,</hi>
call'd <hi>Metaguesunaux.</hi> Which
seems highly probable, because
that Fruit is of colour deeply
sanguine, and very austere and
rough of taste, as I observed in
some that were given me some
years since.</p>
                  <p>To meliorate the taste of
<hi>Hungry</hi> and too Eagre <hi>White-Wines,</hi>
they draw off 3 or 4 gallons of
the Wine, and infusing therein
as many pounds of <hi>Malago Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins,</hi>
stoned and bruised in a stone
Mortar, till the Wine hath suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
imbibed their sweetness
and tincture (which it will do
in a dayes time) they run it
through an <hi>Hippocras</hi> bagg, then
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60736:103"/>
put it into a fresh Cask, well
scented, together with the whole
remainder of the wine in the
hoggshead, and so leave it to
fine.</p>
                  <p>To help <hi>Stinking</hi> wines, the
general Remedy is <hi>Racking</hi> them
from their old and corrupt Lee.
Besides which, some give them
a fragrant smell or <hi>Flavor,</hi> by
hanging in them little baggs of
spices, such as <hi>Ginger, Zed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ry,
Cloves, Cinnamon, Orras</hi> roots, <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebs,
Grains of Paradise, Spiknard,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Aromaticks.</hi> Others boyle
some of these Spices in a Pottle
of good sound wine of the same
sort, and turn up the dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion
hot. Others correct the ill sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of rank-leed <hi>French</hi> wine
with only a few <hi>Cinnamon</hi> canes
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60736:104"/>
hung in them. Others again for
the same end use <hi>Elder Flowers,</hi>
and topps of <hi>Lavender.</hi> ¶.</p>
                  <p>Having thus run over three
parts of the <hi>Vintners Dispensatory,</hi>
and transcribed many of their

                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning these, therefore
it is observable, that as whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Wines are in praeternatural Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions,
from an excess and
predomination of their Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous
parts, the grand Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
is to <hi>Rack</hi> them from their
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60736:104"/>
Lee: so, on the contrary, when
they decline and tend toward
<hi>Palling,</hi> by reason of the scarcity
of their Spirits and Sulphur; the
most effectual Preservative is to
rack them upon other Lees, richer
and stronger than their own; that
being from thence supplyed with
new Spirits, they may acquire
somewhat more of vigour and
quickness. I say <hi>Preservative;</hi>
because there is, in truth, no
<hi>Restoring</hi> of wines after they are
perfectly pall'd and dead, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is past perfection, and
hath run its natural race once,
can receive much amendment.</p>
                  <p>But besides reinforcing of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverished
wines by new and
more generous Lees, there are
sundry <hi>Confections,</hi> by which also,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60736:105"/>
as by <hi>Cordials,</hi> the languishing
spirits of them may be sustained,
and to some degree recruited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Of which I here bring two or
three particular examples.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Sacks</hi> begin to languish
(which doth not often happen,
especially in this <hi>City,</hi> where are
so many <hi>Sack-drinkers)</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
them with a <hi>Cordial syrup<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
made of most generous <hi>Wine,</hi> of
<hi>Sugar</hi> and <hi>Spices.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Rhenish</hi> and <hi>White</hi> wines, a
simple decoction of <hi>Raisins</hi> of
the Sun, and a strong-scented
Cask, usually serve the turn.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Claret</hi> inclining to a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption;</hi>
they prescribe a new
and richer <hi>Lee,</hi> and the shaving<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Firr</hi> wood; that he Spirits
being recruited by the additional
Lee, may be kept from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haling,
by the unctuous sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the <hi>Turpentine.</hi> Which
artifice I have often observed, at
the time of my being at <hi>Paris,</hi>
to be used in the most delicate
and thin-bodied Wines of
<hi>France:</hi> and seems to me, no
improbable cause of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
dulness and pain of
the head, which alwayes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
upon Debauches made
with such Wines.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it a Modern invention,
but well known to, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
put in use by the old

You have heard the summe
of what I have my self obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and what I have transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
from the <hi>Manuscripts</hi> of some
very skilfull <hi>Vintners,</hi> which I had
the good luck to peruse; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Remedies</hi> of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>sicknesses,</hi> to which <hi>Wines</hi> are
obnoxious.</p>
                  <p>It remains only, that I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Your patience, a minute
or two longer, with a taste of
the more disingenuous practices
of <hi>Vintners,</hi> in the <hi>Transmutation</hi>
or <hi>Sophistication</hi> of Wines, which
they call <hi>Trickings</hi> or <hi>Compassings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They transform poor <hi>Rochel</hi>
and <hi>Cogniak</hi> White wines into
<hi>Rhenish;</hi> Rhenish into <hi>Sack;</hi>

of <hi>Raisins;</hi> they sell decayed
<hi>Xeres,</hi> vulgarly <hi>Sherry,</hi> for <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senna</hi>
wine: in all these impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
deluding the palate so
neatly, that few are able to
discern the fraud; and keeping
these <hi>Arcana Lucrifera</hi> so close,
that fewer can come to the
knowledge of them. So that
we may say, as <hi>Pliny</hi> did, in the
close of his chapter touching the
Sophistication of wines, in his
dayes; <hi>tot veneficiis placere cogitur,
&amp; miramur noxium esse vinum?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for their metamorphosis
of <hi>White</hi> into <hi>Claret,</hi> by dashing
it with <hi>Red;</hi> nothing is more
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60736:107"/>
commonly either done or
known.</p>
                  <p>For their conversion of <hi>White</hi>
into <hi>Rhenish;</hi> they have several
artifices to effect it, among
which this is most usual.</p>
                  <p>They take a hogshead of
<hi>Rochel,</hi> or <hi>Cogniak,</hi> or <hi>Nants</hi> White
wine; rack it into a fresh Cask,
strongly scented; then give the
white <hi>Parell:</hi> put into it 8 or
10 gallons of clarified Hony, or
40 pounds of cours Sugar, and
beating it well, leave it to clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.
To give this mixture the
delicate <hi>Flavour,</hi> they sometimes
add a Decoction of <hi>Clary</hi> seeds,
or <hi>Gallitricum;</hi> of which Druggs
there is an incredible quantity
used yearly at <hi>Dort,</hi> where now
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60736:108"/>
is the <hi>Staple</hi> of Rhenish wines.
And this is that Drink, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
our English <hi>Ladies</hi> are so
much delighted, under the
specious name of <hi>Rhenish in the
Must.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The manner of making adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>Bastard,</hi> is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Recipe,</hi> Four gallons of <hi>White</hi> wine,
three gallons of old <hi>Canary,</hi>
five pounds of <hi>Bastard</hi> Syrup,
beat them well together; put
them into a clean Rundlet,
well scented; and give them
time to fine.</p>

                     <hi>Sack</hi> is made of <hi>Rhenish,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by strong Decoctions of

                     <hi>Muskadel</hi> is sophisticated with

                  <p>They dissolve in a convenient
quantity of <hi>Rose-water,</hi> of <hi>Musk</hi>
2 ounces, of <hi>Calamus Aromaticus</hi>
powder'd 1 <hi>ounce,</hi> of <hi>Coriander</hi> seed
beaten <hi>half an ounce;</hi> and while
this infusion is yet warm, they
put it into a Rundlet of old Sack,

a <hi>Flavour for Muskadel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many other wayes there are of
<hi>Adulterating</hi> Wines, daily practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

                  <head>SOME
OBSERVATIONS
Concerning the
ORDERING OF WINES.</head>
                  <byline>By Dr. Merret.</byline>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Mysterie of Wines
consists in the making
and meliorating of
Natural Wines. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioration
is either of sound or
vitious Wines. Sound Wines
are bettered, 1. By preserving.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60736:110"/>
2. Timely fining. 3. by mending
Colour, Smell or Taste.</p>
                  <p>To preserve Wines, care must
be taken, that, after the Pressing,
they may ferment well: for
without good Fermentation,
they become <hi>qually</hi> (i. e.) cloudy,
thick and dusky, and will never
fine of themselves as other
Wines do: and when they are
fined by Art, they must be spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
spent, or else they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>qually</hi> again, and then by
no Art recoverable.</p>
                  <p>The Principal Impediments
of the Fermentation of Wines,
after pressing the Grapes, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Unripeness when ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
or the mixture of Rain
water with them, as in wet
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60736:110"/>
Vintages; or else through the
addition of Water to rich Grapes.
The Spaniards use <hi>Giesso</hi> to help
the Fermentation of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Wines.</p>
                  <p>To preserve Spanish Wines,
and chiefly Canary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
principally that which is
<hi>Razie,</hi> which will not keep so
long; they make a Layer of
Grapes and Giesso, whereby it
acquires a better durance and
taste, and a whiter Colour, most
pleasing to the English.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Razie</hi> wine, is so called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it comes from Rhenish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine
slips, sometimes renewed.
The Grape of this Wine is fleshy,
yielding but a little juice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:60736:111"/>
French and Rhenish wines
are chiefly and commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by the <hi>Match,</hi> thus, used
at <hi>Dort</hi> in Holland: Take
Brimstone 20 or 30 pounds,
rack, into it melted, Spices, as
Cloves, Cinnamon, Mace,
Ginger and Coriander-seeds
and some to save charges use
the reliques of the Hippocras
bag; and having mixed these
well with the Brimstone they
draw through this Mixture,
long, square, narrow pieces of
Canvas, which pieces thus
drawn through the said mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they light and put into the
Vessel at the Bung-hole, and
presently stop it close: Great
care is to be had in proportioning
the Brimstone to the quantity
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60736:111"/>
and quality of the wine; for
too much makes it rough; this
smoaking keeps the wine long,
white, and good, and gives it
a pleasant taste.</p>
                  <p>There's another way for
French and Rhenish wines, <hi>viz.
Firing</hi> it: 'tis done in a stove,
or else a good fire made round
about the Vessel, which will
gape wide, yet the wine runs
not out; 'twill boyle, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
may soon be rack'd.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For timely fining
of wines. All Wines in the
Must are more opacous and
cloudy. Good wine soon fines,
and the gross Lees settle quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and also the flying Lee in
time. When the grosser Lees
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60736:112"/>
are setled, they draw off the
Wine, called <hi>Racking.</hi> The
usual times for Racking, are
Midsommer and Alhallon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide.</p>
                  <p>The practice of the Dutch
and English to rid the wine of
the flying Lees speedily, and
serves most for French and
Spanish wine, is thus perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Take of Isinglass half a
pound, stop it in half a pint of
the hardest French wine that
can be got, so that the wine may
fully cover it. Let them then
stand 24 hours, then pull and
beat the Isinglass to pieces, and
add more wine, and 4 times
a day squeez it to a gelly, and
as it thickens add more wine.
When 'tis fully and perfectly
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60736:112"/>
gellyed, Take a Pint or Quart
to a Hogshead and so proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably:
then overdraw 3 or 4
Gallons of that wine you intend
to fine, which mix well with the
said quantity of gelly, then put
this mixture to the piece of
wine and beat it with a staffe,
and fill it top-full. Note that
French-wines must be bunged
up very close, but not the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish;
and that Isinglass raiseth
the Lees to the top of strong
wines, but in weaker precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth
it to the bottom.</p>
                  <p>They mend the Colour of
sound Clarets by adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Red-wine, Tent or Alicant,
or by an infusion of Turnsole
made in 2 or 3 Gallons of wine,
and then putting it into the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60736:113"/>
Vessel, to be then (being well
stopt) rowled for a quarter of
an hour. This infusion is
sometimes twice or thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
according as more Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
is to be added to the wine;
some 3 hours infusion of the
Turnsole is sufficient, but then
it must be rubbed and wringed.
What Turnsole is, see the Notes
on the Art of Glass.</p>
                  <p>Claret over-red, is amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Addition of White-wines.</p>
                  <p>White wines coming over
sound but brown, thus reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died:
Take of Alablaster-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
over-draw the Hogshead
3 or 4 Gallons, then put this
powder into the Bung, and stir
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60736:113"/>
and beat it with a staff, and fill
it top-full. The more the
wine is stirred, the finer it will
come upon the Lee, that is, the
finer it will be.</p>
                  <p>To colour Sack white; Take
of white Starch 2 pounds, of
Milk 2 Gallons, boyle them
together 2 hours, when cold
beat them well with a handfull
of white Salt, and then put
them into a clean and sweet
Butt, beating them with a staff,
and the wine will be pure and
white.</p>
                  <p>One pound of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
gelly of Isinglass
takes away the browness of
French and Spanish wines,
mix'd with 2 or 3 gallons of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60736:114"/>
wine, accoriding as 'tis brown
and strong, more or less to be
used. Then overdraw the peice
of wine about 8 gallons, and use
the Rod, and then fill the Vessel
full, and in a day or two 'twill
fine and be white, and mend if
qualley.</p>
                  <p>The first Buds of <hi>Ribes nigra</hi>
infused in wines, especially
Rhenish, makes it diuretick and
more fragrant in Smell and
Taste, and so doth Clary. The
inconvenience is, that the Wine
becomes more heady: a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
whereof is Elder-flowers
added to the Clary; which also
betters the fragrancy thereof, as
'tis manifest in Elder-vinegar.
But these flowers are apt to make
the wine Ropy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:60736:114"/>
To help brown Malago's and
Spanish wines; Take powder
of Orras-roots and Salt-peter of
each 4 ounces, the whites of
8 eggs, whereto add as much
Salt as will make a brine, put
this mixture into the Wine, and
mix them with a Staff.</p>
                  <p>To meliorate Muddy and
Tauny Clarets; Take of Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
2 pints, the Yelks of
8 Eggs, Salt an handfull, beat
them well, let them stand 6 hours
before you put them into the
Cask, then use the Rod, and in
3 dayes it will come to it
self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:60736:115"/>
To amend the Taste and
Smell of Malago. Take of
the best Almonds 4 pounds,
make therewith, and with suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
quantity of the wine to
be cured, an Emulsion; then
take the whites and yelks of
12 Eggs, beat them together
with Salt an handfull, put
them into the Pipe, using the
Rod.</p>
                  <p>To amend the smell and taste
of French and Rhenish which
are foul. Take, to an Auln of
the Wine, of honey one pound,
of Elder-flowers a handfull,
Orras powder an ounce, one
Nutmeg, a few Cloves, boyle
them in sufficient quantity of
the wine to be cured, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60736:115"/>
of half, when 'tis
cold, strain and use it with the
Rod: some add a little Salt.
If the wine be sweet enough,
add of spirits of Wine one pound
to a hoggshead, and give the
Cask a strong scent. Spirit of
Wine makes any wine brisk, and
fines it without the former mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>A lee of the Ashes of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches,
<hi>viz.</hi> a quart to a Pipe,
being beaten into the wine, cures
the ropiness of it; and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
doth a Lee of Oaken
Ashes. For Spanish ropy wine,
rack it from its Lees into a new
scented Cask, then take of Alum
one pound, Orras roots powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
half a pound, beat them well
into the wine with a staff. Some
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60736:116"/>
add fine and well-dryed sand,
put warm to the wine. If the
wine besides prove brown, add
3 pottles of Milk to a Pipe.
<hi>Alias,</hi> the <hi>Spaen</hi> cures ropy wine,
used before it begins to fret.</p>
                  <p>Herrings Roes preserve any
Stum wines.</p>
                  <p>To order Rhenish wines when
fretting. Commonly in <hi>Iune</hi>
that Wines begin to ferment and
grow sick, then have a special
care not to disturb it, either by
removing, filling the Vessel, or
giving it Vent, only open the
Bung, which cover with a slate,
and as often as the slate is foul,
cleanse it and the bung from
their filth, and when the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
is past, which you
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60736:116"/>
shall know by applying your
Ear to the Vessel, then give it
rest 10 or 12 dayes that the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
Lees may settle, then rack it
into a fresh scented Cask.</p>
                  <p>This mixture meliorates vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
wines both in smell and
taste; especially French. Take of
the best honey one part, of Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
two parts and one third
of sound old wine of the same
kind; boyle them on a gentle
fire to a third part, scumming
them often with a clean Scum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
(to which purpose they
have a payle of fair water
standing by to rince it in) then
put this mixture hot into a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of fit capacity, and let it stand
unbunged till cool. Some, to
better this, put in a bag of Spices.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60736:117"/>
This mixture, called by the
Dutch <hi>Soet,</hi> will serve also to
fine any Wine new or old.
2. 'Twill mend the hard taste
of wine <hi>(i. e.)</hi> putting a gallon
thereof to a hogshead, and
using the Rod, and then let it
rest 5 or 6 dayes at the least, but
if mild enough, add white
mustardseed bruised.</p>
                  <p>To mend and preserve the
Colour of Clarets. Take red
Beet-roots <hi>q. s.</hi> scrape them
clean and cut them into small
pieces, then boyle them in <hi>q. s.</hi>
of the same wine, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of a third part, scum
it well, and when cool, decant
off what's clear, and use the
Rod.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:60736:117"/>
                     <hi>Alias,</hi> Take of the wine and
honey of each 2 pounds, Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
a pottle. 12. Beet-roots,
ripe Mulberries 4 or 5 handfulls,
boyle them to half, and when
cool decant, <hi>&amp;c. ut suprà.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To preserve Claret rack'd
from its Lees. Take to a Tierce
10 Eggs, make a small hole in the
top of the shells, then put them
into the wine, and all will be
consumed.</p>
                  <p>To prevent souring of French
wines. Take Grains of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
<hi>q. s.</hi> beat them in a pan,
and hang them or put them
loose into a vessel. Some use
Lavender tops.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:60736:118"/>
To help sour French wine.
Take of the best wheat 4 ounces
boyled in fair water till it break,
and when cold put it into a Vat
in a bag, and use the Rod. <hi>Alias,</hi>
Take 5 or 6 Cinnamon canes,
bung them up well.</p>
                  <p>To help Spanish sour wines.
First rack the wine into a clean
Cask, and fill it up with two
or three Gallons of water, and
add thereto of burnt Chalk
4 ounces, and after 3 or 4 dayes
it must be rackt and filled up
again with rain water, if the
first time doth not do it. Some
use Loam or Plastering. If
these Ingredients make the
Wine bitter, correct the fault
with Nutmegs and Cloves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:60736:118"/>
To help stinking wines.
Take Ginger half an ounce,
Zedoary 2 drachms, powder
and boyle them in a pottle of
good wine, which put scald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hot into the Vat: bung it
up and let it lye; the species
of <hi>Diambrae</hi> and <hi>Diamoscu Dulc</hi>
do the same; and so Nutmegs
and Cloves which also give a
kind of Raziness.</p>
                  <p>To help Wine that hath an
ill savour from the Lees.
First, rack it into a clean Cask,
and if Red or Claret, give him
a fresh Lee of the same kind:
Then take of Cloves, Ginger
and Cinnamon 2 ounces, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras-root
4 ounces; powder
them grosly, hang them in a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60736:119"/>
bag, and taste the wine once
in 3 dayes, and when 'tis
amended take out the bagg.
Some do it thus, Take of
Cloves half a pound, Mastick,
Ginger, Cubebs, of each 2
ounces, <hi>Spica nardi</hi> 3 drachms,
Orras root half a pound, make
thereof a fine powder, which
put loose into the Vat, and use
the Rod, then make a good fire
before it.</p>
                  <p>Firing of Wines in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
is thus performed: they
have in some Vaults 3 or 4
Stoves, which they heat ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hot; others make fires al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
before every Vat; by
this means the Must ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with that Vehemency, that
the wine appears between the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60736:119"/>
staves; when this Ebullition,
fermentation and working ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
let the Wine stand some
dayes, and then rack it. This
firing is only used in cold
years, when the wine falls out
green.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Stum</hi> is nothing else but
pure wine kept from fretting
by often racking and match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in clean Vessels and
strongly scented <hi>(i. e.)</hi> new
matched, by means whereof
it becomes as clear or clearer
than any other Wine, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it self from both its Lees
by precipitation of them:
But if through neglect it once
fret, it becomes good Wine.
The Bung of the Vessel must
be continually stopt, and the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60736:120"/>
Vessels strong left they break.
A little Stum put to Wine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed,
makes it ferment afresh,
and gives life and sweetness
thereto, but offends the head
and stomach, torments the guts,
and is apt to cause loosnesses,
and some say Barrenness in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                  <p>To Fine Wine presently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Fill a Cask with shavings or
chips of Beech or Oak (which
are best) this is to be done
with much art, or else it sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
hits right, but lasteth
long: put these chips into a
Cask which is called by the
Dutch <hi>een Spaen (i. e.)</hi> a Chip,
into which they pour in as
much Wine as the Cask will
hold, and in 24 hours the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60736:120"/>
wine will be fine. Or a
quart of Vinegar in three
dayes will fine a hogshead of
Wine.</p>
                  <p>To set old Wine a fretting
being deadish and dull in taste.
Take of Stum 2 Gallons, to
a hogshead, put it hot upon
the wine, then set a pan of
fire before the hogshead, which
will then ferment till all the
sweetness of the Stum is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to the wine, which
thereby becomes brisk and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant.
Some use this Stumming
at any time, some in <hi>August</hi> only,
when the wine hath a Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to fret of it self, more or less
Stum to be added, as the wine
requires.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:60736:121"/>
The best time to rack wine
is the decrease of the Moon,
and when the wine is free
from fretting; the wind being
at North-east or North-west,
and not at South, the Sky se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene,
free from Thunder and
Lightning.</p>
                  <p>Another Match for French
Clarets and Spanish wines.
Take Orras-roots, Mastick and
Brimstone, of each 4 ounces,
Cloves 2 ounces; ordering it
<hi>ut suprà</hi> in Matching wines.
This will serve for all wines,
adding if you please Nutmegs,
Ginger, Cinnamon and other
Spices. Double the quantity of
Orras root is to be used for Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
wines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:60736:121"/>
To help Malago's which
will not fine. Take of crude
Tartar powdered, sifted and
dryed, 2 pounds, mix it with
the whites of 6 Eggs: dry,
powder and sift them again,
then overdraw the Pipe as much
as will serve to mix with this
powder, and fill the Pipe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
beating it with a Staff as
before, and this wine will be
Fine in ten dayes.</p>
                  <p>Another speedy way to fine
French wines. Hang a piece
of scent in the Cask, and when
'tis burnt out, put in a pint of
the best Spirit of Wine, and stir
it about. Some add, a little
salt well dryed. This fines the
wine in 24 hours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:60736:122"/>
To keep Must a Year. Take
Must, put it into a Cask pitcht
within and without, half full,
stop the bung close with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Others few the Cask in
Skins, and sink it for 30 dayes
into a Well or River. Or else a
Garland of <hi>Polium Montanum</hi>
hung in the Vessel. Or rub the
inside of the Vessel with Cheese:
all these preserve Rhenish Must,
<hi>As the Scholiast on Dodonaus in
Dutch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alum put into a hogs-blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
keeps wine from turning
flat, faint or brown and beaten
with the whites of Eggs removes
its ropiness.</p>
                  <p>

Flat Wines recovered with
spirit of Wine, Raisins and
Sugar or Melosses; and Sacks,
by drawing them on fresh
Lees.</p>
                  <p>Our Wine-Coopers of lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
times use vast quantities
of Sugar and Melosses to all
sorts of Wines, to make
them drink brisk and spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and to give them Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
as also to mend their
bad tastes, all which Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins

Countrey Vintners feed
their fretting Wines with raw
Beef; and here, their Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with Malago, which is
added more or less to all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries.</p>
                  <p>The Composition of Wines
is manifold, the Vintners usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
drawing out of 2 or 3
Casks, for one Pint, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
it to the Palate of those
that drink it. Most of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
is made with Malago and
Zerez Sack.</p>
                  <p>I shall conclude with two
common compunded Wines,
<hi>Muscaden</hi> and <hi>Hippocrass:</hi> the
former usually made with 30
Gallons of <hi>Cute</hi> (which is
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60736:123"/>
Wine boyled to the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of half) to a Butt of
Wine. Or the Lees and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings
boyl'd and clarified;
its Flavour is made of Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
seeds prepared and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
of Cyprus wood. Some
instead of Cute, make it of
Sugar, Melosses and Honey,
or mix them with the
Cute. This following is an
Hypocrass of my own mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the best I have
tasted.</p>
                  <p>Take of Cardamoms, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pobalsamus
of each half an
ounce, Coriander seeds prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
Nutmegs, Ginger, of each
2 ounces, Cloves 2 drachms;
bruise and infuse them 48
hours in Zerez and White wine,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60736:124"/>
of each a Gallon, often stirring
them; then add thereto of Milk
3 pints, strain through an
Hippocrass bag, and sweeten
it with a pound of Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candy.</p>
