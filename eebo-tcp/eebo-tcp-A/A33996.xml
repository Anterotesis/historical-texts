            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOt becauſe I envy the Perſon of any Man of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, ſo conſequently not thoſe of the <hi>Papal</hi> Church, who at preſent I am concerned with; but 'tis their Capital Errors, and Damnable Principles I aim at in this my Diſcourſe, knowing they are contrary and repugnant to the Word of Truth, which is the Rule of Faith and Manners, and having compaſſion on Souls, which may be Ignorant, leſt they ſhould fall into the Errors of the Wicked (and eſpecially young ones) which are not aware of their Principles, I have taken a little pains to gather up ſome of their Horrid Practices, and Soul-deſtroying Principles, into a narrow Compaſs, that ſo in a little time any may perceive what kind of condition they ſhall be in that do taſte, touch, or handle any of them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beg of you all to whom this ſhall come, to reade it conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and compare their Principles and Practices with the Word of God, and you will ſee that there is as much difference between them, as between Light and Darkneſs, Good and Evil, Heaven and Hell, God and the Devil. And this is not my Opinion alone, but the Opinion of almoſt all the Reformed Churches: For that the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> hath been put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to moſt of the Confeſſions of Faith. I ſhall only recite the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of one, whoſe incomparable Learning and Piety may make his Words received, or mine at leaſt not over-haſtily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; it is the Reverend Doctor <hi>Uſher,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> who in his Catechiſe writ thus.</p>
            <p>
               <q>As <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Head of the True Church, ſo <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is the Head of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, which is his Body.</q>

            </head>
            <p>BEloved Friends and Country-Men, I am this Day, as God's Meſſenger, to remind you of a very Signal, but almoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forgotten Deliverance, which <hi>England</hi> received in the Year 1605, from that <hi>helliſh Powder-plot</hi> of the <hi>blood-thirſty Papiſts:</hi> Which was not only a general Mercy then received; but as it was a kindneſs to our Grand-Fathers and Fathers, ſo alſo to us: For had <hi>Popery</hi> then entred <hi>England</hi> (which hath been, yet is, and I hope will be <hi>Emmanuel's Land) what in all probability had we been at this time!</hi> (Now for as much as <hi>God delights to have his wonderful Works remembred,</hi> (Pſal. 111. 4.) by thoſe that are in the fruition and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them; and more eſpecially, conſidering the need we may have of as great a kindneſs as then received, already through Grace begun to be ſhewed, the Lord of his rich Mercy bring <hi>Ahitophel</hi>'s Counſel to nought totally) what cauſe have we to be praiſing God this day! that ſo your Hearts may be animated and ſtirred up to the Work. I ſhall in this my Diſcourſe at this time, run a Parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the wicked Conſpiracy made againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>People of God</hi> in the days of King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> and the <hi>hellith Powder-Plot</hi> in the days of <hi>King James of happy Memory, for defending the Proteſtant Religion, and diſcountenancing the contrary;</hi> and I hope by that time I have done, you will ſee what great cauſe there is to bleſs God for his unſpeakable Goodneſs, and alſo ſee what <hi>Enemies Papiſts are</hi> to all true <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and ſo I ſhall now begin what I have to ſay.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As in the days of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> (who Reigned from <hi>India</hi> even to <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> over one hundred and ſeven and twenty Provinces, <hi>Eſther</hi> 1. 1.) there was a <hi>Maſſacre</hi> deſigned upon all the Men, Women, and Children, which were of the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> (the Church of God) <hi>Eſther</hi> 3. 13.</p>
            <p>So in the days of <hi>King James</hi> 1605. (about ſeventy three Years ſince) there was a <hi>Powder-Plot</hi> againſt this Nation, and all the People of God; for there was <hi>thirty ſix Barrels of Gun powder</hi> in a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58561:4"/>
Seller under the Parliament Houſe: And in ſtead of Shot, they had laid upon the Powder, Bars of Iron, Logs of Timber, maſſy Stones, Iron Crows, Pickaxes, and all their working Tools; and to cover all (that the <hi>Plot</hi> might not be diſcovered) they had laid great ſtore of Billets and Faggots; ſo that nothing was wanting to carry on their <hi>wicked Deſign:</hi> Neither were the Jeſuites and Prieſts ſlack on their parts, who uſually concluded their Maſſes with Prayers for the ſucceſs of that <hi>Good day,</hi> as they called it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The chief Conſpirator in King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi>'s days was wicked <hi>Haman,</hi> a Perſon of no ſmall note.</p>
            <p>So in like manner, thoſe that had a hand in this <hi>Gun-powder Plot,</hi> were great Men, men of Note, ſome that could give many Hundreds to carry it on. Mr. <hi>Percy,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Catesby,</hi> finding the Charge lay heavy, call in Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi> of <hi>Rutlandſhire,</hi> and <hi>Francis Treſham,</hi> Eſquire. <hi>Catesby</hi> alſo took in <hi>Ambroſe Rockwood,</hi> and <hi>John Graunt,</hi> two Recuſant Gentlemen, beſides <hi>Winter, Fanks, John Writh.</hi> And Sir <hi>Edmund Baynam,</hi> an attainted Perſon (who ſtiled himſelf <hi>Prince of the damned Crew)</hi> was ſent to the Pope to acquaint him of the <hi>Gun-powder Plot.</hi> Theſe were ſome of the Inſtruments imployed in this Deſign.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And as <hi>Haman</hi> was willing to be at vaſt Expences to have the <hi>Jews</hi> Maſſacre'd; for he offers <hi>ten thouſand Talents of Silver</hi> for the accompliſhing the thing, <hi>Eſther</hi> 3. 9.</p>
            <p>So thoſe men, and many more, did not care what Expences they were at. Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi> offers <hi>one thouſand five hundred Pounds,</hi> and <hi>Treſham two thouſand,</hi> and <hi>Percy, four thouſand,</hi> to forward the Action. And they were in great hopes of having in a few Months ten times as much. The <hi>Pope himſelf was willing to give one Million of Money to compleat the Spaniſh Armada,</hi> which he called the <hi>Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Armada,</hi> but God made it vincible; for of <hi>one hundred and thirty four ſail of Ships</hi> that came for <hi>England,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Drake with eight Fire-ſhips,</hi> by God's bleſſing, deſtroyed ſo many of them, that but <hi>fifty four</hi> returned to <hi>Spain.</hi> But will the <hi>Pope</hi> give this Million of Money <hi>gratis,</hi> and expect nothing for it? No I'le warrant you, for he lays but one half down, and the other half when they had won any notable Haven in our Dominions; and with this <hi>proviſo</hi> that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be held Tributary to the <hi>See of Rome;</hi> in token whereof he beſtows on the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> his <hi>Apoſtolical Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> and the Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith.</hi> Not at ſo little Charge was the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whom the Pope animated to the Work, by perſuading him that the Church of God could not be more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly

            <p>His Charges muſt needs be great, for they were five Years a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring their Fleet, which conſiſted of <hi>an hundred thirty and four Sail,</hi> containing <hi>fifty ſeven thouſand eight hundred and eight Tun,</hi> wherein were <hi>eight thouſand and forty five Mariners, nineteen thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninety five Souldiers,</hi> to cut the poor Proteſtants Throats, had they been landed: <hi>Two thouſand eighty eight Gally-Slaves;</hi> and ſo ſure were they that <hi>England</hi> ſhould pay the Shot, they ſpared no coſt for Furniſhing; they were provided for Sea and Land; they had Bullets of great ſhot <hi>two hundred and twenty thouſand,</hi> of Powder <hi>four thouſand,</hi> and <hi>two hundred Kintals,</hi> every Kintal containing one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound weight; Muſquets <hi>ſeven thouſand;</hi> of Partizans and Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts <hi>ten thouſand,</hi> with ſtore of other murthering Pieces, as double Cannon; they had alſo ſtore of Torches, Lamps, Lanthorns, <hi>Whips, Butcherly Knives, to murder and torment the poor Engliſh.</hi> This Army coſt the King of <hi>Spain</hi> thirty two thouſand Ducats every day. Oh who would be at ſuch charges to do God ſervice, as the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>King of Spain, Catesby, Treſham, Percy, Haman,</hi> &amp;c. were to do the Devil ſervice!</p>

               <hi>Don Pedro</hi> being asked the queſtion of the intent of their coming to <hi>England</hi> by ſome of the Privy Council, ſtoutly anſwered, <hi>To ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due your Nation:</hi> But what would you have done with the <hi>Papiſts? We would have ſent them</hi> (good men) <hi>in the Nation to Heaven, and you Hereticks to Hell.</hi> But what meant you to do with your Whips of Cord and Wyer? <hi>We meant to whip Hereticks to death.</hi> But what would you have done with the young Children? Anſwer, <hi>Them that were above ſeven years old, ſhould have gone the ſame way their Fathers did, them under ſhould have lived; only we would have branded them in the Forehead with the letter L. for Lutherans, and reſerved them for perpetual Bondage.</hi> This <hi>Rome</hi>'s cruelty is one infallible mark of her being <hi>the Whore of Babylon,</hi> which is a better ſign of her being a falſe Church, than her pretence of Unity, Antiquity, Univerſality, Infallibility and Miracles will render her to be a true one. For theſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58561:5"/>
Denominations do as rightly belong to the Devil himſelf, as to her; I conceive to both alike.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The chief cauſe and reaſon why <hi>Haman</hi> ſought the lives of the <hi>Jews,</hi> was, becauſe <hi>Mordecai</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> would not bow and ſtoop to him: He was ſo full of Ambition, that all the Honour the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him ſignified nothing, ſo long as <hi>Mordecai</hi> would not bow, <hi>Eſther</hi> 5. 13.</p>
            <p>So in like manner, becauſe we will not bow to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg him to be Head of the Church, who is a great Enemy to God, by worſhipping Idols; to Chriſt, by its new-found Mediators; to the Holy Ghoſt, by putting a <hi>Pope</hi> in his room; to the Scripture by its Legends and corrupt Traditions; to Reaſon, by its impoſed Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; to Common Senſe, by its moſt fooliſh and Idolized Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiations; to all tender diſſenting Conſciences, by Fire and Faggot; an Enemy alſo to all Civil Government that refuſes to be ſubject to it, by <hi>Plots, Aſſaſsinations,</hi> and horrid <hi>Maſſacres.</hi> Shall we ſtoop to her that will not ſtoop to God? Let <hi>Rome</hi> know, that as <hi>Mordecai</hi> which was a <hi>Jew</hi> would not ſtoop to <hi>Haman,</hi> Son of <hi>Hamadatha</hi> the <hi>Agagite, Eſther</hi> 3. 1. The Heathen King, the Perſon and People whom God ſent <hi>Saul</hi> to deſtroy, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 2, 3. which People were called <hi>Amalekites, Agag</hi> being King of them; they were a People ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Lord, and of whom God ſaid, <hi>Numb. 24. 20. That</hi> Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek <hi>was the firſt of the Nations, but his latter end ſhould be that he periſh for ever.</hi> Now <hi>Mordecai</hi> knowing that they were a People of God's hatred, and knowing <hi>Haman</hi> to be one of them, <hi>Mordecai</hi> out of Conſcience (I conceive) would not bow to him; and alſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they had been Enemies to the People of God.</p>
            <p>So in like manner, we knowing <hi>Rome</hi> to be an Enemy to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and that God hath purpoſed to deſtroy her, and give her <hi>Blood to drink,</hi> being worthy, <hi>Rev. 18. 6. becauſe ſhe hath drunk deep of the Blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus,</hi> and alſo becauſe ſhe ſets at nought God's holy Word; therefore we cannot, we will not bow to her Golden Image that ſhe hath ſet up, notwithſtanding all her Threats. As <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> threatned the three Worthies with a burning fiery Furnace, if they would not bow down to the Image of Gold which he had ſet up. So this Mother of Harlots, if you will not put your Necks under her Yoke, <hi>then comes an Armada, an Inquiſition, a Maſſacre, a Powder-plot, Fire, Faggot, Racks, Aſſaſſinations, Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, witneſs Juſtice Godfry,</hi> Who for taking but an Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which was his Place, and Work, and Sworn to it, <hi>thoſe Men of Blood could not ſleep quietly, till their malice was vented on his Body,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58561:5"/>
by ſtrangling and other Tortures they put him to,</hi> as is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, to protract his miſery; and after a conſiderable time thruſt a Sword into his Body, to make the World believe it was his own Act. Surely had he done it himſelf, ſome Blood would have appeared on the Ground where he lay! but the Sword being run into his Body ſome conſiderable time after Strangling, the Blood being coagulated, nothing appears but a black Water, which uſually followeth after the Bloods coagulating: And that Act, inhumane and horrid Act, was done by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> is clear, from their taking his Pocket Book, where the Depoſitions and Examinations were; which was that they wanted, though not his Gold nor Silver. 'Tis true, his great Lace Band he went out withal in the Morning, was taken away, the Gentleman being ſtrangled, doubtleſs the Band was torn in the Fray; and to have let that gone, would have told the Story too plainly. <hi>But this Blood, as well as the Blood of many millions more, crieth for Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. That one inſtance in Ireland, in that moſt inhumane Maſſacre in 1642, wherein were more than three hundred thouſand in a few days put to Death; ſome burnt, ſome ſlain with the Sword, ſome ſhot to Death, ſome ſmothered, ſome ſtarved and pined to Death, ſome killed with Staves, ſome cut in pieces, ſome hanged twice or thriee, many thouſands drowned at</hi> Portendown-Bridg: <hi>And when the poor Souls came ſwimming by the River ſide to ſave their Lives, the</hi> Papiſts <hi>knockt them on the head with the But-end of their Muſquets.</hi> But the Inſtance I mind is that at <hi>Portendown-Bridg,</hi> a Woman was ſeen to riſe Breſt-high out of the River, her Hair hanging down, with Skin as white as Snow, often crying out, <hi>Revenge, Revenge, Revenge,</hi> which made the Perſons much amazed that ſaw, and heard it. This was atteſted by one <hi>Elizabeth Price</hi> (whoſe Husband was thrown into that River) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Commiſſioners appointed for that purpoſe; with many more that might be named.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sudden Death was deſigned by wicked <hi>Haman,</hi> after one Years proviſion and preparation for the Work; as the Spaniſh Invaſion was five Years before compleated, ſo there was to be one Year. For on the 13th day of the firſt Month, the King's Scribes were called to make the Writings, and on the 11th day of the twelfth Month, the month <hi>Adar,</hi> the Maſſacre was appointed, and then nothing but ſudden Death in one day: Saith the Word, They were to Deſtroy, Kill, and to cauſe to Periſh, all <hi>Jews</hi> both young and old, little Children and Women, in one day, <hi>Eſther</hi> 3. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>So in like manner, Sudden Death was like to be the portion of the <hi>Proteſtants in England.</hi> Time for Repentance would have been rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58561:6"/>
too good for an Heretick. To <hi>kill them, and ſend them to Hell ſpeedily, is an act meritorious, and cauſe of Triumph: when there was near one hundred thouſand lives in three days time taken away in</hi> France, <hi>(which it ſeems no leſs could quench the thirſt of that unſatiable Whore and Harlot)</hi> his Holineſs at <hi>Rome,</hi> at the ſame time made Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires, rings his Bells, ſhoots off his Guns, and ſang (O horrid Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy!) <hi>Te deum Laudamus,</hi> We praiſe thee, O God: As if he would draw in the moſt Gracious God to be acceſſary to his Murders, and an accompliſher of his Bloody and Abominable Impieties. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death is that they delight in, when ſo many Barrels of Gun-powder were under the Parliament Houſe, and Chair of State. Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix Barrels would ſoon have diſpatcht the <hi>King, Princes, Clergie, Nobles, Knights and Burgeſſes, the very confluence of the Flower of Glory, Learning, Prudence, and Authority in the Land;</hi> Fathers, Sons and Brothers, Foes, Papiſts, Proteſtants, all at one blaſt; and after that had been done, then a <hi>ſudden Maſſacre</hi> throughout the Nation, and ſo would have altered Religion and Government, and brought in a Foraign Power. But our good God hath prevented them hitherto, praiſed be his holy Name. O what a ſettled Deteſtation, and fixed Oppoſition, ſhould we have againſt that Religion! whoſe Faith is Faction, whoſe Promiſes are Equivocations, whoſe Worſhip is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, whoſe Principles are high Treaſon, whoſe Mercies are Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, whoſe practices are <hi>Stabbing, Strangling, and poyſoning of Kings,</hi> whoſe frame of Government is a politick deſign to enſlave the World, and to bring <hi>the Necks of Princes under their Iron Yoke,</hi> and <hi>whoſe God is a pretty little tiny thing,</hi> which the Prieſts firſt create with a Charm of four Words long, and then worſhip the Works of their own Hands; and when they have done, chop him up at a bit, and make no Bones of him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Much Deceit and Hypocriſy was acted by wicked <hi>Haman,</hi> when he intended to have the <hi>Jews</hi> Maſſacred: For he pretended to the King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> that this People had Laws diverſe from the King's Laws, and that they kept not the Laws of the King; and beſides, that it was not for the Kings profit to ſuffer ſuch People, <hi>Eſt.</hi> 3. 8. This he pretends to the King, as the great reaſon why he would have them deſtroyed, when indeed it was not out of love he had to the King's Honour, but his own, through the pride of his own Heart: All the reaſon was, becauſe <hi>Mordecai</hi> would not bow to him, <hi>Eſther</hi> 3. 5.</p>
            <p>As hypocritical and deceitful hath <hi>Rome</hi> been, in bringing about her wicked Deſigns at all times: for concerning this <hi>Powder-plot,</hi> the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58561:6"/>
better to bring about her deſign, Mr. <hi>Percy</hi> takes ſome Rooms of one Mr. <hi>Winyard,</hi> which Rooms ſerved for withdrawing Rooms in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-time for the Lords, for theſe Rooms adjoyned to the Wall of the Parliament-Houſe, and <hi>Percy</hi> took <hi>Fauks</hi> under pretence to be his Man, who changed his name into <hi>Johnſon,</hi> he had the Keys and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Rooms; and theſe Rooms were taken for Lodging Rooms. They took alſo another Houſe and a Seller, juſt under the Parliament Houſe, under pretence to keep Coals and Wood, which was to make the Serpents Neſt in; thus their deceit appears. Yea further, When they wanted to bring the <hi>Plot</hi> upon the Proteſtants, (for that they would have done) one of the Conſpirators, Mr. <hi>Keys,</hi> a Relation of Mr. <hi>Pickring</hi> of <hi>Tichmarſh</hi> Grove, in <hi>Northamptonſhire</hi> (which <hi>Pickring</hi> was a Proteſtant, and a great Favourite of King <hi>James</hi>'s) who had a very choice Horſe: This Mr. <hi>Key,</hi> (one of the Conſpirntors) borrowed Mr. <hi>Pickring</hi>'s Horſe, under pretence no Horſe could ſerve his turn ſo well as that, (which indeed would not, conſidering he was a Proteſtant); this Horſe was to ſtand in St. <hi>Georges</hi> Field, ready for <hi>Fauks</hi> after the Blow was given, as the Papiſts pretended to him. Mr. <hi>Pickring</hi> was to be killed, and conveyed away ſo as not to be found; and when <hi>Fauks</hi> came into St. <hi>Georges</hi> Fields, the Papiſts did intend to kill him, and ſo to have mangled him, that he ſhould not have been known from Mr. <hi>Pickring</hi> the Proteſtant, and ſo it ſhould have been bruited abroad preſently, that the Proteſtants had done the work of the Plot; and to make the World believe it, Here, ſay they (or would have ſaid) is Mr. <hi>Pickring</hi> with his choice Horſe, who did the thing, and was about to make his eſcape, but he was prevented; and ſo they did intend to have Maſſacred the Proteſtants, under that pretence of their blowing up the Parliament Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fauks</hi> after he was taken and put into the Tower, would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs any thing, notwithſtanding they put him upon the Rack, till he came to underſtand the deſign of his Brethren in Iniquity againſt him, who promiſed him a great ſum of Money to ſet the Houſe on Fire; yet when he came to make his eſcape in St. <hi>Georges</hi> Fields, there they intended to take away his Life, the better to bring about their deſign, and then he confeſſed all when he came to hear this. Thus we ſee there is no manner of ſafety in being a Papiſt, for they value not the lives of their own party to bring about their deſigns; for if we will not be ſubject to them in every thing, they matter not the lives of their own Proſelytes. <hi>Witneſs King</hi> Henry <hi>the 3d, and 4th of</hi> France, <hi>the firſt, becauſe he would not deſtroy all the Hugonots and Proteſtants in</hi> France, <hi>they Aſſaſſinated him, and took away his Life. So</hi> Henry <hi>the 4th
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58561:7"/>
was their Convert, whom they twice Aſſiſſinated, and the third time took away his Life; ſo that a Man cannot promiſe himſelf any ſecurity under the Romiſh Religion, but upon every humour and ſuſpicion, the Blood of the moſt Noble muſt go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. As God wrought marvellouſly in the delivering the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> from the cruelty of wicked <hi>Haman,</hi> ſo he <hi>did deliver Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from the fate of <hi>Rome:</hi> Conſider with me a little, how the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God did work in the ſaving the former.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> makes a Feaſt, invites his Nobles, when his heart was merry with Wine, he ſends for Queen <hi>Vaſhti</hi> to come before him, ſhe refuſeth to come; the King and Nobles were greatly troubled for her not coming. Queen <hi>Vaſhti</hi> is no more to come into the King's preſence, ſhe is ſhut out for ever from being Queen more; this makes way for <hi>Eſther</hi> who was a <hi>Jew,</hi> to be an Inſtument to ſave her People.</p>
            <p>A great many fair Virgins, were to be ſought for (by the King's Command) out of all Provinces, and brought to <hi>Shuſhan</hi> the King's Palace. Now <hi>Mordecai</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> brings in <hi>Eſther,</hi> his Uncles Daughter, who had neither Father nor Mother; and among all the Virgins that were brought, none pleaſed the King ſo well as <hi>Eſther,</hi> whom he made Queen.</p>
            <p>Again it came to paſs on a certain Night, that the King could not ſleep, (a Hand of God there was in that alſo) he calls for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, in which he finds that two of the King's Chamberlains, <hi>Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thana</hi> and <hi>Tereſh,</hi> intended to lay Hands on the King, which was diſcovered by <hi>Mordecai</hi> the <hi>Jew.</hi> Then ſaith the King, What hath been done to him for that good deed? Hath he not been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted for the ſame? No, ſay the King's Servants. Who is in the Court, ſaith the King? <hi>Haman,</hi> ſay the Servants. Now <hi>Haman</hi> at this time ſtood in the outer Court to ſpeak with the King, to have <hi>Mordecai</hi> hanged on the Gallows he had prepared. The King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Haman</hi> to be called in: What (ſaith the King to <hi>Haman)</hi> ſhall be done to the man whom the King delighteth to honour? <hi>Haman</hi> thinking he ſhould be the man, ſaid thus, <hi>Eſther 6. 7, 8, 9. Let the Royal Apparel be brought which the King uſeth to wear, and the Horſe that the King rideth upon, and the Crown Royal, which he uſeth to wear: And let this Apparel and Horſe be delivered into the hands of one of the King's moſt noble Princes, that they may array him withal, whom the King delighteth to honour: And bring him on Horſe-back through the Street of the City, and proclaim before him; Thus ſhall be done to the man whom the King delighteth to honour. Then ſaid the King to</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:58561:7"/>
Haman, <hi>Take the Apparel and Horſe, and do ſo to</hi> Mordecai <hi>the</hi> Jew <hi>that ſitteth in the King's Gate, and let nothing fail of all that thou haſt ſpoken. Then</hi> Haman <hi>did as the King commanded, but</hi> Haman <hi>haſted to his own Houſe mourning, and having his Head covered.</hi> Mark how God's Providence did work further. When <hi>Mordecai</hi> had by Proxy informed Queen <hi>Eſther</hi> of wicked <hi>Haman</hi>'s deſign, and ſent her a Copy of the Writings among the <hi>Jews,</hi> by the hand of <hi>Hatateh</hi> the King's Chamberlain, poor <hi>Mordecai</hi> weeps bitterly, puts on Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, and went into the midſt of the City, and cried with a loud and bitter Cry. But when Queen <hi>Eſther</hi> came to hear of the Deſign, ſhe is in a very great ſtrait, ſhe had not been called before the King for thirty days ſpace: And there was a Law, that whoever comes before the King into the inner Court, except the King holds out his Scepter to them, they are to be put to death. What ſhall Queen <hi>Eſther</hi> do now? Well, out of love to her own Country, and conſidering what <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſaid; Think not that thou ſhalt ſave thy own Life. Upon theſe conſiderations, ſhe reſolves to go to the King with her Life in her Hand, and <hi>if I periſh, I periſh,</hi> ſaith the Queen. When ſhe comes before the King, God puts it in his heart to hold out his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to her: ſo <hi>Eſther</hi> drew near and touched the top of his Golden Scepter. Then ſaith the King to her, What is thy Requeſt, and it ſhall be granted, to the half of my Kingdom? And Queen <hi>Eſther</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Let the King and <hi>Haman</hi> come this day to a Dinner I ſhall prepare: The King and <hi>Haman</hi> did ſo. Now <hi>Haman</hi>'s heart was lifted up, when he heard that none but he was to go with the King to the Dinner the Queen had prepared, yet ſaith he, <hi>All this avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me nothing, ſo long as</hi> Mordecai <hi>ſtandeth in the Kings Gate.</hi> When the King, Queen, and <hi>Haman</hi> was at the Banquet of Wine, What is thy Requeſt Queen <hi>Eſther,</hi> ſaith the King, and it ſhall be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thee, even to the half of my Kingdom?</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Eſther</hi> the Queen anſwered, If I have found favour in thine Eyes, O King, if it pleaſe the King, let my Life be given at my Petition, and my People at my Requeſt; for we are ſold, I and my People to be deſtroyed, to be ſlain, and to periſh: But if we had been ſold for Bond-men, and Bond-women, I had held my Tongue. Then ſaid the King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> Who is he? And where is he that durſt preſume in his heart ſo to do? And <hi>Eſther</hi> ſaid, The Enemy is this wicked <hi>Haman.</hi> Then the King roſe up in Wrath, and went into the Palace Garden, and <hi>Haman</hi> being afraid, ſtandeth up and makes requeſt for his Life to the King, and to <hi>Eſther</hi> the Queen, in the Kings abſence. When the King returned out of the Palace-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58561:8"/>
               <hi>Haman</hi> was lying on the Bed where <hi>Eſther</hi> was. What, ſaith the King, will he force the Queen before me in the Houſe? Thus the King was more and more enraged againſt <hi>Haman. Haman</hi>'s face was covered of a ſudden. The ſaith one of the King's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlains, there ſtandeth a Gallows in <hi>Haman</hi>'s Houſe, which he built for <hi>Mordecai,</hi> who hath ſpoken good for the King; then the King ſaid, Hang him thereon. So <hi>Haman</hi> was hanged, and the former Writing reverſed by ſending Letters through all the Provinces, and Orders was given the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould be ready to deſtroy all that day, that came to deſtroy them; and on that day they deſtroyed ſeventy five thouſand, but laid not their hands on the Prey. Thus you ſee, how wonderfully God did work for their Deliverance.</p>
            <p>So in like manner did he for <hi>England,</hi> for the Lord was pleaſed to prevent their deſign by two Prorogations before this Fifth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> and but ten days before the Parliament ſate, there was a Letter ſent from ſome (whoſe heart God had ſtirred up) to the Lord <hi>Mount-Eagle,</hi> to have him exempt himſelf from the Parliament Houſe that day: The ſaid Lord <hi>Mount-Eagle</hi> takes the Letter, and late at Night goes to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and ſheweth it to the Earl of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> then Principal Secretary; the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> acquaints the Chamberlain therewith; theſe two Councellors ſhew the Letter to the Earls of <hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> and all concluded how ſlightly the Contents ſeemed to be to ſhew the King, for it was without Date and Subſcription, and not very legible: However the Earl of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> preſents the Letter to the King, which is as followeth.</p>

            <p>God's goodneſs did greatly appear in giving the King that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to interpret ſome dark phraſes in the Letter by receiving a

terrible Blow, this Parliament; <hi>the King did preſently apprehend that a ſudden blow of Gun-powder was intended,</hi> by ſome baſe Villain in a Corner: And that the danger was paſt, ſo ſoon as the Letter was burnt. The King putting the former words, <hi>a terrible Blow,</hi> and theſe together, gathered that for <hi>ſo ſoon,</hi> was as quickly as the Letter was burnt, the danger would be paſt. Order was given that the Rooms under the Parliament Houſe ſhould be ſearched throughly: Accordingly the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> then Lord Chamberlain, upon <hi>Monday</hi> in the Afternoon, with the Lord <hi>Mount-Eagle,</hi> repaired into thoſe under Rooms; and finding the Sellar well ſtored with Wood and Coals, asked <hi>Fauks,</hi> the counterfeit <hi>Johnſon,</hi> Whoſe they were? Who anſwered, The Lodgings belonged to Mr. <hi>Thomas Percy,</hi> and the Sellar was to lay in his Winter Proviſion. When they were come forth, the Lord <hi>Mount-Eagle</hi> told the Chamberlain when he heard <hi>Percy</hi>'s name named, he did much ſuſpect <hi>Percy</hi> to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diter of that Letter. The Lord Chamberlain returned and told the King and Council what he had ſeen, and the ſuſpicion the Lord <hi>Mount-Eagle</hi> had of <hi>Percy,</hi> and of <hi>Johnſon</hi> his Man; all which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed his Majeſties jealouſie, and a Charge was given that a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower ſearch ſhould be made, the Billets and Coals turned up to the bottom. Sir <hi>Thomas Knevet,</hi> a Gentleman, one of his Majeſties Privy-Chamber, and a Juſtice of Peace in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> was imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herein; who about Mid-night before the Parliament was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, went with a ſmall, but truſty number of Perſons, and at the sellar door they found <hi>Fauks</hi> at ſo unſeaſonable an hour, Cloaked and Booted, with a Dark-Lanthorn; they found about him three Matches, and other Inſtruments for blowing up the Powder: He was no whit daunted, and inſtantly confeſſed his Guiltineſs, and was ſo far from Repentance, that he vowed had he been within the Houſe (as he came but juſt forth) he would have blown up the Houſe, with himſelf and them all in it; and further ſaid, That the Devil and not God, had diſcovered that Deſign. And when they came to ranſack the Billets, they found the Serpents Neſt, thirty ſix Barrels of Powder, with Bars of Iron, and maſſy Stones. This Wretch would not diſcover the Plot, till he knew the deſign of his Brethren in Iniquity, which was to murder him in St. <hi>Georges</hi> Fields, when he came to take Mr. <hi>Pickrings</hi> Horſe, and would have ſo man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled him, that the World ſhould have thought that it had been Mr. <hi>Pickring</hi> the Proteſtant; and ſo, as I ſaid before, would have father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Plot upon them. This Villain remembred the Oath of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crefie that he took with the reſt, from <hi>Gerard</hi> and <hi>Treſmond,</hi> Jeſuitical
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58561:9"/>
Prieſts, who by their Apoſtolical Power, did commend the Fact and abſolve the Actors; the Oath was in theſe words:</p>
            <q>
               <hi>You ſhall ſwear by the Bleſſed Trinity, and by the Sacrament you now purpoſe to receive, never to diſcloſe directly, or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, by word or circumſtance, the matter that ſhall be propoſed to you to keep ſecret, nor deſiſt from the Execution thereof, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the reſt give you leave.</hi>
            </q>
            <p n="6">6. As the Wicked was ſnared in the work of his own hands, in the days of <hi>Ahaſuerus;</hi> wicked <hi>Haman</hi> was hanged on the Gallows he made for <hi>Mordecai,</hi> Eſt. 7. 10. Yea, his ten Sons were hanged alſo, and ſeventy five thouſand were ſlain, who thought to have ſlain the <hi>Jews,</hi> Eſt. 9. 16.</p>
            <p>So in like manner, about the Gun-powder Plot, the judgment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns on their own Pate, many of their lives being taken away that were Actors of it. <hi>Fauks</hi> was Hanged and Quartered, as ſome ſay; others ſay, that he had a pair of Iron Boots, made red-hot, which he was put to ſtand in. Sixteen were taken in the Country and ſent to <hi>London. Catesby, Rockwood,</hi> and <hi>Grant,</hi> had their Faces ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome Powder which they had put in a Chimny-corner; a Billet thrown into the Fire, raiſed a ſpark that fell on the Powder. Two whoſe names were <hi>Wright,</hi> were ſhot down dead in a Fray, that was in <hi>Holback-</hi>Houſe in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> which belonged to <hi>Stephen Littleton;</hi> theſe and many others were purſued there by the high Sheriff of <hi>Worceſterſhire;</hi> thoſe that were in this Houſe being deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſet open the Gates, and ſuffer'd the Sheriffs Men to ruſh upon them: <hi>Rockwood,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> were ſorely wounded, <hi>Gatesby</hi> and <hi>Percy</hi> deſperately fighting back to back, were both ſhot through and ſlain with one Muſquet-Bullet; the reſt being taken were carried to <hi>London,</hi> where they received the juſt demerit of their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>But moſt remarkable is that Judgment of God, that befel the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>Black-friars,</hi> on a Lord's Day, <hi>Anno Chriſti,</hi> 1623. about ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years after this Plot was levelled againſt the Proteſtants, which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58561:9"/>
was the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> by the <hi>Roman</hi> Account: One <hi>Drury,</hi> a Romiſh Prieſt, a Man of parts, was to preach in a fair Houſe in <hi>Black-friars.</hi> Upon this Report, many Proteſtants as well as Papiſts, Schollers as well as others, aſſembled to hear him; he had not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed half an Hour, but the Floor whereon he was and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, fell down with ſuch Violence, as therewith the Floor of the Chamber underneath where <hi>Redgate</hi> was and his Company (another Jeſuite Prieſt) was broken down with it, ſo that both the Floors, with the Beams, Girders, Joyces, Boards and Seilings fell down together upon the third Floor; ſome there were that were pulled out alive, but ſo bruiſed or ſpent for want of Breath, that ſome lived not many hours, ſome died not many days after. On the Lord's Day at Night, were numbered ninety one dead Bodies. Both the Jeſuites were killed.</p>
            <p>One thing is very remarkable further, There was at this time one <hi>Parker,</hi> who was a Factor for the Engliſh Seminaries and Nuns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea; he had ſo dealt with two of his Brethren, that he had got from one a Son, and from the other a Daughter, to ſend them to Religious Houſes, as they falſly call them beyond Sea.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Parker,</hi> at this time, took his Nephew with him, a Lad about ſixteen Years old; the Youth loſt his Life, but <hi>Parker</hi> eſcaped with a bruiſed Body. But though he had his Life given him, he did not prize his Mercy, but would often wiſh that he had died among ſo many Martyrs. (Many ſuch Martyrs have been made at <hi>Tybourn</hi> for Treaſon) But, Beloved, the preſervation of the Wicked, is but a reſervation to future Judgment: For about ten days after, this <hi>Parker</hi> was ſhooting <hi>London-Bridg</hi> with his aforeſaid Neece, whom he was conveying beyond Sea, they were both caſt away, and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Thames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Judg by this, O Parents, whether God is well pleaſed with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſing your Children to Popiſh Education.</p>
            <p>Again, Should we go back to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Invaſion, and ſee how God turned their own Cruelties on their own Heads. For on the 29th of <hi>May,</hi> 1588. the Fleet ſet ſail out of the River <hi>Tago:</hi> but God, who is an Enemy to all ſuch Hoſtile Actions, cauſed a Storm to raiſe, a very dreadful one, their Ships were diſpers'd, ſome their Maſts broken and blown over-board; and abundance of their Men died with the Peſtilence, and their Fleet was ſo torn that they could not poſſibly come out that Year. The next Year coming out again with a Fleet of about one hundred and thirty ſail, they ſeemed as if they made for <hi>Plymouth,</hi> they came with lofty Towers like Caſtles
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58561:10"/>
(their Ships being ſo built) in front like a Half-Moon: On <hi>July</hi> the twenty third they had a great Fight, and the greateſt they ever had; the Engliſh Commanders found very hard work to Fight them, and were out of all hopes of doing much good, becauſe they did not dare to board them, they having ſo many thouſand Souldiers; but God was pleaſed to put a Project into the Heart of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (Or Sir <hi>Francis Drake)</hi> So that the next day after they had caſt Anchor, the Lord Admiral made ready eight Ships, filled with Wild-fire, Pitch, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, Brimſtone, and other combuſtible matter, their Ordnance being charged with Bullets, Stones, Chains, all the Men being taken out; about two a Clock after Mid-night, the Ships were let drive with Wind and Tide (under the guidance of <hi>Young</hi> and <hi>Prowſe)</hi> among the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, their Train taking fire, ſuch a Thunder-clap was given by them in the dead of the Night, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were amazed, and knowing not better how to avoid theſe Fire-Ships than by cutting their Cables aſunder, which they did, and ſo ſome run upon the Sands, others were taken, that in all they loſt <hi>eighty one</hi> Veſſels, <hi>thirteen thouſand five hundred</hi> and odd Souldiers, Priſoners taken in <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> about two thouſand, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Spain</hi> but a ſmall number of Ships and Men, to what they had when they came out; thus their <hi>Invincible Armada</hi> by God's bleſſing proved <hi>Vincible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Beloved, I think none will be ſo unbelieving as to think that all theſe Judgments came by chance; no, God forbid ye ſhould; we would not be raſh in cenſuring, yet when we ſee Judgments exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted on Sinners in the act of their Sins, when they are impudent and preſumptuous therein, not to acknowledg ſuch to be judged by the Lord, is to wink at their Light, <hi>Pſal. 9. 16. God is known by the Judgments he executeth.</hi> Shall <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> while he is vaunting of his great <hi>Babylon,</hi> be bereft of his Wits? Shall <hi>Herod,</hi> while he is priding himſelf in the flattering applauſe of the People, be eaten with Worms? Shall <hi>Haman,</hi> while he is practizing to deſtroy all the People of God, be hanged on the Gallows fifty Cubits high, which he prepared for <hi>Mordecai?</hi> Shall the Houſe where the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines met together to ſport with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> fall upon their Heads? Shall theſe and ſuch like Judgments overtake Men in acts of Sin, and yet be accounted no Judgment, no evidences of God's Revenging Judgments? Truly then we may deny all Providence.</p>
            <p>☞ God will certainly take Vengeance on all his Implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, God will not forget the Blood of ſo many Millions of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> which now crieth for Vengeance, whoſe greateſt guilt was their

            <p>
               <hi>Let me give you a ſhort Scheme of the variety of Popiſh Tortures, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctized by the Bloody Idolaters, upon the poor Chriſtians in</hi> Ireland, Paris, <hi>and</hi> Piedmont.</p>
            <p>Some had their Bellies ript up when they were with Child, and the living Child laid on the dead Mother; ſome driven into a River, and there Drowned in great numbers; if any could Swim, they either ſhot at them, or knockt them on the Head with the But-ends of their Muſquets, as they came near the Land.</p>
            <p>One Mrs. <hi>Manuel</hi> they threw into the Water then in Labour, the Child being half born when the Mother was drowned.</p>
            <p>The mercileſs <hi>Papiſts</hi> having ſet fire on a Caſtle where many <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> were, and hearing them ſcreek, <hi>O how ſweetly do they cry!</hi> ſaid they, rejoycing.</p>
            <p>In one place they burnt two Proteſtants Bibles, and ſaid, <hi>It was Hell fire they burnt;</hi> other Bibles they took and cut in pieces; and they took the Bible of one Mr. <hi>Edward Slack,</hi> a Miniſter, opening of it, they laid it in a puddle of Water, and then ſtampt upon it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>A Plague on't! this Bible hath bred all the Quarrel.</hi> Women great with Child, had Swords run in them in ſuch an inhuman manner
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58561:11"/>
that the Children in the Womb thruſt their Arms and Feet out of the Wounds: Others have been tortured alive, others deadly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and laid on Tenter-hooks; others their Fleſh ſliced off their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; ſome with Ropes and Withs about their Necks, have been drawn through Water, Bogs, Woods, Streets, to inforce them to confeſs their Treaſure, and when they had ſo done, and gotten their Treaſure, were baſely Murdered; ſome were hanged up by their Arms, and Soldiers did try the ſtrength of their Swords upon them.</p>
            <p>A School-Maſter of <hi>Rovas</hi> being ſtript Naked, had his Nails tore off with Pincers, his Hands ſtabb'd with a Dagger-point, drawn through the Borroughs of <hi>Lucerna</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and had his Fleſh cut off with a Faulchion, crying out to him, <hi>What ſayeſt thou now? Will you go to Maſs?</hi> To which with admirable conſtancy, he ſaid, <hi>Much rather Death than Maſs,</hi> crying, <hi>O diſpatch me quickly for the love of God!</hi> Some they ript up, and their Guts left to trial about their Heels; Women great with Child were hung up by the Heels, and Bellies ript open till the Children dropt out, and then caſt into a Ditch. Some Children have had their Brains daſht out againſt the Wall, and their Bodies thrown to Dogs and Swine; ſome Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren thrown to Dogs to be devoured by them; ſome trampled upon to death; other Infants have been found ſucking the breſts of their dead Mothers: Some were driven to the Woods and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in the extremity of Froſt and Snow, having firſt been ſtript ſtark naked, and ſo were ſtarved; others have been driven to take ſhelter in Caves, and there by Fire and Smoke made at the Caves mouth, were ſmothered and choaked to Death. Some of the Murderers in <hi>Piedmont</hi> finding eleven Men, made a Furnace red-hot, and made one caſt in another, and the laſt they caſt in themſelves.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Piedmont</hi> two Children, both Dumb, murthered. The Marqueſs of <hi>Pioneſſa</hi> commanded the Hangman to take the Body of <hi>Giovani Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,</hi> after many Scorns laid upon him by the Friars, to be dragged to a Tree and there Hanged, who before they hanged, uſed many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to him to leave his Religion, but could not prevail. Some time after an Elder of the Church at <hi>Roſanna,</hi> was brought to the ſame place to die, the Marqueſs of <hi>Pioneſſa</hi> three or four days after going that way, and one of the Soldiers diſcharging a Muſquet on the dead Bodies, there came a ſtream of freſh Blood from one of them, which the Marqueſs ſeeing, ſaid, <hi>This Blood crieth for Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58561:11"/>
Some have been compelled to carry their own Parents to the place of Execution, others to ſet fire to the Pile that burnt them; ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers compelled to caſt their own Children into the Water to drown them; ſome Wives to hang up their own Husbands, and Children to hang up their own Parents, and when this was done inhopes of Life, becauſe Life was promiſed for ſo doing, were Maſſacred themſelves; ſome have been boil'd to death in Cauldrons; ſome have had their Eyes twiſted out with Cords.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Maſſacre</hi> was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Popiſh Prieſts gave the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> to many <hi>Iriſh,</hi> upon condition that they ſhould <hi>not ſpare Men, Women, nor Children that were Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One <hi>Hulligan</hi> a Prieſt, when this Maſſacre began, read an Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication againſt all thoſe that from henceforth ſhould harbour any <hi>Engliſh, Scotiſh,</hi> or <hi>Welſh,</hi> or give them Alms, whereby many were <hi>famiſhed to death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time, when the <hi>Iriſh Maſſacre</hi> was acting, they boaſted, <hi>That when they had deſtroyed the</hi> Iriſh, <hi>they would go over to</hi> England, <hi>and not leave the memorial of an</hi> Engliſh-Man <hi>under Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Popiſh Prieſts after they had given their Crew a diſmiſs at Maſs, the day before the Maſſacre, told them they ſhould go and take poſſeſſion of all the Proteſtants Lands, alſo to Strip, Rob, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoil them: for the Proteſtants were worſe than Dogs, they were Devils, and therefore their killing them was a meritorious Act. Some had their Brains taken out and fried in a Pan; many ſtoned to Death; ſome have been put into a Hole, and nothing but their Head appearing, covered to the Neck with Stones and Earth, that they might feel Death, and taſte death more deliberately.</p>
            <p>Some have been ſtript ſtark-naked and driven by the Inhumane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors through the Streets; and if their weakneſs was ſuch that they could not go ſo faſt as they would have them, they would prick them forward with Swords and Spears. Some have been ſo wracked, that in their Feſtering Wounds, Worms and other Vermin have bred.</p>
            <p>Some of the Papiſts openly profeſt in <hi>Irelands</hi> Maſſacre, that they <hi>held it as lawful to kill a Proteſtant, as a Dog:</hi> And one of their Prieſts ſaid, <hi>It was as lawful to take away their Lives, as a Bone out of a Dogs mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One <hi>Ann Hill,</hi> going with a young Child on her back to ſave her Life, and four more by her ſide, they met her and pulled the Child from off her Back and trod on it till it died, ſtript her and the four Children naked, ſo that they died with cold.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Joan Addis</hi> they ſtabbed, and then put the Child to her
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58561:12"/>
Breſt, and bid it <hi>Suck, Engliſh Baſtard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Good-wife <hi>Lea</hi> they carried and her Daughter into the Woods, and firſt hung the Mother, and then the Daughter by the hair of her Mother's Head.</p>
            <p>Poor Children that went out into the Fields to eat Weeds and Graſs, they murdered without all pity.</p>
            <p>Some of thoſe <hi>Bloody Murderers</hi> have boaſted, that their Arms have been ſo weary with killing, that they could not lift them up to their Heads. Some Infants have been cloſed up in their Mothers Belly and been ſtrangled. <hi>Many thouſands have died in the Inquiſition.</hi> Some have been drawn with promiſes of Life, and threats of death to renounce their Religion and turn <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and when they have ſo done, have been murdered; the ſcoffing Papiſts telling them it was good to kill them while they were in a good humour, leſt they ſhould recant if they lived longer.</p>
            <p>Others have yielded up their Forts and Caſtles upon Articles and Conditions to have their lives ſpared, and then being diſarmed, were kept in the Fort or Caſtle, till ſtarved, with this Jeſuitical Evaſion, <hi>We promiſed you your Lives, but not Food to preſerve them.</hi> Like that Treachery the Marquiſs of <hi>Pioneſſa</hi> was guilty of in the late Maſſacre in <hi>Piedmont, April, Anno</hi> 1655. The Deputies of the Proteſtants, by the Subtilties of this Marquiſ of <hi>Pioneſſa,</hi> were detained at <hi>Turin,</hi> in which time a great Army arrived at St. <hi>Giovani,</hi> and ſome other Towns, to the number of fifteen thouſand, which ſet upon the poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in an inhumane manner; the Marquiſs alſo made a great Dinner for many of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and made the Deputies many fair promiſes, that there ſhould be no hurt to any of them, if they would but quarter a few Troops, as a token of their Obedience; they did aſſent to what the Marquiſs deſigned. But no ſooner were thoſe Troops entered, but they put all to Fire and Sword, ſlaying all they met with in the moſt barbarous manner that could be invented.</p>
            <p>Much like this was that of Admiral <hi>Coligny</hi> with abundance of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who were enticed to <hi>Paris</hi> with Promiſes and Oaths of Security, under pretence of a Marriage between two Houſes, where were barbarouſly ſlain <hi>ten thouſand Proteſtants,</hi> whoſe Blood ran down the Chanel like Water.</p>
            <p>Not much different from this, was the practice of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Soveraign Prince of the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> after a tedious and chargeable Application of the Proteſtants to him, for a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Liberty of Conſcience, did at laſt by an Edict promiſe expreſsly that he would confirm unto them the enjoyment of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58561:12"/>
of Religion, and of theſe Priviledges granted to them by his Predeceſſors, Dukes of <hi>Savoy.</hi> Yet by the powerful perſuaſion of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> as they call it; or of the Jeſuits, Friars, and others, one <hi>Gaſtalt</hi> was at laſt ſent from the Prince with a Commiſſion, who calls himſelf <hi>Conſervator General of the Catholick Faith againſt the Reformed Profeſſors,</hi> affirming that he had received Inſtructions from the Prince, <hi>That in caſe they will not within three Days receive the Romiſh Religion, they muſt for ever bid farewel to their Native Country, Houſes, Lands, and Poſſeſſions;</hi> adding moreover, <hi>It ſhould be death without mercy, if after that ſpace of time any were taken in thoſe Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that you ſee thoſe Men make little conſcience of Promiſes, or Covenants. But what need we queſtion that? 'Tis a Maxim owned by the Prieſts, <hi>That Faith ought not to be kept with Hereticks;</hi> and that all Oaths, Covenants, Promiſes, made to and with the ſilly <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> are of no force longer than it pleaſeth the <hi>Pope;</hi> and ſo it ſeems indeed by their practices.</p>
            <p>It was the <hi>Pope</hi> (to the ſcandal of all the World) perſuaded the King <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus,</hi> to break his League with the <hi>Turk</hi> upon ſome ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Advantage: the <hi>Pope</hi> abſolved him from his Oath: But God re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>venged the Perjury, with the death of many thouſand poor Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As the People of God of old (the <hi>Jews)</hi> did keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the Month <hi>Adar,</hi> Annually, in remembrance of that great Deliverance from <hi>Haman</hi>'s deſigned Maſſacre, as you have in <hi>Eſt.</hi> 9. 18, 29.</p>
            <p>So in King <hi>James</hi>'s dayes, from a ſenſe of the Mercy then received, it was Enacted, that <hi>November the Fifth</hi> ſhould be kept throughout the Nation, with praiſing God for ſo great Deliverance.

               <bibl>REVEL. xvii. 5.</bibl>
               <q>And upon her Forehead was a Name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THeſe words, Beloved, contain the Inſcription that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon the Forehead of Antichriſt; and they may be written in Capital Letters in our Bibles, to ſhow unto us that this Inſcription is as plain, obvious, and legible upon the Forehead of Antichriſt, as in our Books.</p>
            <p>By the Forehead we may ſafely underſtand the Principles and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the falſe Church: For as what is written on the Forehead is plain, apparent, and obvious to all Spectators: So all that will but take a proſpect of <hi>Romes</hi> Practices and Principles, through the Glaſs of God's ſacred Word, muſt needs read this Inſcription, <hi>Myſtery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots, and Abominations of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. She is called <hi>Babylon,</hi> becauſe ſhe reſembles <hi>Babylon,</hi> where the the <hi>Jews</hi> and the People of God were ſeventy Years in Captivity: For as Literal <hi>Babylon</hi> held the Bodies of Men in Captivity, ſo <hi>Rome,</hi> which is Myſtery Spiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> keeps their Souls. Therefore ſome of the Learned have ſaid, <hi>Babylon</hi> was the <hi>firſt Rome,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> is the <hi>ſecond Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. She is called <hi>Myſtery Babylon,</hi> becauſe ſhe pretends to be <hi>Sion,</hi> but is truly <hi>Babylon.</hi> That that is a Myſtery, is ſomething hidden: So <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Babylon,</hi> but hidden under the name of the Mother Church, God's Temple, the Miſtreſs of Faith. <hi>Rome</hi> hides her Fornication under the name of the pure Spouſe, her Impiety and Blaſphemy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Piety and Infallibility, ſhe dares not appear to be what ſhe is.</p>
            <p n="3">3. She is called <hi>the Mother of Harlots,</hi> becauſe ſhe is the Head of the great Apoſtacy from Chriſt; and is not only a Harlot her ſelf,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58561:14"/>
but hath many Daughters of the ſame Nature, whom ſhe hath taught to commit Spiritual Whoredom. How many Kings, Kingdoms, Nations, and Languages, hath ſhe infected by the Golden-Cup of her Fornication? This poor Nation of <hi>England</hi> was once greatly infected and poyſoned by that Harlot, that indeed to this day ſome Reliques of her Poyſon, which was then drunk, remain. The good Phyſician of Value cleanſe this Nation wholly of all ſuch Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous and Infectious Doctrines. Hence 'tis the Spirit hath this Emphatical phraſe in the Text, <hi>GREAT,</hi> becauſe there never was, nor will be a greater Harlot than ſhe is, and hath been; there is not a worſe to be found, ſhe is the Mother, the firſt, the greateſt that can be named.</p>
            <p n="4">4. She is called <hi>the Abomination of the Earth,</hi> becauſe ſhe is the Mother of all falſe and Adulterous Churches; ſo the Abomination of the Earth, the Mother of Impious and Idolatrous Practices. The Doctrine from theſe words is this:
<q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Mother of Harlots, and Abominations of the Earth.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Doctrine appears to be true, if we conſider the deſcription the Sripture giveth of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She ſtandeth, or is built upon Seven Mountains, or Hills. This is her Scituation, as you may ſee, <hi>Rev. 17. 9. The ſeven Heads are ſeven Hills, on which the Woman ſitteth;</hi> that Woman in my Text, the Mother of Harlots. And this ſtands ſtrongly againſt them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they can find out another City which is ſo Situated, which is impoſſible, and this they cannot deny but the City is ſo Situated, many of the Fathers acknowledg it. Beſide, <hi>Rome</hi> being built on ſeven Hills, her own Poets ſing loudly of it; as <hi>Virgil, Ovid, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertius.</hi> See the Book intitled, <hi>The Man of Sin.</hi> Alſo the Reverend Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> is of the ſame mind. But that which they Object, is this:</p>
            <p>Object. 1. Say they, <hi>This is meant of</hi> Rome <hi>in her Heathen State, and not in her State of Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That cannot be meant of <hi>Rome</hi> in its Heathen State, becauſe the Apoſtle ſpake Prophetically, of a Time to come. <hi>Rome</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſeven forms of Government, called <hi>Seven Kings,</hi> (Rev. 17. 10.) to govern the Common wealth. 1. Kings, properly ſo called: 2. Conſuls. 3. Decemviri. 4. Tribunes of Souldiers. 5. Dicra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. 6. Emperors, properly ſo called. 7. Antichriſt, the ſtate of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58561:15"/>
the Beaſt, which is a note of difference from all the others which were yet to come. Now five of thoſe in the Apoſtles days were fallen; one then was in being, namely the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor; and the other (that was the Beaſt <hi>Antichriſt)</hi> was yet to come. Therefore if the Antichriſt, the Beaſt, the Mother of Harlots, was not then in being, in the Apoſtles ſenſe, it could not be <hi>Rome</hi> under the Reign of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors in her Heathen State. But <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 10. clears this fully.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It cannot be Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe ſhe never made a Covenant with God, and broke it. The Antichriſt is a Whore, a Harlot, one that hath left her firſt Husband. Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> never profeſſed Chriſt, therefore it cannot be her. It muſt needs be <hi>Rome</hi> Apoſtate: For the Antichriſt, the Man of Sin, is ſome Apoſtate, as you may ſee in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 3. The Apoſtle there exhorting the Saints to conſtancy in the Faith, and that they ſhould not expect Chriſt's coming (which they ſo much looked for) till there was ſome great Apoſtacy from the Faith, <hi>ver. 3. Let no Man deceive you with vain words by any means, for that Day ſhall not come except there be a falling away firſt, and that Man of Sin be revealed, the Son of Perdition.</hi> So that this Beaſt is one that falls from the Truth, which Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> never did. But <hi>Rome</hi> in its profeſt Chriſtian State hath ſo done: For ſhe was once a famous Church, when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writ the Epiſtle to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8. St. <hi>Paul</hi> thanks God that <hi>their Faith was ſpoken of through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole World;</hi> and many Elders and Chriſtians did ſuffer under the ſixth form of Government. But now ſhe is <hi>Rome</hi> Apoſtate, the fallen Star, mentioned in <hi>Rev. 9. 1. I ſaw a Star fall from Heaven to the Earth,</hi> to earthly Concupiſence, an earthly Mind, <hi>which had the Key of the bottomleſs Pit.</hi> The Pope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pretend to have the Key of Hell: By that means they delivered <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperor's Soul out of Hell; a great Perſecuter of the Chriſtians. But I ſhall not impoſe the belief of this on you in the leaſt. <hi>Rome</hi> did once ſhine as a glorious Star, but now a place of Darkneſs, by reaſon of the Smoke that comes out of the Pit. The Sun and Moon are darkned. True Principles of Chriſt are hid from a great part of the World, by the black and ſmoaky principles of the fallen Star.</p>
            <p>So in my Text, ſhe is called, a <hi>Whore,</hi> a <hi>Harlot.</hi> Which ſhe would not have been called, had ſhe not defiled her Lord's Bed. We have her portraied to the life, in 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 1, 2, 3. Now the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſpeaketh expreſsly, that in the latter Times ſome ſhall depart from the Faith, giving heed to ſeducing Spirits, and doctrines of Devils, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lyes in Hypocriſy, having their Conſciences ſeared with a hot Iron, forbidding to Marry, and commanding to abſtain from Meats, which God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58561:15"/>
hath ordained to be received with thanksgiving.</hi> Who is this but <hi>Rome Chriſtian?</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> think it Antichriſt. Know we not that ſhe forbids her Prieſts to Marry, and to abſtain from Meats, under pretence of doing Penance for Sin, and imitation of Chriſt, who faſted forty days.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Had it been Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> the Apoſtle ſpake of, he would not have ſpoken of her as a Myſtery: He calls her <hi>Myſtery Babylon,</hi> and <hi>myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. 7. Now it was not a Myſtery for Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> to perſecute Chriſtians; but for Chriſtians to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Chriſtians, that was a <hi>Myſtery</hi> indeed. The <hi>Pope</hi> pretends he loveth Chriſt, but hates his People. He is Chriſt's Vicar by Name, but Enemy in Deed; he is not Iniquity publick, openly, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, but Iniquity in a Myſtery, in a dark and hidden way.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nor could the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> have made Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of Souls, which only ſubdued Nations by Force, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected them by Poyſon; it kept a Shambles for Bodies, but not a Market for Souls, as <hi>Myſtery Babylon</hi> doth; <hi>Rev. 18. 13. And in her was found Slaves, and Souls of men.</hi> Among all the Traffick of <hi>Rome,</hi> none is ſo gainful as Souls. Her Merchants are the Monks and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, called the falſe Prophets, who are to be caſt into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20. That the Apoſtacy is not a Civil Apoſtacy, but Religious, is the opinion of ſome of their own, as <hi>Nical Delyra, Theodoret,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin, Oecumenicus,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It cannot be Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe ſhe never did ſit in the Temple of God, as Antichriſt is deſcribed, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 4. Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> never pretended to be God's Temple, but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth: She ſaith ſhe is God's Houſe, and doth not Apoſtate <hi>Rome</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to all thoſe Phraſes? 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
            <p>Firſt, She oppoſeth and exalteth her ſelf above all that is called God: Doth ſhe not oppoſe Kings, and exalt her ſelf above all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, called Gods in Scripture, in reſpect of their Authority?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Doth ſhe not oppoſe and exalt her ſelf above what is worſhipped? God ſaith in his Word, <hi>You ſhall worſhip Me only, not Images.</hi> Saith the Pope (quite contrary) you ſhall worſhip Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. In the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, 567, the Pope with three hundred and eighteen Fathers, (as they call them) ordained the making and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Images.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Doth not he pretend to ſit in God's Temple, and make himſelf as if he were a God? In many things he makes himſelf equal with Chriſt; in forgiving Sins, in redeeming Souls by their Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, Propitiatory, and Explatory Sacrifices, which they blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58561:16"/>
ſay they make in their unbloody Sacrifice at Maſs. Beſides, The Pope and his Council can make new Articles of Faith, as if he were the thirteenth Apoſtle, and he is much troubled that he cannot find the name of <hi>Pope</hi> mentioned in the four Evangeliſts; therefore he hath made other Articles of Faith, which Chriſt never made.</p>
            <p>Take an account of ſome of them.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſo conſequently ſay they the Pope, is the Rock on which the Church is founded.</item>
               <item>2. That the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is our Mediatrix.</item>
               <item>3. That all other Saints ſuſtain that Office.</item>
               <item>4. Religious Worſhip is to be paid to Stocks and Stones, yea, old Clouts, called Reliques of Saints.</item>
               <item>5. That Images do as great Miracles as Chriſt himſelf, if not greater.</item>
               <item>6. Chriſt's Sufferings will not make ſatisfaction for our Sins; but we muſt alſo make ſatisfaction our ſelves.</item>
               <item>7. Such as died before St. <hi>French</hi>'s time were ſaved by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſince by St. <hi>Francis.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>8. All buried in the habit of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> whether <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Turk,</hi> ſhall be ſaved.</item>
               <item>9. That Chriſm takes away Sin, as Chriſt's Blood.</item>
               <item>10. That there is no Salvation without praying to Saints.</item>
            </list>
            <p>They deemed our Lord Jeſus Chriſt but half a Saviour; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deviſed <hi>Francis, Peter, Baruardons</hi> Son, as if he had been wounded with the ſame Wounds of Chriſt, and in the ſame parts, and conſecrated him in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, the typical <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Alſo how prophanely do they ſpeak of the Scripture, calling it, <hi>A Leader, Rule, Aeſops Fables, a Noſe of Wax, black and inkie Divinity, a Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phian Sword;</hi> and Chriſt's Miniſters, <hi>Scripture-Men, Inkie Divines.</hi> He will judge all Men, but will be judged by none. Therefore I infer, he that fitteth in the Temple of God, and oppoſeth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth himſelf above all that is called God, is the Man of Sin, the Antichriſt: But thus the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> doth; therefore 'tis not <hi>Rome</hi> Heather, but <hi>Rome</hi> Apoſtate, that is this Mother of Harlots.</p>
            <p>Object. 2. <hi>It cannot be</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>that can be this Mother of Harlots, the Antichriſt: Becauſe the Scripture ſets him out to be a ſingle Man,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. 3. <hi>called there, that Man of Sin, and Son of Perdition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This word here <hi>[Man of Sin]</hi> doth not reſpect the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſs of the Perſon, but the nature of the Antichriſt: He ſhall be a Man, or ſucceſſion of Men, which ſhall be full of Sin, a Man of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58561:16"/>
Sin, as if there was nothing but Sin in him. As Chriſt is called <hi>a Man of Sorrows,</hi> to ſhew that his whole Life was full of Sorrows: So the whole ſtate of Antichriſt is a ſtate of Sin. <hi>A Man of Sin,</hi> 'tis an apparent <hi>Hebraiſm,</hi> 'tis one given up to commit Iniquity. We reade of Men of Knowledg, of Patience, a Man of Strife; which are Perſons arrived above the common pitch: So he is called <hi>a Man of Sin,</hi> alſo <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> one paſt all hopes of Honeſty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It cannot be one ſingle Perſon, as ſome of the Fathers ſuppoſe, or one of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> which ſhall riſe in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> he muſt not be a <hi>Jew,</hi> but a pretended <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> And the City cannot be <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe ſhe is not built on ſeven Hills; nor can Antichriſt be one ſingle Perſon, becauſe we find he had a being in the Apoſtles days, 2 <hi>Theſſ. 2. 7. For the myſtery of Iniquity doth already work.</hi> And this myſtery of Iniquity will continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the coming of Chriſt, whom he ſhall deſtroy, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. Now ſurely this Perſon, if a ſingle Man, muſt be very Aged, that ſhould be in the Apoſtles days, and continue till Chriſt come in the Fleſh the ſecond time: What is his Name? Where doth he dwell? It is ridiculous ſo to think. You ſee therefore it muſt intend a ſucceſſion of Men, and not one ſingle Perſon.</p>
            <p>Object. 3. <hi>Rome Chriſtian cannot be Antichriſt: Becauſe the Apoſtle St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, that Antichriſt, that Man of Sin, was in his days,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. 7. <hi>But he whom the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of,</hi> Rev. 17. 10. <hi>was not then in being by your own account, which you ſay muſt be the Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis true, Antichriſt was then in being: But though he was then in being, he was not then revealed, as the Apoſtle phraſeth it, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 8. he had not arrived to his full Power, which is that the Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> means, when he ſaith, <hi>Five are fallen, one is, and the other is not:</hi> Not that he meaneth he had no beginning; no, for he tells us he had, in that phraſe, <hi>Rev. 17. 8. The Beaſt that was, is not, and yet is:</hi> He is, ſaith the Apoſtle, yet is not: He is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, but not a Man. Antichriſt began to work in the Apoſtles days, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 22. but was not revealed, in full power, had not ten Kings to aſſiſt him, till that which did let, was taken out of the way, which was the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which many Learned did believe; therefore prayed that the Empire might ſtand, that Antichriſt might be kept out. But the reaſon why the Apoſtle might not name the Heathen Emperor, was, becauſe in all probability Perſecution would have iſſued from <hi>Nero</hi> (then in Power) againſt the Chriſtians; and that it was the Heathen Emperor did let Antichriſt from being
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58561:17"/>
revealed, is the opinion of many of the Learned, even ſome of the Church of <hi>Rome, Cyril, Chryſoſtom, Tertullian,</hi> the famous Biſhop of <hi>Hippo, Theodorus:</hi> ſee a Book called, <hi>The Man of Sin,</hi> pag. 9, 10. As the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy muſt make <hi>roome</hi> for the <hi>Perſian,</hi> that for the <hi>Macedonian,</hi> and that for the <hi>Roman:</hi> So the <hi>Roman</hi> muſt make way for the <hi>Man of Sin, Antichriſt,</hi> the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and he at laſt muſt make way for <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that though Antichriſt was in the Apoſtles days, yet he was then but as an Infant, by degrees he grew more and more, till he came to his perfection; to have ten Horns, ten Kings, which gave their power to him according to the Prophecy.</p>
            <p>Having thus proved that <hi>Rome</hi> is that <hi>Myſtery Babylon,</hi> and Mother of Harlots, I now come to ſhew what a Harlot ſhe is.</p>
            <p>Firſt, She is a <hi>cloſe, ſecret, cunning Harlot:</hi> Well may the Apoſtle call her the <hi>myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> or iniquity in a Myſtery; or <hi>Myſtery Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Babylon</hi> in a Myſtery. The Apoſtle doth well deſcribe her, <hi>Rev. 13. 11. The Beaſt that came out of the Earth had two Horns like a Lamb, but a Voice like a Dragon.</hi> She pretended to be like Chriſt, but ſhe really is like the Dragon, the Devil, from whom ſhe hath her power; ſhe hath a form, a ſhew of Godlineſs, but the power of Ungodlineſs: She hath the name of a Chriſtian, but, like <hi>Sardis,</hi> is dead indeed. She is in a counterfeit ſhew Chriſt's Vicar, Chriſt's Vicegerent; in preſumption a Fellow-mate, in purpoſe an Adverſary. She hides the greateſt Impieties under the name of Piety; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhe gets her Riches by her Cunning. Not a little of her Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Craft is diſcovered in making that a Principle. That the Publick Worſhip ſhould be performed in a Language unknown to the People. And the Pope knows what he doth well enough: For ſeeing there are ſo many Idolatries, Errors, and Hereſies, in the Maſs-Book, 'tis better to be in Latin, than in the Mother-tongue, leaſt it ſhould be diſcovered, and the People come to know their Deluſions.</p>
            <p>But if you pleaſe to reade 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> condemns theſe Principles throughout the whole Chapter.</p>
            <p>And indeed no leſs is Antichriſt's Subtilty diſcovered in his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> a place that they ſay the pains are as ſharp, but not as eternal as the pains of Hell. But for as much as the Scripture ſpeaks not one word of Purgatory, but only Heaven and Hell, one for the Godly, and the other for the Ungodly, how dares the Pope to invent ſuch a place! O, Beloved, half his Religion, if not half his Gains, depends upon it. Therefore the Pope hath cunningly determined that there is a Fire. (which is not in the very Hell of all)
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58561:17"/>
where ſouls after this Life are purged from Sins, and that by the help of Maſſes, Dirges, and Prayers, theſe may be pardoned and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of thoſe Torments, eſpecially if they leave the Pope a good round ſum of Money to procure Indulgences, and have a Maſs-Prieſt to pray for their ſouls.</p>
            <p>Again, Her Cunning is ſeen in her pretence of having things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be ſeen and had; their lies further appear in that.</p>
            <p>They ſay, they can produce the Fore-skin of our Saviour, after Circumciſion; the Platter Chriſt eat the Paſchal Lamb in; the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice Chriſt gave the Sacrament in; yea, the Towel he wiped himſelf withal at Supper. Surely it was made of good Flax. So the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots, wherein the Water was turned to Wine in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee;</hi> yea, the Croſs, and alſo the Nails that nailed Chriſt to the Croſs, if you will believe them. The Text ſaith, one Man carried the Croſs: Yet <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, They have ſo much Timber, which they pretend to be Chriſt's Croſs, that a Horſe cannot carry it, nay, not many Horſes. Can you imagine they can ſhew the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s Hair, her Comb, upper and under Garments, yea, her Milk alſo: <hi>John Baptiſt's</hi> Head, Bones, yea, the Finger that pointed at Chriſt when he ſaid, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God!</hi> John 1. 29. alſo St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Jaw-bone, his Beard, one of his Teeth, his Chair, Garments, Altar, and a hundred Reliques more if needful.</p>
            <p>Again, They have Holy Water, Holy Oyl, Spittle, Salt, Beads, and thoſe other Superſtitions, for which not one word can be found. But what faith the Pope to them? Can he make no uſe of them? Yes; hereby we pick the Pockets of credulous Fools; hereby we get their Money, and give them bits of Virgins Wax, fine Beads, Toys for Children to play with: For all which ſhe receives good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Money. Thus ſhe is a cunning Harlot.</p>
            <p n="2">2. She is a <hi>Blaſphemous Harlot,</hi> Rev. 17. 3. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon her Head was the names of Blaſphemy,</hi> Rev. 13. 5. <hi>A Mouth ſpeaking great things, and blaſphemous,</hi> ver. 6. <hi>He opened his mouth in blaſphemy againſt God, to blaſpheme his Name, and his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, he had not only the Name, but <hi>Names</hi> of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: He is not content with one Name, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius, Domitian,</hi> his Predeceſſors were: but this Beaſt as he was to ſucceed in their Room, ſo he was to inherit their Nature, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do them in the worſt of their Actions. Now he may be ſaid to open his Mouth in blaſphemy againſt God, two ways:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Either denying the very Beingof God, as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Who is the Lord, that we ſhould obey him?</hi> Or,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:58561:18"/>
2. When frail Men ſhall intrude into the Place of God, by aſſuming to themſelves ſome of his Divine and Incommunicable Attributes. Thus the Prince of <hi>Tyre</hi> blaſphemed God, when he ſaid, <hi>I am a God, I ſit in the Seat of God,</hi> Ezek. 29. 2, 4, 7. This deſcription St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. 4. He exalts himſelf not only above Magiſtrates, called Gods, but declares and labours to demonſtrate that he is God, by pretending to a God-like Power, to pardon Sin, and offer up a propitiatory Sacrifice in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody Maſs: yea, to abſolve from Laws, diſpence with Oaths, to be Infallible, and the like. Which Title and Power whoever dares aſſume to himſelf, the ſame is Antichriſt, a Blaſphemer, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Beaſt. This the Pope doth aſſume, therefore he is the Beaſt, and Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>Take ſome further Inſtances of their Blaſphemy: The <hi>Gloſs</hi> ſaith, he that denieth the Pope's Obedience, lieth under the ſame Sentence of Damnation, as he that denieth the Almighty Power of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stapleton,</hi> an Engliſh Jeſuit, ſtyl'd Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13th, <hi>The Great, moſt Gracious and Soveraign God on Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sicilian</hi> Ambaſſadors coming to ask Pardon of <hi>Martin</hi> the 4th, delivered their Supplication, by ſaying three times, <hi>O Lamb of God, which takeſt away the Sin of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>'Tis Hereſie to think that our Lord God the Pope, hath no power to decree as he hath decreed.</hi> And the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> ſay, one Article of the Popiſh Creed is, <hi>That the power of Indulgences was left by Chriſt, and that the uſe of them is very available to Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, She blaſphemeth the Tabernacle of God. 1. This may either ſignifie the Church of God, which oftentimes is called the Houſe of God, over which the Beaſt doth ſinfully aſſume a Power. Or, 2. It holds forth the Humane Nature of Chriſt, which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth elegantly call it, becauſe it was the true Tabernacle which the Lord had pitched, and not Man, which is blaſphemed, when the merit of thoſe Sufferings which God himſelf underwent in the Humane Nature is leſſened, and Chriſt's Blood not accounted ſufficient to cleanſe from Sin, without ſomething added by Men to inch out its value. Nay, theſe Blaſphemers do take away the property of each Nature in Chriſt; the Godhead is Infinite, the Humane Nature, Finite. The Pope doth ſet out the Deity of the Father in Pictures and Images, and doth imagine the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt to be in many places at once: With this ſhift, Is any thing too hard for God? So he forges a Finite Divinity, and an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Humanity. He doth alſo confeſs in words, that Chirſt is Juſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58561:18"/>
and Merciful, but in deed doth indirectly deny both. For perfect Juſtice doth not admit of imperfect Satisfaction, that's humane; and perfect Mercy doth not grant imperfect Pardon. Chriſt doth not remit the Fault, and retain the Puniſhment. The Pope doth teach indirectly, that imperfect Satisfaction and Pardon is performed by Chriſt to the Faithful, and ſo makes Chriſt a plain Idol.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thoſe that dwell in Heaven,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>are Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> Rev. 13. 6. They are Angels, or departed Saints. Now when any thing is done to them that are in Heaven, which they would not own on Earth, is to blaſpheme them. You know when the Men of <hi>Lyſtra, Acts</hi> 14. 14. offered to worſhip St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> which had the excuſe of an amazing Miracle to juſtifie them, yet 'tis ſaid, <hi>they rent their Clothes:</hi> Which was uſual in caſes of Blaſphemy, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 37. So when St. <hi>John</hi> would have worſhipped the Angel, ſaid he, <hi>I am thy Fellow-Servant: Worſhip God,</hi> Rev. 22. 8, 9. So the Son of God himſelf appearing unto <hi>Manoah</hi> in the ſhape of an Angel, would not have ſacrifice offered to him, but ſaid, <hi>If thou offer an Offering, offer it to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet one Article of the Popes Creed is, <hi>I do hold that the Saints reigning with Chriſt, are to be worſhipped and invocated; that they offer up their Prayers to God for us, and that their Reliques are to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.</hi> When they pray to St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> they ſay, <hi>Let him ſave us from our Sins, that in Heaven with the Saints we may reſt.</hi> So of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul, Grant that by both their Merits, we may obtain the the glory of Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>O Queen of Heaven moſt mild, deareſt Mother to thy Child.</l>
               <l>Deſpiſe me not, O Duſt, in thee alone I truſt.</l>
               <l>God's ſweet Heart ſpringing, and Star of Grace,</l>
               <l>Think on me ſtill, till I have run my Race.</l>
               <l>We do thee praiſe, and beg always,</l>
               <l>Chriſt Jeſus's Mother dear;</l>
               <l>That thou attend, and us defend</l>
               <l>From ſad Death, which we fear.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O,</hi> Mary, <hi>the Mother of Grace and Mercy, defend us from our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and receive us in the hour of Death. O holy Croſs, our only hope, increaſe our Righteouſneſs. O Saint, ſaith the holy Servant of Chriſt, prepare for us the Glory which thou haſt merited. O Prince</hi> Gabriel, <hi>be on our ſide againſt the Wicked, and all that work Iniquity.</hi> Jaſpar, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chior, <hi>and</hi> Belthazar, <hi>with all the twelve Apoſtles, help me in my neceſſity.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:58561:19"/>
Thus they invocate the Saints and Angels, which is proper only to God: <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble,</hi> Pſal. 50. 15.</p>
            <p>Reliques Invocated.</p>

               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>Thirdly, The Church of <hi>Rome is a proud Harlot.</hi> This appears in that ſhe cannot be ſatisfied without Ruling and Reigning over mens Bodies and Souls, yea, over the beſt Kings and Princes in the World; and all under pretence that the Pope is <hi>St. Peter's</hi> Succeſſor. Which makes nothing for him if he were, but againſt him, for St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that Biſhops muſt not be Lords over God's Heritage, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Chriſt alone is the chief Shepherd of the Sheep. Therefore Shepherds are ſo far from being Lords over God's Heritage, that they are to be Servants; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that will be greateſt among you, let him be a Servant:</hi> As Chriſt commanded <hi>Peter, to feed his Lambs and Sheep,</hi> John 21. 15, 16, 17. Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds have an equal Power here under Chriſt, and he is the Head of all. See <hi>Epheſ. 1. 22. Col.</hi> 1. 18. Beſides, <hi>St. Peter</hi> exhorts to a ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Kings, and Kingly Government, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14, 15. ſuch as are a Terror to evil doers, and a praiſe to them that do well. But the Pope is ſo unlike <hi>St. Peter,</hi> that he tells us he hath power to diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs Princes, if they will not root out ſuch as he calls Hereticks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:58561:19"/>
Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, made one of the Emperors fall down before him in the Temple of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> all the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, putting his beaſtly Foot on his Neck, and uttered theſe words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt tread on the Lion and the Adder, the young Lion and Adder thou ſhalt trample under foot.</hi> The uſages of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and King <hi>John,</hi> do very plainly prove his Uſurpation over Kings. They did what they could againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when they Excommunicated her, and they would have diſpoſſeſſed her of the Kingdom, they did what they could by their <hi>Invincible Armada</hi> (as the Pope chriſtened it) in 1588. but through God's Goodneſs it proved <hi>Vincible.</hi> When the Scripture tells us we muſt be ſubject to the higher Powers, which are Magiſtrates and Princes, <hi>Rom. 13. 1, 2, 3. &amp;c.</hi> The Pope exempts himſelf and all his Clergy, (Prieſts, Monks, Friars, Jeſuits, Nuns, and all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons) from the Juriſdiction of the Civil Magiſtrates, and takes upon him to abſolve all their Subjects from their Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance (if they do not pleaſe him) and give away their Kingdoms and Dominions to others, that will ſubmit to him, and do him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſervice: As <hi>Gregory</hi> did ſpoil <hi>Leo</hi> the third, in taking from him all the Government of the Weſt. Again, her Pride is ſeen in laying the Sriptures of God ſo low, and trampling upon them. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> ſaith, <hi>That holy Council was to have the ſame Veneration and Honour as the Scripture.</hi> And we read in their Decrees, <hi>That the Doctrine of the Chriſtian Religion, is rather taken from the Popes mouth than the Scripture.</hi> 'Tis they that have pronounced the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> Authentick, which was not written by the Prophets, nor received by the Jewiſh Church. And how often do they take from, and add to the Scripture? Yea, ſay they, the Scripture owes its Authority to the Church; and ſhe is ſuperiour to it: And none are Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt, but ſuch as are accounted ſo by the Church; and that Tradition is the very rule of Truth, and the Pope's Inſtructions better than the Scripture, ſay the Decrees. <hi>The Scripture is a dumb and dead Thing, and the tale of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth. No leſs is his pride ſeen, when he calls himſelf <hi>the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Head, Husband, Lion of the Tribe of</hi> Judah, <hi>the Root of</hi> David.</p>
            <p>And though the Scriptures ſpeak ſufficiently of their own clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Pſal. 19. 7. 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16, 17. &amp;c. Yet Antichriſt is of another mind, he ſaith they are very ambiguous in their meaning, and may be twiſted any way, like a Noſe of Wax, or Leaden Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; therefore 'tis not for the Common People to look into them, leſt they are poiſoned with Errors and Hereſies; and (ſay
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58561:20"/>
they) the Scripture is defective in many things, and there is much more of the Mind of God to be known than in the Scripture, which is conveyed down by unwritten Traditions. Now thoſe truths in which the Scripture is defective, are ſuch as theſe; the Offering on the Altar, Sacrifice, Invocation of Saints, Prayers for the Dead, the Primacy of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> above Kings and Princes, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Confirmation, Orders, Matrimony, Penance, Extream Unction, Merits of Works, Auricular Confeſſions, and many more weighty and neceſſary truths, ſay they, which muſt be ſupplied by Tradition, becauſe the Scripture is ſilent in them, and I queſtion not but ever will.</p>
            <p>Will you hear the Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent, That Traditions are to be received with the ſame pious affection as the holy Scripture.</hi> O pride, above all pride! One <hi>Marta</hi> expounds that ſaying, in <hi>Pſal. 8. 6, 7, 8. Thou haſt put under his feet</hi> (the Popes) <hi>all Sheep and Oxen, Chriſtians and Sarazens, Fowls of the Air, the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Fiſhes in the Sea, and Souls in Purgatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, In the Year of Jubilee, the <hi>Pope</hi> is carried in Proceſſion in a Chair of State, a ſumptuous Canopy born over his Head by Kings and Nobles: He is a King over all the Children of Pride.</p>
            <p>His Pride is Illuſtrated in his endeavouring to have the whole World at his command, and to wear his Mark in their Foreheads, and Hands. She hath but too many Souls that have received this Mark. So <hi>Rev. 11. 3. The World wandred after the Beaſt,</hi> ver. 16. He cauſeth all, both Rich and Poor, Small and Great, Free or Bond, to receive a Mark in their right Hand, or in their Foreheads; and that no Man might buy or ſell, but he that hath the Mark, or the name of the Beaſt, or the number of his Name. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 1. her pride is painted out there to the life, <hi>ſhe ſits upon many Waters, that is, People, Multitudes, Nations, and Tongues.</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>And I ſaw a Woman ſit upon a Scarlet-coloured Beaſt, full of names of blaſphemy, having ſeven Heads and ten Horns.</hi> Seven Heads, which is ſeven forms of Government; and ten Horns, ten Kings, that gave their power to the Beaſt. The Woman is the City; the Beaſt is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; her Names of Blaſphemy you have heard. The Beaſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Scarlet-coloured Beaſt, to ſhew her ſins are of a very deep Dye; they are Scarlet-ſins, and accompanied with the greateſt Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Her Character: She is an <hi>Idolatrous Harlot:</hi> Which is made manifeſt in her worſhipping of Images: And that ſhe may do this with the more eaſe, they have taken away wholly the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58561:20"/>
out of their Bibles. And leſt the People ſhould miſs one, they divide the Tenth into two. And when they are urged with the breach of the ſecond Commandment, they ſay, <hi>'Tis not Images we are forbidden to worſhip, but 'tis a Thing in the Original.</hi> Suppoſe that be true, Is not an Image a thing? Notwithſtanding this ſecond Commandment, they ſet up Images (in their publick places of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> of St. <hi>Winifred,</hi> of <hi>God</hi> like an old gray-headed Man ſitting in a Chair, and of the <hi>Trinity</hi> like a ſtrange Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with three Faces, before which the People fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. O horrid Idolatry! And that they might make the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this is lawful, though forbidden in Scripture, they feign that Chriſt in the thirty firſt Year of his Age, himſelf ſent his own Image to King <hi>Abdager,</hi> and made it alſo by Miracle on the Handkerchief of St. <hi>Veronica,</hi> and on his own ſhroud. He that will believe it may. This we might have put among the popiſh Lyes and Forgeries. And therefore the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council anathematizes Image-breakers (that is, ſuch as ſhall break them in contempt or ſcorn) and all ſuch as alledg the places of Scripture which are againſt Idols, againſt their ſacred Images. 'Tis one of the Articles of the Popes Creed, <hi>I do hold that the Images of Chriſt, ever bleſſed Virgin, and all other Saints, are to be had and adored with due worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They commit Idolatry at Maſs alſo, when they ſhall bow to a Wafer, as if it were a God, after Conſecration: alſo they make Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators of Saints and Angels, though the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks ſo very plainly, that <hi>there is but one Mediator between God and man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5. The <hi>Pope</hi> hath found out a great many. The <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> is prayed to, <hi>that ſhe would command her Son to have mercy on them:</hi> For as one of the Jeſuits ſaith, <hi>The Virgin's milk is as precious as the Blood of Chriſt.</hi> And as for what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in this Caſe, 'tis not much to be heeded: For as one Canon in the Decretal ſaith, <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſpoke againſt all Reaſon and Truth;</hi> and others have ſaid, <hi>That if the Apoſtle St.</hi> Paul <hi>be not warily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, he will ſmell of Hereſie;</hi> and <hi>that St.</hi> Paul'<hi>s Epiſtles have need of a Roman Commentary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But may we not be too bold to come to Chriſt, and by him to God the next away? Would it not be more decent and mannerly to come by Angels: As when we come to a King, we make uſe of Courtiers to get acceſs to the preſence Chamber. But the Scripture plainly tells us, we muſt come to God by Chriſt alone, <hi>John</hi> 14. 6.

Fifthly, She is a <hi>Drunken, Blood thirſty, Cruel, Inhumane Harlot:</hi> Not without cauſe is ſhe called the Scarlet-coloured Beaſt, having drunk ſo much of the Blood of the Saints and Martyrs of Jeſus. <hi>Rev. 6. 9, 10, 11. And when he had opened the fifth Seal, I ſaw under the Altar the Souls of them that were ſlain for the Word of God, and for the teſtimony that they held. And they cried with a loud voice, ſaying, How long, O Lord, Holy and True, doſt not thou judg and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the Earth?</hi> Rev. 17. 4. <hi>Theſe came out of great Tribulation.</hi> Rev. 16. 6. <hi>For they have ſhed the blood of Saints and Prophets.</hi> Rev. 18. 20. <hi>Rejoyce over her thou Heaven, and ye holy Apostles and Prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.</hi> Ver. 24. <hi>And in her was found the blood of Prophets, and of Saints, and of all that were ſlain on the Earth.</hi> This further confirmed: For under <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth of <hi>France,</hi> more than thirty thouſand Proteſtants were ſlain in one Month, <hi>Anno 1572. Bellarmin</hi> confeſſeth, that an hundred thouſand of the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> were ſlain in one day, under <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> the Third.</p>
            <p>Let me here call in the <hi>Powder-Plot</hi> againſt <hi>England</hi> 1605, for a Witneſs to this truth. Let me not forget the many thouſands <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> whoſe guilt was their Gold. Alſo that Inquiſition of the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which he called the <hi>Council of Blood,</hi> where were above fifty thouſand Chriſtians murdered at once. Will not <hi>Ireland</hi> witneſs for me here, where were about three hundred thouſand Maſſacred, Starved and Drowned, whoſe Blood calls aloud to be reckoned for? So in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> how many quiet peaceable ſouls were murdered there? Shall I not bring in their Deſign of firing <hi>London, Semptember</hi> 2. 1666, as a Witneſs in this matter? Let me not forget Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godfry,</hi> who will in the great Day of Judgment come in againſt this Church, and prove her a Blood-thirſty Harlot, yea, the Mother of Harlots. I would not have you forget this laſt Conſpiracy, in ſome part (bleſſed be God) diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, She is <hi>a Lying diſſembling Harlot:</hi> Which appears in her pretended Miracles. And this is one ſign and mark the Apoſtle gives of Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſſ. 2. 9, 10. Even him whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all Power, and Signs, and Lying Wonders, and with all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh.</hi>

               <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 14. He doth great Wonders, inſomuch that he maketh Fire come down from Heaven on the Earth, in the ſight of Men. And that you may not think this is real, but only ſeeming, in the 14th verſ. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth.</hi>

               <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and ſome others, would not have the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> to be this myſtery of Iniquity: <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Pope never brings down Fire from Heaven in the ſight of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But the <hi>Pope</hi> pretends to it, or as bad, if you will believe their <hi>Legends:</hi> How often by them are Images counterfeited to move, to ſweat, to nod, to ſpeak, in the account of poor ſimple Men and Women, that they may be aſſured to the worſhipping of thoſe Images they ſee. <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See a Book called,</hi> A Looking-Glaſs for the Pope.</note> The Devil did often ſpeak in the Images of <hi>Heathen Rome;</hi> and no doubt but the Devil doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeak in the Images of <hi>Mystery Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> calls them <hi>Lying Wonders and Signs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect to the End, becauſe they ſerve to ſeduce Men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Called ſo in reſpect of the Matter: For they are either the counterfeits of Lying Men, or the Wonders of Deceitful Spirits.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In reſpect of the Form: For whereas true Miracles exceeded Nature, and were wrought by the Omnipotent Power of God, falſe Wonders are thoſe that are effected by Natural Cauſes, and partly by the power of Satan. The Miracles of the firſt kind have been infinite in the dark Kingdom of Antichriſt; the Apparitions of Spirits, the Viſions of Angels, our Lady <hi>Mary;</hi> How often hath ſhe been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gliding out of Heaven? How often have the miſerable Souls crept puling out of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> beſetting High-ways, and recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Torments, to procure Men to pity them. Hence the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of <hi>Purgatory</hi> is grown ſo very gainful. How often have Images walked on foot, if you will believe it, the Bells ſtruck alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out help, the Angels like Choriſters chant it in <hi>Canterbury</hi> Miniſter, and play upon <hi>Dunſtan</hi>'s Harp; the Apoſtles to come down from Heaven, to help <hi>Baſil</hi> to ſay Maſs? Theſe Lying Miracles were feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Cheating Prieſts, to confirm ſtrange Lyes, and cozen ſimple People of their Coyne: For how often hath a Spirit been appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by a Magiſtrate, Angels ſtript, and our Lady ſent to her Cell? All of them have been notably whipt, ſo that they had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have been in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Theſe had a ſhew of Miracles, but were not really ſo. Nay, how have they pretended to confirm their Maſs with Miracles, and the Tranſubſtantiation? Witneſs that Pillar of Fire from Heaven falling to the Earth upon that place, whereby the negligence of the Prieſt, as the <hi>Legend</hi> doth report, the Body of God fell out of the Pix upon the Grals, that Pillar of Fire ſhining like the Sun about the Body of God, ſo that all the Beaſts of the Field (except one black Horſe which bended but two) bended all their four
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58561:22"/>
Legs to the Body of God. This is like the reſt of her Miracles.</p>
            <p>Pray ſee a few of their own Authors againſt their pretended Miracles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyranus</hi> ſaith, <hi>The People in our Church are grievouſly guld with Miracles, the Prieſts fain for worldly Gain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> a learned Papiſt, ſaith, <hi>There be thoſe who thought it a piece of Piety to tell Lyes for Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saith <hi>Chryſoſtom, Miracles were of good uſe in the Apoſtles days, but of none now: But becauſe there is none now, think not there were none then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that asketh now for a Prodigie, or Miracle, is a Prodigie himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theophilact,</hi> ſpeaking of the Miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, ſaith, <hi>They were ceaſed long a-go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the gifts of Miracles are now ceaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Colledg of <hi>Paris,</hi> in a Writing in 1389. ſaith, <hi>Miracles ought to be ſuſpected, ſince our Lord ſaith,</hi> Mat. 24. <hi>Falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence I infer from this laſt Mark, That whoever pretends to work Miracles, which are nothing elſe but Lyes and Impoſtures, is Antichriſt: But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth ſo pretend, yet nothing but Lyes is the bottom of it; Therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is this Antichriſt, this Beaſt, this Man of Sin, this Mother of Harlots, and Abominations of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The Mother of Harlots, the Church of <hi>Rome, is a croſs crooked Harlot.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt ſaith one thing, ſhe another quite contrary. The Spirit ſaith, 'Tis lawful for all ſorts and degrees of men to Marry: But Antichriſt forbids it, and ſaith, That the Prieſts muſt not, though Whoredom probably may paſs, or elſe ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Infants Sculls had not been found in the Pope's Pond. And a Book in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's days, repreſents to the King, that there were <hi>one hundred thouſand Whores made by the unmarried Clergie.</hi> And Pope <hi>Joan</hi> had a Baſtard, proving her ſelf the Literal Whore of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſay 'tis much leſs ſin for a Prieſt to have many Whores, than have one Wife; and he that hath no Wife, but in ſtead of that a Whore, may not for that be ſuſpended the Communion. Many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances we might give. At <hi>Bath,</hi> one Monk had ſeven Whores, three married, four ſingle, and was a <hi>Sodomite</hi> to boot. At <hi>Monk-fairlee,</hi> the Prior had nine Whores, and the Convent many more. At <hi>Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bradly,</hi> the Prior had five Whores, and ſix Baſtards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:58561:22"/>
Many more Inſtances might be given; but let theſe ſuffice: Here are too many of theſe.</p>
            <p>Again, God ſaith that <hi>all our Righteouſneſs is as filthy Rags and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous Clothes:</hi> But the Pope ſaith, <hi>That our good Works do properly merit Salvation; ſo that God would not be Juſt, did he not reward our good Works with Heaven: And that we have ability to do all that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and more too, ſo that we may merit for our ſelves and others.</hi> Theſe are Works of Supererogation. Look but into the Lives of the Popes, and you will ſee this confirmed backward.</p>
            <p>Again, Chriſt in his laſt Inſtitution, ſaid, <hi>Drink all of this Cup, all my Diſciples:</hi> But the Pope ſaith, The People muſt be contented with half the Sacrament, which is enough for the poor inferiour ſort of People; the Prieſt alone muſt drink of the Cup.</p>
            <p>Again, The Scripture never ſpeaks of the Miniſter's Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by himſelf: But this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, which they call private Maſs. See what the Scripture ſaith to this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. But 'tis enough for the People to ſtand and gaze on the Prieſt (ſaith the Pope) while he mumbles over his <hi>Latine,</hi> ſaying ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they know not what, and doing ſomething they care not what, and drinking ſomething they taſte not, and yet 'tis a Communion for all this.</p>
            <p>Again, The Scripture ſaith, That <hi>the Heavens muſt retain Chriſt's Body, till the time of the Reſtitution of all things.</hi> But the Pope ſaith (and is not this a croſs Harlot) that as ſoon as the Prieſt hath ſaid theſe few words, <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum,</hi> This is my Body, that the Bread and Wine are tranſubſtantiated into the ſame Body of Chriſt, that was born of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and hung upon the Croſs: When if People did but believe their own Eyes, Taſte, and Feeling, they muſt needs conclude 'tis nothing but a Wafer, which the Prieſt makes many ſcores of, and conſecrates at the ſame time: And though this be done in a thouſand places beſides, ſo many Bodies Chriſt muſt have. O horrid! O ſenſleſs! and unreaſonable! that a man cannot be a Papiſt, but he muſt become a Beaſt.</p>
            <p>Again, The Word of God ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt by his own Offering, hath for ever perfected thoſe that are Sanctified,</hi> Heb. 10. 12, 14. Heb. 9. 24, 25, 26. But this croſs Harlot ſaith, That Chriſt is offered up once every day as an Unbloody Sacrifice for the Quick and the Dead, to fetch ſouls out of Purgatory; and every time the Prieſt lifts up the Wafer, he makes an Attonement for the ſins of the People: But 'tis dangerous to truſt to that Atonement. 'Tis an Article in the Pope's Creed, <hi>I profeſs that there is offered up in the Maſs to God, a true
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58561:23"/>
proper and propitiatory Sacrifice for the Quick and Dead.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is full and clear, that Chriſt's Propitiatory Sacrifice for ſin in number is but one, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. For Time, but once offered; the Prieſt was himſelf alone: the Place, upon the Croſs: the Manner, not Unbloody, but Bloody: for the Virtue, Exceeding, Effectual: For what reaſon then doth the <hi>Pope</hi> deviſe another Propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, I know not, except it be to fill his Coffers. Yea, they give the ſame Honour to their departed Saints as to Chriſt. Thus they ſpeak of <hi>Gregory, Let him ſave us from our Sins.</hi> 'Tis true what ſome ſay, Chriſt can hardly be diſcerned from the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>O bleſſed Mother, ſanctifie us from our Sins, by the right of Mother, command a Redeemer.</hi> So ſhe forbids Meats, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3, 4. in <hi>Lent,</hi> and other times, which God hath commanded to be received with Thankſgiving; And is not this a perverſe Harlot?</p>
            <p>Eightly. This Harlot <hi>is an impenitent, yet a ſecure Harlot;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Blood ſhe hath ſhed, and all the Judgments threatned, ſhe is yet ſecure and impenitent, and will be like <hi>Babylon</hi> of old, that Type of Myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> Iſa. 47. 7. <hi>Thou ſayeſt thou ſhalt be a Lady for ever.</hi> So Rev. 18. 7. <hi>For ſhe ſaith in her Heart, I ſit as a Queen, I am no Widow, and ſhall ſee no Sorrow.</hi> And as God plagued Imperial <hi>Rome</hi> with ſending the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> to burn up their City: So God will plague Myſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet ſhe will not repent of her Fornication. <hi>Rev. 16. 8, 9, 10. Men are ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Fire, and great heat</hi> ſhall be their Judgment. But how will they behave themſelves? Do they repent and beg for Mercy? No, <hi>They blaſpheme more and more the Name of God,</hi> which had power over thoſe Plagues, <hi>and they repented not to give him Glory.</hi> Ver. 11. <hi>They blaſphemed the God of Heaven, becauſe of their Pains, and their Sores, and repented not of their Deeds.</hi> No, they could not, for they were judicially hardned in their Sins. So in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 18. when Judgment is poured down upon them, they are angry, they fret and vex, they cannot have their Will on God as they have had on his Saints. So in <hi>Rev. 9. 20. The reſt of the men that were not killed by thoſe Plagues, yet repented not of the Works of their Hands, that they ſhould not worſhip Devils, and Idols of Gold, Silver and Braſs, Stone, and of Wood: which neither can ſee, nor bear, nor walk.</hi> Ver. 21. <hi>Neither repented they of their murders,</hi> (mark that) <hi>nor of their Sorceries, nor of their Fornication, nor of their Thefts.</hi> Thus you ſee ſhe is an impenitent Whore, a brazen-faced Harlot, ſhe is not aſhamed of any thing ſhe hath done againſt God, or his People.</p>

Ninthly, She is a <hi>Superſtitious Harlot;</hi> full of Ceremonies that Chriſt never gave any Toleration for. Out of what Evangeliſt did Chriſt command your Altar? Did not he Adminiſter the Sacrament at a Table, in all probability? Where do you find any other Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that Chriſt wore, than his uſual Garments, when he Inſtituted the Sacrament? Why do your Prieſts then wear ſo many fooliſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Garments, more fit for a Stage-player, than a Miniſter of Chriſt? Which of the Apoſtles wore the <hi>Amis,</hi> or <hi>Linnen-Vail,</hi> or <hi>Albe?</hi> Who commanded you to wear a Girdle, in ſignification of that Cord (you ſay) Chriſt was bound in the Garden withal? the Maniple that bound Chriſt to the Piller? The Stole, a Cord by which Chriſt was led to be Crucified with? I do not remember I have read of ſuch a Cord in the Scripture, neither do I find any Chalice the Apoſtles uſed, nor a Pattin, or Altar-Clothes, Corporal or Pall. Where did Chriſt ever ſay the Sacrament is for three ſorts of Men; thoſe in Heaven to encreaſe Glory; them in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> to free them from pain; them on Earth, to encreaſe Grace? or the Miniſters going back three ſteps from an Altar, in token of Chriſt's proſtrating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Where did the Prieſt learn to beat his Breſt at <hi>Mea culpa,</hi> and to bow at the <hi>Confiteor,</hi> and to kiſs the Altar? Where do you find in God's Word the <hi>Introit?</hi> In what Chapter do you find the <hi>Kyrie Eleiſon,</hi> to repeat nine times, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us;</hi> three times to the Father, three times to the Son, three times to the Holy Ghoſt? What Book in the Scripture do you find Prayers called <hi>the Collects,</hi> or that <hi>Allelujah</hi> is repeated at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> more than any other time of the Year? Where is the Trackt to be found; that is, to be read with a ſlow and a long Voice? Where did any of the Apoſtles reade the Goſpel at the North-end of the Altar, or St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſign the Book with the ſign of the Croſs? Or the Miniſter and People ſign themſelves in three places with the ſign of the Croſs, on the Forehead, on the Mouth, and on the Breſt? Where do we find Chriſt waſh his Fingers juſt after the Sacraments Inſtitution, as your Prieſts do? In what Epiſtle do you find the Apoſtles adore the Bread and Wine that were in his Hand when he Adminiſter'd it? Where have you any Office of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> conſecrated in Scripture, as <hi>Hymns, Pſalms, Canticles, Antiphones, Verſicles, Reſponſories,</hi> and <hi>Prayers,</hi> which you divide the Virgins Office in? Not in holy Writ, I am ſure. Who bid you beg for the aſſiſtance of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to perform your ſervice to God's Glory?

Let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> prove that ſhe hath received thoſe Ceremonies from the Spirit of God, as ſhe pretends, and I will own them too.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, I might ſhow that this Harlot is <hi>a rich Harlot.</hi> See what <hi>Rev. 18. throughout,</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Merchants of this City which were made Rich by her, they ſeeing her Deſtruction, ſhall ſay, Alas! alas! that great City! which was clothed in fine Linnen, and Purple, and Scarlet, and decked with Gold, and precious Stones, and Pearls.</hi> Her Worldly Pomp ſhe hath in her preſent Church ſtate, even among the Clergy only, is quite out of the reach of the beſt Arithmeticians.

our Hearts, leſt our Sins ſhould let her in again upon us; as the Sins of <hi>Iſrael</hi> brought in the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> upon them; and not only ſo, but laid their City deſolate, and cauſed God to take away their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Prieſts, Ark, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> their Solemn Aſſemblies, Sabbaths, and appointed Feaſts. Let us keep our ground that we have got againſt <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and ſtand up as Witneſſes for the Lord: Though we may be ſlain for it, comfort your ſelves in this, the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſhall live again.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let all that are in <hi>Babylon,</hi> be exhorted to take the Counſel of the Spirit of God in <hi>Rev. 18. 4. Come out of her:</hi> And that firſt, becauſe ſhe is a falſe Church. Whatever ſhe pretends, as marks to denote her a true Church, ſhe cannot be ſo, becauſe National. The Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> was ſo indeed: But the Goſpel-Church is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational; only ſuch to be Members of the Goſpel-Church, which can give an account of the Work of Grace upon their Hearts, <hi>Acts 2. 42, 43. Acts</hi> 8. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. As little can they ſay for their Holineſs, which they ſay muſt be in a True Church. See the Lives of many of them which have been Heads of that Church, I mean the <hi>Popes;</hi> ſome have been Drunkards, ſome Whore-mongers, Thieves, given more to War than to Chriſt, prophane Scoffers of Chriſt, Murderers, Poiſoners of their own Parents, calling on the Devil to help them, Players at Dice, and Drinkers of the Devil's Health, Traitors to Princes, <hi>&amp;c. Bernard</hi> was a little moved with the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> when he called them <hi>Tyrants, Defrauders, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous, Traitors, Darkneſs of the World, Wolves</hi> and <hi>Devils.</hi> Are theſe <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s Succeſſors? I am ſure he never taught Men to live at this rate; neither did he live ſo himſelf. If they will have <hi>Peter</hi>'s Seat, they muſt have <hi>Peter</hi>'s Doctrine and Life. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath neither; therefore not <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s Seat.</p>
               <p>And as to their pretended <hi>Miracles,</hi> we have already ſpoke to them. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> may as ſoon prove themſelves Chriſt's Spouſe upon that account, as the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to her <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> as little can be ſaid upon that account, if we may believe Hiſtory, there's ſome ſcores of Orders of Monks and Friars amongſt them; and ſome of them have been ſo divided, that they Burnt one another for matters of Religion, and for different Opinions.</p>
               <p>And if you will ſee the Pope's <hi>Infallibility,</hi> or rather <hi>Fallibility,</hi> look into their Lives, which I juſt paſt.</p>
               <p>And as for her pretence of <hi>Viſibility,</hi> if we ever behold and ſee the True Church (but as we look on her we ſhall never ſee her the true viſible Church of Chriſt) it hath Chriſt for its Head, ſo hath
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58561:26"/>
not the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> All her Members are ſuch as profeſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from dead Works, and Faith in Chriſt: So do not all the Members of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and 'tis impoſſible they ſhould, being National. The true Viſible Church obſerveth all Chriſt's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, have a true Baptiſm both in reſpect of Manner and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; ſo the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not. The true Viſible Church of Chriſt on Earth, may be known by theſe three Marks: Firſt, A right Gathering, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 25. not by the Sword, but by the Word. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, A right Conſtitution, which conſiſts in free Fellowſhip of the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts 20. 40, 41, 42, 47. Acts</hi> 17. 4. The ſecond thing pertaining to Church-Conſtitution conſiſts in the diſpoſing her Members to thoſe Places to which they are fitted to ſerve in, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27. with <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 28. <hi>Acts</hi> 6, 3, 4. The third mark of the true Viſible Church of Chriſt, is Government, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Primitive Practice, which was only Spiritual, and did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide not in the Paſtors and Elders apart from the Church, but in the Paſtors together with the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 22, 25. yet ſo as that thoſe to whom the Church hath committed her Power, are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in the Name of Chriſt and his Church, to exerciſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: Which Government conſiſteth in theſe things, Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Reproofs, with all Long-ſuffering and Doctrine, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. And if this prevail not with Offenders, then is the power of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication to be exerciſed, according to <hi>Mat. 18. 17, 18. 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5. But can any of theſe Marks be found in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> No, ſhe makes Members by the Sword, as the True Church by the Word; She forceth them to be of her Religion. Whereas Members of the true Viſible Church are Volunteers, 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 5. Rome</hi>'s Government is by the Sword, not by God's Word; 'tis Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, not Spiritual, as the Government of Chriſt's Church is: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſee ſhe is ſtill the falſe Church, the Mother of Harlots, what ever ſhe pretends.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place. <hi>Come out of</hi> Babylon <hi>thoſe that are in her:</hi> And you that are out, keep out; becauſe if you partake of her Sins, you will partake of her Plagues. Take an account of them in ſeveral Threatnings of God againſt her: the Apoſtle calls upon us in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 1. to ſee the Iudgment of the great Whore, that ſitteth upon many Waters. In this Judgment they ſhall kill one another, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 4. making good that Prophecy in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. where 'tis ſaid that God ſhall put it into the Hearts of the ten Horns, the ten Kings, to hate the Whore, to burn her Fleſh with Fire, and make her deſolate, Rev. 18. 16. <hi>Reward her double even as ſhe hath rewarded you: And
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58561:26"/>
double unto her double according to her Works. In the Cup which ſhe hath filled, fill to her double.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>France,</hi> who proved ſo Treacherous and Cruel to the Admiral <hi>Coligny,</hi> and the Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> to the number of about an hundred thouſand Maſſacred in a moſt Inhumane man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; though he gloried ſo much in that Action, as to make certain Medals to perpetuate the Memory of it, yet the ſame King was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly tormented with the Horrors of a guilty Conſcience, which the Effuſion of ſo much Blood did juſtly raiſe in him, being ſometimes troubled with Viſions, he was often heard to ſay, <hi>Ah! my poor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, what had you done? But I was forced to it.</hi> The ſtrange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his Death, looked like a ſignal Judgment from Heaven, for that Bloody Day: For after a long Sickneſs, believed to be the Effect of a <hi>Lent</hi> Poiſon, given him by the Queen-Mother, Blood not only came out at all the Conduits of his Body, but through the very Pores; ſo that he was ſometimes found all bathed in his own Blood: And he that made the Kingdom ſwim with Blood, died thus wallowing in his own. Thus wicked Men fall into the ſame Pit they thruſt others into, and their violent dealing comes on their own Pate: As lately here in <hi>London,</hi> one <hi>Edward Coleman,</hi> a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> who was found to be a grand Conſpirator againſt the Proteſtant Religion, intending to ſubvert and overthrow Religion, and the People of God, was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (with divers others) taken in the ſaid Conſpiracy, Judged, Condemned, Drawn, Hanged, and Quartered, as his juſt Demerit for that Act and Deed, <hi>December</hi> the 3d. 1678. at <hi>Tybourn,</hi> in the view of thouſands.</p>
               <p>Yet again, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 5. we have an account of ſeven Viols, or Goblets of Gold, all filled up to the brim with the Wrath of God, which often in Scripture is compared to Wine; and becauſe of the effects of it, called <hi>the Wine of Trembling,</hi> or Aſtoniſhment. And they are called <hi>the ſeven laſt Plagues,</hi> or Stroke: Becauſe in them the Wrath of God is finiſhed. Then he ſtirs up all his Wrath againſt them, that the ſufferers <hi>do knaw their Tongues for pain.</hi> And well they may: For mark that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 10, 11. 'tis like <hi>Zechariah</hi>'s <hi>Roll,</hi> filled with Curſes within and without. Thoſe that receive the Mark of the Beaſt in their Forehead publickly, or in their Hand privately, ſhall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the Cup of his Indignation, and they ſhall be tormented with Fire and Brimſtone in the preſence of the holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb: And the ſmoke of her Torment aſcendeth up for ever and ever. They have no reſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58561:27"/>
Day nor Night, who worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever receiveth the mark of his Name. And when the Voice ſhall be, <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen,</hi> Rev. 17. 2. which ſhall be when ſhe is very ſecure, and ſaith in her Heart, <hi>I ſit as a Queen, and am no Widow, and ſhall ſee no Sorrow:</hi> Then ſhall Worldly ſpirited Men lament and tremble, and cry, <hi>Alas, alas,</hi> while the bleſſed Inhabitants that are in Heaven, the holy Apoſtles, Prophets, and Angels, are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to rejoyce over her deſtruction; for which alſo the Blood of the Martyred Souls under the Altar doth cry, and all their Brethren, who are yet witneſſing in the Wilderneſs, do earneſtly pray, as being then to receive a full Reward for their Labours, and to Reign with Chriſt, for whom they ſuffered. <hi>Even ſo, come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi>

               <p>THat the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth look upon ſhedding of the Blood of Proteſtants (which they call Hereticks) as Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, let us take a view of their Practices after the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre in <hi>France.</hi> The News being brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> on the 6th of <hi>November,</hi> 1572. A Conſiſtory was called of Cardinals, and the Legats Letter, that contained a Relation of the Maſſacre, was preſently read. See <hi>Thuanus.</hi> Upon this they went ſtraight in a Proceſſion to St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Church, where they offered thanks to God for this great Bleſſing to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Catholick Church. And on <hi>Monday</hi> following, there was another Proceſſion made by the Pope and Cardinals, to the <hi>Minerva,</hi> where they had high Maſs, and then the Pope granted a Jubilee to all <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, that they ſhould thank God for the Slaughter of the Enemies of the Church lately executed in <hi>France.</hi> Two days after that, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had another great Proceſſion of all the Clergy, the Ambaſſadors, Cardinals, and the Pope himſelf, who came to St. <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Chappel, where the Cardinal Celebrated Maſs himſelf, and in the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Name, he thanked the Pope and Cardinals for their good Counſel, the Help they had given him, and the Aſſiſtance he had received by their Prayers, of which he had found moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Effects. He alſo delivered the King's Letters to the Pope, in which he wrote, that more Hereticks had been deſtroyed in that one Day, than all the twelve Years of the War.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:58561:27"/>
Nor did the Pope think there was yet Blood enough ſhed, he ſends Cardinal <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin,</hi> his Legat, in all haſte to <hi>France,</hi> to thank the King for ſo great Service he had done the Church, and deſired him to go on and extirpate Hereſie, Root and Branch, that it might never grow again. And as the Legat paſſed on his Journey, he gave a plenary Abſolution to all that had been actors in the Maſſacre.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the beſt Picture-Drawers and Workers of Tapiſtry, were alſo put to work, to ſet off this Action with all poſſible glory: And a ſute of theſe Hangings are to this day in the Pope's Chappel. So well do they like that Act, that they ſtill preſerve the Memory of it. I muſt confeſs, ſuch a Repreſentation does well agree with their Doctrine.</p>
