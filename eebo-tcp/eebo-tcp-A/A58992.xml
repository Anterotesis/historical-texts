            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> in his large Hiſtory in <hi>Folio,</hi> did go a great way in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but here is included the Lives of many more eminent Heroes and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Patrons, (which I hope their memory may ſurvive in ſucceeding Ages) this being done with that bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, which may be more beneficial to the Reader.</p>

            <p>I need not inlarge, or give any further Incomium upon this ſubject, but referr you to the Table firſt, and then to the Book it ſelf, which I hope will find that kind acceptance, that may ingage me in ſome further proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that may pleaſe my Countrymen, which I ſhall alwayes endeavour to

For, there were founded, anciently, in the Church of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> two Cardinals choſen by Dean and Chapter, out of the twelve petty Cannons, whoſe Office was to look to thoſe of the Quire, to give the Euchariſt, to the Miniſter of that Church and his Servants, to hear Confeſſions, appoint Penance, and to commit the Dead to convenient Sepulture, and two of them lie buried in the Church of St. <hi>Faiths.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:34146:9"/>This Cuſtom of Cardinal-making was in many other Countries, but afterwards, was appropriated to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they are divided into Biſhops, who are Aſſeſſors with the Popes Prieſts, who are Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and Deacons, <hi>Qui ſerviunt Servo Servorum Dei,</hi> who are Attendants on his Holineſs. The Biſhops are ſeven, <hi>viz.</hi> Biſhop of 1 <hi>Hoſtia,</hi> 2 <hi>Sabine,</hi> 3 <hi>Porto,</hi> 4 <hi>Alba,</hi> 5 <hi>Preneſte,</hi> in which three laſt places, theſe <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> reſpectively have been Biſhops, <hi>viz. R. Kilwardby, Nic. Breakſpeare, Bernar. Anglicus,</hi> and <hi>Sim. Langham.</hi> 6 <hi>Rufine,</hi> 7 <hi>Tuſculane.</hi> Cardinal Prieſts are accounted <hi>twenty eight,</hi> amongſt whom <hi>Steph. Langhton</hi> was Card. of St. <hi>Chryſogon,</hi> An. 1212. <hi>Tho. Woolſey</hi> of St. <hi>Cecily,</hi> 1515. <hi>John Morton,</hi> of St. <hi>Anaſtaſia,</hi> 1493. <hi>Will.

Th. Bourchier,</hi> of St. <hi>Cyriacus</hi> in the <hi>Baths. Rob. Pullen,</hi> of St. <hi>Euſebius,</hi> 1144. <hi>Boſo,</hi> of St. <hi>Puntiana,</hi> 1160. <hi>John Fiſher,</hi> of St. <hi>Vitalis,</hi> 1535. Of Cardinal Deacons, there are ſixteen, whereof <hi>Boſo</hi> was the only <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and Card. of St. <hi>Coſmus</hi> and <hi>Damian.</hi> Their habit is Scarlet.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Paul</hi> II. made it Penal, for any beneath their Order, in <hi>Rome,</hi> to wear a <hi>Red hat.</hi> The Cardinal-Biſhops took place of the Emperour before his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, and of other Kings. The Popes were to be choſen by, and out of that Order. The Cardinal-Deacons were oftentimes elected to the Popedom before the Cardinal-Prieſts. There is at this day, a Brother of the late Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> enjoys the Title and Dignity of Cardinal. 'Tis alledged by ſome that <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> being of a different Religion from his Holineſs, and in a manner, exiles abroad,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34146:10"/>
and not furniſhed with ſufficient Eſtates, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeldom honoured with that Dignity, which has been fatal to ſeveral <hi>Engliſhmen</hi>; for Card. <hi>Mackels<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> was buried four Months before his Cap was brought him; Card. <hi>Sertor</hi> died in <hi>Italy</hi> in the juncture of time, <hi>inter pileum Datum &amp; Suſceptum.</hi> Card. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> when his Cap was come to <hi>Calis,</hi> had his head ſtrucK off at <hi>Tower-Hill.</hi> Card. <hi>Somercot</hi> was Poyſoned, in the Conclave, to prevent his Election to the Popedom. Card. <hi>Evosham</hi> was ſent the ſame way, on the ſame occaſion. Card. <hi>Bambridge</hi> was Poiſoned at <hi>Rome,</hi> by one of his Servants, being an <hi>Italian.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XV. Of Sheriffs.</head>
               <p>SHeriff is a <hi>Reeve</hi> or Overſeer of a <hi>Shire,</hi> in Latin <hi>Vicecomes,</hi> or Deputy of an <hi>Earl</hi> or Count, who anciently preſiding over a <hi>County,</hi> gave names both to the <hi>Place,</hi> and deputed Juriſdiction. In the year 888. K. <hi>Alfred</hi> firſt divided <hi>England</hi> into Shires. <hi>The Clerk of the Peace</hi> for each County in <hi>Mich.</hi> Term, preſents to the Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice, ſix</hi> or more names of able Perſons for the Office of <hi>Sheriff,</hi> of whom three are preſented to the <hi>King,</hi> who pricks one to ſtand <hi>Sheriff,</hi> for the County. His Power is to ſuppreſs <hi>Riots,</hi> ſecure Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, diſtrain for Debts, execute Writs, return <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> for Parliament, empannel <hi>Juries,</hi> attend the Judge, ſee the Execution of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, &amp;c. By 4. H. 4, 5. Sheriffs are to abide within their Counties. 'Tis obſerved by ſome, that anciently the Office of Sheriff was <hi>Honos ſine onere,</hi> in middle times <hi>Honos cum onere,</hi> and in our days <hi>Onus ſine Honore,</hi> a burden without honour.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34146:15"/>
fancy are but perſonal, but Arms <hi>aſſigned</hi> by Princes are Hereditary. The plainer the Coat is, the more Ancient and Honourable; two Colours are neceſſary and moſt highly honourable, tho both may be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoned with one word, as <hi>Varrey,</hi> (formerly born by the <hi>Beauchamps</hi> of <hi>Hatch</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and ſtill quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the Duke of <hi>Somerſet) three</hi> are very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, <hi>four</hi> Commendable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>IT was faſhionable for the <hi>Clergy,</hi> (eſpecially Regular) to have their <hi>Surnames,</hi> from the places of their Nativity; As <hi>Richard</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> quitted <hi>Angervill,</hi> tho his Father Sir <hi>Richard Angervill</hi> was a Knight of Worth and Worſhip, to be called
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34146:17"/>
of <hi>Bury,</hi> where he was born, and <hi>William</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Winchester</hi> waved <hi>Pattin,</hi> to wear <hi>Waynfleet,</hi> tho he was eldeſt Son to <hi>Richard Pattin,</hi> an Eſquire of great Ancientry.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the place of one's birth is rendred uncertain, when ſeveral places have the ſame name. One inſtance of many, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Wickham</hi> was the famous Founder of <hi>New Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi>: But how can his Cradle be certainly fixed in any place, when it is equally rock't betwixt <hi>twenty</hi> Villages of the ſame Denomination? In inquiries of this Nature and Difficulty, 'tis beſt to have recourſe to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in the Hiſtory of ſuch a controverted Perſon. Where two or more places claim the birth of the ſame Perſon, my uſual expedient is to inſert the Character at large, of the controverted Perſon in that County, which produceth the beſt Evidence for him, yet ſo, that I alſo enter his name with a reference in the other reſpective places, which with probability pretend unto him. But many multiply differences in the places of Mens birth by miſtake. The Papiſts can tell you a Tale how the Men of <hi>two</hi> Towns in <hi>Germany</hi> fell out and fought together, whilſt one of them was for <hi>Martin,</hi> the other for <hi>Luther,</hi> being but the ſeveral Names of the ſame Perſon. If one Author affirms Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> born at <hi>Buden,</hi> another at <hi>Berinerber,</hi> let none make ſtrife betwixt theſe two Writers, the former naming the Houſe and Village, the later the Pariſh wherein he was born.</p>
               <p>As for the Sons of Miniſters, tho ſome unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably think them <hi>generally unfortunate,</hi> by the ſequel of this Treatiſe it will plainly appear that they have by <hi>Gods</hi> Bleſſing, proved as eminent as any who have raiſed themſelves by their own endeavours. For Stateſmen, <hi>George Carew,</hi> Privy Councellor of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34146:18"/>
                  <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and as able a Man, as the Age he lived in, produced, was <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Totnes,</hi> the ſame place whereof his Father was Arch-Deacon. Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys,</hi> Son to Arch-Bſhiop <hi>Sandys,</hi> was a Man of ſuch Merit, that <hi>England</hi> could not afford an Office which he could not manage. For Lawyers, Sir <hi>Th. Richardſon,</hi> lately, and the never ſufficiently to be commended Sir <hi>Orlando Bridgeman,</hi> now Lord Chief Juſtice, with many others. For Seamen, Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> that great <hi>Scourge</hi> and <hi>Terrour</hi> to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pride. But the Sons of Miniſters have never been more Succeſsfull, then when bred in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of their Fathers. Thus of the Prelatical Clergy we have <hi>Francis Godwin</hi> a Biſhop, the Son of a Biſhop, and Dr. <hi>John King,</hi> Son to the Reverend Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi> And of others, we have three Generations of the <hi>Wards,</hi> in <hi>Suffolk.</hi> As many of the <hi>Shutes,</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> no leſs painfull then Pious and able in their Profeſſions. Let me add, that there were at one time three Fellows of Kings Colledge, Sons of eminent Divines, and afterwards Doctors of Divinity, <hi>viz. Sam. Collins, Th. Goad,</hi> and <hi>Will. Sclater.</hi> And I believe there were not ſeverally in their Generations, Men more Signal, in their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Eminencies.</p>

Landfloods, ſoon come, and ſoon gone, have been dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up before this Generation. Yet many of theſe have continued in a certain Channel, and carried a conſtant Stream.</p>
               <p>The Church before the <hi>Reformation,</hi> advanced many Families. For tho Biſhops might not marry, they preferred their <hi>Brothers Sons</hi> to great Eſtates, as the <hi>Kemps</hi> in <hi>Kent, Peckhams</hi> in <hi>Suſſex, Wickhams</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire, Meltons</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since the Reformation, ſome have raiſed their Families to a Knightly and Worſhipful Eſtate, as <hi>Hutton, Bilſon, Dove, Neil,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>The <hi>Civil Law</hi> hath preferred few. The moſt Eminent in that Faculty before the Reformation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſons in Orders abſtained from Marriage; ſince the Reformation, there are Worſhipful Families raiſed thereby.

            <p>BARKSHIRE hath <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> on the weſt, <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> on the South, <hi>Surrey</hi> on the Eaſt, <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Buckinghamſhire</hi> on the North. 'Tis in Form of a Lute, the Belly towards the <hi>Weſt,</hi> the Neck extending to the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> In length about forty Miles, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhul</hi> to <hi>Windfor,</hi> and about twenty Miles in the broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part. Very plentiful of <hi>Graſs, Grain, Fiſh, Fowl, Wool and Wood, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Natural Commodities are firſt, <hi>Oakes</hi>; of Trees, <hi>Barkſhire</hi> hath abundance in all kinds. The Oaks in <hi>Windſor-Forreſt,</hi> (as all other Engliſh Oak) are the beſt, 1. for firmneſs, for, when entred with Bullet, it remaineth firm round about it, whilſt all the Oak does <hi>cowardly</hi> ſplit about the paſſage. 2. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of Portage, our four principal Forreſts ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either on the Sea or Navigable Rivers, <hi>viz.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Bark.</hi> Whence the Name of this County, It is eſſential for making of good Leather; for, he that ſtays for Leather-ſhooes made without Bark, may <hi>long time go Bare-foot.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>As for Manufactures, the chief is <hi>Clothing</hi>: For the Antiquity of it. 1. <hi>Cloth,</hi> is of the ſame date with the Civility of our Land; indeed the <hi>Britains</hi> went naked, which Cuſtom a Beggar continuing, gave a reaſon thereof, by ſaying, <hi>All my Body is Face.</hi> 2. <hi>Fine</hi> (narrow) <hi>Cloth,</hi> begun about, 1. E. III. 3. <hi>Broad-cloth</hi> (wherein the Wealth of <hi>England</hi> is folded up) began in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. <hi>Jack</hi> of <hi>Newbury,</hi> ('tis ſaid) was the firſt that introduced it. <hi>Minerva</hi> was held the Foundreſs of <hi>Weaving,</hi> ſo great is the ingenuity thereof.</p>
            <p>For Buildings, <hi>Windſor-Caſtle,</hi> a Royal Seat ever ſince the Conqueſt, brought to modern Beauty, chiefly at the coſt of E. 3. It is a <hi>Caſtle</hi> for Strength, and a Palace for State, and hath a Colledge, Chappel, and Alms-Houſe. In this Palace is moſt remarkable, the <hi>Hall</hi> for Greatneſs, <hi>Wincheſter-Tower</hi> for height, and the <hi>Terrace</hi> on the North-ſide for Pleaſure. Nor boaſteth it ſo much that it conſiſteth of <hi>two</hi> Great Courts, as that it contained <hi>two</hi> Great Kings, <hi>John</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> Priſoners therein together, as alſo that it was the Seat of the <hi>Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Order</hi> of the <hi>Garter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many pleaſant Seats are in this County, on the <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> and <hi>Thames,</hi> which ſeem dutifully to attend at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance on <hi>Windſor-Caſtle,</hi> as <hi>Alder-maſton, Ingle-field,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For Proverbs.

Opinion; For ſince <hi>Samuel</hi> was reduced (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) to extream weakneſs, his Body being parched, his Humours fixed, and his Spirits exhauſted, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that his languiſhing <hi>Phantaſie</hi> ſhould either produce or receive ſo bright an <hi>Idaea,</hi> without the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Aſſiſtance of Divine Power.

All the Rivers in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have their Fountains and Falls therein. It is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Evidence of the plenty of this County, that the <hi>Toll</hi> of the <hi>Wheat, Corn</hi> and <hi>Malt,</hi> growing or made about, and ſold in the City of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> doth amount yearly at a <hi>half-penny</hi> a <hi>Quarter,</hi> to 60 pounds and upwards.

It is to be hoped that for the preſervation of Woods, a way may be found out to Chark Sea-coal in ſuch manner as to render it uſeful for the making of <hi>Iron.</hi> Then <hi>Talk,</hi> produced in great abundance in this County, is an excellent <hi>white Waſh,</hi> and a great aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.

The foreſaid <hi>Ditch</hi> is called <hi>Claudh-Offa,</hi> becauſe made by King <hi>Offa,</hi> who Enacted, that what <hi>Welſh-man</hi> ſoever was found on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> ſide of this <hi>Ditch,</hi> ſhould forfeit his Right Hand, a Law long ſince Cancelled.

            <p>This Diviſion proved the Confuſion of <hi>Wales,</hi> whoſe Princes were always at War, not only againſt the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> but mutually with themſelves, to enlarge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Dominions. Of theſe <hi>Three, North-Wales</hi> was the Chief, being left to <hi>Mervin</hi> eldeſt Son to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> aforeſaid; the <hi>Princes</hi> whereof (by way of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency,</hi> were ſtiled the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Kings of <hi>Aberfrow</hi>) paid to the King of <hi>London,</hi> yearly 63 pounds, by way of Tribute, the ſame ſum being like wiſe paid to the ſaid King, by the Princes of <hi>Powis</hi> and <hi>South-Wales.</hi> However <hi>South-Wales</hi> (called by the Natives <hi>Deheubarth, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Right-ſide,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nearer the Sun) was of the <hi>three,</hi> the largeſt, richeſt, and moſt fruitful; But this Country being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly infeſted with the Invaſions of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Flemings,</hi> had <hi>North-Wales</hi> preferred before it, as more entire, and better ſecured from ſuch Annoyances. Hence it is that the <hi>Welſh-Tongue</hi> retaineth the purity thereof only in <hi>North-Wales.</hi> The Soil moſtly riſing up into Hills and Mountains, is of a lean and hungry Nature; yet is the ill quality recompenced by the good quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof; Whence it was that a Worſhipful Knight in <hi>Wales,</hi> who had a fair Eſtate therein, ſaid to an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Gentleman, (who bragged that he had in <hi>England</hi> ſo much Ground, worth 40 Shillings an <hi>Acre,) You have</hi> 10 <hi>yards of Velvet, and I have</hi> 200 <hi>of Frize, I will not exchange with you.</hi> However there are in <hi>Wales</hi> moſt pleaſant Meadows along the ſides of Rivers; and as the ſweeteſt Fleſh is ſaid to be neareſt the Bones, ſo moſt delicious Vallies are interpoſed betwixt theſe Mountains. The Inhabitants are Healthful, Strong,
<pb n="922" facs="tcp:34146:325"/>
Swift and Witty, which is imputed to the clear and wholſome Air of the Mountains, the cleanly and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Diet of the people, and the hardneſs whereunto they are inured from their infancy.</p>
            <p>Of Natural Commodities, there is <hi>Silver,</hi> whereof <hi>Cardigan-ſhire</hi> yields <hi>Royal Mines</hi>; in theſe Mountains, <hi>viz. Comſomelock, Tallabant, Gadarren, Bromfloid, Geginnon,</hi> and <hi>Cummerrum.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> began to Mine here, (as appears by their Coynes found therein) working in Trenches, (about 24 Fathom deep) and found plenty of Lead. The <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> wrought 100 Fathom deep, and found great plenty of the ſame, till their Works were drown'd with water. Cuſtomer <hi>Smith,</hi> about the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered Silver in <hi>Comſomelock</hi>: After his death the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was proſecuted, and more perfected by Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton</hi> Knight, Coyning the Silver to his great Charge, (as his Predeceſſor had done) at the Tower; After whoſe death, Sir <hi>Francis Godolphin</hi> of <hi>Cornwal</hi> Knight, and <hi>Thomas Buſhel</hi> Eſquire, undertook the Work. King <hi>Charles</hi> I. granted to them power of Coinage at <hi>Aberrusky,</hi> in that County. <hi>Thomas Buſhel</hi> (Sir <hi>Francis</hi> dying, and <hi>Comſomelock</hi> being deſerted) adventured on the other <hi>five</hi> Mountains, and at laſt theſe Mines yielded 100 pounds a Week, (beſides Lead amounting to half as much) Coyned at <hi>Aberrusky</hi> aforeſaid. The Pence, Groats, Shillings, Half-Crowns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of this Silver, had the <hi>Oſtrich Feathers</hi> (the Arms of <hi>Wales</hi>) ſtamped on them. The Civil Wars diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed all the Work. I will add no more, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make mention of that ingenious invention, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Miners are ſupplyed with freſh Air: This is done by <hi>two</hi> Mens blowing wind with a pair of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, on the outſide of <hi>Adit,</hi> into a Pipe of Lead, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lengthned as the Mine is made longer, whereby the Candle in the Mine is daily kept burning, and the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

recruited conſtantly with a ſufficiency of breath. There is <hi>Lead</hi> found in many places of <hi>Wales,</hi> but in <hi>Carnarvan-ſhire</hi> the beſt. Plenty of <hi>Goats</hi> are bred here, eſpecially in <hi>Montgomery-ſhire.</hi> As for Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> generally bearing themſelves high, on the account of their gentile extraction, are better pleaſed in the employment of their <hi>Valour</hi> then <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> and therefore there are only thoſe few that follow, <hi>Frieze,</hi> of which <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> having a Suit, and being checkt by a bold Courtier for wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame many Weeks together, <hi>Would</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that the Cloth of my Country would laſt alwayes.</hi> Then Cheeſe, very tender and palatable, the Pedigree where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was by one, merrily derived, thus,

            <p>As for the Buildings, generally they are like thoſe of the old <hi>Britains,</hi> neither big nor beautiful; the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian humour</hi> of building having not affected (not to ſay <hi>infected</hi>) the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation. <hi>Hoelldha</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> about the year 800. built a Houſe for his own Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>White-hurdles</hi> or <hi>Watling,</hi> therefore called
