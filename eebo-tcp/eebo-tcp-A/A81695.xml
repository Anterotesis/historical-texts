            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE DOVVNFALL OF <hi>Mercurius Britannicus. Mercurius Pragmaticus. Mercurius Politicus.</hi> That three Headed CERBERUS.</head>
            <l>THat proverb which of late by him was ſpoken</l>
            <l>In him's now croſſed, the <hi>threefold cord is broken</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Brit. Prag.</hi> and <hi>Pol.</hi> in Print muſt lye no more.</l>
            <l>By'th Rumps authority, that's out of door.</l>
            <l>He and the Rumpe were birds all of a Feather,</l>
            <l>And tis moſt fit that they ſhould fly together.</l>
            <l>But by the way there is a triple tree</l>
            <l>May well become this triple <hi>Mercury.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And there perhaps hee'l finde one cord may hold</l>
            <l>Far better, then his own that was threefold.</l>
            <l>This was the Scribe that ſold himſelf for gain,</l>
            <l>To work iniquity 'gainſt his Soveraign.</l>
            <l>'Twas he blaſphem'd his Prince, and with his Pen</l>
            <l>Murder'd the beſt of Kings, and beſt of men.</l>
            <l>His curſed <hi>Siquis</hi> ne're well be forgotten</l>
            <l>Againſt his Prince, when he is dead and rotten.</l>
            <l>And 'tis the Nations crime (which God forgive)</l>
            <l>That they ſhould ſuffer ſuch a Rogue to live.</l>
            <l>He that <hi>Diana's</hi> Temple burnt, could be</l>
            <l>Not half ſo famous for his infamy.</l>
            <l>But now the time is coming, which no doubt</l>
            <l>Will do him Iuſtice, vengeance will finde him out.</l>
            <l>Though <hi>Foulk</hi> may guiltleſs prove of Royal blood,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Scobels</hi> Certificate can do thee no good.</l>
            <l>Thy Books will riſe up to condemn thee here,</l>
            <l>And to confound thee i'th' other world, I fear.</l>
            <l>When there was hopes that <hi>Caeſar</hi> would prevail;</l>
            <l>He then was for the head againſt the tail;</l>
            <l>And who but he for Kings? and Monarchy</l>
            <l>Was better far then Ariſtocracy.</l>
            <l>But when the Rumpe had got the upper hand,</l>
            <l>He was all theirs, and at their ſole command;</l>
            <l>And then there could be found no ſaving health</l>
            <l>But in a Free State and a Commonwealth.</l>
            <l>Thus with the times he turn'd, next turn I hope</l>
            <l>Will up the Ladder be, and down the Rope.</l>
            <l>And when thou'rt gone from hence, 'tis like thou'lt be</l>
            <l>In <hi>Pluto</hi>'s Parliament a <hi>Mercury,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>From whence perhaps thy friends may look to hear</l>
            <l>From thee, what news, and the nocturnals there.</l>
            <l>But firſt let <hi>Oliver</hi> thy Patron know</l>
            <l>Our revolutions here, and how things go.</l>
            <l>How <hi>Dick</hi> and <hi>Harry</hi> both have loſt their ſtation,</l>
