            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE Right Honourable, <hi>FRANCIS</hi> Lord <hi>COTTINGTON,</hi> Baron of <hi>Hanworth,</hi> Chancellour of the Exchequer, and one of his Majeſties moſt Honourable Privy Council.</head>
            <p>THE profitable uſe of Bathes, both for neceſſity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, is ſuch, and ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from all antiquity, as I need not labour to illuſtrate it more; only it hath been the ill hap of <hi>Our</hi> Countrey Bathes to lie more obſcure then any other throughout Chriſtendome, although they deſerve as well as the beſt, becauſe very few have written any thing of them, and they either have not mentioned, or but ſlightly paſſed over the main points concerning their cauſes and originals; contenting themſelves with an emperical uſe of them. This hath made me, through the inſtigation alſo of ſome of my worthy friends, to attempt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of this kind: which if it give not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction according to my deſire, yet may be a provocation to ſome others, to perfect that which I have begun. And ſeeing I do it for the uſe of my Country, I have neglected
<pb facs="tcp:63227:3"/>
curious ornaments to garniſh it withall, but have clad it in a plain Sute of our Country Cloath; without welt or gard: not deſiring it ſhould ſhew it ſelf in forain parts: <hi>Mea cymba legat littus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in this mine undertaking, I find my ſelf expoſed to many cenſures, both concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Paradoxical Opinions in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, which notwithſtanding I deliver not <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> but confirmed with good grounds of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and authorities: as alſo concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of our Bathes, which do daily ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer many indignities more wayes then I have mentioned, under the tyranny of ignorance, impoſture, private reſpects, wants, factions, diſorder, &amp;c. ſo as they are not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play their virtues, and do that good for which God hath ſent them to us; and all for want of ſuch good government as other Bathes do enjoy. I blame not our City herein, unto whoſe care the ordering of theſe Bathes is committed, the diſorders and effects being ſuch as are out of their verge, and neither in their power, nor in their knowledge to redreſſ. For they have ſufficiently teſtified their deſire of reforming all ſuch abuſes, when they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily did joyn in Petitioning the late King <hi>James</hi> of bleſſed memory, to that end: by whoſe death this Petition alſo died. And they knew well that it must be a ſuperior power
<pb facs="tcp:63227:3"/>
that muſt effect it. In theſe reſpects I have need of ſome noble and eminent Patron to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect both me and my Bathes, whoſe cauſe I take upon we to plead, and to advance, according to their due deſert: but eſpecially for the Bathes ſake, which I deſire may flouriſh to the utmoſt extent of benefit to the people; and to have all impediments removed out of their way, which may hinder them in the progreſſ of their virtues. This is the cauſe Sir, why I preſume to dedicate theſe my labours to your Honour, who having obſerved in forrain parts, the uſes and governments of all ſorts, and being both by the favour of his Majeſty well able, and by your noble diſpoſition well inclined and willing to maintain good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſcipline, will, I doubt not, excuſe this boldneſs, and pardon my preſumption. Conſider Sir, that this is your native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which naturally every man doth affect to advance, and theſe Bathes are the principal Jewels of your Countrey, and able to make it more famous then any other parts of this Kingdom, and in advancing them, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance your Name to all poſterity. wherefore howſoever my ſelf deſerve but ſmall reſpect from you, yet I beſeech you reſpect the Bathes of your Countrey, and me as a wellwiſher unto them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63227:4"/>
And as the common opinion of your great worth and abilities, have moved me to this boldneſſ, ſo the particular favours of your Noble Lady, and the encouragement of your learned Phyſitian, Doctor <hi>Baskervill,</hi> mine eſpecial Friend, who hath ſpurred me on to this work, have removed out of my mind all ſuſpition of miſconſtruction. But that as mine intent hath been meerly the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging of the knowledge of thoſe points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Bathes, and more eſpecially of our Bathes in <hi>Somerſet-ſhire</hi>; ſo you will be pleaſed to accept of this publick invitation by me to do your Countrey good, and your ſelf ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which I wiſh may never be disjoyned. And to me it will be no ſmall encouragement to devote my ſelf and my best endeavours to your ſervice. So I humbly take my leave this <hi>23. Aprilis, 1632.</hi>

            <head>A Preface TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE enſuing Diſcourſe of <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bathes, and Mineral Waters,</hi> of the learned Author, Dr. <hi>Jorden,</hi> having found ſo kind an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in the World, as to have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Preſs twice in a Year; and the Copies of both Impreſſions at this time ſo few, as not to anſwer the Enquiries of perſons deſirous to peruſe them, a third Edition was neceſſary, the Care of which, together with ſome Additional Enlargements, being requeſted of me, I thought it might be a thing acceptable to many, to view the Work, and revive the memory of ſo worthy a Perſon. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in this looſe, and quaking age of ours, in which Empericks, and jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling Medicaſters do ſo much abound, that tis almoſt as hard a matter to meet with a regular and well accompliſh'd
<pb facs="tcp:63227:5"/>
Phyſitian now, as it was in former times for <hi>Diogenes</hi> to find an honeſt man.</p>
            <p>The great occaſion of this general abuſe of Phyſick I obſerve to be, mens beginning uſually at the wrong end. For the moſt ſuppoſing the Practice of Phyſick to be a mere Trade, and Medicines the Ware to furniſh themſelves withall, make what haſte they can to get, though upon Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, a Pack of Receits, which they cry up as the moſt effectual, and <hi>Triarian</hi> Remedies; and having made a ſhift to truſs up, with the former fardle of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Receits, ſome few Specificks, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſet up for eminent Phyſitians, when, to give them their due, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve nothing leſs then that Honourable Name, being indeed but Pedlers in the Faculty.</p>
            <p>For there are, beſides the uſe of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which in its proper place is not to be neglected; many very ſignificant things to be known and ſtudied by a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian; as, after the praeliminary helps of the Tongues, and Natural Philoſophy, the ſtructure and uſes of the parts of the body; the virtues of Plants; the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Medicines; the Nature, Cauſes, and Signs of Diſeaſes; not to mention the knowledge, at leaſt, if not the practice
<pb facs="tcp:63227:5"/>
of Manual Operations, with ſome Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>technical Endeavours. All theſe, vaſt dominions in themſelves, a Son of Art (to make bold with one of their expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) ſhould in ſome meaſure command. So that I have in my thoughts ſometimes reſembled a Compleat Phyſitian to the draught of a Man, ſtanding on the two Legs of Anatomy &amp; Herbary, Operating (if need be) with the hands of Chyrurgery, and Pharmacy, having a Chymical Head, and the bulk of his body made up of the Nature, Kind, and Cures of Diſeaſes, which we may not improperly, term a Body of Phyſick.</p>
            <p>But theſe Agytrae, and Quackſalvers, are as far from theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. They for the moſt part, know no other tongue then their Mothers, and are as deſtitute of Philoſophy, as a rational me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. Every Plant to them is All-heal, and every trite Medicine a <hi>Panpharmacon.</hi> The Body of Man, they think contains no other parts then what they ſee in a Harſelet, and the fire is as dreadfull to them, as to the burnt Child. Yet they will ſometimes make bold to uſe the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, and dextrouſly wound the Heart through the Arm. In brief, they meddle with what they do not underſtand, and
<pb facs="tcp:63227:6"/>
are the ſpots, and ſtains of the Faculty to which they moſt injuriouſly pretend. but to reſign thoſe Juglers to their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Self-Conceit, and thoſe that are willing to die at a cheaper rate to their cruel mercies, and confident Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, I ſhall give what account I can of the Author of this Book (a man of a temper quite different from the former) &amp; what alterations have been made in it.</p>
            <p>As to the Author (whom I had not the happineſs to know otherwiſe then by this his Picture, being at the time of his death, and ſome years after in an incapacity of knowing any thing unleſs only a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Praexiſtence; yet) I underſtand he was a Gentleman of a good Family<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and being a younger Brother, was by his Father deſigned for a Profeſſion, for which when he had accompliſh'd himſelf by a convenient Courſe of Studies in his own Country (I think at <hi>Oxford</hi>) travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led abroad to ſee the manners and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of the Univerſities beyond Sea; and having ſpent ſome time there, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at <hi>Padua</hi> (where he took his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Doctor in Phyſick) returned home, became an eminently ſolid and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Philoſopher and Phyſitian, and one of that famous and learned Society, <hi>The Kings Colledge of Phyſitians there.</hi>

In his Travels, undertaking in the company of ſome zealous Jeſuites, the defence of the Proteſtant Religion, he ſo much troubled their patience, that they reſolved to terminate that diſpute of his in a perpetual Silence, which they had effected, had not his Countryman, one of the number, but more mercifull then the reſt, (by awaking him out of his natural ſleep, preventing the ſleep of death) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him of their deſign, to be put in execution that night; whereupon he preſently withdrew, and left not only the Houſe, but the Place, and eſcaped the cruelty of theſe blood-thirſty Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gioſo's; who ſhortly after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, brake open his door, entred his Chamber, and approached his Bed, with a full resolution to have acted their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Tragedy.</p>
            <p>He had a great natural inclination to Mineral Works, and was at very great Charges about the ordering of Allum, which ſucceeding not according to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, he was thereby much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced in his Eſtate; of which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains in the 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> page of the following Diſcourſe. He was much reſpected by King <hi>James,</hi> who committed the Queen to his Care, when ſhe uſed to Bathe, and
<pb facs="tcp:63227:7"/>
gave him a Grant of the Profit of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Works, but upon the importunity of a Courtier, as I am informed, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards revoked it; whereupon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor made his application to the King, but could not prevail, though the King ſéem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be more then ordinarily ſenſible of his Condition.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he practiſed in <hi>London</hi> there was one <hi>Anne Gunter,</hi> troubled with ſuch ſtrange and unuſual Symptomes, that ſhe was generally thought and reported by all that ſaw her to be bewitch'd. King <hi>James</hi> hearing of it ſent for her to <hi>London,</hi> and pretending great pitty to her, told her, he would take care for her relief, in which thing he employed Doctor <hi>Jorden,</hi> who, upon examination, reported to the King, that he thought it was a Cheat; and tincturing all ſhe took with harmleſs things, made her believe that ſhe had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Phyſick, by the uſe of which, ſhe ſaid, ſhe had found great benefit. The Doctor acquainting his Majeſty that he had given her nothing of a medicinal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only what did ſo appear to the Maid, and alſo, that though when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the Lords Prayer, and Creed in Engliſh, ſhe was much out of order, yet at the rehearſal of the ſame in Latine ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:63227:7"/>
was not concern'd, the King was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in what he had ſuſpected before, and the Doctor had ſuggeſted. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King dealing very plainly with her, and commanding her to diſcover the Truth unto him, the maid, though at firſt very unwilling to diſcloſe the Juggle, yet, upon the Kings importunity, and promiſe to her of making up what damage ſhould accrue from the diſcovery, confeſſed all, and his Majeſty received from her own mouth this Account. That ſometime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there happened a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Female Neighbour of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and himſelf, and having in his own apprehenſion, no better way to be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of her then this, impiouſly cauſed his Daughter, on the receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, to engage to imitate one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd, and aſcribe it to that woman, which ſhe did, and acted this part in ſo exact and wonderfull a manner, that ſhe deceived all the Countrey where ſhe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, who thought it to be a truth. After Which Confeſſion ſhe was very quiet, &amp; the King giving her a Portion, ſhe was afterwards married, being by this ſubtle artifice perfectly cured of her mimical Witchery.</p>
            <p>His Wife was a Gentlewoman of a
<pb facs="tcp:63227:8"/>
Name differing but in one letter from his own, Daughter to one Mr. <hi>Jordan,</hi> a <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> Gentleman; which came to paſs after this manner. The Doctor being on a Journey, benighted on <hi>Salisbury Plain,</hi> and knowing not which way to ride, happened to meet a Shepherd, of whom he made enquiry what places were near, where he might have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment for that night; the Shepherd telling him there was no place near e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for him conveniently to reach in any ſeaſonable time, the Doctor asked, what Gentleman lived therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts; the Shepherd replyed, there was one Mr. <hi>Jordan,</hi> not far off, a man of good quality, and a great eſtate. Preſently the Doctor (looking on this as a good Omen) reſolved on his houſe, where he was ſo kindly entertained, and ſo well accepted, that Mr. <hi>Jordan</hi> underſtanding him to be a Batchelour, beſtowed hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After he had practiſed ſome time in <hi>London,</hi> he came hither, and ſetled a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Bathe,</hi> where living many years, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was ſo ſweet, his Carriage ſo obliging, &amp; his Life ſo anſwerable to the port &amp; dignity of the Faculty he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb facs="tcp:63227:8"/>
that he had the Applauſe of the Learned, the Reſpect of the Rich, the Prayers of the Poor, and the Love of all.</p>
            <p>I hear but of four Children he had that attained to any maturity of age (beſides one who periſhed by that, which by the bleſſing of God, and the aſſiſting help of proper Remedies, hath prolonged the life of many, the <hi>Bath.</hi>) Two Sons, and as many Daughters. <hi>Edward</hi> the elder, being an Officer in the unhappy deſign of the lſle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> was there unfortunately ſlain, making his Colours, he managed, his winding ſheet. The younger, <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi> or rather <hi>Benoni,</hi> the Son of his affliction, a man more profuſe and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, deſiring to try his Fortunes in the world, died in obſcurity. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his eldeſt Daughter was married to Mr. <hi>Thomas Burford,</hi> an Apothecary in <hi>Bath,</hi> and Mayor of the City; and <hi>Mary</hi> his youngeſt Daughter died in her Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, before her Father.</p>
            <p>The Doctor alſo living a ſtudious and ſedentary life, which might encourage his two grand diſtempers he laboured under, the Stone and the Gout, in the ſame year in which this Treatiſe was printed, to which he imparted his laſt breath, departed this life, in the great
<pb facs="tcp:63227:9"/>
Climacterical year of his Age 63. and of our Saviours Nativity, 1632. leaving behind him the name of a judicious, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and ſober Phyſitian, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent example of a pious Chriſtian; on whom I ſhould have thought it no trouble to have ſpent more Ink, could my diligence which was not wanting in this thing, have procured me ſufficient infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>But <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the Doctor is dead, and this Child of his ſurvives the reſt, which happening to fall into my hands for a review, I could not but uſe it with all the tenderneſs and reſpect, confeſſedly due to the juſtly celebrated Off-ſpring of ſo deſerving a Parent, whom it ſo very much reſembles. And, I hope, as I have here done the Doctor right, ſo I have not elſewhere done his Diſcourſe any wrong, which I had ſome intentions at firſt to enlarge much more, but on ſecond thoughts I judged it more convenient, only to draw up a Table of the Minerals he mentions, with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome few marginal Annotations, and to ſubjoyn the greateſt part of what I had to adde of mine own, by way of Appendix (though ſome things there are of a different nature from his deſign)</p>
            <p>

                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>Explication of the word <hi>Bathe.</hi> The ſcope and argument of this Book. The ancient uſe and eſteem of Bathes among the Romans. The modern uſe of them among the Turks. Of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Bathes, and Mineral Waters. Hom eſteemed by the Greeks, Latines, Arabians, and other Nations.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE word <hi>Bathe</hi> or <hi>Balneum</hi> is of lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger extent then I purpoſe to diſcourſe of: for it being the name of a form of Remedy applyed to the Body, it may be framed either out of liquid things, or ſolid ſubſtances, or vapours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:63227:14"/>
Liquid Subſtances are Water, Milk, Muſt, Wine, Oyle: Solid Subſtances are Sand, Salt, preſſed Grapes, Corn, &amp;c. Vapours are Stuphs and Hot Houſes.</p>
                  <p>My intent is only to treat of Waters, and principally of thoſe which be called Mineral, whether they be uſed in Bath or in Potion, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe kind of watry and vaporous Bathes have been in uſe from all antiquity, and held in great eſteem, both for pleaſure, and for preſervation of health. For there is no form of Remedy more comfortable to mans body, or which eaſeth pain and wearineſs more ſpeedily, and more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually. And whereas <hi>Hypocrates</hi> commends thoſe Remedies which do cure <hi>cito, tuto, &amp; ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunde,</hi> ſpeedily, ſafely, and with comfort; theſe Bathes perform all theſe intentions: and beſides, may be uſed to all Sexes and Ages, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratures, without hurt or inconvenience, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the antient Romans had them in very frequent uſe: their Diet being liberal, and upon variety of Meats, eſpecially upon Lettuce, Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worts, Aſparagus, raw fruits, and ſuch like, which bred crude humours in their bodies, and had need of ſome ſuch help to digeſt them: as <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumella</hi> faith, <hi>Quotidianam cruditatem laconicis excoquimus</hi>: We concoct our crudities by the uſeof Bathes. We read in <hi>Plinie,</hi> that <hi>Agrippa</hi> built in <hi>Rome</hi> 170 publick Bathes for common uſe, and <hi>Pancirollus</hi> tells us of 856 in <hi>Rome</hi> at one time, <note place="margin">De deper litis pag. 164</note> and all of them moſt ſumptuous and magnificent buildings, eſpecially the <hi>Anthonin</hi> and <hi>Diocleſian</hi> Bathes: the Walls whereof were of admirable height, with an infinite number of Marble Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63227:14"/>
erected for oſtentation, and not to ſupport any thing, 1000 Seats to ſit in; Their <hi>Calda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Tepidaria, Frigidaria,</hi> moſt ſumptuous and ſtately: the whole fabrick ſo large and ſpacious, as they reſembled rather Cities than Houſes: And ſo it might well be, when as there were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for the building of the <hi>Diocleſian</hi> Bathes, as <hi>Baccius</hi> faith. 40000 men, but <hi>Salmuth</hi> faith, 140000 for ſome years together. <note place="margin">De deper litis pag. 164.</note> They were placed where now the Church of Saint <hi>Angelo</hi> ſtands. <note place="margin">Bellonius obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat.lib2.3.6.34 Proſper Alpinas de medicina AEgyptiorum.</note> The Turks at this day retain that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient cuſtome of the Romans, and are in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more profuſe, then in their Temples and Bathes, which are like unto great Pallaces, and in every City very frequent. And yet both the Romans and the Turks uſed thoſe Bathes chiefly for pleaſure and delicacy, and cleanlineſs: the Romans going bare-legged, and their wayes duſty, had need of often waſhing; and the Turks lying in their Cloaths, ſubject to Lice and Worms, if it were not for their often bathing.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the Diet of the Turks, though it be more ſparing then that of the Romans, yet it is little better: namely, upon Herbs, Roots, raw fruit, &amp;c. and their Drink, for the moſt part Water, being prohibited the uſe of Wine by their Religion, muſt needs breed many crudities in their bodies, yet by their often bathings, they do not only overcome them, but get a good ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of body, their Women being accounted as delicate creatures as any in the world, who duly twice a week reſort to the Bathes.</p>
                  <p>Now if thoſe Nations would beſtow ſo much upon their Bathes of delicacy and pleaſure, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63227:15"/>
were only of pure Water; we have much more reaſon to adorn our Mineral Bathes; which (beſides the former uſes) are alſo medicinal and very ſoveraign for many Diſeaſes, conſiſting of wholſome Minerals, and approved for many hundred years, of many who could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be recovered. At the leaſt wiſe if we do not beautifie and adorn them, yet we ſhould ſo accommodate them, as they might ſerve for the utmoſt extent of benefit to ſuch as need them.</p>
                  <p>For there is nothing in our Profeſſion of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick more uſeful, nor in the works of Nature more admirable, (man only excepted, which <hi>Plato</hi> calls the great miracle) then Natural Bathes, and Mineral Waters. The nature and cauſes whereof have been ſo hard to diſcover, as our antient Authors have written little of them, holding them to be ſacred or holy, either for that they judged them to have their virtue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from God, or at leaſt from the celeſtial Bodies; from whence, both their actual heat was thought to be kindled, by lightnings or ſuch like impreſſions, and other admirable Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and ſometimes contrary effects derived, which appear in them. Alſo divers miracles have been aſcribed unto thoſe Natural Bathes, to confirm the opinion of a ſupernatural power in them, as <hi>Guaynerius</hi> reports of the Bathes of <hi>Aque</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi>: and <hi>Langius</hi> out of <hi>Athenoeus,</hi> concerning the Bathes of <hi>Edepſus,</hi> which both loſt their vertue for a time. <note place="margin">Cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63227:15"/>
were reſtored to their former virtues again,</p>
                  <p>I need not herein averring the opinion of Divinity which was held to be in Bathes, make any mention of the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> written of by Saint <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Nonnus</hi> the Poet: nor of the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> which cured <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> of his Leproſie, being indeed true mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and done by a ſupernatural power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> yet it is likely that thoſe and ſuch like examples bred in the minds of men a reverend and divine opinion of all Bathes: eſpecially where they ſaw ſuch ſtrange effects as they could not well reduce to natural Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>And this hath been the cauſe that in old time theſe mineral fountains have been conſecrated unto certain Deities: as <hi>Hamon</hi> in <hi>Lybia,</hi> unto <hi>Jupiter: Thermopilae,</hi> unto <hi>Hercules,</hi> by <hi>Pallas</hi>: among the <hi>Troglodites,</hi> another to the <hi>Sun,</hi> &amp;c. And at this day we have divers Bathes which carry the names of the Sun, Moon, and Saints: and many Towns and Cities named from the Bathes in them: as <hi>Thermae</hi> in <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Sicily, Thermidea</hi> in <hi>Rhodes, Aquae</hi> in <hi>Italy, Aquiſgraue</hi> in <hi>Germany, Baden</hi> in <hi>Helvetia</hi>: and our antient City of <hi>Bathe</hi> in <hi>Somerſet-ſhire,</hi> in honor whereof I have eſpecially undertaken this labour, and I perſwade my ſelf, that among the infinite number of Bathes and Mineral Waters which are in Europe, there are none of more univerſal uſe for curing of <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> nor any more commodious for entertainment of ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, then theſe are.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this ſacred conceit of Bathes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in antient times, the minds of men were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63227:16"/>
poſſeſt, we may adde this, that the nature of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals was not ſo well discovered by them, as it hath been ſince: and therefore we finde very little written of this argument, either in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> or in <hi>Galen,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">De tuenda ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. lib.4. cap.4.</note> who wrote moſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly in all other points of Phyſick, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this hath little; <note n="*" place="margin">See the reaſon of this in <hi>Iones</hi> his <hi>Bathes Aid,</hi> fol. 7. b. where alſo he proves the inward uſe of Mineral wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters among Phyſicians, as well before, as ſince the time of <hi>Galen.</hi>

                  <p>After theſe Grecians, the antient Latines and Arabians ſucceeded <hi>Plinie, Celſus, Seneca, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius, Avicen, Rhaſis, Seraphio, Averrhoes,</hi> it whom we finde ſome ſmall mention of natural Bathes, and ſome uſe of Salt and nitrous, and <hi>Aluminous</hi> waters, but nothing of worth toward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The like reaſon may be drawn from the coldneſs of mountains, which being near to the middle region of the air, and wanting that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of the beams of the Sun, which is in the valleys, are continually cold, and often covered with ſnow, which would not be if the air were hot. As for the conceit that the middle region is made cold by an Antiperiſtaſis, the element of fire being above it, and the reflection of the beams of the Sun beneath it, it is an idle conceit. For theſe heats on both ſides would rather heat than cool the middle region by their working upon it. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo take away the element of fire from under the Moon, which is an opinion now exploded by the beſt Philoſophers, and then what becomes of your Antiperiſtaſis? <note place="margin">Davaeus Philoſ.

                  <p>Neither would it be ſo cold neer the Poles, if the air of it ſelf were hot. But the long abſence of the Sun in thoſe parts, and the oblique beams when it is preſent, do permit the air to enjoy his natural coldneſs. And as the airis of it ſelf, and in his own nature cold, ſo is it probable that it is more cold than water, ſeeing it hath a greater power of condenſation, than water, as we ſee it congeals water into ice, ſnow, hail, &amp;c. which the water cannot do of it ſelf.

                  <p>For the firſt, it is certain that our Springs and Rivers do receive great ſupply of waters from the Air, where vapours being congealed by cold, do fall down upon the Earth, in Rain, or Snow, or Hail, whereby the ground is not only made fertile, but our Springs are revived, and our Rivers increaſed. <note place="margin">1 From the Air.</note> As we ſee the Rhine and Danubius to ſwell more in Summer than in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe then the Snow which continually lyeth upon the Alpes, doth melt by the heat of the Sun, and fills thoſe Rivers, which have their Originals from thence up to the brinks. Alſo we ſee daily after much Rain, our ſmall Lakes

and Rivers to be very high. Alſo upon much dryth our Springs fail us in many places, which upon ſtore of Rain do ſupply us again with water. And this is the cauſe that in moſt parts of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> near the Equinoctial, where it rains little, they have little water; and many times in two or three dayes journey, can hardly find to quench their thirſts and their Camels. <hi>Leo Africanus</hi> ſpeaks of an Army wherein were many Camels, which in their marching, coming to a River, (perhaps it was but a Brook) did drink it dry. So that we muſt acknowledge that the Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives much water this way. But how this ſhould ſerve the Bowels of the Earth with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the generations there, and for perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Springs, is very doubtfull; whereas <hi>Seneca</hi> faith that theſe waters do not pierce above ten foot into the Earth:neither if there were paſſages for it into the Bowels of the Earth, can the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred part of it be imployed this way, but is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily conveyed by Rivers into the Sea.<note place="margin">Quoeſt. natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Heat cannot do it, although it rarifie and attenuate, both for that it conſumes moyſture, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe water is cold, which it ſhould not be, if it were made by heat; for every natural Agent works to that end that it may make the Patient like it ſelf: and heat may convert earth into ſume and dry exhalations, but not into water, for all water which is not eternal, is from cold; likewiſe cold cannot convert earth into water, becauſe cold doth congeal, condenſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate, and indurate, and not diſſolve and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate, &amp;c. as we ſee in Amber and Gumms. Neither will water be converted into earth. For by heat it turns to vapour and air, by cold into ice and ſtone; wherefore the Elements are not changed the one into the other, unleſs it be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and air, which have more affinity and more neighborhood than the reſt.<note place="margin">Ariſtotel.4. me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor. cap. 10. &amp; ultimo.</note> And yet it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as I have ſaid in the former Chapter: but this generation of water from the earth is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.

Others will make the earth to be an animal, and to ſuck water by veins, to ſerve his turn for generations and nutritions. But why ſhould it ſuck more than it hath need of? and how ſhall it caſt it forth beyond the place of uſe to the ſuperficies of the earth? unleſs they will ſay that the Mynes which ſuck it, do puke it up as Infants do when their ſtomachs are full, which is abſurd to ſay. Theſe and ſuch like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices are produced for the maintaining of their Original; which as they are all inſufficient to afford ſuch a proportion of water as is requiſite, ſo moſt of them are ſo improbable, and full of deſperate difficulties, as I am unwilling to ſpend time in the rehearſing of them, or their Authors, much more unwilling in the confuting of them, to trouble my ſelf, and offend my Reader, only the point of ſubterranean fire which hath taken deepeſt impreſſion in moſt mens minds, I ſhall ſpeak of hereafter, when I come to ſhew the cauſes of the actual heat of Springs.

But holding the ſacred Canon of the Scriptures, that all Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are from the Sea, &amp;c.

the natural place of waters is above the earth. And although neer the Coaſts it be depreſſed and lower than the Shore, yet there is reaſon for that, becauſe it is terminated by the dry and ſolid body of the earth: as we ſee in a cup or bowl of water filled to the top, we may put in a great bulk of ſilver in pieces, and yet it will not run over, but be heightened above the brims of the bowl.

For if a meaſure ſhould be taken of the Globe of the earth, it muſt be taken from the tops of the Mountains, and from the higheſt of the Sea, and not from the Valleys, nor from the Sea-coaſts.

                  <p>THe ſecond ſhall be Stone. Stone is another Mineral ſubſtance, concrete and more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy than earth, and our Mineral men confound themſelves much in the definition of it. <note place="margin">De metallis cap.6.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Fallopius</hi> implores the help of <hi>Marcus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius Janna</hi> about it, as one of the moſt difficult points in Philoſophie: but in the end, defines it <hi>by his want of diſſolution, either by heat or moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</hi> And whereas it is manifeſt that ſome ſtones will melt, he imputes it to the admixture of ſome metal, among which he reckoneth glaſs. Others define it by his hardneſs, wherein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it goeth beyond others Minerals. But you ſhall have ſome ſtones ſofter than ſome of thoſe, and therefore the definition is not good. Others by this, <hi>that being broken or calcin'd, they will not be conſolidated again into their former conſiſtence or ſhape.</hi> But for breaking, the reaſon of that, is want of fuſion; for without fuſion or ignition, which is a kind or degree of fuſion, Metals alſo being broken, will not be conſolidated into the ſame Maſſe again. And there is no more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in nature or eſſence, between a whole ſtone and a broken, than there is between a maſs of Metal, and the powder or filings of the ſame. As for calcination, other minerals may be ſo far
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63227:30"/>
calcin'd, and brought to a Crocus by fire, as they will be irreducible, therefore this is not proper to ſtone. Wherefore I am of <hi>Fallopius</hi> his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in this point, and the rather becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would ſeem to be a ſpecies in nature wanting, if there were not Mineral Species wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, diſſolution by heat or moyſture, as well as there are, having ſuch diſſolution. And this <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi> which nature abhors, is not only to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of a local vacuity, but alſo of a want b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſuch ſpecies as are in natures power to produce, for the ornament of the World. For if it be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural paſſion to be diſſolved, it is likewiſe a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural paſſion not to be diſſolved: and if ſome things will be diſſolved both by heat and moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, as Salts, why ſhould there not be other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which will be diſſolved by neither of them. And this muſt be ſtone, for nature affords none other. Moreover, according to <hi>Ariſtotle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

water: for this quality ſheweth the perfection of their mixture. True it is that ſome ſtones will be diſſolved by fire or water, and therefore <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Agricola</hi> divide Stones into fuſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſible: but this is in regard of other ſubſtances bred in the ſtone; which if it be Metal, the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will be Metalline: If Nitre or mean Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, it will be Vitrificatory. As <hi>Pliny</hi> reports of the invention of Glaſs by certain Merchants, who melting Nitre upon the Sand in <hi>Syria,</hi> where with Clods of Nitre they had made a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace for their neceſſary uſe; found that clear Metal which we call Glaſs, <hi>Ecce liquato nitro oum arenis viſi ſunt rivi fluxiſſe nobilis liquoris.</hi> Behold, with the Sand, when the Nitre was mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ran ſtreams of a noble liquor.</p>
                  <p>If Sulphur, as in <hi>Pyrite,</hi> it will likewiſe melt and ſtrike fire. And whereas the ſtriking of fire out of a flint or Pyrites, or any other thing that will ſtrike fire, is held by all men to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the kindling of air, by the colliſion of two hard ſubſtances together, they are miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. For then Diamonds, Chryſtal Glaſs, &amp;c. ſhould ſtrike fire as well as flints; but it is the Sulphur contained in them: And <hi>G. Fabricius</hi> in his obſervations, although he obſerves not the reaſon of this fire, yet he confeſſeth that out of any Pyrites <hi>è quo excutitur ignis, etiam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>xcoquitur ſulphur</hi>; Out of which fire is ſtruck, Sulphur alſo is to be had. <hi>Pliny</hi> gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the name, <hi>quia ineſt illi ignis</hi>; Becauſe fire is in it. The like we obſerve in <hi>Indian</hi> Canes, and ſome Woods that are unctuous, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But whereas it is a common received opinion, that ſome of theſe <hi>Bitumina</hi> will burn in water, I cannot believe it; although. <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola,</hi> and moſt that have written ſince, out of them do averr it, and bring arguments and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to prove it. For although water were a fewel to fire, as oyle is, yet there can be no fire without air, and water excludes air; and ſo doth oyle, if the fire be beneath it, and covered with it: As for their arguments, they ſay that <hi>Bitumen</hi> being ſprinkled with water, burns more, and therefore water is a fewel to it: as wee ſee that Smiths caſt water upon their Sea-cole in their Forges: but the reaſon of this is, becauſe their Coal being ſmall like duſt, the water makes it to cake and bake together, where otherwiſe the blaſt would blow it way: alſo it hinders the quick burning of it, and ſo makes it continue the longer: ſo in a <hi>Vulcano</hi> after Rain, they find the fire to burn more, when the <hi>Bitumen</hi> is ſmal, and in duſt. Although this may be a reaſon of it, that the Lyme which hath there been calcined, being by Rain diſſolved, increaſeth the fire. And whereas they ſay that water will kindle <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen,</hi> and quench <hi>Sulphur</hi> it is not ſo: neither doth their example of Wild-fire prove it. For in Wild-fire, beſides Bitumen and Camphir, there is a double proportion of quick Lymes, which by reaſon of the ſudden diſſolution of his Salt, by the effuſion of water, is apt to kindle any combuſtible matter; not by reaſon of any Bitumen in the Lyme, as ſome imagine, nor of

Among theſe Gums or Roſins, we reckon Camphir, and ſo that argument is anſwered. As for his other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument drawn from earth-quakes, mentioned by the Arabians, after which there is commonly more plenty of Camphir: this doth not prove it to be a mineral; For earth-quakes are as apt

to caſt up freſh mould, whereby trees are made fruitful, as minerals. Wherefore let us ſubſcribe to the antient Arabians, although they were not eye-witneſſes hereof, and to the later obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Spaniards and others; eſpecially now that we have a Countrey-man of our own, who hath had as good means to learn the truth of this, as any European ever had; who is yet living, and able to give ſatisfaction to any that are curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in theſe points.</p>

or roching of concrete juyces, is worthy to be obſerved, ſeeing every kind hath his ſeveral manner or faſhion of ſhooting, whereby a man may ſee the perfection of each kind. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if Salt-peeter be brought you to examine whether it be perfect good or not, diſſolve it in water, and ſet it to ſhoot in a wooden-diſh, or with ſticks of Aſh, or other porons wood: and if it ſhoot in needles, (<hi>in ſtirias</hi>) it is right. But if any of it ſhoot in ſquares or angles, or lumps, it is mixt, and unfit either for Medicine or Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder. The common Salt-peeter being prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and cleanſed with aſhes, hath commonly much of the ſalt of the aſhes mixt with it in the liquors, which being brought to ſhoot, will ſettle firſt upon the wood in ſquares, (<hi>in teſſeras</hi>) and then the Salt-peeter will ſhoot upon it in nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles. Theſe needles are good Salt-peeter, but the ſquares are other ſalt, and weaken the Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeter in his operation; the like you may judge of other concrete juyces. There are alſo certain ſtones which we call <hi>fluores,</hi> which do naturally ſhoot in divers forms: as Chriſtal into fix ſquares (<hi>in ſexagulos.</hi>) Sparr, which the Dutch call Sput or Querts, ſhoots into points like Diamonds, as we ſee in thoſe Corniſh or <hi>Briſtol</hi>-ſtones: <hi>Oſteocolla</hi> found by <hi>Darmſtadt,</hi> in the Palatinat, like bones: others like Oyſter or Muſcle-ſhells, &amp;c. The reaſon of this ſeveral ſhooting in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete juyces and other minerals, is hard to give. For if it did lye in the thinneſs or thickneſs, or clammineſs of the matter whereof they were made, that difference were taken away when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts are diſſolved together in the ſame wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

Yet I do
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63227:40"/>
not deny a diſtinction to be made of Purgations in other reſpects. And our antient Phyſitians through long experience have found out the right uſe of purging medicines, and their true diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for ſeveral uſes for mens bodies: as that ſome do purge groſs humours, and ſome thin, ſome are ſtrong, and ſome weak: ſome are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to the Stomach, or Liver, or Spleen, &amp;c. and ſome hurtfull to ſome of thoſe parts: ſome are too hot in ſome caſes, and ſome temperate, &amp;c. but they have not diſcovered the true cauſe of this purging quality: ſome attributing it to a celeſtial influence, ſome to a hidden quality, which is as much as if they bad ſaid nothing: ſome to a Sympathy, Antipathy, &amp;c. For my part I hold the purgative quality of mixt bodies to lie principally in the terreſtrial part of them, which is their Salt: and therefore the Chymiſts uſe to acuate their purging extracts with their proper Salts. It were much better if they could make their Salts without calcination; for then they ſhould retain the taſte of the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which lyeth in the Salt, and much other virtue which the fire conſumes in calcination. <note place="margin">Three wayes to make Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Salts to retain the taſte of the herbs from whence they are drawn. 1.</note> It were a delicate thing to have all our vegetable ſalts to retain the taſte of the herbs and ſimples, from whence they are drawn: as of Wormwood, bitter; of Sorel, ſour; of Licoris, ſweet, &amp;c. There are in mine opinion, three ſeveral wayes for it, although they be laborious. The one is by precipitation, when the juice or ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of any ſimple is precipitated by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſome appropriate liquor which will ſtrike down all other parts in the juice or deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63227:41"/>
but the Salt which is in it will not eaſily precipitate, but will remain in the liquor, and muſt be ſevered either by evaporation, or by roching. But in this work we muſt make choice of ſuch a precipitator, as may not infect our Salt with any ſtrange quality. <note place="margin">Three wayes to make Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Salts to retain the taſte of the herbs from whence they are drawn. 2.</note> Another way it to make an extract of the ſimple which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to work upon, and when we have made it ſo dry as it will be powdred, then pour upon it pure ſpirit of Wine, which will diſſolve no Salt, if it be without flegme. By this means throngh often repetitions of new infuſions, untill the extract will yield no more tincture unto the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, you ſhall find the Salt in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, as a ſubſtance which the Spirit of Wine will not work upon, nor diſſolve. <note place="margin">Three wayes to make Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Salts to retain the taſte of the herbs from whence they are drawn. 3.</note> A third way, as I conceive, may be in manner of the working of Salt-Peeter, by putrifying great quantities o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſecond courſe I have tryed, the other wayes are very probable.

In Phyſick we find our <hi>Sal Nitrum</hi> (which is a kind of it) to cool the body mightily, and therefore uſed in Juleps.

And theſe parts of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are found to be very ſoveraign againſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome and maligne humours. The reaſon of it I take to be, not only the drying quality they have, whereby they reſiſt corruption of humours, but alſo &amp; principally by reaſon of their volatile Salt or Nitre, whereby they move ſweat, and expell from the center of the body. For all their Salt is volatile, as may appear by this, that you can never make any <hi>lixivium,</hi> out of any of theſe animal Medicines, by calcination, as you do out of vegetables; their Salt being altogether eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated by the fire.

For whereas <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his followers attribute the ſaltneſs of the Sea, to the evaporation of the freſh and ſweet parts of the water, by the Sun, and to an aduſtion procured alſo thereby: I anſwer, that neither the one nor the other can breed a ſubſtance in the water, which was not there before. For qualities can breed no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and aduſtion is but a quality imprinted, and no ſubſtance. Neither can evaporation breed any, but only diſcover that which was in it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by taking away the thin parts, and leaving the terreſtrial behind. <note place="margin">Aliquid aquae admixtum Ariſt. 2.

And whereas they alledge for confirmation of their opinion, that under the torrid Zone, the Sea is more ſalt then in other parts, the Sun exhaling more there, and making a greater aduſtion; I doubt it, both for the large &amp; plentiful Rivers which thoſe parts afford, beyond any other parts of the world, and alſo for that the Sea water there is not hot, neither are the beams of the Sun ſo hot, but that men do endure them: and therefore not likely to breed an aduſtion in the Sea water, which muſt firſt be hot, before it be aduſted. Alſo it may be that thoſe parts do abound in Rocks of Salt, as we read of people in <hi>Africa,</hi> called <hi>Ammantes,</hi> who make them Houſes of Rock-Salt, and Caſtles, as that in <hi>Sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Mountain <hi>Oromenus</hi> in <hi>India</hi> is all of Salt. Moreover if the Sun be able to do this in the Sea, which is alwayes in motion, whereby it eludes the force of the beams; why ſhould it not do the like, and much more in ſtanding Lakes, as the <hi>Lemanus</hi> and ſuch like? They anſwer that Lakes are continually ſupplyed and fed with freſh water from Springs. But ſo is the Sea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually fed with freſh water, and in as large a proportion, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> as Lakes are. For as the Sea is not increaſed by the influx of freſh waters, no more are divers Lakes, but keep the ſame fulneſs, and ſometimes are leſſened. And whereas they ſay that the upper part of the Sea is more ſalt then the botome, they ſpeak againſt all reaſon, ſalt being heavier then water, and againſt experience, as I have ſhewed in the former Chapter. Alſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in ſome places confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it. <note place="margin">Meteor. 2.c.3.</note> But if any man will take the pains to vapour away 100.

This may be tryed alſo in any diſtilled water, which we are ſure can have no Salt in it, (for Salt will not ariſe in diſtillation) and is as apt to yield Salt as any other water, if aduſtion or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporation would breed it. Wherefore the ſaltneſs of the Sea is not from evaporation or aduſtion, but muſt needs proceed from Rocks of Salt in the Earth, which the Sea doth, waſh, and diſſolve much of it.

                     <p>Of Mineral Spirits; Quick-ſilver, Salphur or Brinsſtone, Arſenick, with his kinds, Cadmia.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AFiſt kind of Minerals are called Spirits; theſe are volatil in the fire, and have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion into Metals, but no metalline fuſion. Theſe are Quick-ſilver, Sulphur, Arſenick, Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, Ruſma, &amp;c. All which being volatil, will eaſily ſublime, and being mixed with metals, as Cadmia's ordinarily to make Braſs, will alter the colour of the metal, and make it leſs fuſible, and leſs malleable. I will briefly run over the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of theſe and their virtues or qualities, being more obſcure, and in our Baths leſs uſeful than the former, and more rare.</p>
                  <p>Qnick ſilver was not well known to <hi>Galen,</hi> for he confeſſeth that he had no experience of it, and did think it to be meerly artificial, and not naturally bred in the earth. <note place="margin">Simpl. med. fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. 1. 5. 0. 59.</note> 
                     <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> makes no mention of the temperature of it, but holds it to be a pernitious venome, and to fret the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails; although <hi>Matthiolus</hi> affirms that it is ſafely given to women to further their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and we find it ſo by often expcrience, both in that cauſe, and in Worms, and in the French Diſeaſe and Leproſies, if it be skilfully prepared, and with judgement adminiſtred. <hi>Fallopius</hi> holds it to be one of the miracles of nature. Thoſe that take upon them to determine of the qualities of it, are much diſtracted; fome reckoning it to be hot and dry, and ſome cold and moiſt; and both

In <hi>Scotland</hi> three miles beyond <hi>Barwick,</hi> I found a red ſtone, which I took to be <hi>minium nativum,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Agricola</hi> makes mention of it in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but by a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance could not try it.</p>
                  <p>Sulphur attracts, contracts, reſolves, mollifies, diſcuſſes, whereby it ſhews a manifeſt heat, though not intenſe, yet the ſume of it is very ſour, and therefore muſt cool and dry: and I perſwade my ſelf that there is no better ſume to correct veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and infectious air, than this of Sulphur, or to remove infections out of rooms, clothes, bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, veſſels, &amp;c. <note place="margin">Sulphur.</note> We muſt acknowledge dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering parts in all compounded bodies; as Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb hath a purgative quality in the infuſion, and an aſtrictive in the Terreſtrial ſubſtance, where the ſalt hath been by infuſion extracted. The ſubſtance of Sulphur is very fat (<hi>Sulphure nihil pinguius</hi>) faith <hi>Felix Platerus,</hi> and this is the cauſe of his eaſie taking of fire, and nor any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquity it hath with fire in the quality of heat: for if it were very hot, <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> would not comment it <hi>purulenta extuſſientibus,</hi> the next door to a Hectick. Alſo Galen faith, that fat things are moderately hot, and are rather nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63227:48"/>
than medicaments. Now for Sulphurous Baths, they are very frequent, and if we ſhould believe ſome, there are no hot Baths but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate with Sulphur, but they are deceived, as ſhall appear hereafter, when we come to ſhew the true cauſes of the heat of Baths. Neither are all ſulphurous Baths hot. <hi>Geſner</hi> reports of a Bath by <hi>Zurich</hi> very cold, and yet ſulphurous, <hi>Agricola</hi> of another by <hi>Buda</hi> in <hi>Pannonia.</hi> In <hi>Campania</hi> by the Leucogaean Hills, are cold Springs full of Brimſtone. Alſo there are hot Baths without any ſhew of ſulphur that can be diſcerned, as the Baths of <hi>Petriolum</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Baths <hi>Caldanelloe</hi> and <hi>de Avinione in agro Senenſi, de Gratta in Viterbienſi, de aquis in piſanis col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus. Divi Johannis in agro Lucenſi, in Alſatia</hi> another not far from <hi>Geberſallerum,</hi> &amp;c. All which are very hot, and yet give no ſign of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur either by taſte or ſmell, or effects. And yet no doubt there are many Baths having a ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſmell from other minerals; as from Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Vitriol, Sandaracha, Allum, &amp;c. which are hardly to be diſcerned (if at all) from Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur. So we commonly ſay, if a houſe or a tree be fet on fire by lightning, that it ſmells of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone when there was no Brimſtone there. Manſ things combuſted, will yield a nidorous ſmell, not diſcernable after burning what the things were. But there are divers truly ſulphurous Baths which contain Sulphur, although not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly mixt with the water without ſome <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> but only confuſed: for perfect Sulphur will not diſſolve in water no more than Bitumen, The ſpirit of Sulphur may be communicated to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63227:48"/>
water, and ſo may the matter of Sulphur before it hath attained his perfect form and conſiſtente : otherwiſe it is only confufed with water, and alters it into a milky colour. <hi>Sulphurca Nar al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus aqua,</hi> Nar with Sulphurous water white. At <hi>Baia</hi> are divers hot fulphurous Baths, and every where in <hi>Hetrnria,</hi> in <hi>Sicily, in Dioceſi Panormitana</hi> ; the Baths of <hi>Apono,</hi> as <hi>Savana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rola Muntagna,</hi> and <hi>Fallopius</hi> avevs, although <hi>John de dondis</hi> denieth it; the Bath of <hi>Aſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> of <hi>Callatura, S. Euphemie, Aquiſgran, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes thernmae in V aleſiis Helvetiorum, Aqua ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta in Picenis,</hi> and an infinite number every where. <hi>Baccius</hi> reckons our Baths of <hi>Bath</hi> among fulphurous Baths, from the relation of <hi>Edward Carne</hi> when he was Embaſſador to <hi>Jnlius tertius,</hi> and <hi>Panlus quartus.</hi> I will not deny ſome touch of Sulphur in them, ſeeing we ſind among bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous coals, ſome which are called metal coals, with certain yellow vains which are Sulphur. But the proportion of Sulphur to Bitumen, is very little, and therefore I do not hold them Sul-phurous &amp; <hi>pradominio.</hi> This is enough for Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Arſenick, it is a venomous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and therefore I need ſpeak noth ng of the Baths which proceed from it, but that we take heed of them; It is likely that thoſe venomous waters and vapours which kill ſuddenly, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Arſenick, as at <hi>Cicrum</hi> in <hi>Thracia, font Neptunius in Terracina,</hi> at <hi>Peraut</hi> by <hi>Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelier, the Lake Avernus. <note place="margin">Arſenick.</note> The cave of Charon by Naples.</hi> Under Arſenick we may comprehe. d <hi>Auripigmentum, Riſagalum, Sandaracha, Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>

                  <p>For Tin, we have as good as any in the World, although it is not wrought to the beſt advantage. <note place="margin">Tin.</note> The Countreys where it grows, are barren of wood, and they are fain to fetch it far off.

The Tin alſo would be as good as now it is, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct not diminiſhed.</p>
                  <p>For Lead, although for ſoft Oars the ordinary courſe of melting at <hi>Mondip</hi> and the <hi>Peak,</hi> may ſerve Well, and much better than their Baling at <hi>Alendale</hi> in <hi>Hexamſhire</hi> and at <hi>Graſs</hi> in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Dureſme</hi>: yet for hard Oars (which are commonly rich in ſilver) there might be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courſes taken, by common or proper Agents. Common agents are fire and water; proper are diſſolvents or additaments. <note place="margin">Lead.</note> By fire they might amend their working, if they did roaſt their Oars well before melting, to breath away volatil and combuſtible ſubſtances which are mixed with their Oars. By water, after calcination or roaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they may ſeparate all diſſoluble juyces, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Diſſolvents do chiefly ſerve to ſeparate the ſilver or gold out of the Oars: as in the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver work, or by Lyes of Nitre, Allum, Salts, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Additaments are alſo of great uſe, whether they be ſegregatory for ſeparation of ſpirits, or mean metals from our Oars, and ſo to facilitate
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63227:52"/>
their fuſion: or propugnatory to defend the Oares from conſuming or vitrifying. Segregatory ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditaments are either ſuch as are more eaſie of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion than the Oare, and ſo draw the Oare into fuſion with them, or ſuch as will not melt at all, as <hi>Geber</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cujus intentio non ſit fundi</hi>: which keeps the Oar aſunder from clodding, and giyes it a greater heat, like fire in his boſom. By theſe means well applyed and uſed, all Lead Oares might be wrought, be they never ſo ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, and none need to be neglected. Hitherto I have digreſſed out of mine intended courſe, through the deſire I have to advance mineral works. Now I will return to ſhew the nature and qualities of theſe metals, as I have done of other minerals.</p>
                  <p>Gold of all Metals is the moſt ſolid, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moſt heavy, as having few impurities or heterogeneal ſubſtances mixed with it. <note place="margin">Nature and qualities of Gold.</note> And therefore it is not ſubject to corruption, as other metals are, neither will it loſe any of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, either by fire or water, although it ſhould be held in them a long time: ſo as it is an idle and vain perſwaſion that many have, who think by boyling Gold in Broth, to get ſome ſtrength from thence, and ſo to make the Broths more cordial. <note place="margin">Bascius lib. 6. cap. 8.</note> The like I may ſay of putting Gold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Electuaries or Pills, unleſs it be in caſe of Quickſilver taken into the body, which the Gold by touch may gather to it, otherwiſe it goes out of the body as it came in, without any concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or alteration, or diminution. And if it be diſſolved in ſtrong water, it will be reduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to his metalline ſubſtance, without diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63227:52"/>
much leſs will it be diſſolved without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive Spirits, to make <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> as ſome do undertake. <note place="margin">Baſilica chimia Pag. 204.</note> 
                     <hi>Crollius</hi> doth acknowledge, that there is but one <hi>Menſtruum</hi> in the world that may do it, and that he knows not. But if we had it diſſolved, we are yet uncertain what the quality of it would be, or what uſe to make of it in Phyſick; only becauſe it loſeth none of his ſubſtance, we know it can do no hurt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we uſe it for Cauteries, &amp; to quench in Beer or Wine, &amp;c. to warm it, or to give it ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction from the fire. <note place="margin">De Thermis cap. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Fallopius</hi> in theſe regards diſclaims it in all mineral waters, as he doth all other metals: and will not believe that any metal doth impart any quality unto water. <note place="margin">In ingreſſu ad infermo, pap.373.</note> 
                     <hi>Claudinus</hi> holds otherwiſe, and ſo doth <hi>Baccius, Savanarola, Montagnana, Venuſtus, Solinander,</hi> and almoſt all that have written of Bathes. For if we ſhould exclude Metals, we muſt likewiſe exclude Stones, and Bitumina and Sulphur, and almoſt all minerals, except concrete juices. For none of theſe, after they have attained to their full conſiſtence, will of themſelves diſſolve in water, without the help of ſome concrete juice, as a medium to unite them with the water. But before they have their full conſiſtence, whilſt they are in <hi>Solutis principiis,</hi> as Earth, Juice, or Vapour, they may be communicated with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Gold is ſo ſparingly bred in the bowels of the Earth, as in that reſpect it can hardly furniſh a perpetual Spring with any quality from it: yet ſome Bathes are held to participate with Gold, as <hi>Ficuncellenſes, Fabariae, Piperinae, de Grottae in Viterbio: Sancti Caſſiani de Buxo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Iron is the moſt impure of all metals, as we have it wrought, and will hardly melt as metals ſhould do, but with additaments and fluſſes. <note place="margin">Of Iron and Steel.</note> Neither is it ſo malleable, and ductible as other metals are, by reaſon of his many impurities.

And how can they attract and concoct nouriſhment, and expel excrements, which have no veins nor fibres, nor any diſtinct parts to perform theſe Offices withal? Moreover they are not increaſed as Plants are, by nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereas the parts already generated, are extended in all proportions by the ingreſſion of nutriment, which ſills and enlarges them: but only are augmented externally upon the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, by ſuper-addition of new matter concocted by the ſame virtue and ſpirit, into the ſame Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. <note place="margin">Eraſt. diſput. part. 2. p. 261.</note>

                  <p>Thus much for the manner of all mineral ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, which is not much controverted: the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63227:57"/>
chief difference is about the efficient and the matter. About the efficient cauſe of generations (for we muſt handle them all together) there are divers opinions, as there are divers cauſes which concur to all generations of animals, vegetables or minerals. But there muſt be one principal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe, to give the form to all Species, as thee are other adjuvant and attending cauſes: The principal cauſe and agent in this work, is by moſt attributed to the influence of the Planets, eſpecially to the Sun, who either by his light, or by his heat, doth frame the ſpecies of all things, and ſo of minerals, but chiefly in regard of his heat. <note place="margin">The principal Efficient Cauſe of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, not the Sun.</note> This heat working upon apt matter, is thought to produce the ſeveral ſpecies which we ſee. As for the motion of the Planets, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they move continually in a conſtant or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the World could not ſubſiſt as it doth without it ſo as it may be <hi>canſ a ſine qua non</hi>; a very remote cauſe, as there may be a hundred more cauſes of that nature. So likewiſe the light, which the Peripateticks make the inſtrument of coeleſtial effects, can do as little to the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of generations, ſeeing they proceed as well by night as by day: and for minerals, it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual night with them, the denſity of the earth and rocks not ſuffering the light to paſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they inſiſt chiefly upon the heat of the Sun: but <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us that Plants were created with their ſeeds in themſelves upon the third day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Planets, which were not created till the fourth day; the ſhew us that Plants and terreſtrial ſubſtances depend not upon Planets for their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, <note place="margin">Dorn. phiſica Gereſis.</note> nor for their virtues, but have the prin|
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63227:58"/>
cipal cauſes of them in themſelves. The ſame we may judge of minerals, being terreſtrial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and propagated by ſeeds, as Plants are, and likely to be created upon the ſame day with Plants, ſeeing there is no other mention of their creation in <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for the heat of the Sun, no doubt it is an univerſal foſterer of all inferior ſubſtances: but that it ſhould beget particular Species, is very improbable. The heat of the Sun is no more apt to breed a Nettle than a Dock, Brimſtone than Salt, &amp;c. For it cannot give the eſſence to any thing: heat being only a quality which can breed no ſubſtance, and ſuch a quality as can only ſegre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate heterogeneral ſubſtances; and thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate homogeneal. Whereas in all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there muſt be a further power and virtue, to proportion the Elements fit for every Species (if they will have all things made of the Elements) and to bring the Species form a potential being to an actual, giving to every thing his proper ſhape, quantity, colour, ſmell, taſte, &amp;c. and to unite them, which before were of different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: It muſt be an internal and domeſtical agent, and efficient cauſe which muſt perform this: and ſuch a one as is not common to all Species alike, but proper to that which it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth: otherwiſe there would be no diſtinction, of Species. <note place="margin">Gal. de Maraeſ.</note> And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith of Plants, that they have their ſeeds in themſelves, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeyeral kinds. Neither can any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſe give an eſſential form to any thing, which form muſt be <gap reason="foreign">

And ſo <hi>Zabarella</hi> doth molliſie the harſhneſs of the former opinion: and doth acknowledge that the Sun doth further generations only as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of another ſuperiour power, whereby in minerals it may make the matter more apt to receive the form, but it makes no minerals, no more then it makes blood in our bodies. <note place="margin">De catore.</note>

And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> explodes this efficient of fire, and attributes it to the forms of natural things. <note place="margin">1 De anima Item 2. cap. 4.</note>

                  <p>As for cold in the other Elements, it is far more unlikely then heat, to perform theſe offices, being rather a diſtructive, then a generative quality, and is not called in by any Author to this work, before the ſpecies have received his form by heat: and then it is admitted only for conſolidation, but how juſtly, it is doubtfull: for heat doth conſolidate as well as cold, by drying up moiſture. But we will not grant this to either of them, as principal Agents, but as they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments attending the forms of natural things.</p>
                  <p>The Alchymiſts make Sulphur to be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal efficient of all minerals, eſpecially of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and Mercury the matter. If they mean common Sulphur and Mercury, which are perfect Species in their kinds, they are much deceived, and this opinion is ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by all that oppugne them. But it ſeems
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63227:59"/>
they underſtand ſome parts in the ſeminary of metals which have ſome analogy with theſe: and ſo their opinion may be allowed. For the ſpirit, which is the efficient in theſe generations, doth reſide in a material ſubſtance, which may be reſembled to Sulphur or Oyle, as ſome other part may be reſembled to Mercury. For all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations are framed of different parts united by this Spirit. Thus much of the different opinions concerning the efficient of all generations, and in particular of minerals. The matter whereof minerals are bred, is attributed chiefly to the Elements, as the general matter of all animate and inanimate bodies: inſomuch as both the heavens, and the very ſouls of men are made to proceed from the Elements.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Heavens, it hath been the ancient opinion of the <hi>Platonicks, Pythagoreans,</hi> and <hi>Epicureans,</hi> that not only theſe inferiour bodies, but alſo the coeleſtial, have been framed out of the Elements. <note place="margin">Triſmegiſtus in Aſclepio cap. 1.

Their opinion is more probable, which hold, <hi>animam ex traduce,</hi> and to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated as one light to another: as <hi>Timoth. Bright</hi> proves in <hi>Phyſicam Scribonii,</hi> and not to aſcribe it to the Elements. nor to miracles, or new creations. But there is far more reaſon to derive from the Elements, the taſtes, colours, ſmells, ſigures, numbers, quantities, orders, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, &amp;c. which appear more in corporal ſubſtances, and yet theſe are not from the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

What taſte have any of theſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Fire or heat which is the moſt active Element, hath none. And whereas it is thought, that bittterneſs proceeds from heat, we find that many ſharp and tar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The like difference wefind between our <hi>oleum omphacinum,</hi> and therpe oyle. So likewiſe <hi>opium,</hi> which is held to be very cold, yet it is extream bitter, ſo as the cold

parts in it are not able to maſter the bitterneſs, but this is ſtill predominant: wherefore heat can be no cauſe of bitterneſs, unleſs it be in exceſs or defect, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> confeſſeth. Wormwood is very bitter, being hot and dry in the ſecond or third degree: if heat were the cauſe of it, then all other ſimples which are hot and dry in the ſame degree, ſhould be alſo bitter. As I have ſaid of taſtes, ſo I may ſay of all the other affections of natural things, that they proceed not form the Elements, but from the ſeeds and forms of every thing. So for fat and unctuous ſubſtances, as Sulphur, Bitumen, Oyle, Greaſe, &amp;c. unto what Element ſhall we aſcribe them? Not unto fire, becauſe this is extream hot and dry, that is temperate in heat, and very moiſt. Moreover, fire would rather conſume it, then generate it: and Phyſitians judge the generation of fat in our bodies to proceed rather from cold, then from heat. Air, if it have any ingenerate quality, as ſome do make doubt out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> it is cold and moiſt, as I have ſhewed before, <hi>cap.</hi> 2 &amp; 5. <note place="margin">1 M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

but mud, would make us have muddy brains. We will grant the Elements to be <hi>matrices rerum naturalium,</hi> the wombs and nurſes of natural things, but we will not grant them to be material cauſes. Neither can we attribute more dignity unto them, then we do to our Mothers, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from their ſubſtance whereof they conſiſt, as fleſh, bones, ſinews, veins, arteries, &amp;c. to the nouriſhment of their Infants, but only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare blood for them, from the nutriments which they receive.

So that it is manifeſt that if natural bodies be not nouriſhed by the Elements, they are not compounded of them: but being nouriſhed by other ſubſtances then the Elements, they muſt be compounded of the like; <hi>Simile ſimili nutritur: compoſit a compoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>This is the generation of minerals, according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>; but it is not ſo clear, but that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63227:64"/>
leaves many ſcruples, both concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the efficients. For the matter, it ſeems not probable, that water and earth ſhould make any thing but mud and dirt; for you can expect no more from any thing than is in it, the one is cold and dry, the other cold and moyſt; and therefore as fit to be the matter of any other thing, as of particular minerals. And water, whereof principally metals are made to conſiſt, is very unfit to make a malleable and extenſible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, eſpecially being congealed by cold, as we may ſee in ice. But ſome do add a mineral qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to theſe materials, and that ſimple water is not the chief matter of metals, but ſuch as hath imbibed ſome mineral quality, and ſo is altered from the nature of pure water. This aſſertion doth preſuppoſe minerals in the earth before they were bred; otherwiſe what ſhould breed them at the firſt, when there was no mineral quality to be imparted to water? Again, this mineral qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity either gives the water or the vapour of it the effence of the mineral, and then it is not the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of water, but of the mineral quality, or the potential fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>lty to breed it. If the effence, then this metall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> water, or vapour, muſt have the form of the metal, and ſo be fuſible and malleable. If it have only the power and potential faculty, then the generation is not perfected, but muſt expect further concoction. This concoction is ſaid to be partly by heat, and partly by cold; if by heat, it muſt be in the paſſages of the exhalation as it is carried in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the earth: for afterwards, when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation is ſetled in the ſtones, the heat is gone.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63227:65"/>
Now if the concoction be perfected before the exhalation be inſinuated into the Stones, as it muſt be, if it be like dew, then it is perfect me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and neither is able to penetrate the Stones, nor hath any need of the cold of them to perfect the generation. If by cold, it is ſtrange that cold ſhould be made the principal agent in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of metals, which generates nothing; neither can heat be the efficient of theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Simple qualities can have but ſimple effects, as heat can but make hot, cold can but cool, &amp;c. But they ſay cold doth congeal metals, becauſe heat doth diſſolve them; I anſwer, that the rule is true, if it be rightly applyed: as we ſee ice which is congealed by cold, is readily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by heat. <note place="margin">Valcſius ſacra Philoſoph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>. 49.</note> But the fuſion of metals cannot properly be called a diſſolution by heat, becauſe it is neither reduced to water or vapour, as it was before the congelation by cold, nor is it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent in that kind of diſſolution, although af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fuſion it ſhould be kept in a greater heat than the cold could be which congealed it. For the cold in the bowels of the earth cannot be ſo great, as it is upon the ſuperficies of the earth, ſeeing it was never obſerved that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> was any ice bred there. Alſo this diſſolution which is by fuſion, tends not to the deſtruction of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal (but doth rather make it more perfect) as it ſhould do according to the former rule rightly applyed. And therefore this diſſolution by fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, doth not argue a congelation by cold; which being in the paſſive elements, doth rather attend the matter than the efficient of generations: for it is apt to dull and hebetate all faculties and

                  <p>There is a Seminarie Spirit of all minerals in the bowels of the earth, <note place="margin">The Authors opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the manner of the Generation of Minerals.</note> which meeting with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient matter, and adjuvant cauſes, is not idle, but doth proceed to produce minerals, according to the nature of it, and the matter which it meets withal; which matter it works upon like a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by his motion procures an actual heat,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63227:66"/>
as an inſtrument to further his work; which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual heat is increaſed by the fermentation of the matter. The like we ſee in making of Malt, where the grains of Barley being moiſtned with water, the generative Spirit in them is dilated, and put in action; and the ſuperfluity of water being removed, which might choak it, and the Barley laid up in heaps; the ſeeds gather heat, which is increaſed by the contiguity of many grains lying one upon another. In this work natures intent is to produce more indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, according to the nature of the Seed, and therefore it ſhoots forth in ſpires: but the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt abuſes the intention of Nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts it to his end, that is, to increaſe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Malt. The like we find in mineral ſubſtances, where this ſpirit or ferment is reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as in Allum and Copperas Mines, which being broken, expoſed and moiſtened, will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an actual heat, and produce much more of thoſe minerals, then elſe the mine would yield; as <hi>Agricola</hi> and <hi>Thurneiſer</hi> do affirm, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by common experience. The like is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally obſerved in Mines, as <hi>Agricola, Eraſtus, Libavius,</hi> &amp;c. do avouch out of the daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of mineral men, who affirm, that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, they find their Mines ſo hot, as they can hardly touch them; although it is likely that where they work for perfect Minerals, the heat which was in fermentation, whilſt they were yet breeding, is now much abated: the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals being now grown to their perfection. And for this heat we need not call for the help of the Sun, which a little could will take away from us, much more the body of the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63227:66"/>
earth, and rocks; not for ſubterranean fire: this inbred heat is ſufficient, as may appear alſo by the Mines of Tinglaſs, which being digged, and laid in the moiſt air, will become very hot. So Antimony and Sublimat being mixed together, will grow ſo hot as they are not able to be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: If this be ſo in little quantities, it is likely to be much more in great quantities and huge rocks. Heat of it ſelf differs not in kind, but only in degree, and therefore is inclined no more to one Species, then to another, but as it doth attend and ſerve a more worthy and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour power, ſuch as this generative ſpirit is. And this ſpirit doth convert any apt matter it meets withall to his own ſpecies by the help of heat; and the earth is full of ſuch matter which attends upon the ſpecies of things: and oftentimes for want of fit opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and adiuvant cauſes, lies idle, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any ſpecies: but is apt to be tranſmuted by any mechanical and generative ſpirit into them. And this matter is not the Elements themſelves, but ſubterranean ſeeds placed in the Elements, which not being able to live to themſelves, do live to others. <note place="margin">Muſſetus in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logo apologetics.</note>

                  </argument>
                  <p>NOW I come to ſhew how our mineral waters receive both their actual heat, and their virtues. <note place="margin">Cauſes of heat in mineral waters not.</note> I joyn them together, becauſe they depend upon one and the ſame cauſe, unleſs they be juices which will readily diſſolve in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without the help of heat: other minerals will not, or very hardly.</p>
                  <p>This actual heat of waters hath troubled all thoſe that have written of them, and many opinions have been held of the cauſes of them. Some attribute it to wind or air, or exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions included in the bowels of the earth, which either by their own nature, or by their violent motion, and agitation, and attrition upon rocks and narrow paſſages, do gather heat, and impart it to our waters. <note place="margin">Wind, Air, Exhalations in the Earth.</note> Of their own nature theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations cannot be ſo hot, as to make our water hot, eſpecially ſeeing in their paſſage among cold rocks, it would be much allaied, having no ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63227:69"/>
of heat to maintain it. Moreover, where water hath paſſage to get forth to the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the earth, there theſe exhalations and winds will eaſily paſs, and ſo their heat gone withall, and ſo our waters left to their natural coldneſs: whereas we ſee they do continue in the ſame degree and tenor, many generations together. <note place="margin">Agitation and violent motion.</note> If by their agitation and violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they get this heat, becauſe no violent thing is perpetual or conſtant, this cannot be the cauſe of the perpetual and conſtant heat of water. Beſides, this would rather cauſe earthquakes and ſtorms, and noyſes in the earth, then heat our ſprings. Moreover, we daily obſerve, that exhalations and water are never heated by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or agitation; as in the Cataracts of the <hi>Rhine</hi> by <hi>Splug</hi>; the agitation and fall of water upon rocks is moſt violent, and makes a hideous noyſe; yet it heats not the water, though it be very deep in the earth. <note place="margin">Valeſeus centre. lib. 4. cap. 3. Solinand. l. 1. cap. 4.</note> Neither can any attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion heat either air or water, or any ſoft and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid thing, but rather make it more cold.</p>
                  <p>Others attribute this actual heat of Bathes unto the Sun, whoſe beams piercing thorow the pores of the earth, do heat our waters. <note place="margin">The Sun.</note> If this heat which heats our Bathes be cauſed by the beams of the Sun, then either they bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely from the Sun, as a quality proceeding from thence, or they make it by their own motion. If it come from the nature of the Sun, the Sun muſt be extream hot that can heat theſe inferiour parts at ſuch a diſtance; eſpecially the beams which muſt carry it, paſſing thorow the middle region of the air, which is alwayes extream cold,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63227:69"/>
and cannot but cool thoſe beams before they come to us. And if they were able to paſs that region without loſing their heat, yet they cannot but warm that region, being nearer to their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of heat, as well or better then they can warm our waters, in deſpite of any Antiperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis. But it is doubtfull whether the Sun be hot of his own nature or no. <note n="†" place="margin">It may be ſo in former times, but few, I think, do doubt it now; I am ſure not thoſe who hold the Sun to be a Flame.</note> The Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks hold it to be hot and dry moderately; yet it muſt be extream hot, if in this manner it do heat our Bathes. And if the Sun be capable of heat, they muſt alſo make it capable of cold (ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary qualities) and then they make celeſtial bodies obnoxious to generation and corruption; which they are not willing to grant. Although in this reſpect they need not fear the decay of the Sun, no more then of the globe of the earth: which though it ſuffer in his parts many altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet the whole remains firm and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, as Mr. Doctor <hi>Hakwell</hi> proves in his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed work upon that argument; and will ſo do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be diſſolved by that omnipotent power which framed it. <note place="margin">His Apology.</note> If they make this heat to come from the motion of the Sun, we muſt conſider how the Sun by motion may get ſuch a heat. The Sun is either moved by his own motion, or as he is carried in his Sphear wherein he is fixed. If by his own motion, it muſt be either by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation upon his <hi>axis,</hi> which is called <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63227:70"/>
at the ſiege of <hi>Scodra,</hi> of a bullet of twelve hundred weight called the Prince, and it ſeems a great matter. But to have ſuch a bullet as the globe of the Sun, which is held to be 166 times bigger then the globe of the earth, to be carried in a ſwifter courſe, and that perpetually, is a monſtrous, furious, and mad agitation, <hi>inſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motus,</hi> as one termeth it. The like may be ſaid of the motion of the Sphears: but I will leave the confutation of this to others. <note place="margin">Gilbertus de magnete lib. 6. Taurellus de primis rerum principiis. Conrad.

                  <p>Wherefore the beams of the Sun by their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt make this heat, by the collection a many beams together.

But no doubt the Sun by his light and beams do warm theſe inferiour parts, eſpecially where they have free paſſage, and reflection withall, and it is to be judged, that the heat not being eſſentially in the Sun, is an effect of the light by whoſe beams it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to us: So that where light is excluded,

For the heat in our bodies is continually fed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the Heart by his motion: that a Bathes hath no ſuch ſupply according to their doctrine, from any cauſe to make or continue this heat. And therefore the repelling of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours cannot make water hotter then it is: and being naturally cold, and without any heat
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63227:71"/>
where heat is not, how can it be pend in or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled? Again, in <hi>Hypocrates</hi> his example there is an <hi>interſtitium</hi> (our skin) between the fuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous vapours and the external air, which keep them from uniting: but in our Bathes there is nothing to hinder the meeting and conjunction of theſe qualities, and then the one muſt dull the other. Moreover, we ſee that any thing that is naturally cold, as Iron or a Stone, if it be made hot accidentally by fire or otherwiſe, it is ſooner cold in cold air, then in a warm place. So that the <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> doth rather diminiſh then increaſe the heat of it. Wherefore unleſs water were naturally hot, or the heat maintained by ſome continual cauſe, this <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> can do no good, but by his oppoſite quality would rather cool it. Nay heat it ſelf cannot make any thing more hot, unleſs it be greater then the heat of the thing it ſelf. But to aſcribe the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heat to cold, and ſo to make it the cauſe of his contrary, is againſt the law of Nature. No quality of it ſelf is increaſed by his contrary. It is true, that a pot of water ſet over the fire, will be ſooner hot, being covered, or otherwiſe the vapours kept in, then being open: but there muſt be fire then to heat it, and to continue the heat: otherwiſe the <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, unleſs it make it more cold, and congeal it into Ice, if the air ambient be more cold then the water.

                        </gap> Fire.</note> Fire is a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and the higheſt degree of heat, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt without a ſubject; for I define it to be <hi>intenſiſſimus color in corpore cremabili</hi>: The higheſt degree of heat in a combuſtible body: And it is received into his ſubject either by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation or coition, as when one candle lights another, or by motion, as colliſion, concuſſion, dilatation, compriſſion, putrefaction, fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, reflection, &amp;c. yet all motion doth not kindle fire although it heat; neither are all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances apt to be heated by motion. Air and water are rather colder by motion: but this rule holds in ſuch things as are apt to receive heat by motion, as ſolid ſubſtances, combuſtible ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c. And the heat of animals, vegetables, and minerals, which they have for their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nutrition, is from motion: although this heat is not in ſo high a degree as fire is, for then it would conſume them; but as the motion is moderate, and agreeable to each nature, ſo is the heat. This motion in natural things proceeds from their ſeeds, or forms, and may be called internal or natural. External motions are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent agitations, concuſſions, &amp;c. which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly kindle fire in apt matter. As for the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire, which ſhould be pure, not ſhining,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63227:73"/>
and therefore inviſible, and ſubſiſting without a ſubject or fewel: let them find it who know where to ſeek for it. For my part I know no element of fire, unleſs we ſhould make it to be that which is natural to all creatures and their ſeeds, cauſing their fermenting heat, whereof I ſhall ſpeak anon. And this interpretation we may well make of <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> where he faith, that all things are made of fire and water; and that theſe two are ſufficient for all generations; fire giving motion, and water nutrition. <note place="margin">D: ditca lib. 1.</note> And it is not likely that this fire ſhould be fetched from: a remote place, and downwards, againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fire, for every generation: but that it be near hand, and inbred in the ſeeds themſelves, as the principal ingredient into every natural thing; whereas if it were remote, what ſhould bring it continually, and unite it with the other elements in theſe generations? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is moſt likely to be the element of fire, Our burning fire is all of one nature, not differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in kind, but only in degree according to the quality of the fewel. Some fewels will make a manifeſt flame, as all thin and light ſubſtances, Sulphur, liquid Bitumen, Oyle, Fat, &amp;c. Some only a glowing coal, with little or no flame, as ſome forts of Stone-coal. Yet all fire doth ſend forth fuliginous vapours, which would choak it if there were not vent for them into the air: as we ſee in the making of Char-coal, although they cover their fire with lome, yet they muſt leave ſome vent for the ſmoke; though not ſo much as may make it to flame, yet enough to maintain the fire. Of the firſt flaming fort there
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63227:73"/>
are divers degrees, as that of Straw, Brimſtone, Spirit of Wine, Naphtha, Petroleum, &amp;c. Some of which will ſcarcely take hold upon other fewel: as one may wet a linnen cloath in Spirit of Wine, and being kindled, he ſhall hardly find the cloath ſcorched. The like hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in that exhalation which is called <hi>ignis ſatuus,</hi> being of a very thin ſubſtance, for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen or Naphtha. Some reckon Comets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe fiery exhalations: but I can hardly believe that they are any kindled ſubſtances. <note place="margin">Comets, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably not k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, becauſe if they be of a thin ſubſtance from Sulphur and Bitumen, the flame would be greater, ſeeing it muſt be plentiful, if it continue ſo long in burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as we find them to do. Or admit that this matter be kindled by ſucceſſion, yet it is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that it ſhould continue burning above a year together; as that Comet <hi>Xiphian,</hi> which laſted a whole year: Another, <hi>Anno</hi> 1572. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conſtellation of <hi>Caſſiopaea,</hi> laſted a year and a half, others ſix months, others three, &amp;c. If the Sulphurous or Bituminous matter be thick, it will melt in burning, and rain down Brimſtone and Bitumen upon us. Thirdly, if Comets were kindled ſubſtances, what enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment could they find above the Moon, and among the ſpheres, where they ſay no corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible or elementary ſubſtance can be indured. But many of our Comets have been obſerved to have been above the Moon, and ſome among the fixed Starrs, as hath been obſerved by <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> and <hi>Clavius</hi>: and upon due obſervation
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63227:73"/>
they could find ſome of them to admit no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralaxis, or diverſity of aſpect to any ſtar in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Climats.</p>
                  <p>This argumnnt may be good againſt a Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetick; but a Platoniſt, or a Pytnagorean, who hold the Heavens to be made of elementary matter, and ſubject to generation and corruption, will not allow it, no more will many of our Divines.</p>
                  <p>For glowing fires, we have none but they muſt be kindled, and then they muſt have vent for their fuliginous vapours, and they muſt be kindled either by propagation or coition from ſome other fire, or by violent motion able to kindle them, which we ſhall hardly find in the bowels of the earth, where all is quiet, and no ſpace for any ſuch perturbation.</p>
                  <p>But they ſay there is an <hi>ignis ſubterraneus,</hi> which being kindled upon Sulphur and Bitumen, diſperſeth it ſelf among other Mines of the like nature, and ſets them on fire.

                  <p>I hope none will think that I deny a Hell, but I approve not of the aſſignment of it to the center of the earth, or that that fire ſhould ſerve as <hi>Baccius</hi> would have it, to further all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the earth: and as others, to be the cauſe of Fountains, Winds, Earth-quakes, Vulcanoes, Storms, Saltneſs of the Sea, &amp;c. nor of the actual heat of our Bathes, although it be the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon received opinion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt for the place, it is not likely that the center of the earth, whither all heavy things do tend, ſhould be hollow, but rather more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact then any other part of the earth, as likewiſe <hi>Valeſius</hi> thinks; but if there be any concavities, they are between the Center and the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and theſe concavities being receptacles of water from the Sea, cannot alſo receive fire.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63227:75"/>
Theſe two will not agree together in one place, but the one will expel the other: for whereas ſome hold that Bitumen will burn in water, and is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by it, it is abſolutely falſe, as experience ſhews; and I have touched it among the <hi>Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, if the heat which warms our Bathes did proceed from hence, there muſt be huge veſſels above the fire to contain water, whereby the fire might heat it, and not be quenched by it. Alſo the vapours ariſing from hence, muſt be hotter then water can endure, or be capable of; for as they aſcend towards the ſuperficies of the earth, they muſt needs be cooled as they paſs by Rocks, or elſe they could not be congealed into water again: and after this congelation, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath loſt moſt of his heat, as we find in our ordinary diſtillations of Roſe-water, &amp;c. where we ſee our water to deſcend into the receive; almoſt cold; ſo that they cannot derive our hot Bathes from hence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the fire it ſelf, although water and air may be received into the bowels of the earth, yet there is great difficulty for fire. For the other two need no nouriſhment to ſupport them, as fire doth. If there be not competency of air to nouriſh the fire by venting his fuligious vapours, howſoever there be fewel enough, it is ſuddenly quenched, and ſuch huge and flaming fire as this muſt be, will require more air then can there be yielded: a great part thereof paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing away through the ſecret creeks of Rocks, and little or none entring through the Sea. And therefore daily experience ſhews, that our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63227:75"/>
men are fain to ſink new Shafts (as they call them) to admit air to their works, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their lights would go out. Although one would think, that where many men may have room enough to work, there would be ſpace enough for air to maintain a few lights. The like we ſee in Cupping-glaſſes, where the light goes out as ſoon as they are applied. Alſo there are no fires perpetual, as hot Bathes are, but are either extinct, or keep not the ſame te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. Wherefore fire cannot be the cauſe of this conſtant heat of Bathes. It muſt be a continual cauſe that can make a continual hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Alſo where fire is, there will be ſmoak, for as it breeds exhalations, ſo it ſends them forth. But in moſt of our hot Bathes we find none of theſe dry exhalations. Moreover, fire is more hardly pend in then air; yet we ſee that air doth break forth: wherefore fire ſhould alſo make his way, having fuel enough to maintain it. So they ſay it doth in our Vulcanoes at <hi>Hecla</hi> in <hi>Iſeland, AEtna</hi> in <hi>Sicicy, Veſuvio</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> in <hi>Enaria, AEolia, Lipara,</hi> &amp;c. But it is yet unproved that theſe eruptions of fire do proceed from any deep cauſe, but only are kindled upon or neer the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the earth, where there is air enough to feed it, and means enough to kindle it by lightnings, or other caſual means. Whereas in the bowels of the earth, there is neither air to nouriſh it, nor any means to kindle it; ſeeing neither the beams of the Sun, nor Wind, or other Exhalations, nor any Antiperiſtaſis, nor Lyme, nor Lightnings can do it. For the ſame reaſons that exclude the Beams of the Sun and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63227:76"/>
exhalations, will likewiſe exclude lightnings.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the fuel, there are only two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the bowels of the earth, which are apt fuels for fire, Bitumen and Sulphur. <note place="margin">Douatus de a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis Lucenſibus lib. 1. cap. 18.</note>

                  <p>Sulphur is in ſuch requeſt with all men, as they think there can be no not Bath without it: nay many hold, that if water do but paſs thorow a Mine of Brimſtone, although it be not kindled, but actually cold, yet it will contract from thence, not only a potential, but an actual heat. <note place="margin">Geſaer. Epiſt. lib. 3. pag. 90.</note> But we do manifeſtly find, that neither all hot waters are ſulphurous, nor all ſulphurous waters hot (as is ſaid before in Sulphur.)</p>
                  <p>The Bathes of <hi>Caldaneila</hi> and <hi>Avinian in agro Senenſi, de Grotta in Viterbio, de aquis in Piſano, Divi Johannis in agro Lacenſs, Balneum Geber ſuilleri in Halſatia, &amp;c.</hi> are all hot, and yet give no ſigne of Sulphur, either by ſmell, or taſte, or quality, or effect. Contrariwiſe that all ſulphurous waters are not hot, may appear by the Bathes in <hi>Zurich</hi> in <hi>Helvetia,</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi> in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> at <hi>Cure</hi> in <hi>Rhetia, Celenſes</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> In <hi>Campania</hi> between <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Pateolum,</hi> are many cold ſulphurous Springs.

And no marvel, for if we inſuſe any ſimple, be it never ſo hot potentially, yet it will not make the liquor actually hot. Wherefore this Sulphur muſt burn before it can give any actual heat to our Bathes; and then it muſt needs be ſubject to the former difficulties, and alſo muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually repaired by new generations of matter, which actual fire cannot further, but rather hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

                  <p>The like we may judge of Bitumen, that unleſs it be kindled, it can yield no heat to our Bathes; as <hi>Solinander</hi> reports of a Bituminous Mine in <hi>Weſtfalia, in agro Tremonenſi,</hi> where going down into the Grove, he found much water, having the ſmell, taſte, and colour of Bitumen, and yet cold. <hi>Agricola</hi> imputes the chief cauſe of the heating of Bathes, unto the fuel of Bitumen; <hi>Baccius</hi> on the other ſide to Sulphur.

                  <p>I have in the former Chapters ſet down mine opinion concerning the generation of minerals, that they have their ſeminaries in the earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with ſpirits, and faculties attending them; which meeting with convenient matter and adiuvant cauſes, do proceed to the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeveral ſpecies, according to the nature of the efficient, and aptnes of the matter. In
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63227:77"/>
this work of generation, as there is <hi>generatio uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> ſo there muſt be <hi>corruptio alterius.</hi> And this cannot be done without a ſuperiour power, which by moiſture, dilating it ſelf, worketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter, like a ferment to bring it to his own purpoſe. This motion between the agent ſpirit, and the patient matter, proceedeth from an actual heat (<hi>ex motu fit calor</hi>) which ſerves as an inſtrument to further this work. <note n="*" place="margin">What Dr. <hi>French</hi> hath ſaid againſt this opinion, may be ſeen if the 19, 20, &amp; 21. pages of his <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Spaw.</note> And this motion being natural and not violent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a natural heat which furthers generations; not a deſtructive heat. For as cold dulls and benumbs all faculties, ſo heat doth quicken them, This I ſhewed in the example of Malt. It is likewiſe true in every particular grain of Corn ſown in the ground, although by reaſon they lie ſingle, their actual heat is not diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by touch, yet we find that external heat and moiſture do further their ſpiring, as adiuvant cauſes; where the chief agent is the generative ſpirit in the ſeed. So I take it to be in minerals, with thoſe diſtinctions before mentioned. And in this all generations agree, that an actual heat, together with moiſture, is requiſite: otherwiſe there can neither be the corruption of the one, nor the generation of the other. This actual heat is leſs ſenſible in ſmall ſeeds and tender bodies, then it is in the great and plentifull ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and in hard and compact matter: for hard bodies are not ſo eaſily reduced to a new form, as tender bodies are; but require both more ſpirit and longer time to be wrought upon. And therefore whereas vegetable generations are brought to perfection in a few months, theſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63227:78"/>
mineral generations do require many years, as hath been obſerved by Mineral men.

As we ſee in the Iron Mines of <hi>Illua,</hi> the Tin Mines in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> the Lead Mines at <hi>Mendip,</hi> and the <hi>Peak,</hi> &amp;c. which do not only ſtretch further in extent of ground, than hath been obſerved heretofore; but alſo are renewed in the ſame groves which have been formerly wrought, as our Tinners in <hi>Cornwall</hi> do acknowledge; and the examples of <hi>Illua</hi> and <hi>Saga</hi> before mentioned, do confirm. This is a ſufficient means for the perpetuity of our hot Springs; that if the actual heat proceed from hence, there need be no doubt of the continuance of them, nor of their equal tenor or degree of heat.</p>
                  <p>Now for the nature of this heat, it is not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive heat, as that of fire is, but a generative heat joyned with moyſture. It needs no air for eventilation, as the other doth. It is in degree hot enough for the hotteſt Baths that are, if it be not too remote from the place where the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter iſſueth forth. It is a means to impart the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of minerals to our waters, as well as heat, by reaſon the minerals are then <hi>in ſolutis prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiis,</hi> in their liquid forms, and not conſolidated into hard bodies. For when they are conſolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there are few of them that will yield any quality to water, unleſs they be the concrete

juyces, or any actual heat, becauſe that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by the contiguity of bodies, when one part lyeth upon another, and not when they are grown <hi>in corpus continuum</hi>; as we ſee in Malt, where by turning and changing the contiguity, the heat is increaſed, but by ſuffering it to unite, is quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: But before conſolidation, any of them may yield either ſpirit or juyce, or tincture to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which by reaſon of their tenuity (as is ſaid before) are apt to imbibe them. Now if actual fire kindled in the earth, ſhould meet with theſe minerals whilſt they are in generation, it would diſſipate the ſpirits, and deſtroy the minerals. <note place="margin">Thurneiſer Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimia magna lib. 4.c.8.</note> If it meet with them after conſolidation, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to attenuate them ſo, as to make them yield their qualities to water. For we never find any metals or minerals melted in the earth, which muſt be, if the heat of actual fire were ſuch as is imagined: neither do we ever find any flores of metal ſublimed in the earth. This natural heat is daily found by our Mineral men in the Mines, ſo as oftentimes they are not able to touch them, as <hi>Agricola</hi> teſtifieth; although by opening their groves and admiſſion of air, it ſhould be well qualified. Whereas on the other ſide, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obſerved, that any actual kindled fire was ever ſeen by workmen in the earth, which were likely to be, if theſe fires were ſo frequent.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore ſeeing we ſee that Mineral waters do participate with all ſorts of Minerals, as well metals as other, as hath been ſhewed in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular examples of all of them: ſeeing alſo that few of them, unleſs Mineral juyces, are able to impart their quality to water, as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidated,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63227:79"/>
but only as they are in <hi>ſolutis principiis,</hi> and whilſt they are in generation, as is agreed upon by all Authors: ſeeing alſo this natural heat of fermentation muſt neceſſarily be preſent for the perfecting of their generation, and is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, in regard of the degree of heat to make our Baths as hot as they are: ſeeing alſo that the other adventitious fire would rather deſtroy theſe Minerals, than further them: ſeeing alſo we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine it either likely, or poſſible, without manifold difficulties and abſurdities: I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that both the actual heat of Baths, and the Mineral qualities which they have, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived unto them by means of this fermenting heat: <note n="*" place="margin">The cauſe of the heat in Bath, aſſigned by Dr. <hi>Rouzee,</hi> is their motion and agitation in the bowels of the Earth, falling from Cataracts and broken Concavities in the ſame.

                  <p>Vegetables have likewiſe their ſeaſons of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and planting, as they may have the earth and the ſeaſon moſt convenient: yet at any time, if their ſeeds get moyſture and heat to dilate them, they will ferment and attempt the production of more individuals: but oftentimes the Artiſt doth abuſe this intention of nature, and converts it to his ends: and oftentimes nature being ſet in action to proceed <hi>a potentia in actum,</hi> doth want convenient means to maintain her work: as when we ſee a Rick of Hay or Corn which hath received moyſture, burnt to aſhes.

It might ſave much fuel, and veſſel, and labour, and perhaps with advantage in the product. For I ſee but two points to be obſerved in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: the one is to extract the ſubſtance of the Malt into water: the other to give it his due fermentation. And both of theſe may be done without boyling. But the artifice will differ ſomewhat from Wine, and will require many concluſions to be tryed upon it, before it be brought to perfection. I do mention theſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices only to ſhew the power of this ſeminary and fermenting ſpirit, and how it may be drawn to other uſes for our benefit. As this is found in

vegetables, ſo likewiſe in Minerals; which as they have this generative ſpirit for the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſpecies, as hath been ſhewed before, ſo they have this means of fermentation, to bring them from a potential quality, to an actual exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence. And as their matter is more plentifull, and in conſiſtence more hard and compact; ſo theſe ſpirits muſt be more vigorous and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſubdue it: and conſequently the heat of their fermentation muſt be in a higher degree, then it is in other generations. <note place="margin">A brief col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the the Authors arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of others touching the actual heat of Bathes.</note>

                  <p>We muſt not imagine that the government and ordering of the world and nature in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe, is performed by miracle, but that natural effects have natural cauſes, and muſt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63227:81"/>
be both under the ſame <hi>genus.</hi> Wherefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ordinary diſtribution, ſeeing it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all, and not queſtioning the celeſtial bodies, whether they be elementary or no, that is, ſubject to alterations, as intention and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, generation and corruption, &amp;c. We ſay that this heat muſt proceed either from the ſuperiour and celeſtial bodies, as the Spheres and Starrs, or from the inferiour or ſublunary.</p>
                  <p>From the ſuperiour Spheres or Globes it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed, ſeeing (as is ſhewed before) they are neither indowed with ſuch a degree of native heat, nor can acquire it accidentally by their motion, being thin and liquid bodies; neither, if they had it, can they convey it unto the earth, but by their beams, which are not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it as they paſs thorow the cold region of the air, nor able to warm that, although it be nearer to their fountain of heat. Wherefore if theſe beams can any way do it, it muſt be by their motion and reflection upon the earth: and this is no conſtant heat, but varieth according as the beams are perpendicular or oblique, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the air is cleer or cloudy, &amp;c.. And as they are not able to give this conſtant heat, ſo the earth in her bowels is not capable to receive it, being hindered by the denſity of the earth and rocks, and the heat of reflection taken away before it can come three foot deep.</p>
                  <p>From the inferiour parts of the world if it proceed, it muſt be either from the Elements, or from mixt bodies. From the Elements it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come, but from fire; for all the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are cold, as I have ſhewed, eſpecially the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63227:81"/>
earth where this heat is ingendred.</p>
                  <p>And as for the Element of Fire, ſeeing we know not where to find it, neither, if it be any where, doth it perform the office of an Element in production and nutrition of creatures; as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> faith, <hi>Ignis nil generat,</hi> and therefore <hi>nil nutrit; <note place="margin">3. De gen. ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</note> nam nutritio fit ex iiſdem ex quibus conſtat</hi>: therefore as it begets nothing, ſo it nouriſheth nothing; and ſo cannot be an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor as an Element maintain this heat of Bathes. <note place="margin">2. De gen. ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, cap. 3.</note> But contrariwiſe if it have no power of begetting or nouriſhing any thing, it muſt have a power of deſtroying or hindering nature in her proceedings; for nature will admit of no <hi>vacuum</hi> or idle thing. Alſo ſeeing Nature uſeth no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means to maintain her ſelf, this elementary fire cannot be pen'd in the center of the earth, being of a thin ſubtilnature, and naturally aſpiring upwards: and if it have any place aſſigned unto it, it muſt be above the other Elements, and then it cannot be drawn downwards againſt his nature, and that continually, without breach of the order and courſe of nature. And whereas they place the Element of Fire under the concave of the Moon, being in it ſelf lucid and reſplendent, it is ſtrange that it is not ſeen by us, neither makes our nights light. For although by reaſon of his tranſparency it doth not terminate our ſight, yet it ſhould remove the obſcurity of our nights much better then the <hi>Via lactea.</hi> Moreover, if it were there, we muſt ſee the Starrs through a double <hi>Diaphanum,</hi> one of air, and another of fire, and ſo would make a double refraction: which is elegantly confuted by <hi>John Pena</hi> and <hi>Conr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But there is another thing ſubſtituted in the place of this element of fire, and maintained by air, and by mineral ſubſtances in the earth; which is neither an Element, nor a mixt body, nor any ſubſtance at all, but a meer quality: and this is preferred by moſt to be the cauſe of the heat of our Bathes. And this is our common kitchin-fire, which is kindled by violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, maintained by ſervel, without which it cannot ſubſiſt, and extinguiſhed by his contrary. And although it may be derived by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or coition, as one candle lights another, yet originally it is kindled by violent motion, and what violent motion can there be in the bowels of the earth to ſtrike fire, or who ſhall be the fueller? Exhalations and lightnings cannot do it, being aereal meteors, and no more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable then the beams of the Sun. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although they may kindle a Vulcano upon the ſurface of the earth, yet they cannot pierce deep, and their very reflection upon the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the earth takes away their ſtrength: ſo as they can neither kindle new fire, nor commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that which is kindled to any other fuel. For if it be by communication or coition, that muſt be by touch, <hi>per contactum,</hi> and then in the earth it can make but one fire, and not many, being not diſtinct in place, and muſt increaſe in heat: and then it will not keep a conſtant tenor, as our Bathes do.</p>
                  <p>Secondly for the nouriſhment of it, being a quality, it muſt have a ſubject, that is fuel, and it muſt have means to vent the fuliginous vapours which it breeds in the diſſolution of the fuel, leſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63227:82"/>
they recoyle and quench the fire; as alſo there muſt be conveyance for the aſhes which will fall down continually upon the fire, and quench it. Moreover, by conſuming ſuch great quantities of Sulphur and Bitumen, and by mollifying and breaking of Rocks, it would cauſe a great ſinking of the earth in thoſe places; as we ſee in our Vulcanoes, where whole mountains have been conſumed and brought to even ground.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this fire being a quality, is ſubject to intention and remiſſion, and to utter extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only by want of fuel, which cannot be regenerated where this actual fire is, nor for want of vent, or choaking of aſhes, &amp;c. but alſo by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the abundance of water which the earth receiveth for the generations of Minerals, which being oppoſite to fire, would quench it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot rely upon any ſubterranean fire for the maintenance of our hot Bathes.</p>
                  <p>From the air this heat of Bathes cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, ſeeing it is neither hot in it ſelf, as hath been proved, nor can get any heat by motion, being of a thin liquid ſubſtance, which no attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or colliſion can make hot. And as for aereal meteors, bred from exhalations, and kindled, as is imagined, by an Antiperiſtaſis: if they be bred in the air, they are not able to penetrate into the bowels of the earth, as hath been ſaid before: if in the earth, beſides the difficulty of finding room enough for ſuch plentiful exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as thoſe muſt be which procure lightning and thunder, and the vanity of their Antiperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis to kindle theſe exhalations, as hath been ſhe wed before; it is a ſufficient refutation to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63227:83"/>
take away the ſubject of the queſtion, that is, all ſubterranean fire, as I hope I have done; and then we need not diſpute about the means of kindling it, &amp;c. theſe momentary meteors being produced only to kindle, and not to maintain this fire.</p>
                  <p>From the water no man will derive this fire, being a cold and moiſt Element, and apt to quench it; unleſs it be by dilating the ſeminary ſpirits of natural ſpecies; and then they concur with us, and renouncing the actual fire, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our heat of fermentation.</p>
                  <p>From the earth ſome have imagined an inbred heat, <hi>ingenitum terrae calorem,</hi> whereby it ſeems they had ſome glimmering of this light which we have given, but have left it in as great obſcurity as the Antipenſtaſis or Antipathy; and earth being a cold and dry Element, cannot be the cauſe of this heat, as it is earth.</p>
                  <p>So as it is manifeſt that naturally the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot procure this heat of Bathes; and by violent motion they can do as little. For the earth being immovable, cannot be ſtirred by any violent motion; and the other three Elements, as Fire, Air, and Water, being thin and liquid ſubſtances, can procure no heat by any motion or colliſion either upon themſelves, or upon the earth; eſpecially in the bowels of the earth, where all is quiet, and no room or ſcope for any ſuch motion as this muſt be. So that neither the other three Elements, nor the earth, either in the whole, or in the parts, can be the cauſe hereof by any violent motion.</p>
                  <p>From mixt bodies if this heat come, it muſt be
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63227:83"/>
from animals, vegetables, or minerals. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are not ſo plentiful in the earth as to cauſe this heat of Bathes, either alive or dead. We read of ſubterranean animals which have both motion, and ſenſe, and underſtanding, in <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius in ſpeculo naturali</hi>; in <hi>Lactantius</hi>; in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola, de animantibus ſubterraneis</hi>; in <hi>Bellonius, Ortelius, Paracelſus,</hi> &amp;c. who calls them <hi>Gnomi,</hi> the <hi>Germanes Bergmaenlin,</hi> the <hi>French Rabat,</hi> the <hi>Corniſh-men Fairies.</hi> The <hi>Danes</hi> are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally perſwaded that there are ſuch creatures. But if any ſuch living creatures be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this heat, it cannot be by their hot comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xions, but it muſt be by violence and ſtriking of fire. Perhaps <hi>Democritus</hi> hath hired them to make his lyme there, or ſome other to erect for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for thunder, lightning, and ſuch like fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works.

For although metals are not frequent in ſome places, or at the leaſt not diſcovered; yet a man ſhall hardly dig ten foot deep in any place, but he ſhall find rocks of ſtone, which have their generation as well as other minerals, or ſome of the Salts, or <hi>Bitumina,</hi> or Spirits, or mean me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, &amp;c. And how can Bathes receive mineral qualities, but from minerals? Therefore where Bathes are, there muſt be Minerals, although where Minerals are, there are not always Bathes, But perhaps they are not ſo accumulated, as by their contiguity they are able to yield any mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt heat; their matter being diſperſed as grains of corn ſown in a field, which by reaſon of their lying ſingle, do not ſhew a ſenſible heat in their fermentation; or moſt metals breeding between a Hanger and a Lieger, which <hi>Agricola</hi> calls <hi>pendens</hi> and <hi>jacens,</hi> are ſeldome above a foot thick, and therefore cannot yield much heat to our waters. And this is the cauſe why we have ſo few Bathes from Gold, Silver, Tin, Lead, &amp;c. But where much matter is accumulated together, the very contiguity (one part lying upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) will make a manifeſt heat, untill it grow to a <hi>corpus continuum,</hi> when the generation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and then the heat is extinguished, Or perhaps they have not water ſo plentifull as may yield a living ſpring, although they may have ſufficient for the uſe of their generation. Or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63227:84"/>
where they break forth, they meet with deſart ſands, as in <hi>Arabia, China, Africa,</hi> &amp;c. Which drink up the water, and hinder the eruption of it. And whereas there are ſome hot ſprings found which do not ſhew any mineral quality in them, the reaſon of this may be the want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete juice, which, as I have ſaid before, is the <hi>medium</hi> of communicating mineral qualities and ſubſtances with water. For without them, water is as unapt to imbibe minerals, as it is to unite with oyle. So as water may of it ſelf receive actual heat from the fermentation of minerals, but not their qualities, without the mediation of ſome of the concrete juices: as contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we find ſome Fouutains that receive mineral qualities, and yet are cold: whereof I have given many examples. The reaſon whereof is either for that they have paſſed a long way, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Meanders from the place of generation to the place of their eruption, and ſo have loſt their heat; or elſe the concrete juices, which will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve in water without any heat, being impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with other minerals, do impart them to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and yet without heat. But to ſay that there is any earth without mineral ſeeds, is to make a <hi>vacuum in rerum natura,</hi> and to deſtroy the uſe of the Elements. It is true that the ſeeds do do not alwaies meet with opportunity to diſplay themſelves, and ſometimes they are fain to ſerve under other colours, which are more predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: but there is no part of the earth without ſome ſeeds or other.</p>
                  <p>And from hence we muſt derive the original of the actual heat of Bathes: for nothing elſe in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63227:85"/>
the world will ſerve our turn to procure ſo laſting and ſo uniform a heat unto them; and that not by kindling any actual fire about them, for moſt of our minerals whereof our Bathes conſiſt, and from whence they receive both their actual heat and virtues, will not burn, neither have any actual heat in themſelves, being all cold to the touch, but receive it by a fermenting heat which they have in their generation: without which there is no generation for any thing. And this heat continues ſo long as the work of generation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues: which being once begun, doth not ceaſe in many ages, by reaſon of the plenty of matter which the earth yields, and the firmneſs and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity thereof. And although after that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals have attained to their perfection, this heat ceaſeth, yet the generation extends further then where it firſt began, and enlargeth it ſelf every way, the works of nature being circular: ſo as the water which was heated by the firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, cannot avoid the other ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, but muſt meet with them either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind or before, beneath or above, on the one ſide, or on the other (eſpecially ſeeing no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration can proceed without water:) and yet keeps the ſame tenor and degree of heat, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of the minerals fermenting, and to the diſtance from the place of eruption. And this is a far more probable cauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of our Bathes, then any ſubterranean deſtructive fire can be, or any other of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed cauſes can yield. I do not deny but that hot Bathes may ceaſe and become cold; as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſaith of Salt Fountains which are cold, <note place="margin">2 Meteorol.c.2;</note> that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63227:85"/>
they were once hot, before the original of their heat was extinct: which I interpret to be when the work of generation ceaſed, and the Salt brought to his perfection. But I do not read of any hot Bathes that have ceaſed: unleſs near onto ſome Vulcano, where either the ſinking of Rocks hath altered the courſe of them, as at <hi>Tripergula</hi> and <hi>Baia,</hi> or the flaming fire which heated them at their eruption being extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in the <hi>AEolian</hi> Iſlands. Theſe Vulcanoes are far more ſubject to decay then our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative heat, becauſe they conſume their fuel; this doth not, but increaſeth it daily, <hi>vireſque acquirit eundo.</hi> Of the other <hi>Ovid</hi> ſaith,

                  <p>This I hope is ſuſficient for the confuting of other opinions, and the clearing of mine own from all abſurdities concerning the degree of heat, which is as much as the nature of water can endure without utter diſſipation: concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the equal tenor of the heat, the duration of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, the participation of mineral qualities, &amp;c. The other kind of confirmation which we call Apodeictical, is alſo here and there diſperſed in this Diſcourſe: as that all minerals have their continual generation: that this generation is not without heat and moyſture, which do neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly  attend all generations: that few mineral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances or qualities can be imparted to water, but whilſt they are in generation, and yet we find them much impregnated with them: that our Miners do find an actual heat, and in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, in the digging of Minerals, where the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation is not throughly extinct: that we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the like courſe of nature in the generations of animals and vegetables: that we are led to the acknowledgement hereof by many artificial concluſions and artifices, &amp;c. Wherefore I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to make any larger repetition hereof.</p>
                  <p>And this is in brief (though plainly deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) my opinion concerning the actual heat of Baths, and of the mineral qualities which we find in them; which I refer to the cenſures of thoſe that be learned.</p>
                  <p>There are two other motions which reſemble this fermentation: The one is <hi>Motus dilatationis,</hi>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:63227:87"/>
the Other <hi>Antipatheticus. Motus dilatationis</hi> is evident in Lime, in Allum, in Copperaſs, and other concrete juyces, whereby the affuſion of water, the Salt in the Lime, or the concrete juyces being ſuddenly diſſolved, there is by this motion, an actual heat procured for a time, able to kindle any combuſtible matter put to it.</p>
                  <p>The like we obſerve in those ſtone Coals, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led metal Coals, which are mixed with a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſit containing ſome mineral juyce, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving moyſture, doth dilate it ſelf, and grows ſo hot, as oftentimes great heaps of thoſe Coals are kindled thereby, and burnt before their time; as hath been ſeen at <hi>Puddle-Wharf</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and at <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> But this is much different from out fermentation.</p>
                  <p>Another <hi>Motus</hi> reſembling this fermentation, is that which is attributed to Antipathy, when diſagreeing ſubſtances being put together, do fight, and make a manifeſt actual heat; as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony and Sublimat, oyle of Vitriol and oyle of Tartar, Allum liquor and Urine, Lees, Chalk, &amp;c. But the reaſon of this diſagreement is in their Salts, whereof one is aſtringent, the other relaxing; the one of eaſie diſſolution in water, the other of hard diſſolution, &amp;c. where one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral hinders the diſſolution or congelation of another; and not by reaſon of any antipathy: for it is not likely that nature would produce two contrary ſubſtances mixed like atomes in o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſubject, but that in their very generations the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> would be an impediment to the other. So in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables where one plant ſucks away the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from another, we call it antipathy. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:63227:87"/>
if we examine aright what this ſympathy and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy is, we ſhall find it to be nothing but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of ignorance, when not being able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the true reaſons of ſuch actions &amp; paſſions in natural things, we fly ſometimes to indefinite generalities, and ſometimes to this inexplicable ſympathy and antipathy; attributing voluntary, and ſenſitive actions and paſſions to inſenſible ſubſtances. This <hi>motus</hi> alſo is much different from fermentation, as may eaſily appear by the former deſcription. And thus much for this point of fermentation, which I hope will give better ſatisfaction then any of the former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE nature of minerals and their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being handled, and from thence the reaſons drawn, both of the actual heat of Bathes, and of their qualities: Now it is fit we ſhould ſeek out ſome means how to diſcover what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals are in any Bath, that thereby we may the better know their qualities, and what uſe to make of them for our benefit. Many have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted this diſcovery, but by ſuch weak means, and upon ſuch poor grounds, as it is no marvail if they have failed of their purpoſe: for they have contented themſelves with a bare diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or evaporation of the water, and obſerving
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63227:88"/>
the ſediment, have thereby judged of the mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, unleſs perhaps they find ſome manifeſt taſte, or ſmell, or colour in the water, or ſome unctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter ſwimming above it. Some deſire no other argument of Sulphur and Bitumen, but the actual heat: as though no other minerals could yield an actual heat, but thoſe two: But this point requires better conſideration; and I have been ſo large in deſcribing the natures and generations of minerals, becauſe without it, we cannot diſcern what minerals we have in our waters, nor judge of the qualities and uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>Our Minerals therefore, are either confuſed or mixed with the water. If they be confuſed they are eaſily diſcerned: for they make the water thick and pudly, and will either ſwim above, as Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will do, or ſink to the bottom, as Earth, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and ſome terreſtrial juices; for no confuſed water will remain long unſeparated. If they are perfectly mixed with the water, then their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is either corporal, where the very body of the Mineral is imbibed in the water, or ſpiritual, where either ſome exhalation, or ſpirit, or tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is imparted to the water.</p>
                  <p>Corporally there are no minerals mixed with water, but juices, either liquid, as <hi>ſuccus la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcens, metallificus,</hi> &amp;c. before they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly congealed into their natural conſiſtence, or concrete, as Salt, Nitre, Vitriol, and Allum, theſe concrete juices do not diſſolve themſelves in water, but oftentimes bring with them ſome tincture or ſpirit from other Minerals. For as water is apt to recive juices, and tinctures, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63227:88"/>
ſpirits from animals, and vegetables; ſo are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete juices, being diſſolved, apt to extract tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and ſpirits from minerals, and to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them with water. And there are no Mines, but have ſome of theſe concrete juices in them, to diſſolve the materials of them, for their better union and mixture: and there are few minerals or metals, but have ſome of them incorporated with them; as we ſee in Iron, and Copper, and Tin, and Lead, &amp;c. And this is the reaſon that water being long kept in Veſſels of any of theſe metals, will receive a taſte or ſmell from them, eſpecially if it be attenuated, either by heat, or by addition of ſome ſour juice; and yet more, if the metals be fyled into powder as we ſee in making Chalibeat Wine, or Sugar of Lead, or Puttie from Tin, or Verdegreaſe from Copper. There may be alſo a mixture of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Subſtance from minerals, whilſt they are in generation, and <hi>in Solutis Principiis</hi>: the water paſſing through them, and the rather if it be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hot, for then it is more apt to imbibe it, and will contain more in it, being attenuated by heat, then being cold; as we ſee in Urins, which though they be full of humours, yet make no great ſhew of them ſo long as they are warm, but being cold, do ſettle then to the bottom.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſpiritual ſubſtances are hardly diſcerned in our Bathes, but by the effects; for they leave no reſidence after evaporation; and are commonly as volatile in ſublimation as the water it ſelf: neither do they increaſe the weight of the water, nor much alter the taſte or ſmell of them, unleſs they be very plentiful. Wherefore we have no
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63227:89"/>
certain way to diſcover them, but by the effects. We may conjecture ſomewhat of them by the Mines which are found near unto the Bathes, and by the mud which is brought with the water. But that may deceive, as coming from the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages through which the water is conveyed, or, perhaps, from the ſweat and ſtrigments of mens bodies which bathe in them. The corporal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are found, either by ſublimation or by precipitation, By ſublimation, when being brought to the ſtate of congelation, and ſticks of Wood put into it, within a few dayes, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete juices will ſhoot upon the wood; in Needles, if it be Nitre; in Squares, if be Salt; and in Clods and Lumps, if it be Allum or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraſs, and the other mineral ſubſtances which the waters have received, will either incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a tincture with them, or if it be more terr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this is of two ſorts: either Salts, as Tartar, Soap-aſhes, Kelps, Urine, &amp;c. Or four juices as Vinegar, Lemons, oyle of Vitriol, Sulphur, &amp;c. In which I have obſerved that the Salts are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to blew colours, and the other to red; for example, take a piece of Scarlet cloath, and wet it in oyle of Tartar (the ſtrongeſt of that kind) and it preſently becomes blew: dip it again in oyle of Vitriol, and it becomes red again. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Heating waters are good for cold affects of the Stomach, Bowels, Womb, Seminary Veſſels, cold diſtillations, Palſies, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond qualities, cleanſing waters are good in all Ulcers, eſpecially of the Guts.</p>

                  <p>Aſtringent waters, for all Fluxes, &amp;c. and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe waters are uſed either inwardly or outwardly.</p>
                  <p>Inwardly, either by mouth, or by injection.</p>

For as it is not enough for a man to get a good Damaſco or Bilbo-blade to defend himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, unleſs he learn the right uſe of it from a Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; ſo it is not enough to get a medicine and remedy for any diſeaſe, unleſs it be rightly uſed, and this right uſe muſt come from the Phyſitian, who knows how to apply it, and how to prepare the body for it, what to add and joyn with it, how to govern and order the uſe of it, how to prevent ſuch inconveniences as may happen by it, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, where we ſpeak of any Mineral water, or of any other medicine that is proper for ſuch and ſuch a grief, we muſt be ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the medicine is not wiſe enough to cure the diſeaſe of it ſelf, no more than a ſword is able of it ſelf to defend a man, or to offend his enemie, but according to the right and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full uſe of it.

It is true, that we have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rules to guide us in the cure of diſeaſes, which are very true and certain; yet when we come to apply them to particular perſons, and ſeveral conſtitutions, theſe general rules are not ſufficient to make a cure, but it muſt be varied according to ſubſtance. Hereupon we daily find, that thoſe patients which think to cure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, out of a little reading of ſome rules or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, are oftentimes dangerouſly deceived. And this is enough to intimate generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the uſes of our Mineral waters.</p>
                  <p>Inwardly we find great and profitable uſe of ſuch waters as proceed from Nitre, Allum, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, Sulphur, Bitumen, Iron, Copper, &amp;c. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples whereof I have ſet down before in the ſeveral Minerals, referring the particular uſes of each to ſuch Authors as have purpoſely deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed them.</p>
                  <p>My intent is chiefly to apply my ſelf to thoſe Baths of <hi>Bath</hi> in <hi>Summerſet-ſhire</hi>; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, as I judge, principally of Bitumen, with Nitre, and ſome Sulphur, I hold to be of great uſe both inwardly and outwardly. <note place="margin">Baths of Bath conſiſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally of Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men With Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and ſome Sulphur.</note> And I am ſorry that I dare not commend the inward uſe of them as they deſerve, in regard I can hardly be perſwaded that we have the water pure, as the ſprings yield them, but do fear, leſt where we take them, they may be mixt with the water of the Bath. If this doubt were cleared, I ſhould
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:63227:91"/>
not doubt to commend them inwardly, to hear, dry, mollifie, diſcuſs, glutinate, diſſolve, open obſtractions, cleanſe the kidneys and bladder, eaſe cholicks, comfort the matrix, mitigate fits of the mother, help barrenneſs proceeding from cold humors, &amp;c. as <hi>Tabernomoutanus</hi> affirms of other Bituminous Baths. <note place="margin">Theſauri aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii pag.cap. 40.</note> Alſo in regard of the Nitre, they cut and diſſolve groſs humors, and cleanſe by urine. In regard of the Sulphur, they dry and reſolve, and mollifie, and attract, and are eſpecially good for uterine affects proceeding from cold and windy humours.</p>
                  <p>And I would wiſh theſe waters to be drunk hot as they are, for better penetration, and leſs offence to the ſtomach. The antient Grecians and Romans did drink moſt of their water and wine hot, as we find in many Authors, which <hi>Salmuth</hi> hath diligently collected: and <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Percius</hi> hath purpoſely written a book of it, entitaled <hi>Dei bever caldo caſtumato da gli Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi.</hi>

                     <hi>Verulamius</hi> doth marvel that it is ſo much grown out of uſe, and adviſeth to drink our firſt draught at our meals, hot. There is great reaſon for it, both for preſervation of health, and for cure of many diſeaſes. The ſtomach being a nervous part, muſt needs be offended by that which is actually cold: and being the ſeat of natural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, <note place="margin">Warm drink commended.</note> and of the firſt concoction (whoſe errors and defects are not amended in the other conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions) had need to be preſerved in his native

vigour and ſtrength, that it may breed good nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment for the whole body. But the much uſe of cold drink, although it ſeem to refreſh us for the preſent, by dulling the appetite and the ſenſe of thirſt and hunger, as a ſtupefictive narcotick will do: yet it deſtroys the faculties of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which are maintained and quickned by heat: and thereby breeds crudities in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, from whence many diſeaſes proceed. The <hi>Eaſt-Indans</hi> are ſeldome troubled with the Stone or the Gout, and it is imputed to their warm drink: the like we may judge of obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cholicks, dropſies, rheumes, coughs, hoarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, diſeaſes in the throat and lungs, &amp;c. in which caſes, and many more which proceed from ill concoction and crudity of humors, no doubt it is an excellent preſervative to drink our drink warm. <note place="margin">I.W.</note> I know a worthy Gentleman of excellent parts, who in his travels obſerved the benefit hereof, and for many years hath uſed to take his drink hot: and being now above 80 years old, enjoyeth his health of body, and vigour of ſpirits, beyond the ordinary courſe of men of his age.

                  <p>Our Bath Guides do uſually command the drinking of this water with ſalt to purge the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, perſwading the people that the <hi>Bath-</hi>water hath a purging quality in it, when as the ſame proportion of ſpring-water, with the like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſalt will do the like. Our Baths have true virtues to commend them, ſo as we need not ſeek to get credit or grace unto them by falſe ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions. The Bitumen and Nitre which is in them, although it ſerves well for an alterative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, yet it is not ſufficient for an evacuative: and therefore we muſt attribute this purgative quality, either to the great quantity of water which they drink (and ſo it works)<hi> ratione pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deris</hi>) or unto the ſtimulation of ſalt which is diſſolved in it, or unto both together. Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſalt hath a ſtimulating quality, as is ſhewed before, Chap. 7. and <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſaith that it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth much. <hi>Bulcaſis</hi> gives it to that purpoſe from 3 <hi>ij</hi> to 3 <hi>iiij.</hi> Meſue alſo preſcribes it to purge groſs humors, and ſo doth <hi>Avicen.</hi> Wherefore there is no doubt but ſalt will purge of it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolved in our <hi>Bath-</hi>water. <note place="margin">Simpl.cap. 16. lib.5. ſum 1. tract.4. ſ lib. 2. tract.3. cap. 624.</note> But I ſhould like much better to diſſolve in it ſome appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſyrup or other purgative, for this purpoſe, as Manna, Tartar, Elaterium, ſyrups of Roſes, of Cichory, with Rhubarb, Auguſtanus; or to

                  <p>Inwardly alſo <hi>Bath</hi>-waters are uſed, for Broths, Beer, Juleps, &amp;c. although ſome do miſlike it, becauſe they will not mix medicaments with ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: wreſting a text in <hi>Hypocr.</hi> to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <note place="margin">Baccius lib. 2.

                  <p>OUtwardly our Bath-waters are principally uſed, becauſe they are moſt properly for ſuch affects as are in the habit of the body, and out of the veins: as Palſies, Contractions, Rheums, cold Tumors, affects of the skin, aches, &amp;c. And in theſe caſes, we uſe not only the water, but alſo the mud, and in ſome places the upour.</p>
                  <p>The water is uſed both for his actual and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential heat, as alſo for the ſecond qualities of mollifying, diſcuſſing, cleanſing, reſolving, &amp;c. which the minerals give unto it.

But we have no certain record hereof. It is enough that we can ſhew the uſe of them for 400 years, and that at this day they are as powerful as ever they were: <hi>Cambden</hi> gives them a more antient date from <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and <hi>Antonine,</hi> and the <hi>Saxons</hi>: and ſaith they were called <hi>Aquae Solis,</hi> and by the <hi>Saxons, Akmancheſter,</hi> that is, the town of ſick people, and dedicated to <hi>Minerva,</hi> as <hi>Solinus</hi> faith. The opinion that the Bathes were made by Art, is too ſimple for any wiſe man to believe, or for me to confute: And <hi>Necham</hi> in his Verſes which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after thoſe I have mentioned, doth hold it a ſigment: you may ſee them in <hi>Cambden.</hi> We have them for their uſe in bathing, diſtinguiſhed into four ſeveral Bathes, whereof three have been antiently; namely the KingsBath, the Hot Bath and the Croſs Bath. The Queens Bath was taken from the Springs of the Kings Bath, that being farther off, from the hot Springs, it might
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63227:94"/>

We find little difference in the nature of theſe Bathes, but in the degree of heat, proceeding no doubt, from one and the ſame Mine. Yet as the Mine may be hotter in one p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Some little difference alſo we find among them, that one is more cleanſing then another, by reaſon (is I take it) of more Nitre. For in the croſs Bath we find that our fingers ends will ſhrink and ſhrivel, as if we had waſhed in Soap-water, more then in the other Bathes.

in the other: the Queens Bath is the hotter of the two, but temperate enough for moſt bodies. The Croſs Bath is the coldeſt of all, as having but few Springs to feed it: yet we obſerve it to ſupple, and mollifie more then the reſt, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are able to ſtay longer in it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as I ſaid before) it ſeems to participate more with Nitre, then the reſt, which doth cleanſe better, and gives more penetration to the other Minerals. Wherefore in contractions, Epilepſies, Uterin affects, Convulſions, Cramps, &amp;c. This Bath is very uſeful, as alſo in cutaneal diſeaſes, as Morphews, Itch, &amp;c.

remembrance. The like alſo I procured to be done at the other Bathes, although that of the CroſsBath is not ſo uſeful, by reaſon it wants heat, unleſs for yong Children. Alſo we have a Pump out of the hot Bath, which we call the dry Pump, where one may ſit in a Chair in his Cloaths, and have his Head, or Foot, or Knee pumped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heating the reſt of the body in the Bath; and deviſed chiefly for ſuch as have hot Kidneys, or ſome other infirmities which the Bath might hurt. This we find very uſefull in Rheums, and cold Brains, and in Aches and Tumors in the Feet. For theſe Pumps we are beholding unto the late Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and to Mr. <hi>Hugh May,</hi> who upon my perſwaſions were contented to be at the charge of them. It were to be wiſhed that ſome well diſpoſed to the publick good, would erect the like at the Kings Bath; <note n="†" place="margin">This is now done, and a dry Pump there erected in the year 1661. at the City charge, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of Mr. <hi>Iohn Ford,</hi> Apothecary, then Mayor of the City.</note> where, perhaps, it might be more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for many, in regard of the greater heat which thoſe ſprings have.</p>

In divers other places either the ſprings ariſe a good diſtance from the bathing places, or elſe there be other eruptions from whence it may be taken.

rather does hurt then good. Wherefore it were better for us, to uſe artificial lutes, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients did, of Clay, Sulphur, Bitumen, Nitre, Salt, &amp;c. or unguents of the ſame nature, as that which they call Ceroma. But the beſt way is to referr the election of theſe remedies to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Phyſitian, who will fit them according to the nature of the grief.</p>

                  <p>TO come more particularly to the uſe of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, we muſt underſtand, that there are many mineral waters fit for bathing, which are not fit to drink: as thoſe which participate with Lead, Quickſilver, Gypſum, Cadmia, Arſenick, &amp;c. Alſo thoſe that contain liquid Bitumen, are thought to relax too much: but thoſe that proceed from dry Bitumen are permitted, and preſcribed in potion by <hi>Paulus AEgineta,</hi> and <hi>Trallian</hi>: Sulphur alſo is queſtioned , Whether it be fit to be taken inwardly by Potion, becauſe it relaxeth the ſtomach, and therefore <hi>Aetius</hi> forbids it: yet <hi>Trallian</hi> allows it, and ſo do others, if the Sulphur be not predominant. <note place="margin">1 Tetrah. ſerm. 3 cap. 167.

And whereas <hi>Oribaſius, AEgineta, Actuarius, &amp;c.</hi> are ſuſpitious of Sulphur and Bitumen for the head: <note place="margin">Orib.l. 10.c.3. AEgin.l.1.c.52.

The other parts of Sulphur are hot and dry, and very unctuous. As for Nitre, it cleanſeth, purgeth both by ſtool and urine, and helpeth the incorporation of the other Minerals with the water, and qualifies the heat of them, and gives them better penetration

into our bodies. In regard of theſe Minerals, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the actual heat, we find that the bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our <hi>Baths</hi> doth warm the whole habit of the body, attenuate humors, open the pores, procure ſweat, move urine, cleanſe the matrix, provoke womens evacuations, dry up unnatural humors, ſtrengthen parts weakned, comfort the nerves, and all neutrous parts, cleanſe the skin, and ſuck out all ſalt humours from thence, open obſtructions, if they be not too much impacted, caſe pains of the joynts and nerves and muſcles, mollifie and diſcuſs hard tumors, &amp;c.

And whereas without the help of ſuch Baths, theſe diſeaſes could not be cured without tormenting the body, either by fire, of lancing, or cauſticks, or long dyets, or bitter and ungrateful medicines, &amp;c. In this courſe of bathing, all is pleaſant and comfortable, and more effectual than the other courſes, and therefore it is commonly the laſt refuge in theſe caſes, when all other means fail. I will not undertake to reckon up all the benefits which our Baths do

                     <p>The manner of bathing, chiefly referred to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection and ordering of a Phyſitian. Yet ſome particulars touched concerning the government of the patient in and after bathing; the time of day, of ſtaying in the <hi>Bath,</hi> of continuing the uſe of it, The time of the year. Of covering the <hi>Baths.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NOw for the manner of bathing, I will not ſet down what the Phyſitian is to do, but leave that to his judgement and diſcretion : but what is fit for the patient to know: for there are many cautions and obſervations in the uſe of bathing, drawn from the particular conſtitutions of bodies; from the complication of diſeaſes, and from many other circumſtances which cannot be comprehended in general rules, or applyed to all bodies alike: but many times upon the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:63227:98"/>
and the appearing of accidents, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian muſt <hi>exre nat a capere conſilium,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps alter his intended courſe, and perhaps change the <hi>Bath</hi> either to a hotter or cooler, &amp;c. In which reſpect, thoſe patients are ill adviſed which will venture without their Phyſitian upon any particular Bath, or to direct themſelves in the uſe of it: And this is a great cauſe that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny go away from hence without benefit, and then they are apt to complain of our Baths, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme this great bleſſing of God beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
                  <p>It is fit for the patient when he goeth into the <hi>Bath,</hi> to defend thoſe parts which are apt to be offended by the <hi>Bath</hi> : as to have his head well covered from the air and wind, and from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours ariſing from the <hi>Bath</hi> : alſo his kidneys (if they be ſubject to the Stone) anointed with ſome cooling unguents; as <hi>Roſatum Comitiſſae, Infri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidans Galeni, Santolinum,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo to begin gently with the <hi>Bath,</hi> till his body be inured to it, and to be quiet from ſwimming, or much motion, which may offend the head by ſending up va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours thither: at his coming forth, to have his body well dryed, and to reſt in his bed an hour, and ſweat, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>A morning, hour is fitteſt for bathing, after the Sun hath been up an hour or two; and if it be thought fit to uſe it again in the afternoon, it is beſt four or five hours after a light dinner. For the time of ſtaying in the <hi>Bath,</hi> it muſt be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the quality of the <hi>Bath,</hi> and the tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the patient. In a hot <hi>Bath,</hi> an hour or
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:63227:98"/>
leſs may be ſufficient: in a temperate Bath, two hours. For the time of continuing the Bath, there can be no certain time ſet down, but it muſt be according as the patient finds amendment, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times twenty daies, ſometimes thirty, and in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult caſes much longer. And therefore they reckon without their Hoſt, which aſſign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a certain time, as perhaps their occaſions of buſineſs will beſt afford. For the time of the year, our Italian and Spaniſh Authors prefer the Spring and Fall; and ſo they may well do in their hot Countreys; but with us, conſidering our climate is colder, and our Baths are for cold diſeaſes; I hold the warmeſt moneths in the year to be beſt; as <hi>May, June, July, and Auguſt,</hi> and I have perſivaded many, hereunto who have found the benefit of it; for both in our Springs, and after <hi>September</hi> our weather is commonly variable, and apt to offend weak perſons, who finding it temperate at noon, do not ſuſp ct the coolneſs of the mornings and evenings. Likewiſe in the Bath it ſelf, although the Springs ariſe as hot as at other times, yet the wind and air beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, doth do them much harm, and alſo make the ſurface of the water much cooler than the bottom : and therefore <hi>Clauidinus</hi> wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all Baths to be covered, and <hi>Fall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it were to be wiſhed that our Queens Bath, and Croſs-Bath, being ſmall Baths, were cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

and their Slips made cloſe and warm. By this means our Baths would be uſeful all the year, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> neither wind and cold air in Winter, nor the Sun in Summer ſhould hinder our bathing. Moreover, for want of this benefit, many who have indifferently well recovered in the Fall, do fall back again in the winter before the Cure be perfectly finiſhed : and as this would be a great benefit to many weak perſons, ſo it would be no harm to this City, if it may be a means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing more reſort hither in the Winter time, or more early in the Spring, or more late at the Fall.</p>
                  <p>I deſire not novelties, or to bring in innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but I propound theſe things upon good grounds and examples of the beſt Baths in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and ſo I deſire to have them conſidered of, referring both this point, and whatſoever elſe I have ſaid in this Diſcourſe, to the cenſure of thoſe who are able to judge.</p>

                  <p>I have joyntly diſcours'd of the Baths and City, which ſeem to me to reſemble the two parts of a Compoſitum, Body and Soul: And as there is a more than ordinary reſpect due to the body, on the account of its being the Caſe and Cabinet of that pearl of great price, out more noble and diviner part, the Soul; So I thought it my Concern to make ſome refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on the City alſo, as well as the waters,

                  <p>That the Baths, or Hot waters of <hi>Bath</hi> in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet-ſhire,</hi> are of great Antiquity, cannot be doubted by any one who hath in the leaſt caſt an eye on antient Records. Many are the Opinions and Conjectures about the time of their diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which I ſhall as briefly as I may examine. And becauſe there is very frequent mention made of King <hi>Bladud,</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> the one as the Founder, the other as being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in his time: I think it may be for the ſatisfaction of ſome, if I give a particular account who this <hi>Bladud</hi> was, and upon what ſcore the Prophet came to be concern'd in this buſineſs. The ſubſtance of which I take out of a Latine Manuſcript intituled <hi>Brutus Abbreviatus,</hi> being an Epitome of a larger Hiſtory, not concerning my ſelf much in the truth of the Relation, but leaving it to the judgements of thoſe that ſhall peruſe it, to determine of it as they ſhall think fit. <note place="margin">G.

                  <p>My riſe I muſt take from <hi>Brutus,</hi> who after the deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> is ſaid to have come into this Iſland, then called <hi>Albion,</hi> about the year before our Saviours Nativity 1100. where find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none but Gigantick Inhabitants poſſeſſing the Hills, and ſeeing a fruitful ſoil, and full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, was pleaſed one day to call his Company together to offer a ſolemn Sacrifice to <hi>Diana,</hi> by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63227:106"/>
whoſe guidance and direction he had lighted on ſo pleaſant an Iſland. But as they were all at Meat, thirty mighty Giants came down upon them, and in a ſhort time ſlew as many of <hi>Brutus</hi> his men, yet were all afterwards quell'd by <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and the ſurviving Company, except one that was greater than the reſt, whoſe name was Gog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magog.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Brutus</hi> had a Companion related to him called <hi>Corineus,</hi> who being not only like <hi>Saul</hi> from the ſhoulders upwards, but from the waſte higher than his Brethren, was deſigned to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take <hi>Gogmagog,</hi> in which Combat <hi>Gogmagog</hi> brake two of <hi>Corineus</hi> his ribs, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding graſping the Giant in his arms, waſted him along the Sea-ſide, and threw him down a precipice, where he was daſhed in pieces, whence that place now bears the name of <hi>Gogmagog's</hi> leap. <note place="margin">Nephew, as ſome write.</note>

                  <p>As to the Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> the time when he deſired rain, falls out to be according to compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in the year of the world 3040. nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and ſome odd years before Chriſt; ſo that this Prophet and King <hi>Bladud</hi> were Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries, and the antiquity reaches no higher on the account of the later opinion then the firſt.</p>

                     </note> However, the matter is not great whether <hi>Bladud</hi> was the eighth King from <hi>Brute,</hi> as my Author ſuppoſes, or the ninth, or tenth, as others; I

inferring no more from the preceding Hiſtory then this, That <hi>Bladud</hi> lived near 900 years before Chriſt; ſince of the exact time of his flouriſhing, more then by Conjecture, by reaſon of the Confuſion and Diſagreement among Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians touching the Number, and Succeſſion of the Kings, and time of their Reign, we have no certain account.</p>
                  <p>But to be as particular as I may, becauſe ſome years paſſed between the Birth of thoſe ſeven Kings mentioned before, and the begining of their Reigns, and alſo becauſe <hi>Gwenthlea,</hi> or <hi>Guendoloena,</hi> and <hi>Leill,</hi> are ſaid by other Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians to have Reigned 40 years (<hi>viz.</hi> the former 15, the later 25) which are not there accounted for, the ſurer way will be to take our account from the Year of the World. Now <hi>Brute</hi> being reported to have entred <hi>Albion A.M.</hi> 2855, and <hi>Bladud</hi> to have begun his Reign <hi>A.M.</hi> 3100, the difference between theſe two numbers is 245 which being taken out of 1108 (the year before Chriſt, in which <hi>Brute</hi> came hither, anſwering to the Year of the World 2855) the Remainder will be 863 (the Year before Chriſt, anſwering to the Year of the World 3100) ſo that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Computation, <hi>Bladud</hi> began his Reign over the <hi>Britains,</hi> juſt 863 years before Chriſt was born, and Reigning 20 years, died in the Year <hi>Ante Chriſtum,</hi> 843 I know <hi>Fabian</hi> the Author of <hi>Polychronicon,</hi> and others, differ ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in their Chronologie concerning <hi>Bladud</hi> from that I have given, but I look on this to be as probable as any.</p>

                  <p>IT is not I think, to be doubted, but that the Bathes were before the City, and gave Name to it: Sick people, in all probability that came hither for relief, firſt making ſmall Cottages for their Conveniences, which were afterwards im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved into fairer Buildings. So that now in this particular, there are few places in <hi>England</hi> that exceed it.</p>
                  <p>That this place was built, or rather begun, by King <hi>Bladud,</hi> is the opinion of ſome, and that he called it by his own Name <hi>Caer Blaeidin,</hi> which ſometime after came to be <hi>Caer Bathe.</hi>

                  <p>This Structure erected by <hi>Robert,</hi> continued till the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th; when <hi>Oliver King,</hi> the 23d Biſhop after the Union of <hi>Bathe</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> pulling down the old Church built by <hi>Robert,</hi> not <hi>John de Villula</hi> (which was burnt, as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> affirms) began the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a fair and ſumptuous Building, but left it, by reaſon of his death, whatever the lately mentioned Hiſtorian relates, very imperfect. <note place="margin">Br.

                  <p>Upon the diſſolution of the Abbey, the Church was uncovered, the Lead taken away, and the Walls much ruin'd, and ſo continued for ſome time. But ſince its laſt demolition, in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, it hath thrice been attempted to be re-edified; Firſt in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by a General Collection, by which the Work was not much advanc'd. The Second, in the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi>

                     <hi>A. D.</hi> 1604. in whoſe time it met with many Benefactors; the principal whereof to this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond work was <hi>Thomas Bellot</hi> Eſquire, Steward of the Houſe, and one of the Executors of the Right Honourable, <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Barkley,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Lord Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> who made ſome entrance on this Work in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and laſt of all, about the middle of King <hi>James's</hi> Reign it was finiſh'd and brought to perfection, as by the Munificence of Noble men, Knights, Gentlemen, and others, whoſe Names are on Record, ſo eſpecially by the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hand of Dr. <hi>James Mountague,</hi> ſometime Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of this Dioceſe, who at one time gave 1000 pounds toward its Reparation, and lies buried in the body of the Church, deceaſed <hi>July</hi> 20.1618.</p>
                  <p>It appears alſo from the Memorials of the Church, that before the firſt of theſe three laſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to repair it, there was little of the Church ſtanding, ſave the bare Walls, and thoſe too, in many places, much impaired, which being then, as it was, decayed in the hands of <hi>Edmund Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurſt</hi> Eſquire, was by him beſtowed on the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though uncovered, and much ruin'd, as it had long ſtood after the diſſolution; and therefore he bears the name of the principal Benefactor to the firſt work.</p>
                  <p>The particulars of the Reparations, with the Names, and Sums of the Benefactors from the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> downwards (which are not for me here diſtinctly to mention) are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in a Book kept for that purpoſe in the Library belonging to the Church, begun by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Lake, and augmented by ſome others, but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63227:118"/>
yet ſtands in need of the helping hands of more Benefactors.</p>
                  <p>And although I have ſaid ſo much concerning this Church already, yet I ſhall crave leave to add as a Concluſion to this Matter a Poem, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally came to my hands by the means of Mr. <hi>John Parker,</hi> Citizen of <hi>Bathe,</hi> a lover of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and my good Friend (to whom I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my ſelf engag'd for the aſſiſtance he afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in my ſearch after the Antiquities of the the City) found in the Study among other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, of that learned Knight, Sir <hi>John Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> whether made by himſelf, as ſome imagine (who well might do it, having a great genius to Poetry, and called by Dr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> one of the moſt ingenious Poets of our Nation) or ſome other, I know not; written, and as it ſeems, ſpoken to Biſhop <hi>Mountague,</hi> at his firſt coming to <hi>Bathe,</hi> and Sight of the Church; which I ſhould have tranſlated, but that the Subſtance of it, as much as is neceſſary to be known for Hiſtory, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the foregoing account. However, to preſerve it from periſhing, and to gratifie the lover of Antiquity, (to whom I chuſe rather to incur the cenſure of being Prodigal, then any way Nice, in with-holding any thing I think may deſerve their acceptance) I ſhall inſert it here, in Latin, as I found it.

                  <p>THE <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities, Inſcriptions and Images, in the Walls and elſewhere of this City, were taken notice of by Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> at his being here, and inſerted into his <hi>Britannia</hi>: yet becauſe ſome alterations have hapened to

                  <p>I ſhall diſtribute them into three Sorts. Tbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> that are between the South and Weſt Gates, Thoſe that are between the Weſt and North Gates; And thoſe in the Garden, formerly <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Chambers's,</hi> now belonging to <hi>William Burvurd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt, of the firſt fort we meet withall, (not taken notice of by Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi>) is the draught of a great Face, (which yet I cannot affirm to be truly <hi>Roman</hi>) about a foot in bredth, and near as much in length, much reſembling the Moon, as it is uſually drawn. Whether this was a memorial of the Idoll of ſome Pagan (which it not very likely) or rather ſet up in memory of ſome Gyagntick perſon, whoſe parts were proportionable to this Face (which is more probable) I know not. Sure I am that <hi>England</hi> hath had thoſe Sons of <hi>Anack</hi> as well as other Countries, as, beſides Hiſtories, the prodigious Bones digged up in ſeveral places thereof, do witneſs; and particularly (ſeeing we are apt to ſuſpect things done many years ago, relations of this nature being not like Pictures, <hi>Quibwè lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginquo reverentia major</hi>) the entire Bones of a man of unuſual dimenſions, found not 20 years ſince, in <hi>Gloceſter-ſhire,</hi> in a Field, between <hi>Over,</hi> and <hi>Thornbury,</hi> do ſufficiently evince.</p>
                  <p>This Sceleton (as I heard it related by a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63227:123"/>
Author, who had it from an eye-witneſs) was incloſed within the body of a maſſie Stone, ſo artificially cemented together, that the joynts were indiſcoverable. In the middle thereof (as it were in a Vault) ſate the Bones of two perſons, one very great, and the other leſs. The Scull of the greater was half an Inch thick, and the Ulna, as big as the Gentlemans Wriſt, who ſaw it (who yet is a corpulent man, and hath none of the leaſt) and as long as from his ſhoulder to his fingers ends. There were Inſcriptions alſo, and ſome Coins, both Silver and Braſs, about, and in it, but what they were, I cannot yet learn, having not hitherto had the opportunity to ſee either the one, or the other.</p>
                  <p>Since the Relation of the former perſon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving occaſion lately to ride into that part of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter-ſhire,</hi> where the bones were found , I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Confirmation of it from two of the Sons of the Gentleman, in whoſe ground, and at whoſe great charges, they were diſcoverd , the Father being dead ſome fout years ſince; only with this difference, that whereas the former Relator in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated the Bone, mentioned before, to be the Ulna, or the Radius, they apprehend it rather to be to the <hi>Os Humeri,</hi> or Bone from the Soulder to the Elbow, which they affirmed to have been as long as from the Elbow of any ordinary man to his Fingers ends, or the length of that Bone uſually and half the Ulna or Radius.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, that both the Sceletons were of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary dimenſions but one bigger then the other, &amp; not both in one Sepulch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e or Vault, but two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ones, diſtant about 2 yard each from other.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63227:123"/>
The Vault of the greater was not above five foot long, in the form, (according to their reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance) of a Jews-harp, narrow at the Feet, and broader about the Seat: ſo that this body muſt ſit, being judged by ſome intelligent perſons that ſaw it, to have been a man of nine foot in heighth. The other was longer, and the Bones ſuppoſed to lie at length, yet very little within the ground; having both great ſtones about and over them, in the manner of a Tomb.</p>
                  <p>After I had received their Information, they were pleas'd for my further ſatisfaction, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me to the place, about a quarter of a mile from their houſe, in an Incloſure, hard by the high-way ſide, now made meadow ground, where I ſaw one Stone, which was at the entrance of the Vault of the greater Sceleton, ſtanding in the ſame place it was firſt ſet, about 4 foot above the ground; to which the other Stones did Anſwer: ſo that the length being five foot, and the heighth four, confirms the Conjecture of the Stature of the Body mentioned before.</p>
                  <p>The Tomb-ſtone that lay over the greater perſon, of an uneven, and (as I may term it) mazzardy ſurface, was ſo vaſt and weighty, that it was a buſineſs of great difficulty and labour to remove it; of a grayiſh colour without, but reddiſh within, and in many places ſtudded with a bright ſhining Stone, ſomewhat reſembling the Stones ot St. <hi>Vincents</hi> Rock near <hi>Briſtow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot underſtand by them there were any Inſcriptions, and but two or three Coins, one having a Falcon (as they called it) which might be a <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle; another a <hi>Caeſars</hi> Head, with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63227:124"/>
a wreath of Lawrel about it, ſuppoſed to be the Head of <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>The common report there is, that it was the Tomb of <hi>Off a,</hi> King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> who yet was one of the middle Kings of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved neer 250 years alter the <hi>Romans</hi> departed out of <hi>Britain,</hi> of whoſe extraordinary ſtature, I know no Hiſtorian that takes any notice. It ſeems to have been a <hi>Golgotha,</hi> or common place of Burial, in thoſe times, the ground thereabouts, in a round, or rather an Oval figure, for neer half an Acre, affording great plenty of other Bones, and the place bearing the name of <hi>Bone-hill.</hi> The time of it's diſcovery was about the year 1652. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this great perſon were a <hi>Roman,</hi> or a <hi>Saxon,</hi> is not very eaſie to determine; if a <hi>Roman,</hi> 'tis much they ſhould here , contrary to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cuſtom, both preſerve the Bones, and leave no Inſcription, and if <hi>Saxon,</hi> 'tis as different to ſolve the Phaenomenon of the <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, being hot accidentally found among other rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh, but in the Sepulchre it ſelf. However, whether <hi>Roman, Saxon,</hi> or other, which I ſhall not at this time any further diſpute, it is enough for my preſent purpoſe that it was a body of more then ordinary dimenſions, and exceeding the heigth of an ordinary man in thoſe times by 3 foot, that is higher by the half then moſt men now.</p>
                  <p>2. A Foot-man with a Spear.</p>
                  <p>3. A Foot-Soldier brandiſhing his Sword, and bearing out his Shield.</p>
                  <p>4. Two kiſſing and clipping one another, which by the Crook in the right hand of one,

Not that I conceive either of theſe to have died here, (though <hi>Severus</hi> himseſf did, and was buried at <hi>York</hi>) but ſome of the Siſterhood may, of later date, and might have the Superſcription of more noted names.

                  </argument>
                  <p>Baths of <hi>Bath</hi> much of the nature of the <hi>Thermae Aquenſes</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> Certain Parallels between. <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Akin Bladud</hi> in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vindicated.</p>
                  <p>I Come now to ſpeak ſomething of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Uſe, and Vertues of the <hi>Baths.</hi> And here it cannot be expected I ſhould ſay much, becauſe my experience of them as yet hath been but little, and the Obſervations I have made ſeem fitter, (as they are intended) for a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a greater work, (which time, and variety of experiments muſt compleat) then, at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be communicated to the publick. And to make ſome compenſation for my brevity in this thing (which is juſtly deemed the moſt material of all other) I ſhall take the boldneſs to engage, as ſoon as time and opportunity ſhall permit, to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63227:128"/>
make a through ſearch into the cauſe of the Heat, Nature, and efficacious operations of the Baths, and perhaps give a more ſatisfactory account of the former, than yet hath been given by any; and for the later, I ſhall not build on the hay and ſtubble of the talk and relations of perſons by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſs'd and concern'd, but on the ſolid baſis of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, obſervation and experience. In the mean time, as I would not ſeem ridiculous to ſome, treating too largely of what I have not yet made a clear inſpection into, ſo I would not be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted abſurd by others, in wholly waving the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of my Subject.</p>
                  <p>To offer then a courſe bit to the eager ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, till time ſhall favour us with a better treat; I conceive that the Baths of <hi>Bath</hi> come very neer the nature of the <hi>Aqueuſes</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> the knowledge of which may be a great help to the better underſtanding of our own. I ſhall therefore, out of the ſuccinct, but pithy diſcourſe of theſe waters, compoſed by the learned and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Phyſitian <hi>Fran. Fabritius Ruremundanus,</hi> ſometime Phyſitian there, take notice of ſome Parallels between that place and <hi>Bath,</hi> in which, beſides many pretty remarkable Coincidences, the nature of the Countrey, and parts adjacent, is in ſome meaſure diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, that Hiſtories relate, that the Hot Waters there were found out by a Prince, one <hi>Granus,</hi> brother, as tis ſaid, to <hi>Nero</hi> the Roman Emperor; who firſt diſcovering theſe Baths, among the mountains and woods, built a Caſtle, and dwelt there, of which, in the Authors time, there was a monument ſtanding, called <hi>Turris Grani.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:63227:129"/>
Secondly, That the City was called by the name of the Waters, to wit, <hi>Aquae Granis,</hi> which ſome improperly call <hi>Aquiſgranum. Ab incolis Aquoe Grani appellatae ſunt, cum Thermae, tum locus ipſe, deducto ſcil. nomine ab Aquis Calidis, &amp; Grano repertore, manſitque appellatio poſtea &amp; Urbi, niſi quod quidam non ſatis apte immuta inflexione, Aquiſgranum appellent.</hi> The Inhabitants ſaith <hi>Ruremundanus,</hi> call the Place, as well as the Waters, <hi>Aquae Grani,</hi> by a name drawn from the Hot Waters, and <hi>Granus</hi> the Founder, which name afterwards the City had, but that ſome, not ſo properly, changing the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, call it <hi>Aquiſgran.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the City is <hi>ſita in valle, &amp; mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus circumquaque cincta,</hi> ſeated in a bottom, and encompaſſed about with Hills. That the Hills (beſides Wood for Fire and Timber) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Quarries of Stone for Building. That cold Springs ariſe within &amp; without the City in great abundance. That at ſome diſtance off is found Lead, and a Bituminous Earth, which mine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor calls <hi>Terra nigra, foco culinaria aptiſſima.</hi> That in the City are two Chief Bathes, The one called the <hi>Kings,</hi> the other the <hi>Cornelian.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">p. 14</note> In the Suburbs, not far from the South Gate, are more Hot ſprings, called, from the abundance of Hogs that are there about, the <hi>Porcetan Bathes,</hi> which being not ſo powerfull as the reſt, are leſs uſed. And laſtly, that I may mention ſomething that would be advantageous to both, and both do want, viz. <hi>a Navigable River,</hi> which ſaies <hi>Rurem.</hi> would compleat its happineſs. <hi>Nibil,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now to give you the Counter-part of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel: 'Tis obvious to obſerve, that to the firſt correſponds the Hiſtory of King <hi>Bladud,</hi> which ſeems not to be ſo fabulous, as many men imagine. For, probably, many Relations we have of perſons, and things, and of thoſe elder times, when ignorance ſo much prevail'd, and men had little ſubtilty in their actions, and leſs politeneſs in their ſpeech, may have much of truth in them, though they now ſeem odd, and rediculous to us. And I am apt to think, that many old Realities do ſuffer much, on no other account then to the temper, and genius of thoſe times. Juſt as 'tis reported of ſome old women in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> that they go for Witches, meerly becauſe they look like ſuch. Not conſidering, that a great deal leſs time then 2000 years, hath made conſiderable alterations, in the manners, lives, and cuſtoms of men.</p>
                  <p>And whereas King <hi>Bladud</hi> had the name of a Magitian, I look upon it as a greater argument of his more then ordinary learning, then note of reproach, the wiſeſt men in thoſe times, and long after to, being reputed ſuch, and he record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wife and eloquent Philoſopher, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematian, accompliſh't (as the times then would bear) with treaſures of forrein, and domeſtick knowledge, having ſpent in Study, (as is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) beſides many, doubtleſs, afterwards, in his own Countrey, eleven years in his Minority, at <hi>Athens,</hi> Of whom that you may receive a more
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63227:130"/>
particular account, I ſhall not think much to give you the Engliſh of what <hi>J. Bate</hi> in his Book <hi>De Scriptoribus Anglicis,</hi> writeth of him. <hi>Bladud</hi> ſurnamed the Magician, the 10th King of the <hi>Britains,</hi> was ſent in his Youth, to the famous City of <hi>Athens</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> there to be inſtructed in Philoſophy, and the Liberal Sciences. And when he had there ſtudied a certain time, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the death of <hi>Ludhudebras</hi> his Father, he returned home again, bringing with him four ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Maſters in many Sciences, not thinking it meet that his Countrey ſhould lack any longer ſuch ſingular ornaments of Learning as they were. Theſe Philoſophers, as <hi>Merlin</hi> writeth, he placed at <hi>Stamford,</hi> in a very pleaſant Soyl, and made Schools for them, to the intent they ſhould there read the liberal Sciences, where they had many times a great Audiences. He was a man very cunning and skilfull, as well in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Sciences of the Gentiles, as in all Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge that the Graecians excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in; but eſpecially ſtudious and very well ſeen in the Mathematical Arts and Sciences, whereupon one of the Sybils, that lived in his time, wrote and dedicated unto him a Book of Propheſies. Some affirmed that the ſame <hi>Bladud</hi> built the City of <hi>Bathe,</hi> and therein made by a wonderfull Art, certain Hot Bathes, for the uſe and commodity of the people, which do yet remain to this day, committing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation thereof to the Goddeſs <hi>Minerva,</hi> in whoſe honour be cauſed a Temple to be there erected, to the intent, that being preferred by ſo mighty a Goddeſs, they ſhould never fail, but
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63227:130"/>
continue for ever, they write alſo, how that he read and taught Necromancy throughout all his Realm. But theſe things I ſuppoſe are ſeigned matters.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond particular anſwers the Name of Bathe, taken from the Waters. For this Name, as is noted before, was given to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſome time after its foundation, when the Hot Waters came into greater requeſt, being called firſt, after the name of the Founder, <hi>Caer Blaeidin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the third, agrees the ſituation of <hi>Bathe,</hi> being exactly the ſame. To the fourth, the Quarries of Stone, upon <hi>Claverton Down, Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb,</hi> &amp;c. To the fifth, the Springs of <hi>Cornwall</hi> in <hi>Wallcot-fields, Beechenclift,</hi> &amp;c. To the ſixth, <hi>Timsbury, Burnet,</hi> (and though the diſtance be ſomewhat greater) <hi>Mendip-Hills.</hi> To the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, the <hi>Kings Bathe,</hi> with its apperdage, the <hi>Queens</hi> and <hi>Croſs-Bath.</hi> To the laſt, the Horſe-Bath, without the South-Gate, doth in ſome meaſure, anſwer, though it hath no Hot Springs of its own, but is ſupplyed by the Overplus of Water coming from the Kings Bath.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is recorded, <hi>That theſe Bathes are not wholſome at all hours, being from</hi> 8 <hi>of the Clock in the morning, to three in the Afternoon, Scalding Hot.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Carbl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>us Br. pag. 233.</note> It is clear, that the inequality of the heat proceeds not ſo much from the Waters (which in themſelves, are obſerved to vary very little from a conſtant, and equal degree of heat, both Winter, and Summer) as from the beating of the Beams of the Sun in hot weather on the Surface of them, which being more troubleſom
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63227:131"/>
to the Bathes, and Mornings and Evenings more convenient for Bathing, the middle part of the day is not made uſe of, though the Waters then are as wholſome as ever. But we may well pardon this learned and induſtrious perſon, if he hath not in this, and ſome other particulars, done the Bathes right, in regard the vaſtneſs of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and urgency of his occaſions, might ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten him hence, ſo that, haply, he could not throughly inform himſelf in things of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Bathes in particular here.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>Of the three Hotter Bathes, <hi>viz.</hi> The Kings, Queens, and Hot Bathe. But chiefly of the Kings, and in what Diſtempers Bathing therein is profitable.</p>
                  <p>HAving thus far drawn the Parallel between <hi>Bathe</hi> and <hi>Akin</hi> which, as they cannot be conceived to agree in every punctilio, (no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, as they ſay, running on four feet) ſo it ſeems they cannot correſpond in ſome of thoſe particulars before recited, without a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication alſo in the Waters of many of the ſame Medicinal Vertues. Having done this, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a light gaſt and reliſh, of the Vertues, and uſefulneſs of every Bath in particular.</p>
                  <p>And here taking it for granted, till better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, what the very learned and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Doctor <hi>Jorden</hi> hath obſerved, That there is very little difference in the Nature of the Bathes of <hi>Bathe,</hi> but in the degree of heat, they all proceeding from the ſame Mine, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the intenſeneſs or remiſsneſs of its heat in divers parts, and the directneſs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directneſs of the paſſages from it, may cauſe this Variation; and alſo, that the Minerals impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the Bathes in general, are Bitumen, Nitre, and Sulphur, I ſhall run the Parallel a little further, and ſpeak ſomething in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of all the Bathes; and firſt of the Kings.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Kings Bathe</hi> exceeds the reſt in Heat
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63227:132"/>
and Dimenſions, being the hotteſt, and largeſt of all. And whereas there is another that for ſome time hath, I know not how, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated the name that is common to them all, and therefore gives moſt people occaſionto ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the heat to be more intenſe there then any where elſe, I conceive, at preſent, the heat of that Bath, to come as much ſhort of that of the Kings, as the Croſs Bath, in that inſtance, yields to the Queens.</p>
                  <p>This Bath, as to its vertues, much reſembles the Kings Bath at <hi>Akin,</hi> that is, conſiſts of the ſame Minerals, though probably, not in the ſame proportion; the German Kings Bath being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted chiefly Sulphurous; This of Bath, Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous. Which, yet notwithſtanding conſidering the great affinity Bitumen hath with Sulphur, and the ſlender difference in their qualities, being bothſuppoſed moderately hot and dry, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt both (according to the common no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) attract, reſolve, molliſie, and diſcuſs, will not alter much the Caſe, not to mention that <hi>Baccius</hi> and <hi>Bauhinus,</hi> and (what is more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) two of our own Countreymen, Doctor <hi>Turner,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Venner,</hi> do all agree, That they are chiefly Sulphurous. And whereas <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem.</hi> faith of the Kings Bath at <hi>Akin; Refert haec aqua modis omnibus naturam Sulphuris, cum admiſſione Nitri modici</hi>; making mention of Sulphur and Nitre, but omitting Bitumen, I queſtion not, but upon Examination, it would be found that Bitumen alſo was concern'd in that Bath, as well as the Cornelian in the ſame City. <note place="margin">De Baln.

which this <hi>Bath</hi> is profitable, ſuggeſts as much: bituminous waters being of a heating, drying na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſuppling the nerves.</p>
                  <p>The Encomium he gives of this <hi>Bath,</hi> and the Diſeaſes he affirms it to do good in, (which for the moſt part agree to this of <hi>Bath</hi> alſo) are as fellows. This <hi>Bath</hi> is profitable for many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, eſpecially cold and moiſt: for it heats powerfully, dries, drives the humors from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts to the outward, diſcuſſes, attenuates, abſtergeth, and that I may ſpeak more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, good chiefly in affections of the Nerves, as Convulſions, Palſies, as well alone, as accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying an Apoplexie, in defect of ſenſe or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or both. It helps ſtiff, benumm'd, and trembling limbs, does good in the ſeveral ſorts of Gouts, eſpecially Hip and Hand-gout. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſeth Tumors: Relieveth thoſe that are ſtreightened about the Midriff: thoſe that have a Cachexy, or ill habit of body: The Dropſie (eſpecially the Anaſarca) and Jaundice. Thoſe that are troubled with a cold diſtemper of the Stomach, Liver or Spleen. Excites and reſtores Appetite. Eaſeth pains in the ſides (without a favour) Boweſs or Loins. Helps cold and moiſt diſtempers of the Womb; furthers Conception, provokes the Terms, giveth eaſe in uterine pains; takes off wearineſs as well ſpontaneous, as by exceſſive labour and travel, &amp;c. moſt proper for thoſe of a cold Conſtitution, and ſomewhat cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent, and not ſo convenient for dry and ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated perſons. To which may be added Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargies, Epilepfies, Cramps, Deafneſs, Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Aches, and many others of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

                  <p>The Hot Bath is ſomewhat cooler, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in the like caſes; and Dr. <hi>Venner</hi> hath obſerved moſt eſſicacious for any weakned and relaxed limb.</p>
                  <p>The Queens Bath is the next for heat, and hath the ſame virtues with the Kings, out of which it was taken, having no hot ſprings of its own, but is ſupplyed out of the Kings, where the water ſtanding as it were in a Cooler, is made more temperate, and fitter for tender bodies, that cannot well endure ſuch a degree of heat, as in the Kings Bath.</p>

                     <p>Of the Croſs Bath, and its Virtues.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE <hi>Croſs Bath,</hi> as to its degree of Heat, abating ſomewhat of the Queens, is the cooleſt of all, of which I may ſay, as a ſtranger ſometime did of this City, that it is <hi>E minimis pulcherrimum,</hi> and though it be little, is not on that, nor any other account deſpicable; <hi>Ineſt ſua gratia parvis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Bath</hi> is thought by Dr. <hi>Jorden</hi> to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate more of Nitre than the reſt, and therefore is obſerved to ſupple &amp; mollifie ſomewhat more, receiving a greater degree of cleanſing and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating from the Nitre; Conſonant to which 'tis ſaid of the <hi>Cornelian Bath</hi> in <hi>Akin. <note place="margin">Cap. 17.</note>

                  <p>And whereas inſtead of Nitre, he mentions Salt, the difference, though ſomething I confeſs, cannot be great, ſince many of the ſame vertues are both by him and others attributed to ſaline Waters, as Nitrous; Nitre it ſelf being a kind of Salt. <note place="margin">Therme Nitroſae omnino eaſdem facultates ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, quas Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae, &amp;c.</note> From the mixture of the Sulphur and

                  <p>This Bath then muſt be of Excellent Uſe in all Contractions, Indurations, and Reſolutions of nervous parts, diſperſe, and diſſipate cold Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; relieve Cachectick, Hydropick, and Corpulent perſons; oppoſe the Sciatica, Cramps, Convulſions, Defluxions, Barrenneſs, and the Whites in Women; uſefull in Cutaneous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers; as the Itch, Scabs, Morphew, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie. Good for fleſhy, cold, moiſt bodies; and not ſo proper for hot, and dry Conſtitutions.</p>
                  <p>And here I muſt crave leave to add, that the reaſon I conceive why the Croſs Bath comes not up to the heat of the reſt, is partly on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its being ſerved by four Springs, but chiefly proceeds from the greater proportion of Nitre it contains, which being of a cooling nature, may more allay the heat ariſing from the Sulphur and Bitumen there, then in the other Bathes. And that Nitre doth more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in that Bath, then in the reſt, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be collected, as from other reaſons, which I here forbear to mention, ſo partly from this, that it ſooner penetrates the body, and hath an eaſier, and quicker ingreſs into its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages and pores, to the great relief of ſome, though it ſeems Paradoxical, in Nephritick Diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>But I hope I may be excuſed on the Score of my former Engagement, if I am not more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular at this time, in things of this nature, till a juſt amaſsment of Obſervations and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,

and a rational deduction of Concluſions from them, (which I hope in ſome time to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh) ſhall either confirm me in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I now have of the Nature and Vertues of the Baths of <hi>Bathe,</hi> or ſupply me with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
