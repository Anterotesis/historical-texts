            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Pious Endeavours of the Gown, has not prov'd more ineffectual in the reclaiming the Errors of a vitious Age, than <hi>Satyr</hi> (the better way, tho' less practis'd) the amendment of Honesty, and good Manners amongst us. Nor is it a wonder, when we consider that Women, (as if they had the ingredient of Fallen-Angel in their composition) the more they are lash'd, are but the more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Impenitence: and as Children in some violent Distemper, commonly spit out those cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing Cordials, which if taken, might chace away the Malady: So they (inspir'd as 'twere with a natural aversness to Vertue) despise that whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Counsel, which is Religiously design'd for their future good, and happiness. Judge then, if <hi>Satyr</hi> ever had more need of a sharper sting than now; when he can look out of his Cell on no side, but sees so many Objects beyond the
<pb facs="tcp:44897:3"/>
reach of indignation. Nor is it altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable for me (while others are lashing the Rebellious Times into Obedience) to have one fling at <hi>Woman,</hi> the Original of Mischief. Altho' I'me sensible I might as well expect to see Truth and Honesty uppermost in the World, as think to be free from the Bitterness of their Resentments: But I have no reason to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd at that; since I'me certain my design's as far from offending the good, (if there are any amongst 'em that can be said to be so) as those few that are good, would be offended at their Reception into the Eternal Inhabitations of Peace, to be Crown'd there with the Sacred Reward of their Labours. As for those that are ill, if it reflect on them it succeeds accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my wish; for I have no other design but the amendment of Vice, which if I could but in the least accomplish, I should be well pleas'd; and not without reason too; for it must needs be a satisfaction to a young unskilful Archer, to hit the first Mark he ever aim'd at.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>AT length from Love's vile Slav'ry I am free,</l>
               <l>And have regain'd my ancient Liberty:</l>
               <l>I've shook those Chains off which my bondage wrought,</l>
               <l>Am free as Ayr, and unconfin'd as thought;</l>
               <l>For faithless <hi>Silvia</hi> I no more adore,</l>
               <l>Kneel at her feet, and pray in vain no more:</l>
               <l>No more my Verse shall her fled worth proclaim,</l>
               <l>And with soft praises celebrate her Name:</l>
               <l>Her Frowns do now no awful terrours bear;</l>
               <l>Her Smiles no more can cure or cause despair.</l>
               <l>I've banish'd her for ever from my Breast,</l>
               <l>Banish'd the proud Invader of my rest,</l>
               <l>Banish'd the Tyrant Author of my woes,</l>
               <l>That robb'd my Soul of all its sweet repose:</l>
               <l>Not all her treach'rous Arts, bewitching Wiles,</l>
               <l>Her Sighs, her Tears, nor her deluding Smiles,</l>
               <l>Shall my eternal Resolution move,</l>
               <l>Or make me talk, or think, or dream of Love:</l>
               <l>The whining Curse I've banish'd from my Mind,</l>
               <l>And with it, all the thoughts of Womankind.</l>
               <l>Come then my Muse, and since th' occasion's fair,</l>
               <l>'Gainst the lewd Sex proclaim an endless War;</l>
               <l>Which may renew as still my Verse is read,</l>
               <l>And live, when I am mingl'd with the dead:</l>
               <l>

Discover all their various sorts of Vice,</l>

               <l>With all their num'rous Race of Crimes beside:</l>
               <l>Unvail 'em quite to ev'ry vulgar Eye,</l>
               <l>And in that shameful posture let 'em lie,</l>

               <l>Sure Heav'n it self (intranc't) like <hi>Adam</hi> lay,</l>
               <l>Or else some banish'd Fiend usurp't the sway</l>

               <l>True, the first Woman gave the first bold Blow,</l>
               <l>And bravely sail'd down to th' Abyss below;</l>
               <l>But had the great Deed still been left undone,</l>
               <l>None of the daring Sex, no, hardly one,</l>
               <l>But in the very self-same path would go,</l>
               <l>Tho' sure 'twou'd lead 'em to eternal woe:</l>

               <l>That does not envy <hi>Eve</hi> the glory of the Fall:</l>
               <l>Be cautious then, and guard your Empire well;</l>
               <l>For shou'd they once get power to rebel,</l>
               <l>They'd surely raise a Civil-War in Hell,</l>

Debauch'd th' innocent, Ambrosial mea</l>

               <l>True, I confess that <hi>Rome</hi>'s Emperial Whore,</l>

               <l>But see the World's mistake; and with it, see</l>
               <l>The strange effects of wild Inconstancy!</l>

For she her self, ev'n in that sacred Room,</l>
               <l>With one brisk, vig'rous on-set was o'recome,</l>
               <l>And made a Brothel of her Husband's Tomb:</l>
               <l>Whose pale Ghost trembl'd in its sacred shrowd,</l>
               <l>Wond'ring that Heav'n th' impious act allow'd:</l>
               <l>Horror in Robes of Darkness stalk't around;</l>
               <l>And through the frighted Tomb did groans resound.</l>
               <l>The very Marbles wept; the Furies howl'd,</l>
               <l>And in hoarse Murmurs their amazement told.</l>
               <l>All this shook not the Dictates of her Mind,</l>
               <l>But with a boldness, bold as was her Crime,</l>
               <l>She made her Husband's Ghost (in Death, a Slave!)</l>
               <l>Her necessary Pimp, ev'n in his Grave!</l>
               <l>Are these (ye Gods) the Virtues of a Wife?</l>
               <l>The Peace that crowns a Matrimonial Life?</l>
               <l>Is this the Sacred Prize for which Man fights?</l>
               <l>Bliss, of his Days? and Rapture, of his Nights?</l>
               <l>The Rains, that guides him in his wild Careers?</l>
               <l>And the Supporter of his feeble Years?</l>
               <l>His freedom, in his Chains? in want, his Store?</l>
               <l>His Health, in Sickness? and his Wealth, when Poor?</l>
               <l>No, no, 'tis Contradiction; opposite,</l>
               <l>As much as Heav'n 's to Hell, or Day's to Night.</l>
               <l>They crown Man's Life with Peace? no, rather far,</l>
               <l>They are the cause of all his bosom-war;</l>
               <l>The very Sourse, and Fountain of his Woes,</l>
               <l>From whence Despair, and Doubt for ever flows:</l>
               <l>The Gall, that mingles with his best delight;</l>
               <l>Rank, to the taste; and nauseous, to the sight:</l>
               <l>A days, the weight of Care that clogs his breast,</l>
               <l>At Night the Hagg that does disturb his rest:</l>
               <l>His mortal sickness, in the midst of health;</l>
               <l>Chains, in his Freedom; Poverty, in Wealth:</l>
               <l>Th' eternal Pestilence, and Plague of Life;</l>
               <l>Th' original, and spring of all his Strife;</l>
               <l>These rather are the Virtues of a Wife!</l>
               <l>Yet if all these should not sufficient be,</l>
               <l>To make us understand our misery,</l>
               <l>See it summ'd up in their Inconstancy:</l>

In which, so many various ways they move,</l>
               <l>They now inconstant in their Follies prove,</l>
               <l>Ev'n as inconstant as they do in Love:</l>
               <l>Nor is't alone confin'd in those to range,</l>
               <l>Their Vices too themselves admit of change,</l>
               <l>Their dearest darling Vices, Lust, and Pride,</l>
               <l>With all they promise, think, or dream beside:</l>
               <l>O how inconstant then must Woman be,</l>
               <l>When constant onely in Inconstancy?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O why, ye awful Pow'rs, why was't your Will</l>
               <l>To mix our solid good with so much ill?</l>
               <l>Unless 'twere when you found Rebellious Man,</l>
               <l>(For 'ere time was you cou'd their Actions scan)</l>
               <l>Would commit Crimes so impious, and high,</l>
               <l>That they were made your veng'ance to supply:</l>
               <l>For not the wild destructive waste of War,</l>
               <l>Nor all the endless Lab'rinths of the Bar,</l>
               <l>Famine, Revenge, perpetual loss of health,</l>
               <l>No nor that grinning Friend Despair it self,</l>
               <l>When it insults with most tyranick sway,</l>
               <l>Can plague or torture Mankind more than they.</l>
               <l>But hold—don't let me blame the Pow'rs Divine;</l>
               <l>Or at the wond'rous Works they made, repine.</l>
               <l>All first was good, form'd by th' eternal Will,</l>
               <l>Tho' some has since degenerated to ill:</l>
               <l>Ev'n Woman was (they say) made chaste, and good;</l>
               <l>But Ah! not long in that blest State she stood:</l>
               <l>She fell, she fell, and sow'd the poys'nous Seeds</l>
               <l>Of Murder, Rapine, all inhumane Deeds;</l>
               <l>Which now so very firm have taken root,</l>
               <l>That Heav'n in vain wou'd strive to raze 'em out.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But stop my Pen; for who can comprehend,</l>
               <l>Or trace those Crimes which ne're can have an end?</l>
               <l>The Sun, the Moon, the Stars that guild the Sky,</l>
               <l>The World, and all its Glories too must dy,</l>
               <l>And in one universal Ruine ly:</l>
               <l>But they ev'n Immortality will gain,</l>
               <l>And live—but must for ever live in pain;</l>
               <l>For ever live, damn'd to eternal Night,</l>
               <l>And never more review the sacred Light.</l>

Beware then, dull deluded Man, beware;</l>
               <l>And let not treach'rous Woman be the snare,</l>
               <l>To make you the Companions with 'em there:</l>
               <l>Scorn their vain Smiles, and all their Arts despise,</l>
               <l>And your Content at that just value prize,</l>
               <l>As not to let those rav'nous Thieves of Prey,</l>
               <l>Rifle, and bear the Sacred Prize away:</l>
               <l>'Tis they, 'tis they that robs us of that Gem;</l>
               <l>How cou'd we lose it were it not for them?</l>
               <l>Avoid 'em then, with all the gawdy Arts,</l>
               <l>Which they still practise to amuse our Hearts;</l>
               <l>Avoid 'em, as you wou'd avoid their Crimes,</l>
               <l>Or the mad Follies that infest the Times;</l>
               <l>Avoid 'em, as you wou'd the pains of Hell,</l>
