            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

&amp; withall, seeing how coherent the argument hereof is, with the occurrents of this yeare, not so myraculous to the Astronomer, as parturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of spirit, wherin for military &amp; marine matters, as expeditions, plantings, discoueries, &amp; voyages of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest compasse, there is growne so vniuersall a consent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition in this triumphant kingdome, that all Christianitie stands now at the gaze, attending from vs some notable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect &amp; consequence; for these respects, I haue deemed it a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter duety both towards nature &amp; my countrie, by reducing the same into our vulgar language, and so committing it to the presse, to benefite many the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> one, more then my self only, as knowing,
that (according to the <note n="‚Äù" place="margin">
                  <hi>Aristoteles<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> bonum quo communius, eo melius.</hi>
               </note> prince of Philosophers)
<q>a good and profitable thing, the more common it is, the better it is.</q>
And whether this methode may iustly be receiued into the number of things of that opinion, yea or no: I appeale to no other iudge tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to your self: a iudge in this matter so suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, as that this Realme, nay many realmes (I speake that which is impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>cy to deny) cannot produce an equal. There is no man, although but of meane and ordinary insight in the state of things, that is ignorant of the great necessity and commoditie of Methods, and directions to men of all quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: insomuch, that whosoeuer vndertaketh any course or profession without it, is like to the foolish youth, that would needs prooue a Latinist without his Grammer, or to the mad Architect, which went about to set vp a house without his rule and compasse, both whose beginnings were confused, and their conclusions ridiculous.</p>
            <p>I haue heard speech of a wise Gentleman of <hi>Naples,</hi> who sometime for a triall dismissed his son, and gaue him libertie to trauell to certaine other Citties, and territories of <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:12810:3"/>
but without instructions, and vpon his returne, he made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that he had seene men, women, wals, houses, woods, and medowes, but of the state, manners, lawes, gouernement and natures of the people, his simple wit could make no reasonable answere. Many of our owne Nation haue beene taken tardy and tripping in this grosenesse: as diuers Gentlemen verie studious in cases of pollicie, and nauigation, by questions and examinations haue found. In whom the ancient complaint of the Poet hath beene too truely and fully verified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coelum non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt,</hi>
               <q>Some by passing the seas, change ayres but not mindes, </q>retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with brains nothing bettered, &amp; spirits nothing quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the varieties of the world.
I doubt not, but that if our men will vouchsafe the reading, portage, and practise of this pamphlet of notes, (a soueraigne Antidotum, or preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue against the poyson of that disease) the thicke mistes of ignorance, and harde conception will soone be scattered, and the same conuerted into a quicke sight, and illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the senses, so that the traueller (although in that course a Nouice) after his ranginges and peregrinations, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre him selfe a man of skill, and bring more to his home from ouer-seas, than the seruant did to his Maister from <hi>Paules</hi> crosse, which peraduenture was a hat and a cloke, but no profite by doctrine.</p>
            <p>For the patronage of this discourse, as it is the custome, or rather by custome the habite in men of industry, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mende their labours to persons of countenance and iudgement, and for the most part to such as by their owne experience are able to speake of that argument, which the worke presented to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> doth principally prosecute, if either I regarde your selfe, or your present busines, I can not sort &amp; single out a man more fit to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the same may be offered. The matter is respectiue to trauell, and who in that course this day liuing is your supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior?
<pb facs="tcp:12810:4"/>
And by reason of that peerelesnesse, who in the appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, &amp; circumstances thereof, can giue a sounder iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or better censure? And as for the men of seruice that are at this instant to be imployed vnder your charge and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement what precepts are more conuenient for their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation and vse? So that although it may seeme a fault &amp; error, that I (as yet vnknowen) haue in this sort pressed vpon your selfe: yet the loue I beare by duty to my cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>trie, the care I carrie (according to my standing) to further my countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp; the sincere affection (which abounds in me) towards your intended attempt (which the Lord of Hostes blesse and prosper) may iustly excuse me, and mooue you to accept this poore paynes. I confesse, that although my propension was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to indeuor somthing for the inlargeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t of your name and honour, hauing so well deserued of this commonwealth, and of euery particular thereof, yet I was motioned to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>

In the mean time I record his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and mine owne petition to the grand Captaine, and commander of all armies, which is feruent and incessant, for the happy egresse &amp; victorious successe of the expedition present: that the issue thereof may be, his glorie, the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the truth, the confusion of the enimie, the terror of Antichrist, the comfort of the Church, the honour of our Prince, the renowne of our kingdome, and the immortality of your owne name.
