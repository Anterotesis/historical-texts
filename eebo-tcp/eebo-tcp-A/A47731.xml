         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THis little Tract, which was chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd by the Ingenious Author, for the Use and Benefit of young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and others, addicted to the Study of this part of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> who have not leisure, or opportunity to read over the vast Systems of Voluminous Writers, has deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly obtain'd so great a Repute among the Curious, that it is Translated into several Languages. It contains an exact Explication of all the Terms that are attributed to Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Bodies; and, in general, all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the Theory and Practice of a good <hi>Geometrician.</hi> Moreover, therein is exhibited the true Mensuration of <hi>Heights, Lengths, Planes, Solids,</hi> and <hi>Concaves</hi>; as also, the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence call'd <hi>The Transmutation of Bodies</hi>; which is the Subject of the first Part. In the Second, are explain'd the Rules that are observ'd by the <hi>French Engineers</hi> at this day, in raising the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the different Sentiments of the <hi>French</hi> among themselves, as to this Matter; it is likewise shewn wherein their manner of Operation differs from that of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and other Nations. Lastly, The most clear and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Method of <hi>Forti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for the Original of this Science, it is indeed very uncertan; and it is believed by many, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irst Inventers thereof: For in regard that the River <hi>Nile</hi> does every Year overflow the Country of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>; those Inundations which generally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw, and confounded all the Land-Marks, oblig'd the Inhabitants to devise certain Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, by the means whereof, they might be able to distinguish, and adjust the Limits of their respective Grounds from those of their Neighbours, when the Waters were withdrawn: And this Opinion is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be rejected; especially if we consider that <hi>Moses</hi> is generally reputed to have given them the first Rudiments of this Art: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever since there were not very many Men

               </gap> Literature in those early Ages of the World: The <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and <hi>Geometry</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, were, as it were, lock'd up within the Breast of some few Learned and Skilful Artists, until the Time of <hi>Thales,</hi> who first publickly professed them in <hi>Greece</hi>; nevertheless the <hi>Grecians</hi> were not very diligent in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and improving these Noble Sciences, and only taught them privately; neither was there any one that undertook to shew the Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and Necessity of this kind of Learning, until <hi>Euclid</hi> wrote his Elements; which gave occasion to the Publishing of a great Number of excellent Treatises on this Subject, that are now extant.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. Measure these two Triangles by the foregoing Problem; <hi>i. e.</hi> multiply the whole Base DG and GE, by the half of the Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular FG, or the whole Perpendicular by the half of the Base DG and GE.</p>
                           <p>Thus for instance: Let the Base DG be 12 foot, and the Perpendicular FG 10: Take the half of the Perpendicular, <hi>i.e.</hi> 5 feet, and multiply it by the Base of 12 feet, and the sum will be 60 feet, which gives the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea of the Triangle DFG.</p>

If one of the Lines to be multiplied has only fathoms, and the other fathoms and feet; when you multiply, instead of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom take 6 foot. For instance: if you are to multiply 7 fathoms by 8 fathoms and 4 feet, instead of the first sum (seven fathoms) you must put 6 fathoms and 6 feet, because these 6 feet make but one fathom: For since there are no feet expressed, you cannot any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise multiply the feet of the second sum: So the number will be 48 fathoms, and 24 feet: for 6 into 8 gives 48: and 6 into 4 gives 24.</p>

                                 <item>2. Instead of 6 fathoms, take 5 fathoms and 6 feet; and put the first cypher 5 under 8, because they both mark fathoms: take one out of the second cypher 6, so as that there may be but 5 feet to put under the feet of the first sum: divide the foot which you substracted into 12 inches, for 12 inches

                        <p>CErtain it is, that Fortification was Originally very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable; for in regard that Men had nothing to fear at that time but the Assaults of Wild Beasts, and Robbers they had no other Fortifications than simple Hedges, which continued still in use 328 Years before our Saviour; at what time <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great found the <hi>Hircanians</hi> and <hi>Mardians</hi> fortified after that manner, <hi>Q. Curtius, l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 5. Afterwards they fortified themselves with Walls, those Hedges being easie to be cut down. But Ambition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing, in regard that they who coveted Dominion over others, soon found a way to leap over these feeble Defences, they added a Moat, and in making this Moat they raised at the same time a Rampart, behind which the Besieged placed himself, to dispierce the Enemy with their Arrows. The Enemy, not able to surmount these Obstacles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to venture some Arrows, to pass the Moat, and lodge himself at the Foot of the Wall, whence the Besieg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This obliged those within to make Holes in the Walls, by shooting their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows at the Enemy to hinder him from attacking them. For which way soever he came, the <hi>Arb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> of the Walls, to hinder the Enemy from lodging between the Holes in the Wall. True it is, that they soon invented certain Engines which we call at this Day Bartering R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55244:59"/>
they made Roundels, which were look'd upon as a stronger sort of Fortification, till Powder began to be known in <hi>Europe.</hi> For we find in History, that in the Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ar 1380. under the Reign of <hi>Wenleslatis,</hi> the Son of <hi>Charles</hi> the IV, a certain <hi>Franciscan</hi> Monk, whose Name was <hi>Berthold Schwarts</hi> of <hi>Friburg</hi> in <hi>Brisgau,</hi> shewed the first use of Powder to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> then at War with the <hi>Genoeses.</hi> After which they made Cannon to batter Places, the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous execution of which, ranvers'd like a Clap of Thunder those feeble Walls; which obliged them that were attack'd with these astonishing Engines, to erect a good Rampart behind their Walls, and to make the same Walls much thicker than before.</p>
                        <p>This Manner of Fortification would have subsisted a long time, had it not had one defect; which was, that those Round Towers had one part in the form of a Triangle, which could not be seen by those within; and which the Enemy covered to batter, on purpose that he might lodge himself secure from the Shot of the Besieged, who could not see him in that part. To correct this default, they fill'd that defective part with good Earth, which being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with a good Wall, form'd also two Points which look'd toward the Field, as now the Faces of a Bastion, and which covered that part. The Enemy seeing that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to attack those two Faces before any other thing: So that the Besieged found themselves obliged to add Flanks to those Faces, to plant Cannon upon them, and prevent the Enemy from doing so much Mischief to the Faces as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And thus the Bastions were invented, as we see them at this Day built upon the Angle of the Gorge.</p>

                        <p n="1">(1.) Take 127 Fathoms, and two Foot between the Points of the Compass, and make a Circle.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) Take 180 Fathoms, and divide them with the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle into four equal parts: When they are joyned the one to the other, they are called Exterior Sides or Polygons; as A, B, C, D.</p>
                        <p n="3">(3.) Divide one of these four Sides into two equal parts with 90 Fathoms; as E, F, G, H.</p>
                        <p n="4">(4.) Draw from the Points E, F, G, H. streight Lines toward the Center, which are called Perpendiculars; to which must be allowed 22 Fathoms in length, as I, L, M, N.</p>
                        <p n="5">(5.) Set the Rule to the Capital Points A, B, C, D. and draw streight Lines through the end of the Perpendiculars I, L, M, N. at pleasure.</p>
                        <p n="6">(6.) Take 55 Fathoms, and place them upon the Lines drawn from the Capital Points, to mark out the length of the Faces, as a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h.</p>
                        <p n="7">(7.) Take 35 Fathoms, and put them from the Point where the Perpendicular ends, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Point I, L, M, N. upon the Lines tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="8">(8.) Draw the end of the Faces and these Points OPQRSTVX. which terminate the Complement of the Defence, and you will have the Flanks.</p>
                        <p n="9">(9.) Then joyn together the Feet of the Flanks, and you will have the Curtins.</p>

                        <p n="1">(1.) Divide the Flank into three equal parts.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) Divide the first of the three into two other equal parts, to joyn from this Middle, the two Extremities of the first part, on the side of the Moat; and this little Rounding makes the Orillon.</p>

                        <list>
                           <item>(1.) Draw from the Capital Points of the Bastions a small streight Line within side of the Bastion, through the end of the Orillon.</item>
                           <item>(2.) Put five Fathoms upon this Line which you have drawn, as also upon that which is almost parallel to the lower part of the Curtin. This is called the <hi>Brisure.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>(3.) Take the Extremities of the <hi>Brisure</hi> with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, and with that Distance draw two Arches, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersect one another toward the Moat, in Figure 8.</item>

Put the Compass upon that Intersection, and joyn the said Extremities of the <hi>Brisure</hi> together by a crooked Line; and thus you will have the Figure which is made at this Day in <hi>France</hi> in stead of the Flanks, as also the Design of the Entire Square.

ought to make this Parapet, or three Fathoms, parallel also to the Orillon, as far as the Brisure: For there it is, that the Parapet of the Orillon ought to end. As for the Hollow Towers, put as already has been said, three Fathoms, for that is the breadth of the Parape<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="3">(3.) Take a Foot and a half, and draw with that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance a Parallel round about the Parapet, toward the Base of the Rampart, which will represent to you the first Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet; round about which you must draw another Parallel of two Foot to mark out the second.</p>

To draw this Parallel round about the point of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, you must put the Compass of the Overture from 16 to 20 Fathoms upon the said point of the Bastion, and draw a little Rounding from thence to the Parallels of the Faces.</p>
                        <p n="5">(5.) To mark out the Covert Way, take from four to five Fathoms, and carry a Parallel to the Moat; but set i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

J. and G.H. and afterwards with 15 Fathoms you shall make points where the 10 Fathoms terminate, and draw from the said Points, in the point of the Intersection, streight Lines; and this is that which is called the place of Arms.</p>
                        <p n="7">(7.) Take 36 Fathoms, or as much as the Ground will permit, and bring a Parallel round about the Covert Way, and the place of Arms to mark out the Glacis or Parapet of the Covert Way. And thus your Square will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly finished.</p>

                     <p>HAving now treated of the Breadths and Lengths of the parts of a Place, it is requisite to say something of the Heighth of the said parts; or rather after what manner to make the Profil of a Place. To which purpose two things are to be observed.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That you erect the Profil of the Exterior Works af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same manner as that of the Body of the principal Place; provided that you apply thereto the Heighths, of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55244:85"/>
which I shall speak as much as is necessary to be known, whereof the Breadths have been above exhibited.</item>
                        <item>2. That 10 Fathoms of the Scale of which I make use in delineating the Body of the Place, make but one, when I would make the Profil of the same Place. So that 100 Fathoms which I have applyed to the Body of the Place, for this purpose, afford only a Length of 10 Fathoms.</item>

                        <p>FOr Examples sake, let us make the Profil of a Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon; and then observe that which follows.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. Draw a long streight Line, and there mark 11 Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms for the Base of the Rampart, beginning at the Left Hand, as AB.</item>
                           <item>2. Put 1 Fathom 4 Feet immediately behind the Point A, upon the same Line as AC. This Triangle marks out the Interior <hi>Talus.</hi> And to mark out the Exterior <hi>Talus,</hi> put 1 Fathom immediately before B, as BD. But in the Field you must allow larger <hi>Talus</hi> to the Rampart, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Nature of the Ground.</item>
                           <item>3. Erect upon CD two Perpendiculars, each of which contain 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> Fathoms in height, as CE, DF, and then joyn AE, EF, and FB, by a right Line, and that will afford the heighth of the Rampart with its <hi>Talus.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>4. Put 4 Fathoms of the Point E toward the Right Hand, to mark out the Platform of the Rampart, as EG.</item>
                           <item>5. Erect upon G a small Perpendicular of a Foot and a half for the heighth of the first Banquet, as GJ. Then draw from the point J a Parallel to the heighth of the Rampart a Foot and a half broad, as JH; that is, the breadth of the Banquet. Then set another Perpendicular upon the point H, of the same heighth as HJ; and from the point J draw also another Parallel of two Feet broad, as LM, and then you will have both the Banquets.</item>
                           <item>6. Put 4 Feet immediately behind the point G, as GN, and then upon that point erect a Perpendicular of 8 Feet, as NO; which done, joyn the point M, and the point O together to get the Interior heighth of the Parapet with its <hi>Talus.</hi>
                           </item>

                              <pb n="55" facs="tcp:55244:85"/>7. Prolong the Exterior <hi>Talus</hi> BF two Feet farther, as H<hi>P,</hi> and joyn O<hi>P</hi> together to have the breadth of the Parapet with its Exterior <hi>Talus.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>8. Put four Feet upon the first Line behind the point B, as BQ; from which point let fall the Perpendicular QR, of 3 Fathoms, and joyn BR together for the Scarp. Which done, put 20 Fathoms behind the point B, for the breadth of the Moat, as BS, then put two points before the point S, as ST; from whence let fall another Perpendicular of 3 Fathoms, as TV; then joyn VS to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to have the Counterscarp of the same RV, and so the Moat will be entirely represented.</item>
                           <item>10. After this take 36 Fathoms, so far as the Ground will permit, and put them behind the point W, upon the same first Line, as WA, and then joyn them together by a streight Line, to represent the Glacis.

                        <p>For Example: If you would trace a Polygon of five Bastions, which is called a Pentagon, of which every Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Polygon must have the length of the Line given AB, which is 180 fathoms, then proceed thus:

                              <item>1. Fix the Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <item>2. Count from the left hand towards the right an Angle of 108 degrees, which is the Angle of the Exterior Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, to the Pentagon, (if you make an Hexagon, you take this Angle of 120 degrees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) there fix a little Peg, which you may see through the moveable Sights, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, C: That done, fix a Cord or a Chain to the Peg B,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55244:86"/>
and draw a streight Line toward the Point C, upon which you shall then put the length of the first Line given <hi>A</hi>B, as BD.</item>
                              <item>3. Put the Instrument upon the Point D, so that through its Diopters or Sights you may see the Peg B. Then seek by the Rule of the Diopters for the Angle of 108 degrees, and there fix another Peg, which you may see through the Diopters, as DE. That done, draw a streight Line from the Point D to the Point E, and then put the length of the Line BD upon the Line DE, as DF.</item>
                              <item>4. Do this as many times as is requisite for a Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</item>
                              <item>5. Divide the Flank into three equal parts, and the first also into two others, in the middle of which fix the Peg H. Then fasten the Chain to the Point H, and draw the Rounding, as upon Paper, with the Compass: That done, draw the Brisures of 5 fathoms, and make in their Extremities two Arches to cut each other in I.

                        <p>DIvide the Circumference of the Diameter, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 360 Degrees, by the number of the Bastions of your Fortress, and the Product of that Division will make

the Overture, or Angle of the Center. For Example: Let us seek the Angle of the Center of a Pentagon; to which purpose, you must divide 360 Degrees by 5. For in regard our Fortress has no more than five Bastions, a larger Divisor cannot be taken: So that the Product of the Division being 72, we must say, that the Angle of the Center of a Pentagon has 72 Degrees of Overture.</p>

the Angle of the Gorge of a Pentagon, you must from 180 Degrees substract 72; for that is the Angle of the Center of a Pentagon: Then observe what remains, which will be 108 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and say, That the Angle has 108 Degrees of Overture.</p>

                        <p>AS for the Angle of the Bastion, and all the rest, it is impossible to know what their Overtures are, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they are not always the same: So that it depends upon the knowledge of the Engineer to make the Flanks, so that they may form a good Angle of the Bastion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which almost all the rest take their measures. Consult our Authors upon this matter. Nevertheless we shall here set down the Overtures of the principal Angles after our manner of Fortification.</p>

                        <p>THis Angle has occasioned great Disputes among the most part of the Ancients, who have Treated of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification: For some were of opinion, that this Angle was to be always acute; others, that it only ought to be so in the Hexagon, and that it ought to be Right in Figures of more than 6 Bastions; and this was the usual practice of M. <hi>Antoine de Ville.</hi> Others there are who maintain the contrary, and say, That the acute Angle is never to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of, but in Figures that are under 6 Bastions, and that it always ought to be Obtuse in a Fortess which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that number. True it is, that the greatest number have been for the right Angle; and it were a sort of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance to maintain the contrary, <hi>Morsheus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But he soon altered his opinion, maintaining that this A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to a Dodecagon of 90 deg. <hi>Goldman</hi> makes use of this Angle for a Square of 65 deg. for a Pentagon of 69 deg. for a Hexagon of 75 deg. for a Heptagon of 79 deg. 17 m. for an Octogon of 82 deg. 30 min. for an Enneagon of 85 deg. for a Decagon of 87 deg. for an Hendecagon of 88 deg. 38 min. for a Dodecagon of 90 deg. <hi>Pascha</hi> takes it for a Square of 60 fathoms, and augments it still by five, according as the Polygon gains more of the Side. But they who have been accounted most skilful in the Art of <hi>Fortification,</hi> were always, as I have said, for the Right Angle, thô it be alledged, that in making it Acute, there is room for more Firing from the Curtains; or that in making it Obtuse, it is more capable to withstand the Enemies Batteries, and the Injuries of Time. The reason that kept them so fix'd to this Opinion, was, that in their time they made their Breaches with the Cannon, so that this Angle being Right, it had all the perfection that could be desired; whereas the making it Obtuse, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished the Capaciousness of the Bastion, and of its Flank; besides, that the same Battery could play upon both Fronts: And by making it Acute, the Point of it was so soon broken by the frequent discharges; more especially, if several Guns played at a Time; besides, that bad Weather more easily ruined that Point. But to speak the truth, we ought to believe, that this Angle, whether Right, Acute, or Obtuse, ought never to trouble our Thoughts, provided it be not less than 60 degrees, nor much more than 100: For the Breaches are now made by Mining, wherein there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>o more trouble to carry the Point of a Bastion with an Obtuse Angle, than with an Angle either Right or Acute. Moreover, there is this in it, that Breaches are rarely made in the Point of a Bastion, but in one of the Fronts, to the end, that in passing the Moat the Assailants may not be exposed to more than one Firing; so that provided the Angle be well able to resist the Injuries of Time, it is enough. However, much more than 100 degrees are not to be exceeded, because that being more open, it would require the Capital Line to be short; in which case, the Bastion would not have room sufficient.</p>

                        <p>ENgineers cannot agree concerning the Overture of the Flank; so that every one orders it according to his Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <hi>Erbard</hi> makes the Flank perpendicular to the Faces of the Bastions; and his Reason is, because the Flanks, being oblique above the Curtain, that is to say, making an acute Angle with it, are much more exposed to the Enemy, and consequently more difficult to be ruin'd, as not being batter'd by the Cannon but very obliquely: But granting that this were so, it is no less a Truth to say, that as they are but little expos'd, so neither do they not survey very far; and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to make good Embrasures upon a Parapet, ordered after that manner. For to play the Cannon above the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, is to make it impossible to preserve it in a good condition; besides that a Flank disposed after that manner, can never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Passage of the Moat, nor flank the Breach, nor in the last place, uncover the covert Ways.

But here is a new Method; which though it be not better, however it is as good.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. After the Out-Lines of the Fortress are drawn, divide the Flank of one of the Bastions into three equal parts, and the Face of the opposite Bastion into two, as, A, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="3">3. Divide this same Third part of the Flank, into two equal parts; as FG, and GD<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> from which Point G, erect a Perpendicular of about two fathoms, as GH. Lastly, Set the Compass upon the Point H, and so draw the Rounding of the <hi>Orillon,</hi> joyning FD, together.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Draw from the re-entring Angle of the Moat P a streight Line through the Angle of the Curtain L, prolonged in the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55244:92"/>
Body of the Place, of an equal bigness to the Line DE; that is to say, of five Fathoms, as, KI; to the end that you may have the <hi>Brisure,</hi> where you may place the piece of Cannon that points towards the Half Moon, &amp; cannot be batter'd from the Field; because it is, as it were, covered by the <hi>Ravelin.</hi> Lastly, To make the Rounding of the Flank retir'd, take the Distance KE, between the Points of the Compass, and make Sections toward the Moat, in L; from whence after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards draw the Arch from K to F.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be said, but that these <hi>Orillons</hi> are very good; for these Roundings give less advantage to the Enemies Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and enlarge the room, as well for placing the Cannon, as for the Musketeers. If you object, That the Distance from that part where the Enemy may pass the Moat, is too great.

                     <p>Upon this Method, Monsieur <hi>de Clermont</hi> observes, That the <hi>Orillon</hi> of the Square would be too little, if you allow it no more than the Third Part of the Flank, as to the <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons</hi>; and therefore he requires Two Fifth Parts of the same Flank, for the <hi>Orillon.</hi> See the Plate P. <hi>Fig.</hi> XXII. at the end of the Third Book.</p>

the Thickness of the Parapet is good, when it is not less than 18 Feet, nor broader than 24. For being weaker, the Parapet cannot long resist the force of the great Shot, which would soon level it with the Earth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Heighth of the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part he thinks sufficient if it be but 3 Fathoms; and he raises the said Rampart above the level of the Feild three Fathoms. <hi>Monsieur Clermont</hi> would have the fourth part of the Face allowed for the Base of the Rampart, or in the Feild from 8 to 12 Fathoms: believing that a larger breadth would not only be useless, but also prejudicial, by reason of the great space of Ground it would take up, and the vast quantity of Earth it would require. <hi>Monsieur de Vauban</hi> never makes the Basis larger than 11 Fathoms, alledging the same reason that <hi>Monsieur Clermont</hi> brings. The heighth of his Rampart never exceeds four Fathoms, whether to cover the Houses of the Place, or to command the Enemies approaches: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lower, the Garison within could never command the Enemies Works.

The upper Breadth of the Rampart ought to be from 4, to 6 Fathoms; for being too narrow, it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that the Parapet should be made too broad to consume the rest of the Earth, appointed for the Rampart; besides that it would be prejudicial, because too broad a Parapet hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Soldiers from the sight of the Moat; and being too large, the remainder of the Earth would not suffice to make

                     <p>IN regard that every Fortress ought to be environed with a Moat, we shall briefly examine which sort of Moats are first to be preferred. Some make them broad, others narrow, one draws the Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ly, one is for a dry Ditch, another for a Moat that is full of Water. One prefers a Moat very deep, but not so broad; another would have it broad, but not so deep. Let us examine every one of these in order. The Count of <hi>Pagan</hi> makes his Moat for a <hi>Tetragon</hi> 16 Fathoms broad; and for <hi>Polygons</hi> of 20, his depth does not exceed 4 Fathoms. Mons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eur <hi>Clermont</hi> takes from 16 to 20 Fathoms, for the Breadth of the Moat, without any regard to the Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Bastions; and makes it hollow from 18 to 20 Feet. <hi>Fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> would have it broad from 15 to 25 Paces, and deep from 15 to 25 Feet. <hi>Cellarius</hi> makes his Moat 3 Fathoms deep,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55244:96"/>
and broad at the top about 19, and at the bottom near 13. Monsieur <hi>de Vauban</hi> prefers Monsieur <hi>Clermont</hi>'s Way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the rest, as to the Breadth and Depth of the Moat: For as to the way of drawing out the Moat, Monsieur <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> makes it narrower toward the Point of the Bastion than toward the other Parts; more especially if the Flanks are large; for he says that otherwise, it would be requisite that the Moat should be as large as the Length of the Flank, or else much more narrow; and in the first case there would be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of making it very shallow, which would render it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, for that the Enemy would easily shoulder himself into it. And supposing it were of a reasonable Depth, there would be Ground which no body would know what to do with, by reason of the extraordinary Wideness. And in the second case, there would be one side of the Flank, that would not uncover the Moat, which would be against the Rules of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Others answer first, that if the Moat were as large as the Flank, with a moderate Depth, that Wideness would hinder the Enemy from crossing the Moat without great loss of his Men. But if the depth were a little more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and it should be asked, what should be done with the Earth taken out of the Moat; they reply, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>twould make the <hi>Glacis.</hi> The learned may judge as they please; but for my part, I hold with them, that are for making the Moat parallel to the Line of Defence. If they still object<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that the rounding of the Moat being as large as in other Places, all the whole Curtain and Face of the opposite Bastion cannot be discovered; we must answer, that if they would uncover those Parts above the rounding, they ought to make no Moat at all, because the Point of the Bastion it self is not proper for that. Add to this, that if the Moat be made narrower toward the Point of the Bastion, the Enemy having once gain'd the Point, the Earth of which is fill'd one part of the Moat, he will easily pass it by, throwing B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>vins over the Ruins of the Bastions, which will shew him, as I may so say, the way to enter directly into the Bastion.</p>
                     <p>The next Question is, whether a Moat full of Water is to be preferred before a dry Moat; which a distinction between the great and small Places will quickly decide. As for great
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55244:96"/>
Fortresses, it cannot be deny'd but that dry Moats are to be preferred before those full of Water. Some will object, that a Moat full of Water secures a Place against Scaladoes and Surprizes; besides that, is very hard to be filled up; and that it affords great Trouble to the Enemy, that would either pass it, or cover himself, or fight within it: And that on the other side, besides that a dry Ditch is extremely exposed to Surprizes, very easie to be filled up, and no less easie to be passed; it is very proper to cover the Enemy in making of Mines, by means of which he may blow up a great Part of the Place. But I answer to this, that as well a Moat full of Water hinders the Sallies of those within, without the help of Boats, which make so great a noise, that 'tis impossible but the Out-Sentinels near the Place besieged, must hear it; and the same that is to be said of the Sallies, is to be said of the Retreats. Beside, if the Water that fills the Moat be not a running Stream, it begets an unwholsome Air, causes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Distempers, and renders the Soldiers less courageous, by reason of the noisome Stenches that arise out of it; and on the other side, besides that, a dry Moat is more commodious for Sallies, and safe Retreats; there is no Fear of Sickness proceeding from noisome Water, and unwholsome Air. To say something of the Convenience of Mines, which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my has to make, you must make a <hi>Cuvette,</hi> or little Dike in the middle of the Moat from 15 to 20 Foot broad, and very deep; for the deeper it is, the better it is: Surround it with a good Parapet with Palisadoes round about; and so you will be secure from Mines and Surprizes. As for little Fortresses, a Moat full of Water is better than a dry, because Sallies, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats, and Succors, are not so necessary as in great Places. The Moat is also to be rounded before the Point of the Bastion, to the end that it may be of the same Wideness quite through, and that it may not advance too far into the Field; which it would do if it were pointed. You may also set a Corps du Guard upon this Rounding, the better to defend the Covert way. Lastly, When you would line the Moat, they never allow it any great <hi>Talus</hi> or Sloaping; only they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it such as the Earth of the Rampart, and the Moat gives it of it self.</p>

                     <p>In short, there are some Engineers, who make a little Moat about the <hi>Glacis,</hi> though others practice quite contrary. The first pretend that the Earth taken out of the Moat, serves to fortifie the <hi>Glacis,</hi> and secure the Covert-way. On the other side it is said, that the Avant-Moat serves only to hinder the Sallies and Retreats of the Garrison: and this Reason prevails; for if you have need of Earth, the better to secure your cover'd Way, you may make the Moat of the Body of the Place deep, and employ the Earth which you take from thence, for that purpose. If you think that this Moat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents Surprizes, and the Approaches of the Enemy; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that a good wide <hi>Glacis</hi> will do the same, without being at so much Charge for an Avant-Moat Nevertheless sometimes they are constrained to environ the <hi>Glacis</hi> with such a Moat: They make it five Fathoms wide, and two deep.

                     <p>This Covert-way has no other Security than the <hi>Glacis,</hi> which serves it for a Parapet round about.

In short, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be suffered about the <hi>Glacis,</hi> that may favour the Enemy in his Approaches: So that if the <hi>Glacis</hi> be higher than five Foot above the Covert way, you must put one or two <hi>Banquets</hi> below, as need shall require for the short statu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>HEre it is, that some will ask me why the <hi>French</hi> admit no <hi>False Brayes</hi> in their Fortifications, as being a second Defence, and an admirable Work to dispute the Counterscarp with the Enemy, and to hinder him from crossing the Moa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. Moreover it is certain, that small Shot does more Execution from a low than a high Place. Besides, that the small Shot placed in the False Bray, doubles the Defence of it, as that Work doubles the Defence of the Place. But if you talk of the Defence; Why do you then put the Counterscarp before the Faces, knowing that those Parts defend nothing? You will answer, that this is to dispute the Passage of the Moat.

As for the part of the False <hi>Bray</hi> that is before the Curtain, it is no longer good, because it does not flank the Faces of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, nor hinder the Passage of the Moat, which is objected always for the principal Reason. Nevertheless the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that Work, which is before the Flank, will be good: But know that this part is easily rendered unserviceable, by the Ruine of the Rampart, and the Parapet of the Flank, which falling within side, fills up its Platform: And if the Rampart be lin'd, the Splinters of it maim the Soldiers, that guard that Flank of the False <hi>Braye.</hi> To remedy which Defects, the French now adays erect <hi>Tenailles</hi> in the Moat before the Curtain, and before the Flanks separated from the Body of the Place, by a little Moat, to the end the fall of the Rampart of the Body of the Place may not kill or wound those that are in it, being lined with Walls There is nothing of all that you talk of False Brays, that can be attributed to these Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nailles; besides that they cast not the half of what those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Works do.</p>

                        </gap> there are certain Maxims, according to which they may be environ'd with a passable Fortification. For Example:
<list>
                           <item>1. Every irregular Fortification ought to be made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Maxims of the regular as near as may be.</item>

                           <item>4. No Face ought to exceed 60 Fathoms.</item>

                     <p>TO avoid much Labour, you must fortifie the parts of an Old Fortification, and finish them, in the same manner as they were begun; unless they are gone utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to decay; and then you may make what alterations you please. To the end therefore, that Money may be laid out to good purpose, when the Flanks are repaired, they must allow an Overture of 100 deg. If the Faces are tolerable, let them alone as they are, to avoid the vast expence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> in making others. Whence it comes to pass, that there is no ancient place which is fortifi'd after the <hi>French</hi> manner, because the Engineers have been always forc'd to labour upon <hi>Dutch</hi> Fortifications. As for the Rampart and Parapet, they may be better fortifi'd whatever Face they have. But to come to the Thing it self, let us observe the following Rules:</p>

The <hi>Small Petard.</hi> The Battering Piece is 10 Feet long, The Bullet about six Inches Diameter, and weighs 33 pounds. requiring two pounds of Powder at least, to charge it; and it carries directly forward 360 Fathoms. At the distance of 100 Fathoms, it pierces two Fathoms of clos'd Earth. If it be not well setled, it pierces two fathoms and a half; and if the Earth be poor, and hungry, it pierces four fathoms, You may discharge it eighty times in a day. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non slings a Bullet of 48 pounds, 400 feet distance, and pierces a Rampart of good and well clos'd Earth 20 feet deep. A half Piece of Battery carries a Bullet of 24 pounds, at 300 feet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and enters twelve feet of good Earth. The <hi>Falcon</hi> carries a twelve pounder 200 feet off, and enters 7 feet into a good Parapet.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Small Petard</hi> cannot break a double Gate well barr'd.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Great Petard,</hi> fix'd to a weak Gate, usually makes no more than a Hole; and the greatest Execution it can produce, is to break the fore part of it.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing can stop the Execution of Mines, as they make them at present; nevertheless there must be a Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Petards, the Mines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Powder.</p>

                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> A Musquet carries 120 Fathoms, and if double charged 150, though it will kill a Man above 300 Paces. Discharg'd very near it will pierce two Planks two Fingers thick: but discharg'd at 50 Paces, it enters according to the substance of the Body it meets with. We shall insist no longer on these things at this time; intending to speak more amply of them in another Treatise, where we shall shew the manner how to attack a Place.</p>
