            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>WISE Men begin at th' Enterprises End,</l>
               <l>Sense shou'd the Aim, ere 'tis an Act, commend;</l>
               <l>With Courtiers, Fencers, Lawyers, Poets still</l>
               <l>Boldness makes up, their want of Force, or Skill;</l>
               <l>And Zeal is oft, the Pious Fools Excuse,</l>
               <l>Whose rude Pray'r is the Deity's Abuse;</l>
               <l>So when defaming Libels flie abroad,</l>
               <l>Profaneing the high Name of earthly God,</l>

I too, scarce hold taking great Name in vain,</l>
               <l>Must with new insolence, of theirs complain;</l>
               <l>Who thinks your Name by Slaves can lessen'd be,</l>
               <l>Do's to your Honour, but more Injury;</l>
               <l>Of all your Provinces, yet ne're was known,</l>

                  <hi>Parnassus</hi> (Sir) Rebellious to the Crown,</l>
               <l>Province of Wit, more than the rest your own</l>
               <l>Tho Poets still, by Courts were kept Threadbare,</l>
               <l>In Verse, for Monarchy, true Wits declare,</l>
               <l>A Wit's your true, Indigent Officer</l>
               <l>Still out of Royal Sight, kept below Stairs,</l>

               <l>If Royal Bounty, ought to Stranger throws,</l>

I am the only Spaniel of the Crown,</l>
               <l>Kick'd out, and yet must still be hanging on,</l>
               <l>The kinder too, for being but ill us'd,</l>
               <l>To baffled me, why is Court-grace refus'd?</l>
               <l>Where 'tis Preferment, but to be abus'd.</l>
               <l>But Poet 'mongst State-Lyars can't put in,</l>
               <l>And Wit with Politicks, scarce ere there, seen,</l>
               <l>The only bashful Lyar too, comes there,</l>
               <l>And only hungry, ill clad, Flatterer;</l>
               <l>Flatt'ry with Wit, like Paint on a good Face,</l>
               <l>Instead of setting off, heightning Disgrace,</l>
               <l>And Flattery makes Wit thought counterfit,</l>
               <l>As red, which does appear too plain to sight,</l>
               <l>Renders suspected, undawb'd neighb'ring White;</l>
               <l>Wit, like unfarded Beauty, will appear,</l>
               <l>Still best bare-fac'd, and when Men peep most near;</l>
               <l>Yet <hi>Fucus</hi> Flattery's too hard for Wit,</l>
               <l>Tho by Wits shelter she do's safest sit,</l>
               <l>

Mole Flatterer, sole danger of great Men,</l>
               <l>Who raises levels up, whilst Heart's unseen,</l>
               <l>Heaving loose Hills, for trampling proud Court foot,</l>
               <l>In unsmooth Court paths, still to spurn about;</l>
               <l>Court-Underminers, are still trod upon,</l>
               <l>Yet to destroy them, each great Man has one;</l>
               <l>As Elephants have Mice to eat 'em down;</l>
               <l>The Horse, has lurking Bot, the Dog his Worm,</l>
               <l>Poet, has Worm call'd Wit, to do him harm;</l>
               <l>Each Mortal, do's own Bane about him bear,</l>
               <l>So great Prince has, his sticking Flatterer;</l>
               <l>Flattery copper Coin to current Wit,</l>
               <l>Tho so Court current, ne're pass'd with you, yet;</l>
               <l>That Ivy of Court Cedars, whose Embrace,</l>
               <l>Hinders its high Stocks growth, its worst disgrace,</l>
               <l>Destruction to best Pallaces high walls,</l>
               <l>Whil'st from her clinging growth, huge Fabrick falls;</l>
               <l>But you hate Flattery, as you love Wit,</l>
               <l>Bold Flattery, always too hard for it;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:33325:4"/>
For Flatterers, tho you low Race disown,</l>
               <l>Still think themselves, Appendixes o'th' Crown,</l>
               <l>So sticking Sploach, Golds lustre will deface,</l>
               <l>And Cobwebs oft, hang safest on high place,</l>
               <l>To Courts, perpetual hanging on, Disgrace;</l>
               <l>Wit like your Robes, none but you there have on,</l>
               <l>Easie Majestick free, to be aim'd at by none;</l>
               <l>In Conversation make no diff'rence yet,</l>
               <l>Distinguish'd then as first but by your Wit,</l>
               <l>Which like your Gold, from you do's freely flow,</l>
               <l>Fountain of Honor, Wealth, nay true Wit too,</l>
               <l>You are a Tyrant only by your Wit,</l>
               <l>Tormenting aiming Coxcombs still with it,</l>
               <l>And no bold Talker can safe near you sit;</l>
               <l>You never triumph, tho you overcome,</l>
               <l>Not by your Checks, but Wit, make Talkers dumb;</l>
               <l>Monarch of Wit, have all Wits in your pow'r,</l>
               <l>Yet ne're made Man blush, who cou'd blush before;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:33325:5"/>
Nay let too, forward dapper Wit, alone,</l>
               <l>'Till that his own bold Nonsence runs him down;</l>
               <l>So an ill Fencer falls by his own Sword,</l>
               <l>The more he pushes, the more out of guard;</l>
               <l>But you, Wit, like your Justice (Sir) all know,</l>
               <l>More than in punishment in mercy show,</l>
               <l>Tho if provok'd none can be sharper too;</l>
               <l>But sparing is the part of gen'rous Wit,</l>
               <l>Whilst rambling Fools shot, do's all round it, hit;</l>
               <l>Loud half Wits, as loud half Braves, bloody'st are,</l>
               <l>In their Wits fury, Man, nor Woman, spare;</l>
               <l>But true Wits, like your Spaniels have alone,</l>
               <l>Their Master Friend, by th'Crowd, kick'd, trod upon;</l>
               <l>Wits small great Party, you alone (Sir) are,</l>
               <l>Yet Poet, at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> sole Flatterer,</l>
               <l>Who by the Rules of Court, is left to starve,</l>
               <l>If not Wit, lying shou'd the Wretch preserve,</l>
               <l>Where cutting Friends up do's Knaves mouthfuls carve;</l>
               <l>

And palling Flattery, helps Fools to dine,</l>
               <l>But cou'd Wits force, with Flattery once join,</l>
               <l>It ne're cou'd have, improsperous design;</l>
               <l>For Wit, with Flattery, like Force with Art,</l>
               <l>Lay's open fencing Courtiers cover'd heart;</l>
               <l>'Gainst lurking Flattery, few men there are,</l>
               <l>Who want their weak side, or do not lie bare;</l>
               <l>None but you (Sir) for Flattery too high,</l>

               <l>But your Great Name can never greater grow,</l>
               <l>By Heaven, Fame, World, Me, nay not by You;</l>
               <l>Fame Poets, Flatterers, Courts Lying Crew,</l>
               <l>In speaking Short of you, do not speak True.</l>
               <l>Their Praise, more than <hi>Whiggs</hi> Malice, will decry,</l>
               <l>And but Besmear Names, they wou'd Glorify;</l>
               <l>Lying Fools praise, or love, worst Injury.</l>
               <l>But <hi>Whigg!</hi> That Burlesque little paultry sound,</l>
               <l>In Ballad Verse, fit only to be found;</l>
               <l>Where your great Name is Sung, it shoud be drown'd.</l>
               <l>Yet I more lessen you Sir, now I fear,</l>
               <l>But when hir'd Pens against your Fame appear,</l>
               <l>What block cou'd help, being Verse-volunteer.</l>
               <l>When Pentionary Quills rebel 'gainst Fame,</l>
               <l>And draw upon the Noblest suff'ring Name,</l>
               <l>I boldly take my Courage, from their Shame.</l>

Yet I, perhaps may do Great Name more wrong,</l>
               <l>By short blunt Pralse, than edgeless Satyr long,</l>
               <l>Their wicked Will is, tho' their force not strong,</l>
               <l>Great is their Rage, who will expose their own,</l>
               <l>Your Sacred Reputation to bring down.</l>
               <l>Such flatt'ring foe-friends of Kings Purse and Crown,</l>

               <l>Let Verse which was their Bellies, not Heads crime,</l>
               <l>Be'ts punishment, in Unpoetick time:</l>
               <l>Instead of Living, may they starve by Ryme.</l>
               <l>Be like their VVritings, both short-liv'd and torn,</l>
               <l>By praise of Fools and Knaves, grow VVise mens scorn:</l>
               <l>VVho like sed Dogs, 'gainst absent bounty bay,</l>
               <l>Snapping that Hand, on which their wants did prey.</l>
               <l>Moon-Barkers so 'gainst the VVorlds second Light,</l>
               <l>VVith false Alarms disturb the quiet Night:</l>
               <l>For shutting out themselves, loud Noise still keep,</l>
               <l>And will not let those of their own House sleep.</l>
