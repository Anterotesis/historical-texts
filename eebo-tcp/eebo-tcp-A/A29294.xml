            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOthing was wanting to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the Happineſs of this
Fortunate Slave, but to fall into
the hands of ſo Generous a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
as your Lordſhip. And I
who had undertaken to furniſh
him, was willing to find him one
ſo qualified, that he might have
reaſon to be well pleaſed with my
Choice. To whom then could I
<pb facs="tcp:103330:3"/>
with more Reaſon Addreſs my
ſelf for making this Preſent, than
to a Lord, who by Excellent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
as well as Eminent Birth,
every day gains Slaves and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to himſelf. To ſatisfie any
of the truth of what I ſay, they
need not make a particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
or hearken after the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Atteſtations of this Kingdom.
The Fame of your Glory extends
beyond <hi>England;</hi> there is not in
<hi>Europe</hi> a Court, where it hath
not arrived, to gain you the Heart
and Admiration of the beſt. But,
my Lord, to know your Merit
more perfectly, we need only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the particular eſteem always
had for you by the greateſt and
moſt diſcerning Monarch in the
World; the choice he hath made
of your Perſon for the greateſt
Employments of War, and the
moſt important Negotiations of
Peace; the weight and ſtreſs he
<pb facs="tcp:103330:3"/>
lays on your Advice, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
wherewith he relies on
the clearneſs of your Judgment,
and greatneſs of your Capacity
in his Council. How fair a Field,
my Lord, are your Praiſes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
on, were my Faculties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to my Subject, or my
Offerings of value anſwerable to
the Dignity of the Perſon they
are made to, but the Enterprize
is too vaſt and too difficult for
ſuch an Author as I; and your
Glory ſtands ſo ſure in that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
eſteem the whole World
hath for you, that it hath no
need of new Elogies or Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks.
It becomes me better to
ſtudy your Pleaſure: The Happy
Slave hath an impatient deſire to
entertain your leiſure hours with
the Relation of his Adventures.
And if he prove ſo happy, as not
to diſpleaſe you, I ſhall eſteem it
the higheſt piece of good Fortune
<pb facs="tcp:103330:4"/>
he hath met with in his Life; at
leaſt, I believe he cannot deſire
any thing with greater paſſion,
unleſs it be, that he who hath
taken the Liberty to preſent him
to you, may with all due reſpect
ſubſcribe himſelf,</p>

            <p>THE Book I Publiſh ſcarce deſerves
an Advertiſement. But that I
give you, is not to beſpeak the Criticks
in my favour. I cannot believe any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Wit will exerciſe his Faculty on a
Trifle, which perhaps I have ſpent leſs
time to Compoſe, than he muſt to cenſure.
But 'tis becauſe ſome Perſons having ſmall
kindneſs for an Author, have been pleaſed
heretofore to comment on my Tables, to
make ſtories of my ſtories, and to ſtretch
my fancy to conjectures which never came
into my Head: It were eaſie for me to
juſtifie my ſelf in this particular, if it
were deſired; but I conceive my manner
of proceeding hath ſufficiently done it, to
Dedicate it to one of the Principal Lords
of the Kingdom, a Book, ſuch as they
make my former, by their ſtrange inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
to be, and to put my Name to
it, was it not the way to gain my ſelf
Enemies, and utterly ruine me? I have
<pb facs="tcp:103330:5"/>
committed faults in my time, but never of
this nature. Therefore I declare to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and eſpecially to thoſe who buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in penetrating into other mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
that under the literal ſenſe of my
Tales there is not hid any Allegorical mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that when I ſpeak of the <hi>Turks</hi> and
of <hi>Africk,</hi> I have not any <hi>Ideas</hi> in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
or any other Nation, and that they
will make me think quite otherwiſe than
I think, if they make me ſpeak any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than I ſpeak, if the Intrigues or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
I write of, have ſome conformity
to thoſe of our times, I am not to anſwer
for it: 'Tis the fault of Chance and not
mine. There are ſo many in Love, that
though Love takes infinite ways, they can
hardly avoid meeting ſometimes: were
Writers confined to entertain you only with
things rare and extraordinary, they would
be ſoon drawn dry, and all their ſtories
quickly exhauſted; the Reader is intreated
to do me Juſtice herein, and not pay me
with ingratitude for the Preſents I make
him of my Toys: This ſhall be followed by
a Second Part, where the Hiſtory of <hi>Laura,</hi>
who ſhall bear the principal part in it, ſhall
be matter of Gallantry, and far exceed this
of the <hi>Sultaneſs.</hi>

               <head>THE
HAPPY SLAVE,
A Novel.</head>
               <p>AFRICK, for ſome Ages,
hath paſt for a part of the
World, where the People
were no leſs Cruel and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
than the Lions and Tygers that
fill the Deſarts of that Countrey: But
ſince the diſcovery of Love there, it
hath appear'd, that as Love grows in
all Countreys, ſo <hi>Barbary</hi> it ſelf hath
nothing of Barbarous but the Name.
To verifie this, I ſhall entertain you
with a piece of Gallantry acted there,
which may juſtifie what I affirm.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>ALEXANDER,</hi> a young
<hi>Roman</hi> Lord, very conſiderable for
Eſtate, (but more for Birth and Parts,)
had ſcarce appear'd to act his part on
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103330:6"/>
the great Theatre of the World, but
he found himſelf preſt by his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to Marry: He was handſom,
high ſpirited, and witty, as thoſe of
Old <hi>Rome,</hi> but addicted to Pleaſure,
as thoſe of the New; humourſome,
and wholly given up to the purſuit of
his Fancy and Inclinations. As for
Marriage (upon the good Advice he
had received not to engage, but as
late as he could,) he uſually ſaid,
<hi>What a pitiful Utenſil a Wife is?</hi> witneſs
the greateſt part of thoſe Gentlemen
dignified with the Illuſtrious Title of
Husbands; eſpecially now a days, when
Men ſeem to have Wives onely for
this, That others may make uſe of
them.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conſequences he drew, as
well from Experience as Example; for
being Young, Handſom, and Rich;
he was ſufficiently qualified not to fail
of good Fortune, with a Sex (in our
Age) very kind and ſuſceptible, and
had not wanted his divertiſements of
that Nature; and therefore he had
ſmall inclination by taking a Wife, to
give others the Opportunity to pay
him in his own Coin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:103330:6"/>
In the mean time the Intereſts of
the Family (which often prove Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to the greateſt pleaſures of Life)
obliging the moſt excellent Perſons to
ordinary Actions: The Young <hi>Roman,</hi>
to deliver himſelf from the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Relations, choſe rather to quit
the Pleaſures of <hi>ROME,</hi> by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
abroad, than to make himſelf
ſubject to a Law ſo contrary to his
Humour, and that beloved Liberty
he preferred before all things. He
communicated his deſign to his <hi>Valett
de Chambre,</hi> who had ſerved him long,
and being active and ingenious, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
took order to have all things in
readineſs that were neceſſary for their
purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Spring was come, and the
Weather ſeaſonable for Travel, when
on a fair day the Young Gentleman
and his Servant privately left <hi>Rome,</hi>
and Imbarqued at <hi>Civita Vecchia</hi> in a
<hi>Felucca</hi> hired for the purpoſe. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
was to viſit the beſt Courts of
<hi>Europe,</hi> beginning with that of <hi>Spain.</hi>
But there are Perſons over whom For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
is ſo rigorouſly imperious, that
ſhe ſeems jealous of any thing they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103330:7"/>
undertake, without conſulting her
firſt. 'Twas ſhe who provided Count
<hi>Alexander</hi> a Voyage into <hi>Africk,</hi> when
he had deſigned to confine his Travels
to <hi>Europe:</hi> Of the Towns he was to
ſee, <hi>Tunis</hi> was marked out by Fortune
for one; and though much out of his
Road, yet where Fortune intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,
there always happens ſomething
extraordinary; her exceſſes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies
being that which chiefly
makes us take notice of her.</p>
               <p>The fourth day after he had left
<hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> this Young Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to perceive, that though all the
Elements are terrible at Sea, yet Men
who are Enemies are more terrible
than the Elements. Till then the
Weather had been fair to extremity,
not a puff of contrary Wind: He
proceeded in his Voyage with what
ſpeed he could wiſh, and bleſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
at the happineſs of the Weather.</p>
               <p>The Coaſt of <hi>Italy</hi> is dangerous,
eſpecially in Summer, being then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to In-roads by People of the South,
whoſe livelihood is Robbery; and
when the Weather is fair, their Trade
is ſo great, that whoſoever is not upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103330:7"/>
his Guard, is happy if he eſcape them;
I mean the Corſairs of <hi>Barbary.</hi> Count
<hi>Alexander,</hi> who never thought he had
left <hi>Rome,</hi> to be led in Triumph to <hi>Tunis,</hi>
ſaw himſelf at break of day ſaluted
by a <hi>Brigandine</hi> of that Nation: The
poor Seamen preſently took <hi>Alarm,</hi>
the ſight of one Turban was ſufficient
to affright them: And the <hi>Turks</hi> had
ſcarce diſcharged three or four Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets
at the Chriſtians, but they leapt
into the Sea to ſave themſeves by
ſwimming; the <hi>Italian</hi> Count and his
Servant ſtaid in the Veſſel, not in hopes
of being able to defend themſelves
againſt that number of Enemies,
which the ſtrength of <hi>Rollando,</hi> and
the Inchanted Armour of <hi>Amadis</hi>
could ſcarcely have done, (whereas
now a Man is but a Man, and among
other Secrets that of Inchanting Arms
is loſt.) But having no skill in ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
he could not expect to eſape
as the Mariners: Yet he was not ſo
out of love with his Life, but that he
held it better to be a Slave than be
drowned. But that thoſe Barbarous
Corſairs might ſee what a Perſon they
dealt with, and that he might ſell his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103330:8"/>
Liberty as dear as poſſible; having
commanded his Servant to throw his
Baggage over-board, he gave him
order what further to do. I will omit
the Deſcription of the Action, though
reputed the moſt glorious ever done
on the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> being a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
of Two againſt Thirty, whereof
they laid ſix dead on the Deck, and
many more wounded. 'Twas an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
of a Herd of Wolves againſt
Two young Lions, who defended
themſelves with unparallel'd Valour
and Courage. 'Tis true, the <hi>Turks</hi>
(not to loſe the Money they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from their Ranſom) ſpared them
at firſt, uſing Cudgels only againſt
them; but at length the Blood and
Death of their Comrades, and the
ſhame and diſdain they had of ſo long
and obſtinate defence made by two
raſh Chriſtians againſt them, being ſo
many, having filled them with rage,
they had recourſe to their Symitars:
And with ſo much advantage, that
having killed the <hi>Valet,</hi> the Young
Count (after ſeveral Wounds received,
his ſtrength, not his Courage, having
failed him in ſo tedious a Fight, was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103330:8"/>
forced to yield, being no longer able
to lift up his Arm to make uſe of his
Sword. The Cowardly Villains had
ſcarce the Courage to board him, and
durſt not approach him till they ſaw
him fallen flat on his back. They
took him, and carried him on board
their <hi>Brigandine,</hi> where they gave him
all the help in their power for ſaving
his Life, having no other mark of
their Victory, but the taking one Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
Perſon, who had coſt them too
dear to be proud of their Prize: They
beheld him with Admiration, and
could not comprehend how an Age
ſo tender could be capable of ſo much
Courage; and that in a Body appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo delicate, there was ſtrength
enough lodged to perform the actions
they had ſeen. And being Naturally
Superſtitious, they did really believe
there was ſomething ſupernatural in
the Young Mans Perſon, or at leaſt,
that he was the Flower of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
this conceit helped them to
bear with more patience the ſhame of
their Victory. And finding their Men
thin, and having taken before ſome
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103330:9"/>
conſiderable Prizes, they reſolved to
return directly for <hi>Tunis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Weather was favourable, and
in few days ſail they arrived at <hi>Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta,</hi>
where going aſhore they put the
poor Count on Horſe-back, bound and
pinion'd like a Robber, and brought
him to the Town; ſome of theſe <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi>
having got the ſtart of the reſt,
ſpread ſuch a Report of his Valour
and Courage, that they drew toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not the ordinary People only,
(who are curious of ſmall matters)
but the Principal Perſons of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> himſelf, who accompanyed
with many of his Friends, came walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards the Ruines of <hi>Carthage,</hi> to
ſee the arrival of this Famous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
whom they imagined a Man
that carried Terror in his looks: But
how were they ſurpriz'd to ſee a
Youth pale and disfigured, yet keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his good mien the marks of
Grandeur in his Countenance. He
was pityed by all, and the <hi>Baſſa</hi> being
a gallant and generous Perſon, was
preſently ſeized with ſuch indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt the Villains, who uſed
in that manner one ſo little deſerving
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103330:9"/>
it, that he commanded them forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
on pain of his diſpleaſure to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bind
him upon the place; which they
inſtantly did, not daring to diſobey
him, who next the <hi>Dey</hi> was of greateſt
Authority and Power in the Kingdom:
He asked them the price of their
Slave, and, having commanded him
to be conducted to his Palace, paid
the Corſairs five hundred Patacoons,
being the Money they demanded.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Alexander</hi> having happily
fallen into the hands of ſo good and
generous a Patron, began to recover.
He was Lodged in a handſom Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Chyrurgions
ſearched his Wounds: And being more
carefully lookt to than on board the
<hi>Brigandine,</hi> he ſoon found himſelf bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
though weak, and ſore bruiſed by
what he had ſuffer'd at Sea from the
hands of thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who having
no pity for any, had not been too
careful of him; yet there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his Life, the Fever he had was
not great, and they had hopes to ſee
him well in few days. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
him Morning and Evening, and
by degrees his care and kindneſs grew
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103330:10"/>
to that height, that he came more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to ſee him, and not only took
more particular notice of him, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
daily the eſteem and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
he had for him.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed, it may not be amiſs
to ſatisfie the Curioſity of the Reader,
in giving him an account of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
the Birth and Character of the
<hi>Baſſa. Mahomet Baſſa.</hi> by the Father
of <hi>Sidy Marat,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet Lapſy</hi> the
new Beys, was the Son of a Renegado
of <hi>Corſica,</hi> of the Family of <hi>Petroſanty,</hi>
who by the handſomneſs of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and the excellency of his Wit,
having gained the good Opinion of
the <hi>Dey</hi> or King of the Countrey,
made ſo good uſe of the favour of his
Prince, that he advanced him to the
higheſt Office of the Kingdom, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he left his Son <hi>Mahomet</hi> his Heir.
But, to ſhorten the Story, <hi>Mahomet</hi>
the younger being deeply embroyled
with the <hi>Dey</hi> and the <hi>Divan,</hi> (who,
jealous of the Authority his Father
had gain'd, would have divided the
Offices of <hi>Baſſa</hi> and <hi>Bey</hi> went to the
Port, and returned Victorious: <hi>Tunis</hi>
never flouriſhed as under him, being
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103330:10"/>
as fit for Arms as Gallantry, of a great
Spirit, and excellent Wit, the moſt
Brave, the moſt Generous and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
of Men: He loved the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and did them Juſtice; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
a Commerce of Civility with
many Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi> He ſent and
receiv'd Preſents every Year to and
from the Great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> in
a word, no Lord of that Countrey
ever carried himſelf better, and had
more Merit and Reputation than he:
Some reſemblance of this Splendor
may yet be ſeen in the Perſon of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet
Lapſy</hi> his Son; he had inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
worthy a great Lord, as he was,
and the Soul of a Man truly Generous,
and of Eminent Virtue.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was charm'd with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
at the Wit of the Count, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
pleaſed with his Converſation,
and ſometimes paſt three or four hours
in familiar Diſcourſe, ſitting on his
Bed. He was chiefly ſurprized to find
his Apprehenſion ſo clear, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ſo general, that what Subject
ſoever he choſe to Diſcourſe of he
ſpoke of to admiration. This made
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſpeak of him to his Friends
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103330:11"/>
with ſo tender affection, and ſo much
to his Praiſe, that he gain'd him the
Eſteem and Amity of all the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Lords of the Kingdom, who came
to ſee him, and made him Preſents
according to the Cuſtom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Baſſa, <hi>by many Illuſtrious
marks and clear diſcoveries, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to believe the Count a Perſon
of no ordinary Quality, but did not
think fit to queſtion him on that point;
and had no further knowledge of him,
than that he was an</hi> Italian. <hi>Nor durſt
the Count acquaint him with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
fearing, the knowing of it
might make his Enlargement the more
difficult: But after ſo many favours
from the</hi> Baſſa, <hi>he could not in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
conceal himſelf from a Perſon
who had Obliged him ſo highly, and
to whom he did owe more than his
Life. Therefore being askt by the</hi>
Baſſa, <hi>whether his Parents were living,
and why he writ not to them:</hi> Sir,
<hi>(ſaid he)</hi> I ſhould be the baſeſt of Men,
ſhould I ever forget the Obligations you
have put upon me, nor could I be guilty
of a greater diſhoneſty, than to be prevail'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103330:11"/>
upon by fear, or any other conſideration,
not to pay you what I owe you. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
(and I hope you will Pardon me,)
that I ſcrupled to make a full diſcovery
of my ſelf to you, for fear my Captivity
might be the harder, my bondage more
ſevere, and my Liberty valued at a higher
rate: but having found you ſo generous,
I cannot, after the favours you have heaped
upon me, the Rights you have over your
Slaves, by forbearing to tell you, I am a
Perſon of Quality, of one of the beſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of <hi>Rome;</hi> that my Name is <hi>Count
Alexander,</hi> and that if ever you reſtore
me to my Liberty, I muſt pay you my
Ranſom with moſt grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of your kindneſs and favours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Baſſa <hi>ſmil'd, and with much
tenderneſs anſwer'd,</hi> Alexander, you
ſhall not fare the worſe for your diſcovery
to me; I am no Merchant of Slaves, nor
did I buy you to ſell you again: You are
free, and ſhall live with me in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
as if you were in your own, with
one of your Friends: And if I detain you
here a little longer than perhaps you would
wiſh, it is becauſe I can hardly part with
one for whom I have ſo high an eſteem,
and ſo cordial affection. <hi>To theſe he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103330:12"/>
added other expreſſions of Kindneſs,
which were joyfully received by the
Count, and diſpelled all his grief for
the loſs of his Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as he had recovered his
ſtrength, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> made him partake
of his Pleaſures and Divertiſements,
in Hunting, Walking, Horſe-race; in
all which the Count appeared Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
above others, and became more
Famous than ever any Chriſtian was
in thoſe Parts; every conſiderable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was ambitious to viſit him, and
took pleaſure to ſee, and to treat him,
which is a ſpecial favour to thoſe of
their Countrey, much more to one
who profeſs'd a Religion, to which
they are open irreconcileable Enemies.
Hence you may obſerve the power of
Merit, and how irreſiſtible are influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of a Fortunate Deſtiny. The
eſteem the <hi>Baſſa</hi> expreſs'd publickly
for him, contributed much to all theſe
advantages; but you are to conſider
his Perſon, and the ſweetneſs of his
Temper, and candor of his Actions
as the effectual means for gaining him
Amity, and that which won him the
Love of the moſt Excellent Perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:103330:12"/>
But notwithſtanding his Illuſtrious
Acquaintance, and agreeable Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements,
the Honours and Favours
he daily received, he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
wiſhing with ſighs for a return
into <hi>Europe.</hi> He lived as one free, but
was really a Slave to the Affection of
the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> from which he thought his
deliverance more difficult, than from
Fetters and Chains. His Wit and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
were not for the Men of
that Countrey; he loathed, and was
weary of them: The <hi>Turks</hi> have a
good ſenſe, and will reaſon well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of the Affairs of the World,
and are great and ſubtile Polititians;
but for Wit and good Breeding, they
know not what it is; their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is barren, and conſiſts more in
the ſmoak of Tobacco than Excellent
Diſcourſe: Their Knowledge is ſmall,
having ordinarily no advantage of
Reading or Travel. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> alone
had more Wit, and more Reaſon than
the reſt altogether; but his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the State engaging him in a
thouſand indiſpenſible Affairs, would
not allow him to be always with
<hi>Alexander,</hi> who in the mean time paſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103330:13"/>
his Melancholy hours in the Garden
of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where he had the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
to walk, being a retired and
very pleaſant place, and that wherein
he took great delight. But alas, how
different were theſe days from thoſe
at <hi>Rome!</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi> are naturally apt
to be Melancholy, and this Solitude
made the Count ſo: The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who
loved him ſincerely, and paſſionately
wiſhed to have him always in good
humour, was troubled to find him ſad
and dejected; but having often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the cauſe, could not obtain far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſatisfaction, than that it was an
effect of his Temper: He had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
him to exceſs with all that
Countrey could afford for the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Life, and could not imagine
the cauſe of the grief, but fancied at
laſt that to compleat his Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Alexander</hi> might want the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
of a Woman. The <hi>Baſſa</hi>
being a Perſon much given to Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
was the more eaſily inclined
to believe he had found the true cauſe
of his Melancholy. And looked upon
it as no incurable Diſeaſe, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
reſolved to find out a Remedy,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103330:13"/>
by furniſhing him with a Miſtreſs,
which was a high ſtrain of complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
in a Perſon of his Character;
but there were no limits to the Love
he had for his <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> is very ſevere
in this Point, againſt Perſons of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Religion, though very indulgent
to thoſe of his own. Thoſe who fall
into the hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and will
make love to their Women, are under
the neceſſity of changing their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or Burning: theſe Extremities
are hard, yet of the many Chriſtians
reduced to thoſe ſtraits, I know not
one who hath thought Martyrdom ſo
charming, as not to prefer Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
before Burning: the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> though
no zealous obſerver of the Law, was
willing however to avoid the Scandal
that might follow if the Intrigue were
diſcovered, and therefore deſign'd to
marry him to a Chriſtian. There
was with the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> his Wife, an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Slave,</hi> a young Maid of good
quality, lovely and witty: it was not
long ſince the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had been in love
with her, but without any ſucceſs:
whether it proceeded from the reſpect
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103330:14"/>
ſhe bore to the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> her Miſtreſs,
who loved her intirely, or from ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Conſcience in point of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with which ſhe excuſed her ſelf,
certain it is, his addreſſes were vain;
and after three Months eager perſuit
of his deſign, being not accuſtom'd to
ſo much reſiſtance, he quitted her, and
caſt his eyes on other leſs difficult con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts:
he hoped that one Chriſtian
with another might have better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
and that <hi>Alexander</hi> being very
lovely, and young, needed only to
ſhew himſelf for gaining the love of a
Maid of his Country, profeſſing the
ſame Religion with him: he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to diſpoſe her for the purpoſe,
by raiſing in her an eſteem for the
Gallant he provided her: he had often
ſpoken of him in the Chamber of the
<hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> where <hi>Laura,</hi> the Slave we
are diſcourſing of, did conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
               <p>And having formed the deſign, he
ſeldom entertained them with any
thing elſe, but <hi>Alexander did this,</hi> or
<hi>Alexander ſaid that;</hi> of which he gave
them ſo pleaſant Deſcriptions, that he
could not fail of making ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103330:14"/>
of love for him in a Woman,
though never ſo little ſuſceptible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Count knew nothing of all
theſe good Offices; the</hi> Baſſa <hi>ſmiling
ſometimes at his ſadneſs, would tell
him, he ſhould ſhortly ſee him in a
different humor. One having diſpoſed
all things on</hi> Laura<hi>'s ſide, (who had
told him, ſhe would not be diſpleas'd
to ſee this Chriſtian) he took him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Garden of the</hi> Seraglio <hi>to walk,
and after a turn or two, asked him if
he had ever been in love. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
did very much ſurprize him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending,
that being among a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
naturally ſuſpicious, the</hi> Baſſa
<hi>might perhaps have had ſome Jealouſie
of him, though he could not imagine
the cauſe. But to diſabuſe him, he
held it neceſſary to affect great indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the buſineſs of Women, and
(the truth is) to that day he had not
been in love. And though it were ill
courtſhip to the</hi> Baſſa, <hi>who was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer
of Women, to tell him he had
never been in Love; yet he choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to commit a ſolaeciſm in courtſhip,
than to give him the leaſt cauſe of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition.
The</hi> Baſſa <hi>adviſed him to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103330:15"/>
have a care of himſelf, leſt Love
ſhould one day be revenged of him,
and told him, he deſpaired not of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him a Lover in</hi> Barbary: You are,
<hi>ſaid he,</hi> handſom and witty, and there
are here, as in <hi>Europe,</hi> dangerous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
who perhaps may have deſigns on
your liberty; and you are not yet got out
of <hi>Tunis: This Diſcourſe unexpected,
and ſpoken with ſuch an Air, ſo
troubled the</hi> Count, <hi>he knew not what
anſwer to make. The</hi> Baſſa <hi>much
pleaſed at the diſorder he had put him
to;</hi> What, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> doth Love appear ſo
terrible to you, that you dare not encounter
it? can a Man of your bravery be afraid
of a Paſſion? Recollect your ſelf, and think
it not ſo dreadful here as in <hi>Italy;</hi> you
arm your <hi>Cupid</hi> with weapons of War,
we dreſs ours with Flowers; nothing is
leſs cruel than Love among the <hi>Turks:</hi>
our Women are kind, and good natured,
and never are the cauſe of any mans
death by coyneſs and diſdain; the ſole diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
is in getting a ſight of them; gain
but that point, and nothing can be more
eaſie than the reſt: your Ladies are ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
and ſhy of ſhewing favour to their
Lovers, and ours make a conſcience of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103330:15"/>
ſeeing their Languiſh: it is not ſo odious
to be fond and coming with you, as 'tis to
be cruel and inſenſible here. We follow in
the firſt place the Law of nature, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
it to <hi>Mahomets,</hi> as being Men
before we are <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi> We hold
our ſelves obliged to pay kind regard and
affectionate tenderneſs to Female Beauty,
and expect from it a return of complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
And thoſe who approve not theſe
<hi>Maxims,</hi> we eſteem unworthy to taſte
the pleaſures of Love. I know that in
<hi>Europe</hi> you uſe this Paſſion an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way, making that Martyrdom which
ſhould be a delight; but I would fain
know, what the deſign of that Woman
can be, who ſees a man every day on his
knees at her feet, ſighing for that which
ſhe alſo deſires, and it may be, more paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately.
Why then muſt he be tormented?
Why ſo many ſighs, why ſo many tears
expected from him, when the paſſion of
both Sexes is equal, if that of the Female
may not paſs for the greater?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Count having in this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected
himſelf, anſwered;</hi> I believe,
Sir, that in Love as in other matters eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one may have his particular fancy, and
different <hi>Maxims</hi> for conduct: but if I,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103330:16"/>
who was never in Love, may be allow'd
to deliver my opinion of it, I conceive
that Men born under a Law, are inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
diſpoſed to bear it with eaſe. And I
dare confidently affirm, there is more ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and charming delight in the torments
we endure in our way of Loving, than in
thoſe eaſie pleaſures that coſt you nothing:
think not, Sir, thoſe torments ſo cruel as
our Lovers repreſent them; they aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
them only to affect their Miſtreſſes
the more, and to make them more ſenſible.
It would certainly ſurprize you to hear
them cry, <hi>Increaſe, O love, Increaſe
ſo ſweet a pain:</hi> their ſufferings are
pleaſures. <hi>The</hi> Baſſa <hi>was ſo charmed
with hearing him ſpeak, that he would
not interrupt him, ſo that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,</hi>
What ſatisfaction can you find in
a Love that is fulſom and dull, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any pique to make it poynant, and
ſeaſon it for reliſh? What divertiſement
to be expected from an innocent <hi>Cupid,</hi> a
Child without wit, without waggery, that
permits you to do in all things as you
pleaſe? <hi>The</hi> Baſſa <hi>could not forbear
laughing, and told him, that to make
him believe that Love the moſt charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that made him ſuffer moſt, he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103330:16"/>
muſt make it appear by trial in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by being in Love, enduring with
pleaſure all the torments he ſpoke of:</hi>
Sir, <hi>ſaid</hi> Alexander, I was never in love
in my Country, where you know we have
freedom of living, and Liberty of converſe
with the Female Sex; it is not probable
then I ſhall fall in love here, where we
are not allow'd ſo much as a ſight of them:
means may be found, <hi>replied the</hi> Baſſa,
to ſatisfie you in that particular if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it. I do not conceive it for my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
<hi>ſaid the Count,</hi> to thruſt my
ſelf into the fire to try the experiment, or
to change my Religion. No, no, <hi>ſaid the</hi>
Baſſa, it is with a Chriſtian I would have
you acquainted, and one in my judgment
very beautiful, and not unworthy your
ſighs: had I been of your mind, and like
the Lovers of your Country, taken plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in being vext and tormented, my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
might have been done. She made
me pine for her above three Months, till
weary of a Miſtreſs that had ſo little
ſenſe of my pain, I betook my ſelf to others
that were more of my humour; her beauty
and wit will certainly charm you, and you
may find her as haughty, as fierce, as
cruel as you can wiſh: it may be difficult
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103330:17"/>
to have a ſight of her, as being with the
<hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> who, ſince ſhe knew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
I had for her, would never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
her to ſtep out of her Apartment:
but I'le bring you thither diſguiſed as an
Eunuch; there is no other way of entrance
for you into the Seraglio: and you are ſo
young, that by Night you may paſs for
an Eunuch without any ſuſpicion. <hi>The
Count gave him a thouſand thanks for
the favour, not but that he could have
been very well content to have been
without it, having no great deſire to
engage himſelf in Acquaintance in a
Country where he would tarry as
ſhort time as he could; yet in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance
to the</hi> Baſſa, <hi>and of Curioſity
to ſee a Slave the</hi> Baſſa <hi>repreſented ſo
beautiful, he accepted this offer with
ſome kind of joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth Prayer being over, be
came to his Patron, being the time
he uſually went to the</hi> Seraglio: <hi>And
having taken the Habit of an</hi> Eunuch
<hi>provided for him there, he waited on
the</hi> Baſſa <hi>to the Apartment of the</hi>
Sultaneſs: Laura, <hi>who had notice of
their coming, waited their entrance;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103330:17"/>
the</hi> Baſſa <hi>came ſmilling up to her, and
whiſpered her in the Ear, that he had
brought her an Eunuch, who could
tell her News out of</hi> Italy; <hi>pray'd her
to have a care of him, and to uſe him
as a Perſon he lov'd entirely.</hi> Laura
<hi>fell a laughing, and anſwered, ſhe
doubted not but the Eunuch ſhould
give him a good account of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
The Count, though Diſguiſed,
was ſo eaſie to be known, that, had
the</hi> Baſſa <hi>ſaid nothing, his good</hi> Mien
<hi>had diſcovered him: No Eunuch, no</hi>
Turk <hi>had ſo good an air. She gave
him her hand to lead her into a
Chamber, where they ſhould not be
expoſed to their view who paſt by.</hi>
Sir, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> I know not what thanks
to give the <hi>Baſſa</hi> for the favour he hath
done me, to afford me a ſight of you, no
man being allowed entrance here but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and the Eunuch whoſe Habit he hath
cauſed you to take. I cannot impute it
to any thing but the extraordinary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
he hath and daily declares for you.
'Tis true, Madam, <hi>anſwered the Count,</hi>
the kindneſs of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> to me is extream;
but either of us have reaſon to be concerned
how to thank him, (as he very well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves)
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103330:18"/>
'tis certainly I, for the favour he
hath procured me; yet I could wiſh I were
not wholly beholding to him for it, but
that (as he would have me believe) you
had a hand in it. Sir, <hi>replyed</hi> Laura,
I ſhall tell you no lye, I have made it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
known to you, I deſired this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
from him. He told us things ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
of you, and related them ſo much to
your advantage, you may eaſily believe, I
(who, for three years I have been here,
have not had the Liberty of Converſe with
any Man) could not but deſire acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of a Perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo generally eſteemed.
Madam, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> this Country hath been
favourable in allowing me a Reputation,
which perhaps I may find difficult to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in your Opinion. You need not fear
that, <hi>reply'd</hi> Laura, your Mien confirms
ſufficiently the reports that have paſt of
you. But to change the Diſcourſe, do you
know, ſaid ſhe ſmiling, that ſometimes
'tis dangerous in a Nation like this, to
make your ſelf ſo much the ſubject of
Diſcourſe; if not on the Mens account,
yet certainly on the Womens, who fall in
Love meerly on report, without a ſight or
knowledge of the Party: <hi>The Count
anſwered ſmiling,</hi> Madam, there is no
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103330:18"/>
danger of your being of the number of
thoſe kind-hearted Ladies, I am not ſo
Fortunate. And why, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> might
not I be one, who have ſo long'd for a
ſight of you: but to loſe no more time, I
muſt tell you, your Fortune is better than
you think; and I do that for another,
which perhaps I would not have done for
my ſelf. The deſire of ſeeing a Man is
here reputed a mighty advancement of
Love, where to ſee and to agree are all
one. But I have undertaken this affair,
and made the <hi>Baſſa</hi> believe I have very
favourable thoughts of you. And to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
your Curioſity of knowing the Party
for whom I have ſo much complaiſance in
ſtore, it is for the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> Lady, Madam
<hi>Alhie</hi> the <hi>Sultaneſs:</hi> The confidence ſhe
is pleaſed to repoſe in me is ſo great, that
ſhe hath entruſted me with this Secret,
and my kindneſs for her ſhould not admit
one moments ſcruple doing her this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
I cannot doubt but you have heard
of her beauty; never was any ſo famous
in this Kingdom, nor perhaps in the World,
more worthy admiration: And as for her
temper, 'tis the ſweeteſt and moſt lovely
that can be imagined. The firſt view
you have of her, will perſwade you ſhe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103330:19"/>
hath an inclination to Love, ſo tender, ſo
languiſhing is the air of her Countenance.
And though this be natural to the Women
of this Country, and that the firſt thing
they are taught, is to ſigh, and appear
languiſhing, yet I have not obſerved thoſe
weakneſſes in her but on your account. To
deduce things from the Original, I muſt
inform you, that when the <hi>Baſſa</hi> returned
from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> having diſpatched
the Affair depending there between him,
and the King, and <hi>Divan</hi> of this place,
and being confirmed by the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
in the Offices his Father had left him,
which they had diſputed; the King, in
order to Reconciliation, was adviſed to
give the <hi>Baſſa</hi> his Daughter in Marriage.
<hi>Alhie</hi> was then Sixteen Years old, and
her beauty at the height; though at this
day in my judgment, no man that ſees her,
but muſt be in Love with her. Theſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
of Policy and State-intereſt, to
which the Daughters of great ones are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to be Sacrificed, ſeldom prove Happy.
The <hi>Baſſa</hi> Eſpouſed <hi>Alhie,</hi> and perhaps
loved her a Week, but after that returned
to his former Engagements, and for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
beauties quitted the greateſt of the
Kingdom. 'Tis true, it often happens
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103330:19"/>
thus in this Country, where Men abhor
loving by Duty and Obligation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
love Miſtreſſes better than Wives:
but this Lady, in my Opinion, ought to
have been excepted, as wanting nothing
requiſite to ſatisfie the Paſſion of any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Man; but ſhe is as unfortunate
as others. The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> though otherwiſe a
Perſon of much Gallantry, viſits her ſcarce
once in a Month; yet he pays her all the
Reſpect in the World, and ſhe hath no
cauſe of complaint but of his Love; but
take love from Marriage, what ſignifies
the reſt? What a trouble it is to a Young
Lady, who knows her own merit, to ſee
her ſelf ſlighted in that whereof ſhe is
moſt ſenſible? A Lady who would think
her ſelf happy in being belov'd, and thinks
ſhe deſerves it: you muſt be a Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you can comprehend the rigor of this
uſage, and the greatneſs of her misfortune.
But to come to what concerns you; the
<hi>Sultaneſs</hi> hath ever had a great inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Chriſtians; and the greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſhe takes, is, in ſtories ſhe makes me
tell of my Country, which ſurprize her
ſo (eſpecially when I ſpeak of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
Men have there with Women) that
ſhe hath a thouſand times wiſhed her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103330:20"/>
had been as mine, and that ſhe had
fallen into the hands of a Chriſtian, who
would have carried her into that Country.
'Tis certain, a Woman had better be a
Slave with us, than free among the <hi>Turks,</hi>
where their Life is nothing but a perpetual
Slavery. The Adventures of Love and
Gallantry have pleaſed her ſo well in the
relation, that ſhe longs for a ſight of one
of thoſe I called Perſons of Quality and
Merit, who were ſo Gallant and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
as I repreſented. You were no ſooner
arrived, but ſhe came with great joy to
tell me, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had newly bought a
Chriſtian, of whom they ſpoke Wonders.
I fell a laughing, and ask'd if it were
not ſuch a one ſhe had often wiſh'd for her
Slave. She bluſhed, and turning about
with a ſigh, anſwered, who knows what
may happen, and whether Fortune hath
not deſigned him for me. She made me
her Bedfellow that Night, to entertain her
on that ſubject. On the morrow the <hi>Baſſa</hi>
having confirmed the Reports of you, and
commended your Perſon, ſhe and I for
ſeveral days had no diſcourſe but of you.
The kindneſs ſhe hath for me, makes me
ſomewhat familiar with her; nor do we
very ſtrictly obſerve here our diſtance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103330:20"/>
great ones; this made me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
take the Liberty to quarrel with
her for the longing ſhe expreſt for a Man
ſhe had not ſeen. I confeſs, ſaid ſhe, this
were falling in Love a little too ſoon, if
we managed our Love as the Chriſtians do
theirs. But the <hi>Baſſa</hi> having made ſuch
a deſcription of this Man, there is not a
Woman in the Kingdom who would not
have had a greater Paſſion for him than
I have expreſt. And you may believe he
would not have ſpoken ſo much in his
praiſe before the meaneſt of his Empreſſes;
but though he ſlight me ſo, that he cares
not what I think, my affections are free.
You would eſteem your ſelf happy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
ſaid I, to have ſuch a Chriſtian in
Love with you. More happy, <hi>reply'd
ſhe,</hi> than you can imagine. And I will
aſſure you, I could willingly change the
ſtate I am in, for the condition of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Chriſtian Lady: What good does it
me, to abound thus with Riches, to receive
ſo much Honour, to be the Daughter of a
King, and the Wife of a <hi>Baſſa,</hi> if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be content, nor do as I would, nor
love where love is due? In a word, if I
am nothing leſs than I am taken to be, but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103330:21"/>
a Slave more unhappy than thoſe under
Chains. Poor <hi>Laura (ſaid ſhe, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
me tenderly)</hi> how I pity thee,
who haſt taſted the Pleaſures and Liberty
of thy Country, and haſt unhappily fallen
into their hands who uſe ſo unworthily all
ſorts of Women.</p>
               <p>With ſuch diſcourſes as theſe did we
entertain our ſelves ever ſince they ſpoke
of you at <hi>Tunis.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa</hi> came oftner
to viſit the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> though we knew
not the reaſon; and almoſt every day
brought us the News of you: And, as he
loves you entirely, took pleaſure in relating
every thing you did. Perhaps, had he
known the favourable inclinations the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs</hi>
had for you, he had been more
ſparing in his expreſſions of you, for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe he deſigned to prejudice himſelf
in ſpeaking obligingly of you. But it was
an overſight, and moſt unpardonable in
him who ſo well knew the temper of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of this Country: Judge you whether
ſo good a report from ſo good a hand could
want its effect. The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with them ſo much to the purpoſe,
that what at firſt was a bare inclination,
grew up by degrees to a ſettled Paſſion.
Her humour was ſuddenly chang'd from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103330:21"/>
Merry and Jocund, into Sadneſs and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy;
and I, who alone knew her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
could not but pity her ſighs and
complaints, and was extreamly afraid ſhe
might fall into a Diſeaſe, which they call
Fantaſie, and is a kind of Melancholy that
proves Mortal to many Men and Women
of this Country. I did my endeavour to
cure her of this Paſſion, by repreſenting
to her all the obſtacles in her way to the
happineſs ſhe deſired. But my Remedies
came too late, I did but trouble her to no
purpoſe, having ſaid to her ſelf all that
I could poſſibly ſay to divert her from the
affection ſhe had taken: So that deſpairing
of Remedy on that ſide, I apply'd my
thoughts another way, and flattered her
hopes of bringing that to paſs, which I
could not diſcover the leaſt poſſibility to
effect. But to prevent the growth and
increaſe of her Diſtemper, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to deceive her by flatteries and hopes.
At laſt, I know not how it fell out, that
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> having ſpoken of you to me two
days ago, as he frequently does when he
finds me alone, I told him, I ſhould be
very glad to ſee you, if it might be done
without noiſe and ſoandal: I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
aſtoniſh'd how eaſily he promiſed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103330:22"/>
it: And you may believe I had not
waited here for you, but that I very well
knew him a Man of his word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Count having hearken'd to all
this diſcourſe with marvellous atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and thanked</hi> Laura <hi>for all her
good Offices, and anſwer'd all her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
expreſſions in behalf of the</hi>
Sultaneſs, <hi>diſcovered to her the</hi> Baſſa<hi>'s
deſign, and the reaſon of his being
brought thither;</hi> Laura <hi>was raviſhed
to hear his diſcourſe, and though ſhe
foreſaw her concern in the Affair was
like to be ſmall, yet ſhe was pleas'd
with the News ſhe received, being
willing to ſacrifice all Intereſts of her
own, to the ſatisfaction of her Lady.</hi>
But, Sir, to tell you all, <hi>ſaid ſhe to the
Count,</hi> having paid my thanks to the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> for the favour I was in hopes of
from him, I went preſently to bring the
News to the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> who could not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
embrace me, being ſo extreamly
tranſported, that nothing in the World
could have made her more joyful; ſhe hath
ſcarcely been able to ſleep ever ſince: ſhe
and I have laid a hundred deſigns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
framed to our ſelves a thouſand devices
how ſhe may have a ſight of you: but if
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103330:22"/>
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> will not permit you to come
alone hither, I do not ſee how it may be
effected: the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> in the mean time
will be raviſhed with joy that I have
ſeen you, and that you know ſome part of
her mind.</p>
               <p>The happy <hi>Roman</hi> being charmed
at the kindneſs a Lady of that beauty
and quality had for him, was very
urgent with <hi>Laura</hi> to oblige him on
this occaſion, and preſs'd her to ſay
to the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> from him, all that a
heart extreamly ſenſible of the favour
ſhe did him, was capable to expreſs.
That he would have eſteem'd himſelf
the happieſt of men, had it been in
his power to have merited this honor,
and that it ſhould be the buſineſs of his
life, to deſerve it by his actions. <hi>Sir,</hi>
reply'd <hi>Laura, all ſhe deſires of you, is
that you will ſo manage the Liberty the</hi>
Baſſa <hi>doth afford you, that ſhe may once
have a ſight of you: I find my ſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to it by ſo many reaſons,</hi> ſaid the
Count, <hi>that you may be aſſured I will
not forget any thing that may gain this
honour: I muſt intreat you to aſſure the</hi>
Sultaneſs <hi>accordingly, and that I have at
leaſt as much paſſion as ſhe.</hi> He had no
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103330:23"/>
ſooner ſaid this, but the <hi>Baſſa</hi> came to
them, which made them change their
diſcourſe, and the <hi>Baſſa</hi> having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended
to make himſelf one of the
company, and very pleaſantly rallied;
then ſaid, he perceived by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances
they were obliged to him for
the acquaintance he had procured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, and that they were very
well pleaſed one with the other: the
Count and <hi>Laura</hi> having returned the
complement, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> took his leave,
and he and the Count went out of the
<hi>Seraglio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> had obſerved ſuch joy in
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s countenance when he was
with <hi>Laura,</hi> it made him believe he
was very well pleaſed with the viſit he
had given her. But he had the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to ask him how he liked her; and
whether ſhe appeared ſo beautiful as
he had repreſented her: the Count
anſwered, it was certainly impoſſible
to ſee a Lady more handſom, or
more witty: and that he was charmed
at her Beauty and Converſation. The
<hi>Baſſa</hi> who deſired nothing more than
to ſee him in Love, was extreamly
glad at the confeſſion he made; and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103330:23"/>
told him it ſhould be his fault, if he
ſaw her not again; and, if he deſired,
he might do it on the morrow, that
he would give him a Key to enter the
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> and that he might go alone;
leſt if he brought him in, the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs</hi>
might be jealous: it being not
his cuſtom to viſit her ſo often, the
Count failed not to acquaint him how
highly that favour would oblige him;
ſo that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> bid him go to bed,
and take his reſt, and told him he
ſhould ſee <hi>Laura</hi> on the morrow about
the time he had ſeen her that day.</p>
               <p>Never was a night ſo reſtleſs to any
man, as this to the Count, her incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
like that he had to marriage,
with the principal and moſt beautiful
Lady of the Kingdom, was a thing ſo
rare, and ſo tempting for a Man of
his temper; what <hi>Laura</hi> had ſaid of
thoſe obliging thoughts that charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Perſon had for him, did ſo raviſh
him with pleaſure, that in the depth
of misfortune he could not imagine
any man more fortunate than himſelf:
But when he conſidered, that ſhe was
the Wife of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> a Perſon to
whom he was ſo ſtrictly obliged, he
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103330:24"/>
was troubled extreamly, and ſigh'd
for ſorrow; theſe ſecond thoughts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
at that time over the other,
he highly reproached himſelf for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
a thought of ſo baſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.
But it is a tickliſh buſineſs
to repent of a thing that extreamly
delights us, and men ſeldom charge
themſelves home for a fault ſo pleaſing
and lovely, as the pleaſure of being
beloved: thoſe reproaches of the <hi>Count</hi>
againſt himſelf, were not altogether
the moſt violent that might be, and
ſometimes he would be angry with
himſelf for making ſo much ado. At
laſt, being aſſaulted by turns, on the
one ſide by Reaſon, on the other by
Paſſion, by the Glory of that, and the
tenderneſs of this, he got up in the
Morning, without having been able
to take any other reſolution than to
yield himſelf up to be guided by his
Deſtiny, to be governed by Fate, and
be meerly paſſive in the management
of the buſineſs; that is to ſay, to love,
in this particular, like a <hi>Turk,</hi> and to
ſee the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> if it were ſo predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated:
but to do nothing in order to
it, though he had promiſed <hi>Laura</hi> to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103330:24"/>
contribute on his part all that lay in
his power, and had told the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> he
ſhould be extreamly glad to go again
to the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> His reſolution ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
was very tottering and weak,
and to ſpeak truth, 'tis almoſt vain to
take one againſt love: he wiſht a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times that day, that his Fate to
whoſe conduct he had given himſelf
up, would incline to bring him to the
<hi>Sultaneſs.</hi> He waited the hour with a
great deal of impatience, however he
would fain have perſwaded himſelf
to the contrary: but a young heart
cannot be inſenſible, being ſo apt to
take fire, that it ſcarce requires any
help to inflame it.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſaw the Count
in the Evening, he ſhew'd him (ſmiling)
the Key of the <hi>Seraglio:</hi> and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it with the greateſt joy in the
World. <hi>But I give it,</hi> ſaid the Baſſa,
<hi>on condition that you make me your Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
And I think I have done enough
to engage you to do me that pleaſure.</hi>
The hour was come for his going to
the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> and the Count having
put on his Eunuchs Habit, his Patron
every day more obliging than other,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103330:25"/>
would needs bear him company as far
as the <hi>Seraglio; Laura</hi> having notice
of his coming, had waited for him
above an hour at the Gate, and no
ſooner ſaw him arrived, but raviſhed
with joy, ſhe gave him her hand, and
told him. <hi>You are either the moſt dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
or elſe the moſt fortunate Perſon
in the World: you bring about things ſo
difficult, and in ſo ſhort a time, that all
things ſeem to joyn in your favour: I am
obliged for it to my fortune,</hi> anſwered
the <hi>Count; for, as for Addreſſes I had no
occaſion to uſe any, but if you would make
me believe my ſelf as happy as you ſay,
help me to a ſight of the</hi> Sultaneſs. <hi>Laura</hi>
told him, he ſhould preſently hear of
her, and brought him into a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where her Lady was uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
viſits. It was her cuſtom to ſeat
her ſelf in a kind of <hi>Alcove,</hi> the paſſage
to which, was through her Chamber,
made up with great <hi>Balliſtres</hi> guilt, and
covered with a Curtain of very thin
Silk, through which ſhe could ſee
thoſe whom ſhe honoured only with
a ſight of her; which is a piece of State
uſed in that Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:103330:25"/>
                  <hi>Laura</hi> told the Count, that the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs</hi>
would ſee him from behind that
Curtain. <hi>And ſhall not I then,</hi> ſaid he,
<hi>have the honour to ſee her. I know not,</hi>
ſaid <hi>Laura, but 'tis a favour ſo great,
that 'tis never granted but when they are
willing to grant all that may be expected:
Ah Madam,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Count, I beſeech
you to deſire that favour for me; tell her
it will be of ſmall conſequence to give a
ſtranger a ſight of her, and that I ſhall
die with grief if ſhe deny me that honour.
Laura<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> promiſed him all the aſſiſtance
in her power, and leaving him for a
moment, went to advertiſe the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs,</hi>
who queſtionleſs longed for
news of the arrival of her dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Chriſtian. In the mean time
the Count conſidered the Riches and
Ornaments of the Chamber, being
the moſt magnificent of the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it was ſet out with four Chriſtal
Glaſſes which had a pleaſant effect on
the Gold and the Jewels which glitter'd
all about: Scarce had the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi>
ſeen <hi>Laura,</hi> but ſhe knew by her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
the happy news ſhe brought;
and without allowing her time to ſay
any thing, ſhe paſt to the <hi>Alcove,</hi> from
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103330:26"/>
whence ſhe deſign'd to take a view of
the Chriſtian, before he ſhould know
that ſhe was there. But ſhe made too
great a noiſe at her entrance, and the
<hi>Cavalier</hi> let her know, he had perceiv'd
her, by ſaluting her, as he did, after
the Turkiſh mode: <hi>Laura</hi> arrived the
ſame time from the other ſide, and
going to the <hi>Balliſtre,</hi> went to whiſper
the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> who was not able ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
to expreſs the pleaſure ſhe took
in ſeeing this Chriſtian, and the Charms
that appear'd in his Perſon. As for
him, he was ſtrangely perplext at a
viſit of this nature, where he could
neither ſee, nor ſpeak to the Party he
viſited. He went, he came, he turn'd
about as deſired, and at the end of
the Shew, went ſilently to the <hi>Balliſtre,</hi>
and addreſſing himſelf to the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi>
having ſeen a ſhadow of her through
the Curtain, he told her a thouſand
pretty Stories, a thouſand Gallantries
to oblige her to afford him a view, for
ſhe underſtood <hi>Italian,</hi> and ſpoke it
pretty well, having learnt it of <hi>Laura.</hi>
She was very well pleas'd to hear the
<hi>Count</hi> ſpeak, and heartily laught at it,
but anſwered not a word, nor had the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103330:26"/>
Curtain drawn. The <hi>Count</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient,
and accounting every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
loſt he ſpent in that manner,
ſeem'd to fret and be angry, and in a
frank and free way told her, he ſhould
die of the Phantaſie, as the People of
that Country, if ſhe denied him this
favour, and that at laſt he would with
his own hand draw that troubleſom
Curtain: and he had certainly done
it, if <hi>Laura,</hi> who fear'd the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi>
might take it ill, had not hindred
him. But <hi>Laura</hi> was miſtaken, and
her Lady gave her not thanks for her
pains.</p>
               <p>'Tis a Maxim among the Women
of that Country, not to ſin of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt the Rules of their duty;
but preſs them a little, and offer them
the leaſt violence, they will preſently
yield without any reſiſtance: their
excuſe is, that nature is weak, that
men know it well enough, and are
very much to blame to preſs them ſo
home: that if there be harm done, it
muſt be laid to their ſcore, who cauſe
them to do it, and not to them who
are ignorant of it, and innocent in the
buſineſs. <hi>Laura</hi> not well verſt in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103330:27"/>
uſe of this Maxim, committed a fault,
when ſhe thought ſhe had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
her duty. The amorous <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs</hi>
would have been raviſh'd with
joy to have been ſeen by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and the officious Slave ſpoil'd all
by a piece of uſeleſs diſcretion. But
her Lady was willing to receive the
miſcarriage, and ſatisfie in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the extream deſire her dear Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
had to ſee her; ſhe gave him
leave to ask what he pleaſed, to make
him amends for the rigour of the
cuſtom of that Country, which made
it undecent for her Sex to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to any but their Husband. The
<hi>Count</hi> preſently deſired ſhe would at
leaſt do him the honour of ſhewing
him one of her fair hands: The <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs</hi>
no ſooner heard him, but lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Curtain a little, ſhe gave
him her hand over the <hi>Balliſtre.</hi> The
young <hi>Count</hi> was ſo charmed with this
favour, that tranſported with joy, he
laid his knee to the ground, and kiſſed
her hand with ſuch paſſion; that the
<hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> equally tranſported, wrung his
hand, preſſing it ſo hard, to let him
know ſhe approved of what he did.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103330:27"/>
She was not over careful to keep her
ſelf unſeen; and having put forth her
arm, ſhe could not chooſe, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
appear to him in part by one
chance or other (to which perhaps ſhe
contributed a little.) Her Gallant
could have wiſh'd he had had a full
ſight of her, but thinking he had
enough for the firſt time, he would
not adventure to deſire any more. The
pleaſure the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> took in the ſight
of him, was ſo great, and ſo charming,
that ſhe could have willingly paſt that
night with him. But knowing that
many eyes were upon her, and that
ſhe lived where men are extreamly
given to jealouſie, and eſpecially of
their Wives, ſhe had apprehenſions of
being Lampoon'd in her own Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for ſtaying ſo long in the <hi>Alcove,</hi>
at a time ſo unſeaſonable for receiving
a viſit. And <hi>Laura</hi> had told her, 'twas
time to withdraw. But how cruel a
thing 'tis to be forced to part from that
which we love? it cannot be done
without pain and regret. Still ſhe
found ſome little pretence or other to
ſtay him a little longer; at laſt ſhe
pretented him with a Gold Chain
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103330:28"/>
beſet with Jewels, and told him obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingly
it was not fit a Slave like him
ſhould wear any other. The happy
<hi>Count</hi> better ſatisfy'd with this Chain,
than if ſhe had given him the Crown
of <hi>Tunis,</hi> anſwered her Gallantry, and
the favour ſhe did him with the moſt
paſſionate and the moſt grateful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
imaginable. And ſeeing the
neceſſity of parting, he took his leave
of the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> and withdrew with
<hi>Laura,</hi> who accompanied him to the
Gate of the Apartment.</p>
               <p>Preſents among the <hi>Turks,</hi> are the
firſt Evidences of affections, and often
paſs for declarations of love. <hi>Laura,</hi>
who knew it well enough, made the
<hi>Count</hi> ſenſible, before parting, what
that meant which he had received
from the <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> and that he was
not to doubt, having heard and ſeen
ſo much of her, but ſhe paſſionately
lov'd him. Yet he was to take heed,
and believe he had need of abundance
of diſcretion, to deal with the Women
of that Country, whoſe paſſion of
love is ſometimes ſo violent, that they
obſerve no bounds; that the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi>
was indeed the moſt rational ſhe had
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103330:28"/>
known amongſt them, and had the
moſt wit, yet tender and paſſionate as
the reſt. That ſhe and he would be
immutably ruined, if the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who had
no ſmall experience in Amours, ſhould
once have the leaſt ſuſpicion of the
Intrigue. That there was not in the
Kingdom a man more tender of his
honour than he; and that all the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
he had for him, would not ſave
him from his indignation, if he once
came to know he had ſeen his Wife.</p>
               <p>As much taken as our young <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
was with the pleaſant beginnings
of his Amours, and for all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings
at thoſe evident kindneſſes
he had received from the greateſt
Beauty under Heaven, yet he could
not forbear reflecting on <hi>Laura</hi>'s good
counſels, but went muſing along the
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> what courſe he ſhould take,
what means he ſhould uſe againſt ſo
dangerous a Paſſion, which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
bring him to ruin and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
When the <hi>Baſſa</hi> going to one of
his Miſtreſſes, met him by the way,
and ſeeing him paſs by without ſo
much as ſaluting him, he preſently fell
a laughing, and taking him by the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103330:29"/>
arm. <hi>Now,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I ſee that you are
in love.</hi> The Count being confounded
at his ſurprizing him in that caſe,
made excuſes for his fault. The <hi>Baſſa</hi>
made anſwer, that if he deſir'd to be
pardon'd, he muſt freely confeſs the
truth, and acknowledge himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
diſordered at the Merits and
Beauty of <hi>Laura: More Sir</hi> (ſaid the
Count with a very deep ſigh) <hi>than you
can poſſibly expreſs or imagine.</hi> But it being
late, and the <hi>Baſſa</hi> not willing to ſtay,
he deferred the more particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
to another opportunity, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd
him to his Lodging. This was
a great happineſs, and no leſs pleaſure
to the young Lover, who was not then
in condition to give the <hi>Baſſa</hi> an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his Amours. Part of that
night he paſs'd walking in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
as if he had intended to come to
a Reſolution before he went to bed.
It was not the fear of death, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
that troubled him, but the
horrour of ingratitude; and having
received ſo much kindneſs from the
<hi>Baſſa,</hi> thought it inexcuſable in him to
have any unjuſt deſigns on his Wife:
<hi>But,</hi> then ſays he, <hi>ſhould I not be the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103330:29"/>
moſt ungrateful of men, ſhould I ſlight the
affection of ſo charming a Perſon, to whom,
if I conſider her Obligations according to
their value, I owe more than to the</hi> Baſſa?
<hi>And is it not poſſible for me to ſee, and to
love her within bounds, ſo as to be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
on the one ſide and the other? No, no,
if there be ingratitude in that, I cannot
help it, there is nothing in the World can
excuſe me to the</hi> Sultaneſs, <hi>and love ought
to make my excuſe with the</hi> Baſſa.</p>
               <p>This was the laſt Combate between
gratitude and love in the heart of the
Count; the laſt carried the day, and
going to bed thereupon, he reſted
very well. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
deſirous to ſee him ſo deeply
in love, that he ſhould not be able to
deny it, was the firſt that ſpoke to
him, to return again that day to the
<hi>Sultaneſs</hi> Lodgings: he gave him the
Key of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and laughing,
told him, he need not make ſuch
haſte to come back, if he found as
much pleaſure as he wiſht him there:
but that he muſt have a care, he did
not engroſs all the love to himſelf,
but he ſhould give <hi>Laura</hi> ſome part,
unleſs he were minded to languiſh,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103330:30"/>
as he had done, a long time to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>The amorous <hi>Italian</hi> went ſtraight
to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and <hi>Laura,</hi> who waited
for him, told him at his arrival, he
might paſs to the ſame Chamber he
had been in, and that ſhe would give
her Lady notice of his coming; but
ſhe not having the patience of waiting
ſo long, was got already into the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cove.</hi>
The Count having an extream
curioſity, and longing for a ſight of
that place, thought it convenient for
the purpoſe, to make uſe of that time,
when he believed the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> was
abſent; and coming up to the <hi>Balliſtre,</hi>
gently took up the Curtain. But how
was he ſurprized to ſee on the ſudden,
that charming Perſon in a poſture
the moſt capable of any, to make one
in love.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not trouble you with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the <hi>Alcove,</hi> which being a
Room of State for the Wife of ſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant
a Lord, you may eaſily believe,
was very noble and rich: It was raiſed
a foot higher than the Chamber; the
approach to it being by a ſpace cover'd
with a fair Turky Carpet, checkquer'd
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103330:30"/>
with little ſquares of Damask wrought
with Gold. The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> lay on a
Bed of Damask of like work; and
having deſign'd to ſhew her ſelf that
day to the Count, ſhe had not forgot
to put her ſelf in an equipage and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
capable to charm him at firſt
ſight: ſhe had turned her face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Balliſter,</hi> leaning her head
careleſtly on her left arm, which you
might clearly ſee in her great Tiffany
ſleeve after the Turkiſh mode. Her
black hair was partly pleated with
great ropes of Pearl, parting down on
her Breaſt, and part on her ſhoulders,
and ſet off the clearneſs of her delicate
Complexion (vying with the Snow in
whiteneſs) to ſo much advantage, that
it wrought wonderful effects in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder.
She had about her body, a
ſmall Gold Bodice only, her boſom
being half open, and the reſt cover'd
with a piece of fine Tiffany, like an
Amazons Scarf: all was viſible from
her Neck to her Breaſt, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
to behold, that it had been
impoſſible for an eye, having ſeen it,
(as the Count did) to eſcape being
enamour'd of it: ſhe had on her head,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103330:31"/>
plumes of ſeveral colours, and in the
midſt of them a creſcent of Silver.
Her Coat was of a light Stuff Imbroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with Gold after the faſhion of
the Country, with Diamond Buckles
to tuck it up at the knee: her Leg was
half naked, and the reſt covered with
Buskins all laid over with Diamonds
and Pearls; in a word, ſhe was all ſo
Rich, ſo Gallant, ſo full of Charms,
that the poor <hi>Count</hi> was utterly undone
at the ſight. His joy and aſtoniſhment
were viſible to her in that confuſion of
action and words, in which he was ſo
miſerably plung'd, that he knew not
what was become of himſelf, nor what
he would ſay to her. But falling into
an Extaſie, and wholly ſwallowed up
with admiration, his Eyes and his
Sighs were Orators for him. The fair
<hi>Sultaneſs</hi> as ſoon as ſhe ſaw him, would,
with a Handkerchief ſhe had in her
hand, have covered her face, and hid
from him part of the confuſion ſhe
was in. But the happy Lover, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
courage by degrees, paſſing
his arm betwixt the <hi>Balliſtres,</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
her from it. <hi>Once you might have
had reaſon Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103330:31"/>
kept from my ſight thoſe treaſures of love,
as knowing full well that no man can ſee
them without dying for love of them,
but now 'tis too late to conceal them from
me. I have ſeen more than any heart is
able to bear, without yielding it ſelf; and
it would be extream cruelty in you, not to
compleat what is ſo happily begun.</hi> As
the <hi>Count</hi> was ſpeaking to her in this
manner, ſhe look'd upon him with
eyes ſo tender and piercing, that ſhe
ſeemed willing to execute what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.
The crafty Count having ſeiz'd
one of her hands, (to which, as he
look'd upon it, he gave a thouſand
amorous kiſſes) by little and little drew
it out ſo far on his ſide, with ſo feeble
reſiſtance from the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> that ſhe
came at laſt to lean her head on the
<hi>Balliſtre</hi> juſt over againſt the head of
the <hi>Count.</hi> Then it was, he had full
liberty to take a view at his leaſure
of thoſe Beauties that put him to
amazement, and raviſhed him with
ſuch joy as he had never before been
ſenſible of. As ill luck would have it,
the <hi>Balliſtres</hi> were ſo cloſe, that not
any two of them ſtood half the head
diſtance one from the other. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103330:32"/>
the two Lovers meeting half way,
made a ſhift to ſlip through a great
number of Kiſſes, the moſt charming
and ſweet that Lovers e're taſted. The
<hi>Count</hi> being naturally bold, made one
Liberty but a ſtep to another, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he was permitted to do, and
the pleaſure ſhe took in it, he preſs'd
his amorous temerity ſo far, that what
he did may paſs for half an enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Till then their entertainment
was made up of dumb engagements, a
thouſand times more eloquent than
the fineſt expreſſions in the World.
Their eyes, their ſighs, their actions,
their toyes had ſpoken a Language in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
enough to perſwade both
they loved one another intirely. They
had no need of other converſation;
yet, <hi>Laura</hi> arriving, they changed it
a little, but they ſpoke before her the
moſt tender, and moſt paſſionate things
you can imagine. The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> who
had that confidence in her as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
nothing from her, was not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at her coming. But the <hi>Count,</hi>
who took not ſo much pleaſure in
theſe diſcourſes though very obliging,
as in thoſe dumb entertainments, made
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103330:32"/>
a ſign to <hi>Laura</hi> to take the other turn;
at which the <hi>Saltaneſs</hi> ſeeming a little
angry, let down the Curtain, and ſo
faſtned it behind, that he could not
take it up. But this being in Jeſt, and
to provoke his Paſſion the more, her
rigour was ſhort lived, and Peace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
made more firm than ever.</p>
               <p>The firſt favours give a priviledge
for others, and a kind of right not
only to hope, but demand them: The
<hi>Count,</hi> to be reveng'd of his <hi>Miſtreſs</hi>
for the piece of ſpite ſhe had done
him, thruſt both his Arms between
the <hi>Balliſtres,</hi> and embracing her on
the ſudden, kiſſed her with that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
that he forced Blood out of her
lips. The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> was ſo far from
complaining of the rudeneſs of his
Careſſes, that being charm'd with the
pleaſure of them, ſhe carefully ſaved
all the Blood on her Handkerchief to
preſerve it as a Trophy to ſhew <hi>Laura,</hi>
as a moſt ſenſible mark of the extream
Paſſion her dear <hi>Alexander</hi> had for
her.</p>
               <p>Let me acquaint you by the way
with a rarity of thoſe parts; that for
a Woman to have been beaten by a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103330:33"/>
Man ſhe loves, is eſteemed in that
Country a great evidence of affection
to the party beaten. I confeſs ſuch
favours are ſomewhat rude, but 'tis
the temper of the Country, and ſuch
is their cuſtom: As for the Blood that
came from the lips of the Amorous
<hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> we may believe it proceeded
from a tranſport of Love. With us,
one may be bitten, but not beaten
through extremity of this Paſſion;
but blows exceed the limits of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
and that Woman muſt be an
<hi>African,</hi> that loves to be ſo Courted.
'Tis a faſhion will never paſs in <hi>Europe,</hi>
and though they uſe it ſometimes, yet
never to oblige Women; none of whom
that I know of, were ever pleaſed
with a baſtinade. The reſt of this
viſit having been ſpent in foolery and
toys, though ſometimes of much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in matters of Love, I will not
trouble you with the particulars. <hi>Laura,</hi>
who was not far diſtant from the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
appeared at the leaſt ſign of their
pleaſure to have her attend. The
Count and the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> bid each other
adieu with the greateſt kindneſs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable:
And <hi>Laura</hi> brought him to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103330:33"/>
the Door of the Apartment, ſo deep
in Love, he ſcarce knew where he
was. He went directly from thence
to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who inſtantly obſerved
the viſible change of the Count's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Sadneſs and Melancholy into a
tender and languiſhing air; at which
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> taking occaſion to laugh,
ſaid, <hi>Well,</hi> Alexander, <hi>hath Love plaid
his part well?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is it your pain, or your pleaſure hath
ſo charm'd you to day? I confeſs, Sir,</hi>
ſaid he <hi>with a ſigh, it is the pleaſure
I have met with; but pleaſure, I fear, which
may coſt me much pain.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
that to be the Confident of
the Count's Paſſion, might be of ſome
uſe, took him by the hand, and led
him to the Garden, to take a turn in
the Walks. He fell preſently upon
the ſubject of his good Fortune, and
prayed him to tell him truly, how his
Affairs ſtood. The Count having his
Heart and his Fancy all full of Love,
with very great eaſe gave him ſuch a
raviſhing deſcription of his tendereſt
affections, and painted the pleaſures
he had taken that Evening ſo much
to the life, adding his ſighs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103330:34"/>
with geſtures and looks
ſo eloquent and paſſionate, that he
awaked in the Soul of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> the
affection he had formerly for <hi>Laura,</hi>
and lately laid aſleep. What care ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is taken to cure one of this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſtill there remains enough in the
Heart of a Lover to ſet it on fire by
the leaſt ſpark that falls on it. The
inſenſibility and reſiſtance of <hi>Laura</hi>
had not Ice enough in them to quench
all the heat of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s affection.
She had only covered it with aſhes, to
preſerve it the better againſt another
time: Had the Count acted like a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
Lover, he had eaſily foreſeen,
how tickliſh and dangerous a buſineſs
it is, to make ſuch repreſentations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Perſons who are Amorouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined;
and eſpecially before a Man
whom he had reaſon to conſider as a
Rival, and in whoſe Power it was to
diſpoſe of him as he pleaſed. But the
truth is, that in ſpeaking thus of <hi>Laura,</hi>
he thought he hazarded nothing of
his own; he had really no kindneſs
for her, but hoped to do his own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
the better, in making the <hi>Baſſa</hi>
believe that he lov'd her; which is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103330:34"/>
the reaſon he did not carry himſelf in
this with ſo much caution, as he would
have done in another conjuncture.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſlept not that Night. <hi>Laura</hi>
appear'd a thouſand times more hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
and charming, in the deſcription
of the Count, than ever ſhe had done
in his Eye at full ſight. He eſteemed
himſelf the moſt unfortunate of Men,
not only for that he had quitted the
purſuit, but had contributed ſo much
to ſee her in the Arms of another:
Hereupon jealouſie preſently poſſeſt
him, attended with a train of ſpite,
rage, and peeviſhneſs to torment him.
What great ſhame, thought he, could
ever happen to a Man as he was, who
never found reſiſtance from a Woman,
than to have been ſlighted by a Slave,
who was his dependent, and had yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to another Slave as ſoon as ſhe had
ſeen him? For after the paſſionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<hi>Alexander</hi> had made, the <hi>Baſſa</hi>
made no doubt but all was concluded;
he had fancies of this kind that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him extreamly: and if he did
not then hate the Count, 'tis certain,
he retained not for him that kindneſs
he had formerly expreſt towards him:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103330:35"/>
And as for <hi>Laura,</hi> though he was then
more in Love with her than ever, he
had a pique againſt her, and could
not forbear reproaching her all Night,
for her want of diſcretion in making
greater account of a mans kindneſs,
that could do her no Service, than of
his, by whom ſhe might have made
her Fortune. Theſe thoughts were
followed by others concerning his
Perſon. He accuſed himſelf of baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and weakneſs of Heart, to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
himſelf with the thoughts of a
Creature that ſo little deſerved his
eſteem, or to intend to hinder the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of two Lovers, whoſe Love
he himſelf had cauſed and promoted.
All this notwithſtanding, he went on
the morrow with the Count to the
<hi>Seraglio;</hi> but for no other end, but to
obſerve the countenance of <hi>Laura,</hi>
who ſurprized to ſee him come: <hi>This
is extraordinary, Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe laughing,
<hi>twice in one week: What will People ſay
of it? As for you, ſaid the</hi> Baſſa, <hi>you
will ſay no ill of it, I come in ſo good
Company; and ſhould others believe as
formerly, that I come for love of you,
you know tis not for my ſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103330:35"/>
you are the more obliged to me. Laura</hi>
very civilly thanked him for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
They fell then all three into a
little diſcourſe of Gallantry, wherein
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſpoke ſo many kind things
to <hi>Laura,</hi> that ſhe might underſtand
part of that Amorous trouble he was
in, if ſhe had miſtruſted it; but he
delivered himſelf with ſuch an air,
that his Complements, and kind Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
were taken for meer effects
of his good humour. But the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s
coming thither, being under pretence
of ſeeing the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> he could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
without giving her a Viſit; but
he was not long with her, being not
able to reſt till he return'd to the two
Lovers, which he did with all the
ſpeed in his power. He told <hi>Laura</hi> a
thouſand things more obliging than
formerly; and having highly careſſed
her, gave her at parting ſuch a look,
that if ſhe had made the leaſt reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon it, ſhe might have eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the kindneſs he had formerly
for her took fire afreſh with more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence
than ever; but ſhe could not
ſuſpect in the leaſt he would trouble
her any more, after the kindneſs he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103330:36"/>
had expreſt for his <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been the inſtrument of the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tended
Paſſion between her and the
Count. She took all for Gallantry,
and made it the ſubject of raillery with
the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> to whom ſhe gave an
account of all that had paſt with the
<hi>Baſſa,</hi> and with <hi>Alexander.</hi> The fair
<hi>Turk</hi> went that Evening to bed, ill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with her fate, having been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
of an Entertainment ſhe
had expected, as pleaſant as that ſhe
had received the day before from her
dear Chriſtian; ſhe could not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
lament the unluckineſs of the
Viſit given her by a man who Courted
other Women, and ſeemed to have
been born to incommode and give
trouble only to her. <hi>Laura</hi> anſwered
in raillery, She had little reaſon to
complain of it to her, to whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance
ſhe was beholding for a ſight
of her Lover: <hi>Ah</hi> Laura, ſaid the
<hi>Sultaneſs, who knows for what reaſon he
hath been ſo complaiſant? You may very
well believe, it was not to oblige me. I
believe ſo,</hi> Madam, <hi>replyed</hi> Laura, <hi>but
you are obliged to him however, and ought
to thank him for me.</hi> After this little
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103330:36"/>
raillery, they fell to diſcourſe, what
could have brought the <hi>Baſſa</hi> thither
that evening; and could not imagine,
but it was in Complement to the
Count.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> by this time was fallen
into a deep Melancholy, ſeldom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
but when he walked in the
Garden, ſometimes alone, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with <hi>Alexander,</hi> and then not a
word of <hi>Laura,</hi> nor any diſcourſe of
going again to the Apartment of the
<hi>Sultaneſs:</hi> This troubled our Lover,
who beſides his affliction for being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the ſight of a Perſon he
loved better than his Life, and ceaſing
to ſee her, muſt ceaſe alſo to live; had
a thouſand tormenting ſurmiſes and
troubleſome fancies upon the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s
change of humour, which he could
not attribute to any thing but his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken ſome umbrage and jealouſie
of him, on the account of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs.</hi>
The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> and her Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
were no leſs tormented on the
other hand; they had ſeen a firſt, a
ſecond, a third, and a fourth long
day paſs without a ſight of their <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander:</hi>
Lovers are very exact Accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103330:37"/>
and keep reckoning of the very
moments, but account nothing more
tedious than a day of abſence. What
ſhould be the meaning of all this,
ſaid they one to the other, having a
thouſand fears upon them, though
they knew not of what: 'tis a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
matter to keep any thing ſecret
in places of that nature. Yet they
could not imagine they had given any
occaſion of diſcourſe, or that any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in the Apartment had made the
leaſt diſcovery of their Intrigue. At
laſt, on the fifth day, after abundance
of Affliction, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> came to ſee
them; but, the miſchief of it was,
that he came alone. Beſides, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
ſo dull, ſo muſing, and ſo much
out of humour, they made no more
doubt but he had ſmelt out the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
they held with the Count.
But that which gave them the killing
blow, and raiſed their fears to the
height, was, that <hi>Laura</hi> having, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her cuſtom, waited the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> out of the Chamber, and asked
him, what he had done with her dear
<hi>Eunuch?</hi> I am jealous of him (ſaid
the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> making no ſtay) I need tell
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103330:37"/>
you no more: <hi>Laura</hi> made haſt to
give her <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> the Alarm, and told
her, there was no more doubt to be
made, but jealouſie was the cauſe of
the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s not bringing <hi>Alexander</hi> with
him, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> himſelf having told her
ſo that inſtant; thoſe who are guilty,
are eaſily frightned, and fear hath this
property, that it ſo confounds the
imagination, that the lighteſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
are taken for clear and unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable
truths. With what ſighs,
what tears did the poor <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
her ſelf; yet not ſo much for the
ill conſequences ſhe might apprehend
from the jealouſie of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> as for
the fear ſhe had, that if he were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
jealous of the Chriſtian, ſhe
ſhould never have a ſight of him more.
She did heartily wiſh ſhe could have
written to him, but there are few
truſty Meſſengers to be found in thoſe
places, where there is cauſe to diſtruſt
every one you converſe with; and
every Eye that ſees you, is a ſpy on
your actions, at leaſt if not gained by
Money or Kindneſs, wherein, after
all poſſible care, you may be deceived,
as ſhe was in this trouble. <hi>Laura</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103330:38"/>
a Note from the Count, brought
her by an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and carried it forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to ſhew it the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> being
in theſe words.</p>
               <p>Madam, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> every day more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
than other, is pleaſed to grant me
the honour of walking with you this Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Garden of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> I
know not whether you can diſpenſe with
your ſelf till then. Let us take the hour
you think moſt proper. He will be there
with one of his Miſtreſſes. Send me word,
if you pleaſe, if I may expect this favour
from you.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> would never have thought
of this walk, but out of the extream
deſire he had to know certainly, how
<hi>Laura</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> ſtood affected one
to the other; and that he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
himſelf of what they ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
The Garden was a place very
fit for his deſign, eſpecially by Night,
where he could hear without being
ſeen. He had made the propoſal to
the Count, in confidence he would
receive it with a great deal of joy,
which in appearance he did, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hope of any great ſatisfaction
from the Adventure, it being ſcarce
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103330:38"/>
probable the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> would permit
<hi>Laura</hi> to come. But that which really
troubled him, was the opinion he had,
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> was certainly jealous of his
Wife, ſince he gave him ſo clear proof
of his unwillingneſs that he ſhould ſee
<hi>Laura</hi> at her Lodgings any more.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion then was, how to
write to the <hi>Slave,</hi> to diſpoſe her for
the walk. But the Count having writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the Billet, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſent it by an
<hi>Eunuch,</hi> and ſtay'd for the Anſwer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> read the Billet, and
was of opinion with her Gallant, that it
was for Love of her the <hi>Baſſa</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
he ſhould come any more to
ſee <hi>Laura</hi> in her Apartment. It was
long ere they came to a reſolution in
the point, whether <hi>Laura</hi> ſhould agree
to the aſſignation: <hi>Laura</hi> very wiſely
thought it better not to go, but the
<hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> wholly led by her Paſſion,
and too deeply in Love, to act any
thing with reaſon that concerned her
affection, notwithſtanding any thing
<hi>Laura</hi> could ſay, made her write him
this Anſwer.</p>
               <p>It were to act the part of a very ill Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to be all alone in the Garden, while
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103330:39"/>
others are diverting themſelves there: I
conſent for pity, to come and bear you
company, but on condition that you will
be wiſe, and that we be at ſome diſtance
from the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> becauſe I would not be
known by her, that he brings with him. If
you can promiſe me theſe two things, I am
for you after the fourth Prayer, when the
<hi>Sultaneſs</hi> is a Bed. Adieu.</p>
               <p>This Anſwer was beyond the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the Count, who rejoyced
extreamly at the pleaſure he promiſed
himſelf with the Slave, from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> while they
ſhould continue in the Garden.</p>
               <p>Night being come, and the fourth
Prayer over, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> told him, he
might go, and bring <hi>Laura</hi> to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
while he went for one of his
<hi>Miſtreſſes,</hi> who was lodged on the
other ſide. It is the cuſtom of the
Grandees of that Country, among a
multitude of Women they have in
their <hi>Seraglio,</hi> when they have not a
particular inclination for any one, to
take this to day, and another to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
and having loſt the taſt of Love,
to ſearch for Pleaſure in change and
variety.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:103330:39"/>
It may be eaſily imagined, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
received this Commiſſion
with a great deal of joy, and was in
no ſmall haſte to go to the <hi>Sultaneſſes</hi>
Lodgings. She who was charmed at
the ſight of him, could not expreſs
her joy without a thouſand tranſports
of Love, and the moſt tender careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
a moſt paſſionate Lady could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
make her deareſt Lover. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
did his part to admiration, not
only returning tranſport for tranſport,
and careſs for careſs, but excelling his
pattern, Love working in him, or he
in the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> ſuch things as gave her
very great ſatisfaction. It may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
peradventure that two Perſons
ſo little acquainted, ſhould in ſo few
days become ſo very good Friends.
But we muſt know, Love in theſe hot
Countries makes far quicker progreſs
than in the cold, where the Winds,
and the Snow, and the Rain ſpoil his
Wings, and hinder his flight: Whereas
on the contrary, the Sun is there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſtill at the height, and Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a tender Infant, and going al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
naked, thrives there the better,
where he finds Hearts very well
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103330:40"/>
diſpoſed, and ready to take fire.</p>
               <p>The Count, who could not ſtay long
there, was willing to beſtow the ſmall
time he had to ſpend with the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
in gentle reproaches for her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<hi>Laura</hi> to come and walk with
him. You have, ſaid he, a very good
opinion of my Affection, <hi>Madam,</hi> or
elſe you love me with a great deal of
indifference, that this does not in the
leaſt trouble you at all. The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi>
anſwered, ſhe relied not ſo much on his
Fidelity, as on <hi>Laura's</hi> Diſcretion,
whom ſhe knew too well, to think ſhe
would betray her. Look you to your
ſelf, as for her I place a confidence in
her, and if you do your Duty, I am
perſwaded ſhe will not be wanting in
hers. Having thus ſpoken, ſhe would
not detain him longer for fear of the
<hi>Baſſa,</hi> but retired to the Chamber. The
happy Lover, very well pleas'd with
the lucky moment he had paſt with
the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> asked <hi>Laura</hi> if ſhe were
ready; She made him anſwer, he ſhould
not ſtay for her longer than while ſhe
fetched her <hi>Barnus,</hi> which is a kind of
Hood that covers them from Head to
Foot. The Count ſeeing her return
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103330:40"/>
mufled up in that Garment, went his
way before, according to their cuſtom
there, and ſhe followed: He ſaid not
a word to her while they were in the
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> for fear of being over-heard,
and diſcovered; but being arrived in
the Garden, where they had liberty
enough, <hi>Who will believe, Madam,</hi> ſaid
he, <hi>but we made an Amorous aſſignation,
being come to a place of Rendezvouz ſo
fit for the purpoſe. And the</hi> Baſſa <hi>will
not fail to think us the happieſt Lovers in
the World. Laura</hi> made him no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
but kept on her way, till they
came to the Bower that was aſſigned
them at a convenient diſtance from
the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s, as <hi>Laura</hi> had deſired. The
Count gave her his hand, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very well every turn in thoſe
Walks, which he viſited almoſt every
day, he made her ſit on a ſeat of green
Turf made for the purpoſe. <hi>Then,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>this, Madam, is to try a mans
Fidelity with a Witneſs, to expoſe him to
paſs part of the Night in ſuch a place as
this with a Lady ſo beautiful as you.
Surely the</hi> Sultaneſs <hi>will hence-forward
reſt aſſured of my Paſſion.</hi> The Count
made a pauſe, expecting her anſwer,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103330:41"/>
but not receiving a word from her, he
proceeded, telling her, I thought we had
not been ſo debarred the pleaſures of an
Aſſignation, but we might have enjoy'd
that of diſcourſe; but for ought I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
you mean to follow the faſhion of
<hi>Turky;</hi> &amp; ſince 'tis a favour in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
for a Woman to ſhew her ſelf, or
ſpeak to a Man, you will deprive me of
the one and the other: But while we
are together, I pray let us live after the
mode of our Country, which is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the <hi>Turkiſh.</hi> To do otherwiſe
with me, were altogether too rigorous,
and more, I believe, than you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> or ſhe expects at
your hands. Away, I beſeech you, ſaid
he, taking her by the <hi>Barnus,</hi> with this
ufeleſs Hood, and do me the favour to
tell me ſome News of the <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> or
if you pleaſe, of the Adventures
brought, you hither, which from the
day I firſt had the honour to ſee you,
I have had an extream longing to ask
you: This you will not deny me, if
you think I may be any way uſeful
to you, as I doubt not but I may, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Country-man, and ſo well
eſteemed by the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> as to be able to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103330:41"/>
do you ſome Service. All this Diſcourſe
ſo obliging for <hi>Laura,</hi> ſhe heard, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
replying a word, or quitting her
<hi>Barnus,</hi> as he had deſired. The Count
ſeeing this, preſſed her no further, but
with more ſerious air ſaid, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
<hi>Madam,</hi> to paſs the Evening in
this manner, it will be very unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
for me; but I muſt comply. And
removing a few paces from her, he
went and ſat him down in a corner
of the Bower, where he continued a
while without ſpeaking a word. The
fair Lady fetched a ſigh, as if ſhe had
been diſpleaſed at his quitting her.
The <hi>Count</hi> laying hold on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to be even with her, took his turn
of tormenting, in not anſwering her
ſighs. At laſt ſhe came to him, took
him by the Arm, and embraced him,
with many grimaces, as if ſhe would
have turned all into ridicule. The
<hi>Count</hi> fell a laughing, and ſaid, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
I beſeech you be ſatisfied with
the Sacrifice I make to Love, without
trying my patience any further; let
us, if you pleaſe, have a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
but anſwer me when I ſpeak,
for I do not love talking to my ſelf.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103330:42"/>
But all would not do; ſhe laughed
under her Hood, and took pleaſure in
vexing him. The Count at laſt grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impatient; This is too much, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
ſaid he, and ſince you will needs
laugh, I'le ſhew you a trick ſhall make
you ſpeak in ſpight of your Heart;
having ſaid ſo, he took her in his
Arms, and not being able to take off
her Hood, he uſed ſome Familiarities
with her, would have forced ſpeech
from a Maid of <hi>Laura's</hi> Diſcretion
and Modeſty: But the Lady was ſtill
ſilent, and ſo little concerned, that
ſhe ſcarce made any reſiſtance. At
which the Count was extreamly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
and after all the eſteem he had
for <hi>Laura,</hi> apprehended there might
be a deſign in the buſineſs, and that
he was abuſed: Then it was he did
all in his power to get ſight of her
through a little glimmering of light
that came into the Bower. Did the
<hi>Sultaneſs</hi> know, ſaid he, the liberty
you allow me, ſhe would give you
no thanks for your ſilence, or your
being ſhie of affording me a ſight of
you, which it ſeems you do to give
me occaſion to attempt greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103330:42"/>
and deny me ſmall favours to
grant me the principal. The fair Lady
not able to defend her ſelf longer,
quitted her <hi>Barnus,</hi> and having eſcap'd
out of his hands, Ah, little Traytor,
ſaid ſhe, is this the Fidelity you have
promiſed me? Oh Heavens, <hi>Madam,</hi>
ſaid he, is it you? It was the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi>
her ſelf had taken <hi>Laura's</hi> place, and
you may imagine what a pleaſant ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
this was to the Count, who
could not on the ſudden otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
it than by his exclamations; and
running after her (who fled not too
faſt) he overtook her at the Door of
the Bower, and embracing her moſt
tenderly, My dear <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> ſaid he
the ſecond time, is it you? Yes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
ſhe (ſuffering her ſelf to be
gently brought back into the Bower)
it is I, who repent me already of what
I have done for you who did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it. Did you think me ſo ſimple,
to expoſe into the hands of another,
that which I hold moſt dear in the
World? Do not I ſee how ill it is
truſting of you? Your Conſtancy
was very tottering; it was at leaſt
half overcome. And had <hi>Laura,</hi> the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103330:43"/>
counterfeit <hi>Laura</hi> anſwered your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
where would you have been?
Never was Man more confounded
than the <hi>Count</hi> at all theſe Reproaches:
He made a free Confeſſion, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
himſelf by her carriage towards
him, alledging it impoſſible for any
Man to have withſtood the attaques
ſhe had made. At laſt, he carried the
Cauſe, all was accommodated, an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
made, and Love ſigned the
Articles.</p>
               <p>To come in ſearch of a Gallant
(as the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> had done) into a
Garden where ſhe knew her Husband
was preſent, was an Adventure ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
bold: And doubtleſs, there are
many Women who will condemn her
conduct as imprudent; but of thoſe
who are in Love there, are few, who
being in her place, would not take
the ſame courſe. The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> though
accompanied with a very Beautiful
Perſon, paſt away time ſomewhat
worſe than the Count: <hi>Chabania</hi> his
<hi>Miſtreſs</hi> had (beſides Beauty) an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Wit, and a very taking car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
which made her paſs for the
moſt charming Perſon in the <hi>Seraglio.</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:103330:43"/>
The <hi>Baſſa</hi> had formerly been deeply
in Love with her; but Love for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
is not very durable: Her
Patron was not in an humour to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
her that Evening, and had not
brought her with him into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
but to ſerve for a pretence to
colour other deſigns; ſhe apprehended
as much, as ſoon as ſhe knew that
<hi>Laura</hi> was in the Garden, which the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> unluckily told her, thinking he
might ſatisfie her in that point, by
letting her know that <hi>Laura</hi> was deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Love with <hi>Alexander,</hi> in whoſe
company ſhe was. But <hi>Chabania</hi> was
ſo far from believing it, that ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
fancied <hi>Alexander</hi> to be no other
than the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Confident in the affair,
and that he had not brought <hi>Laura</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Garden but for his Maſter: ſhe
had been formerly jealous of him, even
to diſtraction, and I know not how
it came to paſs the <hi>Baſſa</hi> was ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen,
as not to have made choice of
ſome other of his Women, who might
have been more for his turn on this
occaſion: She was at her wits end for
the ſmall countenance he gave her;
all the while he was with her ſhe had
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103330:44"/>
ſcarcely fewer words from him, and
ſaw clearly his thoughts were wholly
of <hi>Laura.</hi> This was vexation enough
for a Woman in Love, who knows
her ſelf handſom, and is high ſpirited
withal. But that which put her into
abſolute deſpair, was, that the <hi>Baſſa</hi>
not able to obtain any truce from his
jealouſie, having ſpent ſome time in
her company, without any careſs, or
giving her the leaſt evidence of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
though ſhe had more than once
given him occaſion to ſhew it; told
her, he had a longing deſire to go
hearken, and know how the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in the Bower entertained one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
ſhe made him no anſwer, but
letting him go, ſhe the next minute af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
went another way towards the ſame
Bower to obſerve the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and ſee
what he did there.</p>
               <p>The Nights in that Country are
very clear, eſpecially in Summer: the
<hi>Baſſa,</hi> notwithſtanding all the caution
he had uſed to poſt himſelf ſecurely
near <hi>Alexander</hi>'s quarter, under the
favour of the Hedges that covered his
approach, was perceived by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
<hi>Laura</hi> in the Bower. She had
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103330:44"/>
diſcovered him by his ſhadow, and
having made her lover aware of it, he
preſently went out, and ran to meet
the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> to intreat him not to come
any further, but permit him to enjoy
that moment of pleaſure he had been
pleaſed to procure him. The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi>
not knowing what wind had brought
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> to that ſide of the Garden,
and fearing he would come into the
Bower, would not be perſwaded by
any thing that <hi>Alexander</hi> could ſay to
her, to ſtay after him in the Bower,
but went preſently out to hide her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in ſome corner of the Garden,
where ſhe thought ſhe might be in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſecurity.</p>
               <p>The mean time the jealous <hi>Baſſa,</hi>
confounded at the diſcovery, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
loſt the opportunity of executing
the deſign he had ſo unfortunately
laid, ſuffered himſelf to be prevail'd
upon by the intreaties of his Rival,
and returned towards his Bower, as
<hi>Alexander</hi> to his; where being arrived,
he was ſufficiently amaz'd at miſſing
the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> but thought ſhe had fled
away for fear, which troubled him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly;
but juſt as he was leaving
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103330:45"/>
the Bower to go in ſearch of her, he
ſaw in the furtheſt and moſt retired
part of it, ſomething that ſeem'd to
have the ſhape of a Woman: then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up thither, and finding he had not
been miſtaken, he fancied it only to
be a trick of the <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> this pleaſed
him extreamly, and paſſionately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
her, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>are not
you very waggiſh? you would fain have
made me run all about the Garden in
ſearch of you:</hi> She anſwered not a word,
but getting out of his arms, ſhe went
away briskly, and withdrew into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
corner of the Bower: the Count
was ſurprized at this manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
being not ſo gentle as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> who loved
him ſo tenderly; but to undeceive
himſelf as ſoon as he could, and to
find out the cauſe of ſo ſudden a
change, he went up to her the ſecond
time, and taking her by the hand;
<hi>What may be the reaſon, Madam,</hi> ſaid
he, <hi>that you run away, and hide your ſelf
from me? there is no fear of the</hi> Baſſa;
<hi>he is withdrawn to his quarter, and hath
promiſed not to give us any further diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.</hi>
But all this could not make her
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103330:45"/>
anſwer a word; ſo that not knowing
what to think of this rigour, he kneeled
on the ground where ſhe was ſitting
on a ſeat of green Turf, and kiſſing
her hand, prayed her for loves ſake,
to tell him the reaſon why ſhe ſeemed
angry with him; he courted and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
her with great paſſion and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
and ſhe as patiently took it,
but at laſt perceiving her laugh a
laughter very different from that of the
<hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> he examined her more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and knew by the difference of her
ſhape, and her Cloaths, that he was
miſtaken. It was inconceivable, what
a trouble this put him in. He thought
himſelf arrived in Fairy-land, to ſee
the ſtrangeſt ſights in the World. That
<hi>Laura</hi> had been changed into the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs,</hi>
was not ſo ſurprizing as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
but that the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> ſhould be
turned into another Woman, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s, this was
the thing he could not comprehend:
that which troubled him moſt, and
extreamly diſquieted him, was the pain
he was in, for not knowing what was
become of the <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> and the fear
he had, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> might have met her
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103330:46"/>
in the Garden, and known her: this
moved him again to go out in ſearch
of her, but <hi>Chabania</hi> (for it was ſhe
he had miſtaken for the <hi>Sultaneſs)</hi> held
him faſt by the ſleeve, and ſtaid him,
telling him in the <hi>Moors</hi> Language,
it was not fit for him to quit in that
manner a Lady for whom he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
expreſs'd ſome affection. The
Count underſtood not her language,
prayed her to let him go for fear the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> ſhould come, and be offended at
his being with her. But all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
ſhe no more underſtood his <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
than he her <hi>Moreſque,</hi> and was
ſo far from letting him go, that ſhe
would have made him ſit by her, that
ſhe might revenge her ſelf on the <hi>Baſſa</hi>
for the ſlight he had put upon her.
During this little conteſt, which could
not but be ſomewhat extraordinary
between two Perſons who underſtood
not one another, the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> comes
in quite out of breath, and throws her
ſelf half dead into the arms of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
who happened to be in a place
ready to receive her. What frightful
fancies had he then in his head? He
preſently imagined they were utterly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103330:46"/>
undone, and that ſhe had been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
But the <hi>Baſſa</hi> arriving pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after, ſet him right again in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
you run away <hi>Madam,</hi> ſpeaking
to the counterfeit <hi>Laura,</hi> from a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
who wiſhes you no ill, nor intends
you any; then turning towards <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
he was about to excuſe himſelf
to him for breaking his word, but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Chabania</hi> ſtand by him, he ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
altered both his mind and his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
asking her in <hi>Moreſque</hi> what
ſhe was come thither for. She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him aloud, and gave him a
thouſand reproaches for his unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and weakneſs in quitting her, to
follow a Slave that run away from
him. This was a very rare Scene,
and the Dialogue not a little pleaſing
to the <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> but ſhe had not long
to laugh at it, for <hi>Chabania</hi> being vext
to the heart for the ſlight the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had
put upon her, and for what he had
ſaid to her before her pretended rival,
flew like a Fury upon the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi>
with that promptitude and ſwiftneſs,
that neither the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> nor <hi>Alexander,</hi>
who would have ſtaid her, were able
to ſave the counterfeit <hi>Laura</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103330:47"/>
ſomewhat ill handled. The Count
was touched to the quick at this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and no conſideration of life or
of duty, could have prevented him
from having ſatisfaction, had not his
fear of loſing the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> prevailed
more upon him than his reſentment.
The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was as angry as he, and
taking the enraged <hi>Chabania</hi> by the
hand, he drew her ſomewhat rudely
out of the Bower, and led her away.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Count</hi> was no ſooner alone with
the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> but embracing her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
<hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he, with a paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
tone, <hi>what dangers have you gone
through for love of me! what a cruel
aſſault have you but now endured?</hi> The
<hi>Sultaneſs</hi> did nothing but laugh at the
laſt adventure ſhe had been in, and told
him ſhe took more pleaſure to ſee
<hi>Chabania</hi>'s deſpair, (for whom ſhe had
ever a natural averſion) than ſhe had
ſuffered of harm by her outrage and
violence. But ſhe confeſſed the ſame
time, that ſhe was in extream perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
when ſhe met the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ranging over
the Garden in ſearch of that Woman,
and that it was the higheſt piece of
good fortune imaginable, that ſhe had
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103330:47"/>
her <hi>Barnus</hi> with her, to hide her ſelf
in. She added that her dear Husband
had ſaid to her a thouſand gallant
things, and had done alſo ſome things
a little extraordinary; but that it was
her good fortune to be not far from
the Bower, and to make her eſcape:
ſhe told him further, that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
no more doubt of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s
being newly fallen in love with <hi>Laura,</hi>
and that ſhe was very well aſſured of
it by the kindneſs of his expreſſions,
and the tranſports ſhe obſerved him in
at this rencounter; that this was the
true cauſe of all their alarms, and the
reaſon why he brought him not into
the <hi>Seraglio</hi> as formerly: The <hi>Count</hi>
was of the ſame judgment, and both
held it neceſſary to make good uſe of
the occaſion, and that <hi>Laura</hi> who was
to act the principal part, ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
her beſt addreſs and complaiſance
in their favour.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> taking ſmall pleaſure in
the Garden after the unhappy ſucceſs
of his amorous deſigns, having done his
endeavour to pacifie <hi>Chabania,</hi> would
bring her back to her Lodgings, and
paſs'd by <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Bower, to let
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103330:48"/>
him underſtand it was time to with
draw. The <hi>Count</hi> followed him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
being extreamly joyful to have
come off ſo happily from a walk that
had prov'd ſo full of adventures: He
bore his dear <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> company into
her Apartment, where he ſtaid not
long for fear of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
to his lodging. He paſt the reſt
of the night very pleaſantly, though
he ſlept not at all; and the truth is, he
had reaſon enough to be well pleaſed,
though his Patron had not, who was
more labouring under mortal afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<hi>Laura,</hi> whom he now was more
deeply in Love with than ever, put
him in deſpair by her Rigours and
Cruelties: if no more pity from her,
then no more pleaſure to be expected
in his life. His great affection for
<hi>Alexander</hi> could not keep him from
being his rival, and wiſhing to ſhare
with him in the favours ſhe did him.
His paſſion was arrived at a point
which is the higheſt of ſufferings, that
of not being loved: and when he
thought of the opportunity he had let
ſlip the night before, when he had
<hi>Laura</hi> in his power, he was ſo cruelly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103330:48"/>
vext, he could have found in his heart
to be revenged of himſelf: yet he had
no great cauſe to blame his diſcretion,
for he had done enough, and unleſs
he would have driven his Gallantry to
the laſt puſh of all, he could not have
done more. He was not willing to
declare himſelf to <hi>Alexander,</hi> nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with the thoughts he had
newly entertained, as well to prevent
the diſpleaſure he believed it would
give him, as for that he conceived the
<hi>Count</hi> might be of uſe to him in the
deſign, and that the diſcovery might
be to his prejudice.</p>
               <p>In the Morning as ſoon as he was
up, he went (as he ſometimes was
uſed) to the <hi>Count's</hi> Chamber without
any attendant, and found him in Bed:
<hi>A Man,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>muſt be as happy as</hi>
Alexander <hi>in his Love, before he can
ſleep as quietly as he.</hi> If there be any,
anſwered the <hi>Count,</hi> hath cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
his good fortune on that account,
it muſt without doubt be a Perſon of
your comlineſs and Gallantry, who to
gain love, need no more than ſay you
are in love. Yes, replied the <hi>Baſſa,</hi>
with a ſmile, except it be to <hi>Laura,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:103330:49"/>
who hath made me very ſenſible that
I can ſigh to no purpoſe, and that the
maſter of her perſon may not be the
maſter of her heart; It was neceſſary
that <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould come from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
to <hi>Africk</hi> to make that Conqueſt:
This, Sir, replyed the <hi>Count,</hi> may be
an inſtance of the Vagaries and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies
of Love, who often knows
not where to fix, but follows the effects
of deſtiny, or the Stars which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
over the affections. And I
believe Sir, added he ſmiling, as for
the Love of <hi>Laura,</hi> you are already
very well ſatisfied, and ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
where ſhe beſtows it, that you
never deſigned to make me in Love
with her, that you might be my Rival.
However, ſaid he, obſerving the <hi>Baſſa</hi>
ſigh, I aſſure you, ſhould it ſo happen,
you cannot do me a greater favour
than in letting me know it. And you
ſhall find that all the paſſion I can have
for her, ſhall not hinder any perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the duty I owe you. I will
quit all my pretentions as I know you
have the leaſt deſign upon her, that I
may prevent all diſpute with a Perſon
to whom I am ſo deeply oblig'd, that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103330:49"/>
there can be nothing ſo dear to me,
but I will part with it for your ſake.
Believe it <hi>Alexander,</hi> anſwered the
<hi>Baſſa,</hi> it is not ſo eaſie a matter to be
diſingaged from a paſſion like yours:
you may as well perſwade me, you
cannot be in Love. I am certainly in
Love, replied the <hi>Count,</hi> and it may
be as deeply as poſſible; but having
ſo many favours daily heaped on me
from you, there is nothing in the
World I ſhall Love more than your
repoſe and ſatisfaction: And, Sir, if
<hi>Laura</hi> appear now as amiable as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
to you, I muſt tell you again,
I love her no longer; ſo eaſie a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was it for the ſubtile <hi>Italian</hi> to be
generous in parting with that in which
he was ſo little concerned. The <hi>Baſſa</hi>
asked him if he would ſay as much
before <hi>Laura.</hi> He anſwered, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
him too juſt and too gallant to
deſire him to make a declaration of
that nature before one who had been
his <hi>Miſtreſs.</hi> At laſt the <hi>Baſſa</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
another walk in the Garden
that very day, and at the ſame time
prayed him to write about it to
<hi>Laura;</hi> which the Count having not
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103330:50"/>
been able to avoid, received this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>The burnt child dreads the fire; we do
not commonly expoſe our ſelves twice to the
ſame danger. The <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s uſage of me
laſt night, gives me ſmall encouragement
to truſt him the ſecond time. And you
are an eye-witneſs how ill I was handled
by her he had with him. Let it ſatisfie
you, that if you come hither, I will have
the honour to ſee you. But no more
walking.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> much troubled at ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
an anſwer, went out of the
Counts Chamber without ſaying a
word, and paſs'd in ſolitude the reſt
of the day. But in the Evening he
went to the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
met <hi>Laura;</hi> who inquiring of
<hi>Alexander,</hi> and why he had not brought
him with him; would it diſpleaſe you,
ſaid the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> if I ſupplied his place
this Evening: that were too great an
honour for me, replied <hi>Laura</hi> ſmiling,
but the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> expects you, and is
not very well. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> gave her
his hand, and would have led her into
a private Chamber; <hi>Laura</hi> perceiving
it, and that he was in good earneſt,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103330:50"/>
Prayed him to let her go; that her
Lady was not well, and he knew well
enough ſhe could not endure her being
a moment out of her ſight: I, I, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> is ſick,
and cannot be a moment without you;
but 'tis becauſe 'tis I deſire to paſs that
moment with you; had it been <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
you could have ſtaid a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
The <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſaid this with ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
a tone, ſhe could not forbear
laughing. You know Sir, replied ſhe,
'tis another caſe when you are with
the <hi>Sultaneſs.</hi> Beſides Sir, added ſhe
ſmiling, one would venture a little for
a Sweet-heart: Well, well, ſaid he,
preſſing her to go along with him,
'tis Love hath brought me hither: I,
Sir, anſwer'd ſhe ſtriving to get away
from him, and 'tis Love obliges me to
avoid the occaſion of being found
alone in your company; for though I
know you a moſt accompliſhed Perſon,
you will allow me to tell you, you
have not too much reſpect for our Sex,
and 'tis very hard truſting you, witneſs
your aſſaults laſt night in the Garden.
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> made her a thouſand Oaths
he would keep within the bounds of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103330:51"/>
that reſpect and diſcretion ſhe might
expect from the ſevereſt vertue, and
proteſted he deſired only one quarter
of an hours diſcourſe. <hi>Laura,</hi> who
knew the violence and obſtinacy of his
humour, when denyed any thing he
held reaſonable to be granted him,
diſpoſed her ſelf to entertain him that
quarter of an hour. He reproached
her a thouſand times for her hardneſs
and cruelty againſt him, and gave her
withall the kindeſt words and the moſt
tender and paſſionate expreſſions ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.
<hi>Laura,</hi> to defend her ſelf,
pleaded her Honour, her Religion, and
her Duty to the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> her <hi>Miſtreſs;</hi>
three things ſhe would not betray for
the World: Had you but a little Love
for me, ſaid the <hi>Baſſa</hi> with a ſigh, you
would not find ſo many reaſons for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
I have my Religion as you
have yours, and the Precepts of it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
as ſevere as yours; but Love is
ſtronger than all the Precepts, the
Laws, the Religions of the World, and
thoſe who ſerve him, worſhip no other
God. As for the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> how are
you concerned, that is my buſineſs,
not yours; and it ſhall be your fault, if
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103330:51"/>
ever ſhe know it. But what do you
tell me of Honour?</p>
               <p>Surely 'tis more for your Honour to
love a Man as I am, than to love ſuch
a one as <hi>Alexander.</hi> You miſtake your
ſelf, Sir, anſwered <hi>Laura,</hi> if you think
that in the viſits he hath made me,
there hath any thing paſs'd contrary to
my duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'Tis not with thoſe of our
Nation, as with the People of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
We may be together, and no body
by, yet my Honour ſecure. I ſwear
to you, Sir, <hi>Alexander</hi> never received
that favour from me, which I could
not afford the Perſon for whom I am
the leaſt concerned in the World. The
<hi>Baſſa</hi> interrupted her; what, not in
the Garden? Neither in the Garden
nor any where elſe, replyed ſhe, had
he ever any other advantage than a
ſight of me, which with us is accounted
for nothing. Can you make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
anſwered the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> what you
ſay? <hi>Laura</hi> told him, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more true, and he might reſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of it: But Sir, ſaid ſhe, for your better
ſatisfaction, bring him no more hither,
and you ſhall ſee whether I make my
complaint for it: 'Twere pitty, replyed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103330:52"/>
the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> to deſtroy ſo fair a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
and I do proteſt to you, that
were it in my power, I would give
you no trouble, but I am not ſo much
Maſter of my ſelf, to gain this point on
my heart, to be unconcerned in your
Love: But ſince you love <hi>Alexander</hi>
with ſo much indifference, that you
can ſo eaſily reſolve not to ſee him
more, I have no cauſe to afflict my
ſelf, but rather to hope you may one
day love me perhaps as much as you do
him.</p>
               <p>After theſe words the <hi>Baſſa</hi> retired,
with a heart a little better at eaſe than
when he came in, but as deeply in
Love as before. He gave not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
and firm credit to what <hi>Laura</hi> had
told him of her indifference and ſmall
concernment for <hi>Alexander,</hi> but did
believe her paſſion for the Chriſtian
not ſo great as he had imagined, or
that their Love had been cooled by
ſome quarrel, for he had obſerved on
the one ſide and the other, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference
than is uſually conſiſtent
with that paſſion.</p>
               <p>But then reflecting ſuddenly on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
may not this be (ſaid he, reſuming
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103330:52"/>
his jealouſie and diffidence,) an effect
of their policy? may they not be
agreed to deceive me? and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſufficiently aſſured of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
affections, may they not pretend
they have no Love for one another,
that they may Love one another with
greater ſecurity? No, no, adds he, this
cannot be, there is no hiding of Love,
it will appear if not ſmothered to death:
She love not <hi>Alexander</hi> at all, or loves
him but indifferently; thus he the more
eaſily perſwaded himſelf to be ſo, in
that he did moſt paſſionately deſire it
might be ſo; and thence-forward his
paſſion increaſed ſo faſt, it became
greater than ever. Hope being a paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that more than any other foments
that of Love, eaſily promiſes it ſelf
happy events, and flatters it ſelf with
expectation of good fortune and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laura</hi> gave the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> an accompt
of all the pleaſant diſcourſe; and the
<hi>Sultaneſs</hi> could have wiſhed <hi>Laura</hi> had
not been altogether ſo ſevere to the
<hi>Baſſa,</hi> but a little more kind and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant,
without which ſhe thought
they could not ſee <hi>Alexander</hi> ſo often
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103330:53"/>
as ſhe deſired. <hi>Laura</hi> on the contrary
told her, that to have been complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
would have ſpoyl'd all, for that
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> would then have entertained
ſome hopes of favour from her, and ſo
become more amorous than before,
and conſequently more jealous of his
ſuppoſed Rival than ever. What ſhall
I do then, ſaid the poor <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> who
can do nothing but fear, and cannot
expect any thing but croſſes and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes?
<hi>Laura</hi> told her, things were
not in ſo deſperate a condition, that
ſhe need trouble her ſelf for it, for the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> had promiſed to ſend <hi>Alexander</hi>
on the morrow, and that they would
conſider with him how to order their
buſineſs.</p>
               <p>The Count did not know that the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> had been with the <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> but
having not heard from him that day,
he went on the morrow to wait on
him at his riſing. He found him abed,
ſo dejected and melancholy, that he
might by his countenance eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the heavineſs of his heart. Yet he
received him with that air of kindneſs
and friendſhip might well aſſure the
Count, he was not diſpleaſed with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103330:53"/>
him. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was ſilent a while, and
then looking on the Count with an air
of friendſhip and confidence; <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
ſaid he, I am the moſt unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
of men, eſpecially, in Love.
<hi>Laura,</hi> added he, ſighing, the cruel
<hi>Laura</hi> hath not the leaſt tenderneſs for
me; no, not the leaſt pity for the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſhe ſees me ſuffer for her: and
unleſs you will be a little kind to me,
I know not what will become of me.
Ah Sir, anſwered the Count, let me
but know what you deſire of me, and
what I can do for you: you know it
is not in my power to diſpoſe of others
hearts; but if I may contribute to
your ſatisfaction; if you would have
me ſpeak to her; if—How happy
ſhould I be, ſaid the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, would you do what you can.
Sir, replyed the Count, if it depend
upon me, you may promiſe your ſelf
ſucceſs. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> held his peace for
a little time, as if he ſtudied what to
ſay; but <hi>Alexander</hi> preſſing him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
himſelf, he told him with ſome
trouble, that he ſhould appoint an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
with <hi>Laura</hi> in a Chamber,
in the Apartment of-the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:103330:54"/>
where the <hi>Baſſa</hi> might meet her in his
ſtead. The Propoſal was ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and unfit for <hi>Alexander</hi> to conſent
to, that it aſtoniſh'd him on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ſo extreamly, that having bluſh'd
at it very much, he knew not what
anſwer to make. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> obſerved
the diſorder he was in, and was more
out of countenance at it than the
Count; but for fear he ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
it otherwiſe than intended, and
taking his bluſhing for no very good
Omen, he told him, (to be rid of
him) that he might go think of it, and
that if he gave him any anſwer, it
ſhould be a favourable one.</p>
               <p>The Count went out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and made a thouſand reflections
on his ill Fortune, which had reduced
him to the extremity of making him
ſerve ſuch a perſon; not but that he
was fully perſwaded, <hi>Laura</hi> would not
come, and that he ſhould be little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
though ſhe ſhould entertain
the motion, and favour the paſſion of
his amorous Patron: but beſides the
baſeneſs of the imployment he put him
upon, he was mad to think he took
him for ſuch a Villain, that loving a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103330:54"/>
Maid, as the <hi>Baſſa</hi> believed he did
<hi>Laura,</hi> could betray her ſo baſely.
This was the only thing troubled him,
nor would he have done it, though he
died for it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> having ſeen him leave his
Chamber in that manner, thought
there was ſmall hope of effecting his
deſign that way; yet being a perſon
of great reaſon and worth, he was ſo
far from thinking the worſe of the
Count, or being offended with him on
this occaſion, that he eſteemed of him
the better, and conſidered of other
means to gain ſatisfaction to his love
in the enjoyment of <hi>Laura.</hi> His paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was now arrived at a height be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the power of reaſon to manage,
and capable to put him on any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
whatever. The moſt vertuous
of men when changed into a deſperate
Lover, become the moſt furious and
extravagant of all; being ſo much
more ſenſible of ſlights put upon him,
as he conceives himſelf a perſon of
merit.</p>
               <p>This tranſported Lover having fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of his deſign to make <hi>Alexander</hi> of
his Party, to ſerve his ends in a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103330:55"/>
that included Treachery, reſolved
to deceive <hi>Laura</hi> himſelf, by going to
ſee her that night diſguiſed as an <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch.</hi>
The deſign was not very well
laid, but it took, as ſhall appear by
the ſequel. He had not the patience
to ſtay till his ordinary hour of going
to the <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> but as ſoon as 'twas
night, he went away diſguiſed like an
<hi>Eunuch,</hi> and came to the apartment,
where he found one old <hi>Moor</hi> at the
gate, who not taking ſo much notice
of him as to know him, he ſent her to
<hi>Laura,</hi> to tell her that an <hi>Eunuch</hi> of
her acquaintance deſired to ſpeak with
her in the Chamber of repoſe; ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
becauſe it was retired, and far
from noiſe, and the place where they
uſed to take ſome hours reſt after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in Summer. He made choice of
this Chamber as the moſt proper for
his deſign; and the old Woman was
no ſooner gone about her meſſage, but
he went to hide him there. <hi>Laura</hi>
was then buſie, and the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
caſually met the old Woman in
ſearch of <hi>Laura,</hi> asked her, what ſhe
would have with her? the old Woman
having had no order to keep private
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103330:55"/>
her buſineſs, told her freely, there was
an <hi>Eunuch</hi> deſired to ſpeak with her in
the Chamber of Repoſe. The <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
hearing of an <hi>Eunuch</hi> who would
ſpeak with <hi>Laura,</hi> made no queſtion
at all but <hi>Alexander</hi> was the Man; and
without further enquiry what kind of
Man the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was, or any other
conſideration, ſhe takes <hi>Laura's Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and goes to the place of aſſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
had ſhe made the leaſt reflection
on the meſſage, ſhe could not have
been ſo deceived, nor have expoſed
her ſelf ſo eaſily to the danger ſhe
went into. It was not the cuſtom of
her Gallant to uſe her thus, or to ſee
her any where but in the <hi>Alcove</hi>-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
he ſcarce knew the name of the
Chamber where ſhe was told he ſtaid
for <hi>Laura,</hi> and knowing what ſhe did
of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> ſhe had reaſon to miſtruſt
him. But thoſe who are in Love as
the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> was, are ſubject to greater
over-ſights than theſe. She knew that
<hi>Alexander</hi> was not to ſee her but by
night, yet ſhe waited for him from
the firſt moment ſhe awoke in the
morning; and in this amorous expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
which tantalized her extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103330:56"/>
and kept her in a mortal inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
whether he came or came not,
there needed no help to hurry her
away when the time drew near. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who have been in Love, will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confeſs there is nothing ſo hard as
to be prudent on ſuch occaſions, and
that the name of their Gallant when
expected, hath made them ſtart up for
joy, and run to meet him e're they
knew whether he were come.</p>
               <p>The paſſionate <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up her ſelf to be led blind-fold,
where ſhe thought Love waited for her,
borrowed wings of that God to carry
her the ſooner into that Chamber;
there was not any light there, but this
did not ſurprize her, it being not uſual
to place any in that Chamber. She
pleaſed her ſelf with the fancy of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Love-trick on <hi>Alexander,</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him take her once more for <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi>
this made her reſolve to be ſilent a
while, as ſhe had been in the Garden,
and to divert her ſelf that way. But
as ſhe was entring, ſhe was taken with
a ſhivering all over, and ſuch a ſudden
fear, that ſhe was on the point of going
back again. But the Gallant who
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103330:56"/>
waited for her, having taken her by
the Hand, ſhe began to recollect her
ſelf, and went along with him where
he pleas'd: he led her away to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end of the Chamber, where he
was ſo loth to loſe time for making
uſe of the occaſion, that embracing
her with ſome tranſport, though tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
withal, he had almoſt put it out of
her power to defend her ſelf. The
<hi>Sultaneſs</hi> thinking this action too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to be <hi>Alexander</hi>'s, began to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt;
and having given him his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
till then, ſhe did the utmoſt in her
power to reſiſt him, and knew, though
a little too late, that ſhe was abuſed,
and that this Man had neither the
ſhape, nor the ſtature, nor face of her
<hi>Alexander,</hi> and that it muſt be the <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi>
which ſome marks ſhe knew about
him, ſoon put out of queſtion, ſhe
changed her method, and ſtood upon
her guard. The reſiſtance ſhe made
after the kindneſs ſhe expreſt at the
firſt, was obſerved by the Gallant, and
made him perceive that the cheat was
diſcovered, and no hopes of hiding
himſelf. So that without further dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
he made his laſt efforts, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103330:57"/>
thoſe of the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> ſo uſeleſs,
that he obtained his deſign. This
tranſported Lover was happy at leaſt
in conceit, which ſufficiently proves
the power of imagination, and that
our greateſt pleaſures proceed from it.
I am ſure, there is no unfortunate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
but may envy his miſtake, and
that chance could not put a greater ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
on any Man, than this on the
<hi>Baſſa.</hi> His paſſion thus ſatisfied, he
withdrew, without ſaying a word,
and the Lady made all the haſte ſhe
could to her Chamber, for fear the
paſſionate <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſhould renew the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.
<hi>Laura</hi> who had been much
troubled at miſſing of her, was no leſs
amazed to ſee her come in the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhe was in, which made her throw
her ſelf on the Bed; where half weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
half laughing, ſhe told her the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the adventure: At which <hi>Laura</hi>
did nothing but laugh, expecting very
pleaſant concluſions from ſo comical
beginnings.</p>
               <p>The Count had been at the <hi>Baſſa's</hi>
in the Evening, and not finding him
within, came on the Morrow to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with the reſolution he had
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103330:57"/>
taken on the propoſal. As he entred
the apartment, he was told that the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> had been ill that night, and had
not ſlept at all, and that he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
any entrance into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
but the Count having more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg
than others, they let him paſs,
and he found him abed, and writing
with ſo ſad a meen, and ſo dejected a
countenance, that the Count preſently
concluded he had had a very ill night;
ſeeing <hi>Alexander</hi> on the ſudden, he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
a little; but the Count laying
one knee to the ground, I come, Sir,
ſaid he, to beg one favour more of
you: You are the principal Author of
all the Love I am engaged in; it is my
misfortune that you feel the ſame paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Accept, I beſeech you, the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
I make you Sir, I will never love,
and if you will have it ſo, I will never
ſee <hi>Laura</hi> more. Bleſs me! cryed the
<hi>Baſſa,</hi> what Lovers are theſe! is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that two perſons who began to
love one another with ſo tender affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
can part with ſuch eaſe? and
that I, who am not beloved, cannot
bring my ſelf to this: ſpeak <hi>Alexander,</hi>
and tell me whether it proceeds from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103330:58"/>
any diſtaſt you have taken, or that
you do it for my ſake. No Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the Count, <hi>Laura</hi> is this day as
amiable in my eyes as the firſt day I
ſaw her; but rather than ſee you in
the condition I find you in, I will not
ſpare the doing my ſelf any violence I
am capable of; and for your quiet and
my own, I heartily wiſh. I never had
ſeen her. This example is ſo rare, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> that nothing leſs than
the eſteem I have for you, can make it
credible. In the mean time this Billet
will let you ſee, that I have not ſtaid
for you to ſet me a Preſident, but that
I know in my turn how to give Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
for others to imitate, but not to
out-do. It is written to <hi>Laura,</hi> read
it: And there it will appear to you,
that if I have done you wrong, I know
how to puniſh my ſelf for it. I ſhould
be heartily ſorry, ſo virtuous and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a perſon as you, ſhould part from
us, with an ill opinion of me. The
Count extreamly ſurprized at this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
not comprehending the reaſon
of it, after an anſwer full of reſpect
and acknowledgment to his dear Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
took the Billet, and there read
theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:103330:58"/>
If all the paſſion Man can have for a
Woman, is not capable to juſtifie the crime
I committed againſt you, you ought to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me, at leaſt having ſuffered in one
night all the torments and afflictions of a
cruel repentance, which yet fills my ſoul
with grief and confuſion. And if by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
you and your Lover your Liberty, I
may in ſome meaſure make amends for my
faults, you may make you ready for your
voyage, for to morrow morning you ſhall go
both together. Farewel, and think of the
violence I did my ſelf, in forcing from my
boſom two perſons, whom of all I ever ſaw,
I loved moſt entirely, and then you will
find me not altogether unworthy of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
               <p>The Count was ſo confounded at
reading the Billet, as never was Man,
and had much ado to hide the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it put him in; he kneeled the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, as it were to give the <hi>Baſſa</hi>
thanks for this laſt favour, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his engagement in Love with the
<hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> had been the greateſt he
could have done him; but now after
his paſſion, it was certainly the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
misfortune could befal him. He
was willing by this action to hide from
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103330:59"/>
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> the trouble he was in. But
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> took him up, and told him,
he could not ſee him in that poſture,
for a buſineſs where he had more cauſe
to complain of him, than to thank
him, that he ſhould know at leiſure
the whole matter from <hi>Laura,</hi> and
that in the mean time he had nothing
to do but prepare for his voyage; that
he had given order to ſtay a Chriſtian
Veſſel, which ſhould have gone off
that very day for <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſhould land
them at <hi>Legorn;</hi> that the weather was
fair, and that without fail he ſhould
embark with <hi>Laura</hi> on the morrow:
for all which he gave him his word.</p>
               <p>The Count having taken leave of
the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> went out of the Chamber
with a heart ſo full of trouble and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
for the News he had received,
that he wanted a more proper place to
comfort himſelf, and to vent his
thoughts of the reſolution the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had
taken to give him his Liberty, and to
ſend <hi>Laura</hi> with him. He knew not
what might have obliged him to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of this nature, though upon
reading the Billet, he did imagine, the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> had committed ſome outrage on
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103330:59"/>
                  <hi>Laura;</hi> but this was not the thing
troubled him; it was the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> from
whom he muſt part, and muſt bid her
adieu for ever: to part with a Woman
one loved ſo tenderly, to part with
her for ever, and to part with her in
the height of his paſſion, ſounds very
harſh, and where is the Lover could
take ſuch a reſolution for any reaſon
what-ever? Yet Liberty, which to a
Man who knows what 'tis to be a
Slave, to a Man of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is a thing ſo attractive; to return
to his Countrey after eight or nine
months abſence; the pleaſure of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the conſideration that if he loſt
this opportunity, he might perhaps ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have ſuch another; all this, I ſay,
made ſuch a Party, that the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and moſt charming Lady in the
World, could not have hindred many
excellent perſons from quitting hers to
take it. But true Love which values
nothing above its own ſatisfaction,
ſlights a liberty to be bought with too
many tears: yet in this conjuncture,
it was almoſt impoſſible for <hi>Alexander</hi>
to refuſe this cruel liberty, being all he
could in appearance deſire, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103330:60"/>
on him by the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> with a
<hi>Miſtreſs</hi> with whom he believed him
paſſionately in love. What reaſon could
he find to refuſe ſuch a Preſent which
had coſt the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſo dear, and ought
to be the moſt acceptable to him? He
deſpaired to find any, and ſaw clearly
there was a neceſſity of parting, unleſs
Love, favourable to Lovers in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
would come to his aid, and
make the <hi>Baſſa</hi> alter his reſolution, as
they commonly do who take any
againſt Love; never did Slave pay
more Vows to be delivered from his
Chain, than he did for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his Captivity, chooſing rather
to be a Slave the reſt of his Life, than
to be for ever removed to ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from that which he loved a
thouſand times more than his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> having paſſed ſome hours
after in his Bed, to muſe upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
he had taken, which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to, though it made his heart
ake, called for his <hi>Aga,</hi> and gave him
orders for the departure of the two
Chriſtians, cauſing ſtore of Proviſions,
and very rich Preſents to be carried on
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103330:60"/>
board the Veſſel; this done he ſent his
chief <hi>Eunuch</hi> to the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> his Wife,
to intreat her to give <hi>Laura</hi> her Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whom he was minded to ſend home
to her Country, together with <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
for reaſons of importance to her,
as of neceſſity for him, and for the eaſe
and repoſe of one and the other.
Having given theſe orders, and the
ſame time ſent the Letter he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to <hi>Laura,</hi> he took Horſe for <hi>Bardou,</hi>
one of his Houſes of Pleaſure, a mile
from the Town, and ſtaid there till
midnight, having all that time walked
alone in the Gardens, to wean himſelf
from the ſight and company of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
and the pleaſure he took in <hi>Laura</hi>'s
diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>That night the <hi>Baſſa</hi> could not ſleep,
and in the Morning his <hi>Aga</hi> being
come to bring him an anſwer from
the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> as to his requeſt for
giving <hi>Laura</hi> her Liberty; he went
preſently to carry it to <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom
he found in appearance ready to be
gone, but in truth never leſs diſpoſed,
but hoping every moment ſome change
of reſolution in the <hi>Baſſa.</hi> Ah, <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
ſaid he, we muſt part, but I
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103330:61"/>
know not how we ſhall; for the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs</hi>
who loves <hi>Laura</hi> with the ſame
affection I do you, notwithſtanding
my repreſenting to her how much ſhe
was concerned in intereſt to have us
part, and to deſire it as much as I, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reſolve upon it, but hath ſent me
word this Morning ſhe will ſooner
looſe her Life than her <hi>Laura.</hi> You
muſt go ſee <hi>Laura,</hi> and tell her, 'twill
be her fault if ſhe be not free, and go
along with you; for as for me, what I
have promiſed I will perform. In the
mean time I will give order that the
Veſſel be ſtaid longer, that it may not
ſail without you. Sir, anſwered <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
there are frequent opportunities
of Tranſportation, and when you have
given ſome longer time to ſatisfie the
<hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> and diſpoſe her to grant
<hi>Laura</hi> this favour, our obligation then
will not be leſs for our Liberty you
are now pleaſed to grant us. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
replied the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> reſolutions like
that I have now taken in your favour,
go ſo much againſt the grain of a
heart affected as mine, that delays may
be dangerous, and time may make
them faulter: make uſe of the good
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103330:61"/>
motions reaſon and equity have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
into me. I do not tell you my
thoughts are unalterable. The ſpite I
have againſt my heart for its weakneſs,
the outrage I did <hi>Laura</hi> yeſterday; my
ſhame to appear before her after it, and
the ſmall hopes I have of gaining her
Love, are the true cauſes of your good
fortune: All this is yet freſh in my
mind; ſtay not till time deface theſe
impreſſions, there being nothing men
are apt ſo ſoon to forget, as the injuries
they had done to others.</p>
               <p>As they were diſcourſing together,
a huge Moor who ſerved as Purveyor
for the <hi>Count,</hi> and brought him every
Morning his Proviſion from the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi>
came on the ſudden into the
Chamber with a great Basket on his
head, not thinking (without doubt)
of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s being there. The Moor
ſtarted at the ſight of him, would have
gone back, but the <hi>Baſſa</hi> with his hand
made ſigns for him to ſtay; he obeyed,
and laid the Basket on the ground,
which appeared very heavy, and ſo he
withdrew; the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> of pure curioſity
to ſee what they had ſent <hi>Alexander</hi> to
eat, bid a Moor, who waited in the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103330:62"/>
Room, take up the Basket lid, which
he did, and found the Proviſion to be
a Woman very pleaſantly tucked up
and mufled in her <hi>Barnus</hi> that ſhe might
not be known. But being in the Habit
of a Chriſtian (which the <hi>Baſſa</hi> and
<hi>Alexander</hi> had formerly ſeen <hi>Laura</hi> in)
they made no doubt but it was ſhe.
The <hi>Baſſa</hi> at firſt was very much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
but then fell a laughing, and
ſaid to the <hi>Count,</hi> the Invention is rare,
and that ſhe had far more wit than the
Women of that Country; but this is
a product of Love the Father of Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
However, 'tis certain nothing
could have been done more proper for
our deſign: But ſhall not we ſee, ſaid
he, all your Proviſion? <hi>Madam,</hi> you
are here between the two beſt Friends
you have in the World, and you have
no reaſon to be ſhy of ſhewing your
ſelf; having ſaid this, he drew near to
the Lady, and would have taken her
by the arm to help her to riſe, but ſhe
refuſed and thruſt him back. I ſee
<hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he, you have not yet
granted me the pardon I begged of
you. I confeſs the offence was too
great to be ſo quickly forgiven; but
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103330:62"/>
you are taking your leave, and it is
not fit we ſhould part without being
friends; for it would be a perpetual
grief to me, to ſee you leave this
Country with hatred in your heart.
Deny not this favour (added he, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth his hand) to a man reduced
to deſpair for having offended you, and
puniſhing himſelf ſo ſeverely for the
fault, that there is no need of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
curelty from you. But all he
ſpoke was in vain, for ſhe hid her ſelf
more cloſely, and fortify'd her ſelf in
the Basket to prevent being ſeen. The
<hi>Baſſa</hi> was unwilling to preſs her any
further, but addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
told him, it was his part to make
peace, and to prevail with <hi>Laura</hi> to let
him ſee her once more being the laſt
time: The Count took it ill that ſhe
made ſo ſhy of ſhewing her ſelf to a
Perſon to whom ſhe was too much
obliged, to deny him his requeſt in
ſuch a conjuncture, what cauſe ſoever
ſhe might have had of quarrel againſt
him. Beſides, he was particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to preſs her to ſhew her ſelf;
for the laſt refuge he had, was his hope
that the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s cenderneſs for her, would
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103330:63"/>
perhaps at the moment of parting take
fire afreſh, and make him change his
reſolution; with theſe thoughts he
went to her, and gave her all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
he could invent to be reconciled
to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and let him ſee her a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but all to no purpoſe. He had
not one word of anſwer, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
him ſo, that having taken her
twice or thrice by the arm to make her
riſe, he was juſt going to force up her
<hi>Barnus,</hi> and threatned to do it; but
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> would not ſuffer it, bidding
him force her no further; that ſhe had
cauſe enough to complain, without
doing her new violence for love of
him. But, ſays he, let us make uſe of
the time, and ſince ſhe is brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to our hands, and you have no
more to do but embark, let us finiſh
what we have begun, and perform
what we have undertaken, there never
can be a fairer opportunity; and I
cannot think that <hi>Laura</hi> will be ſorry
to leave ſuch a Country as this, or part
with us to go along with you. The <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs</hi>
in all probability is yet aſleep,
let us not ſtay till ſhe awake. We muſt
preſently carry <hi>Laura</hi> (as ſhe is in the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103330:63"/>
Basket) into the Ship: you ſhall bear
her company, and as ſoon as you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive,
you ſhall hoiſe ſail and away; as
for me, I will paſs the reſt of the day
at <hi>Bardou,</hi> and give out ſuch orders as
may be neceſſary, that in caſe the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs</hi>
miſs <hi>Laura,</hi> and find ſhe is
eſcaped, you may not be ſtaid. Having
ſaid this, he ſent a Moor to the Port,
with order to have a Shallop in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to carry <hi>Laura</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi>
aboard the Chriſtian Veſſel riding at
<hi>Gouletta.</hi> This done, he ſent for the
Captain of his Guards, and bid him
accompany the Count, and commend
the care of that Basket to the Moors
who were to carry it along. Having
given theſe orders, he had no more to
do, but bid his dear <hi>Alexander</hi> adieu;
and having embraced him with tears in
his eyes, he bore him company to the
Shallop, and from thence went to
<hi>Bardou</hi> with a heart full of grief. The
poor Count was more to be pittied:
He was not much concerned to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
how ſorry he was to part with
the <hi>Baſſa;</hi> but as for the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi>
whom he could have wiſhed to have
ſeen once more at leaſt, his trouble to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103330:64"/>
leave her was ſo great, that he felt not
the grief he ſhould have ſhewed when
he bid the <hi>Baſſa</hi> adieu, who had ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obliged him. When he ſaw he muſt
part, and no hopes of ſeeing her, his
heart was ſo full he could not ſpeak a
word; the tears ran down his cheeks,
which much moved the good <hi>Baſſa,</hi>
who thought they were ſhed for him,
and was not diſpleaſed to ſee himſelf
outdone by a Man who was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful,
and cordially loved him: At
laſt he ſaw him embarked, and bid him
the laſt adieu. The afflicted Count was
ſo oppreſs'd with grief, that from the
Haven to <hi>Gouletta,</hi> having given his
heart a little more liberty than he durſt
have done in preſence of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> he let
fall ſuch lamentable expreſſions, looking
towards the Town, that the Captain of
the Guard, and the reſt that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
him, were extreamly aſtoniſhed,
and moved to compaſſion. By good luck
they underſtood not <hi>Italian,</hi> but his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
his tears, his looks, and the colour
of his countenance expreſſed an unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd
trouble and affliction.</p>
               <p>He no ſooner got aboard the Ship,
but he threw himſelf on a Bed, and was
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103330:64"/>
ſo much beſide himſelf, that he did not
as much as think of his Basket; but the
Captain of the Guard had eaſed him of
that care, and cauſed it to be carried
into his Cabbin; after which he took
leave of him, and having commanded
the Captain of the Veſſel to hoiſe up
his Sails, he went into the Shallop and
returned to <hi>Tunis;</hi> then was it that
<hi>Alexander</hi> finding himſelf alone in his
Cabbin, abandoned himſelf to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his grief. Ah Fate, ſaid he, unjuſt
Fate, what have I done that you uſe me
ſo cruelly, that you force me away
from a Perſon without whom I cannot
live. Ah my <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> dear <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi>
muſt I leave you, muſt I abſent my ſelf
from you for ever? For ever, ſaid he
again riſing up: Ah Heavens! let me
rather be ſet aſhore, I ſhall find pretence
enough with the <hi>Baſſa;</hi> let me rather
truſt Love than Fortune, ſhe hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
me: Whatever happen I muſt
die, and I had rather die at her feet
whom I love, than at this cruel diſtance
Having ſaid this, he went to ſee if they
were ſtill at Anchor, but found they
were already a great way from Land,
and ſailing with a favourable wind, had
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103330:65"/>
almoſt loſt ſight of <hi>Gouletta.</hi> What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
was he in? Ah my heart, ſaid he,
there is no remedy, now I muſt periſh.
Dear <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> added he, taking his
Sword in his hand, ſee whether I am
guilty of this abſence, and receive the
Sacrifice I make you of my Life; with
that he drew his Sword, and was going
to thruſt himſelf through, when on a
ſudden the Perſon in the Basket, who
had thus far hearkened to all he had
ſaid, threw her ſelf upon him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
further miſchief. Let me alone
to finiſh a Life which cannot but be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
at this diſtance from all that I
love. Ah dear <hi>Alexander,</hi> anſwered the
Lady, embracing him with all tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
her joy not permitting her to ſay
any more. The Count finding imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
(notwithſtanding the trouble
and tranſport he was in) ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between this voice and <hi>Laura</hi>'s,
looked behind him on the Lady who
held him in her arms: But what an
aſtoniſhment, what a charming ſurprize
was it for a heart like his, and in the
condition he was in, to ſee that it was
the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> her ſelf?</p>

The Happy Lover extreamly ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at ſo ſurprizing an Adventure,
found in himſelf ſo ſudden an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the curioſity of knowing by what

               <p>The Captain of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Guards
being arrived at <hi>Tunis,</hi> took Horſe,
and ſoon got to <hi>Bardou,</hi> where he
found his Maſter walking alone in the
Garden, and gave him an account of
the departure of <hi>Alexander.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa,</hi>
like a man dejected and diſconſolate,
having lift up his Eyes and Hands to
Heaven, without ſaying a word, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103330:66"/>
into a Marble Bower in the
midſt of the Garden, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
all that day, having given his
Guards expreſs Orders not to permit
any Perſon whatever to come near
him; hoping thus to free himſelf from
the importunity he fear'd from the
<hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> on <hi>Laura's</hi> account. His
Servants and Guards were much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
at theſe Orders, not knowing
what might be the cauſe of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
unleſs it were that <hi>Alexander</hi>

               <p>In the Evening arrived at <hi>Bardou</hi> a
Spahie, who brought him a Letter,
and was followed by another, and he
by a third, who all came to ſpeak with
him on buſineſs of extream haſte and
importance; but being acquainted
with the Orders he had given, they
durſt paſs no further, but reſolved to
wait his coming out of the Bower.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> obſerve exactly the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of their Maſters; but <hi>Aly</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Guard, gathering from the
number of Couriers the importance
of their buſineſs, thought it his Duty
to ſtep to the Town, being but three
Miles diſtant, to learn what the matter
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103330:67"/>
was, and getting preſently on Horſe-back,
went directly to the General of
the Gallies, being one of them who
had diſpatched the <hi>Spahies.</hi> The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
ſent him inſtantly back, with
ſtrict Order to ſpeak with the <hi>Baſſa,</hi>
and tell him, that to oppoſe the deſigns
his Enemies had againſt his Life, his
preſence was abſolutely neceſſary at
<hi>Tunis; Aly,</hi> who apprehended the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of the affair, made no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(when returned to <hi>Bardou)</hi> to
preſent himſelf before his Maſter;
who extreamly enraged to ſee his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
broke firſt by him, would neither
hear him, nor receive the Letter he
would have delivered him from the
General of the Gallies. But locking
himſelf up, paſt his time till the fourth
Prayer, when he took Horſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Town. By the way he
received Letters from ſeveral, but
thinking they came from the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi>
or ſome of her party, he opened not
one of them.</p>
               <p>The General of the Gallies aſtoniſh'd
not to ſee him come, after News ſent
him what was Plotting againſt him,
reſolved to go in Perſon to ſee what
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103330:67"/>
ſtay'd him at <hi>Bardou,</hi> and by the way
met him. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſeeing him come
with a very large Train, asked him
ſmiling, if he thought he had been
Beſieged, that he came to meet him
with ſo numerous a Party. You are
pleaſant, Sir, anſwered the General;
but I wiſh we ſtand not in need of far
greater Forces before we come to <hi>Tunis.</hi>
The <hi>Baſſa</hi> obſerving him to ſpeak in
good earneſt, fixt his Eye upon him a
while without ſpeaking a word, then
askt him, what need there could be
of the Forces he mentioned; and
(with Indignation) what, ſays, he,
will they Aſſault me for love of the
<hi>Sultaneſs?</hi> Do not you think, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the General, there is reaſon
enough for't? Can you believe that a
Prince like the <hi>Dey,</hi> your Mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
(but from the Teeth outwards)
can brook the injury you have done
him, who loves the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
better than his Life? What injury,
ſaid the <hi>Baſſa?</hi> What injury, reply'd
the General? An injury, than which,
in my Opinion, a greater could not
have been offered. What, anſwers
the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> interrupting him, will they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103330:68"/>
diſpute my Power to ſet two of my
Slaves at liberty at my pleaſure? No,
Sir, ſaid the General, no queſtion is
made of your Right or Power in the
particular you mention; but the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs</hi>
was not your Slave, and unleſs
you deſign'd to engage in a new Civil
War, not only the Rules of Honour,
Juſtice, and Religion, but the Maxims
of good Polity, ſhould have prevail'd
with you, not to deliver her into the
hands of a Chriſtian, than which a
greater misfortune cannot befall a
Woman of our Religion. The <hi>Baſſa</hi>
thought this Diſcourſe ſo extravagant,
that he burſt out a laughing, and gave
him no other anſwer, but that he had
taken the Alarm too ſoon. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
being moved, reply'd with ſome
heat, you know me too well to
think me concern'd at that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
me with; but when you come
to <hi>Tunis,</hi> you ſhall judge if I had not
cauſe to take the Alarm. If the <hi>Dey,</hi>
anſwer'd the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> deſign a breach
with me, he will find a better pretence
than you ſpeak of. True it is, I have
ſent away <hi>Laura</hi> with <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Chriſtian, without the conſent of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103330:68"/>
                  <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> but there were reaſons for
it, and ſuch as the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
living had moſt cauſe to approve.
The General of the Gallies did verily
believe the <hi>Baſſa</hi> was ſeriouſly bent
upon raillery, and willing to keep that
as a ſecret which all the World knew;
which he took in ill part, and had not
ſpoke a word more on that ſubject,
had not the <hi>Baſſa</hi> continued the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
But, Sir, ſaid the General,
interrupting him, what pleaſure can
you take in endeavouring to conceal
from me (one of your beſt Servants
and Friends) a buſineſs ſo notorious
to all? Every body knows <hi>Laura</hi> is in
your <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and that the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> is
embarqued with <hi>Alexander.</hi> Not to
mince the matter, I muſt tell you, the
general voice is, that for Love of this
Slave, you have rid your hands of the
<hi>Sultaneſs</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> and that you
deſign to Marry <hi>Laura,</hi> though a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.
But give me leave to tell you,
that beſides the novelty of the thing
(the like having never happened in
this Kingdom) not only the <hi>Dey</hi> and
<hi>Divan</hi> will oppoſe it, but your Friends,
will to their power obſtruct it, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103330:69"/>
prevent it if they can; and I dare
undertake, you will ſcarce find a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of your ſide.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> hearing him ſpeak in this
manner, thought him diſtracted, and
would have uſed him accordingly, but
reſtrained by the Friendſhip he had
for him; <hi>Laura,</hi> ſays he, whom I ſaw
carried in a Basket, whom I accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
to the Port (where they put
her aboard a Shallop) whom the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of my Guard conducted to the
Veſſel in which ſhe was Embarked,
and he ſaw under ſail, this <hi>Laura</hi> is
in my <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and I am to Marry
her. Sir, anſwered the General, did
I not know you very well, and were
fully perſwaded of the good eſteem
you are pleaſed to Honour me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
I ſhould not know what to think
of your Diſcourſe; for it cannot be
but you know the whole Affair better
than any Man. But to end the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
let us go to your Palace, where
you ſhall ſee whether it be <hi>Laura</hi> or
the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> that is there.</p>
               <p>It was not long ere they arrived at
the Palace. The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who took all
that the General had ſaid to be fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103330:69"/>
and vain, would not ſo much as
have ſent to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> to know how
things ſtood, thinking it foolery to
doubt of the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> being there.
However in complaiſance, and by
way of raillery, he ordered <hi>Aly</hi> to
wait on the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> and to Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
her for him, upon the diſpleaſure
ſhe took for the departure of <hi>Laura.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Captain of the Guard not fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying
his Maſter ignorant of what
was paſt, took his Order for a meer
matter of Addreſs, and a colour only
to hide the truth of what he would
have conceal'd; and approve himſelf
able to manage the intrigue, as one
who could penetrate into the deſires
of the Perſon who employ'd him, he
went to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
learnt what he formerly knew,
that 'twas <hi>Laura</hi> was there; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> made him a civil
anſwer as from the <hi>Sultaneſs.</hi> This
put the General into very great diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and gave the <hi>Baſſa</hi> new occaſion
to laugh, telling him, he did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the deſign of the <hi>Dey,</hi> in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
thoſe Reports to procure him the
ill will of his Friends, and hatred of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103330:70"/>
People, and renew their former broyls
with greater violence than ever; but
that he ſhould find the means to bring
him to Reaſon, and that in the firſt
place, he would expoſe the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> to
view of all the People, and then ſend
her home to the <hi>Dey,</hi>—to let him ſee
how unwilling he was to have any
Alliance with a man who made it his
buſineſs to find occaſions to ruin
him.</p>
               <p>As they were Diſcourſing, they
heard a great noiſe on the ſudden in
the Palace, followed by Vollies of
Muſquet-ſhot, and People crying, to
Arms, to Arms. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
out of his Chamber to ſee what
the matter was, and met <hi>Aly</hi> coming
to tell him, that the Palace was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
on all ſides, and that an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
had been made to enter it by
force, but that he had beat them back
with ten or twelve Souldiers of the
Guard, who by good Fortune hapned
to be with him. The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> of all
men the leaſt ſubject to fear, and of
a ready Wit, and admirable Judgment
in the moſt ſurprizing occaſions, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf deſtitute then of Forces
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103330:70"/>
to make any reſiſtance, and hearing
them threaten to ſet fire on the Palace
if the Gate were not opened, order'd
they ſhould cry out at the Windows
that the Gate ſhould be open'd, that
thoſe who had begirt the Palace round,
and were, for the moſt part, drawn
thither with hopes of Plunder, might
run all to the Gate, and give him op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to make his eſcape another
way.</p>
               <p>This Stratagem took according to
his deſire, and he made his eſcape by
a private way form his Enemies, who
had ſhewed him no Mercy had he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into their hands. But he, with
the General of the Gallies, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Guard, got ſafe to the
Mountains, Inhabited by the <hi>Moors,</hi>
who had great love for him. He no
ſooner gave them notice of the need
he had of their help, but they came
to him that Night, ſo that by break
of day he found himſelf at the Head
of 8000 Men, Armed ſome with Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets,
ſome with Pikes, both equally
uſeful to them.</p>
               <p>Poor <hi>Laura</hi> was alone, abandoned
to the Mercy of this Popular Torrent,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103330:71"/>
who having pillaged in a moment that
Rich and Sumptuous Palace, without
reſpect to the place or the Sex, entred
the <hi>Seraglio</hi> by Order from the <hi>Dey,</hi>
and took out thence the unfortunate
Slave, leaving the reſt expoſed to the
will of the Rabble. It was <hi>Laura's</hi>
good Fortune, that he who had the
Commiſſion to take her, was a Perſon
of great honeſty and worth, a private
Friend of the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and one who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
as much reſpect for her as ſhe
could wiſh in ſuch a Conjuncture.
She was carried to the Caſtle, where
ſhe was committed to the ſame Officers
Cuſtody, being a Secretary, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
eſteemed by all the <hi>Divan.</hi>
And being the only Perſon could ſpeak
to her without danger of being heard,
he confidently told her the firſt time
he ſaw her, that the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
till then appeared admirable, had
committed a fact no leſs difficult to
be repaired, than generally condemn'd
by the beſt of his Friends, but that
he feared the greateſt ſmart would be
hers. The poor Slave ſufficiently A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd
by ſeeing her ſelf forced out of
the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and made the <hi>Dey</hi>'s
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103330:71"/>
Priſoner, was frightned much more
by the Diſcourſe of this <hi>Turk,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to her a very credible Perſon;
ſhe prayed him for Heavens ſake to
tell her what the matter was, what
fault the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had committed, and
how ſhe was concern'd in it, that ſhe
muſt be thus handled? If you are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the paſſages this day, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the Secretary, I will let you
know them.</p>
               <p>I believe, continues he, that you
know <hi>Chabania,</hi> or at leaſt have heard
talk of her, all the World is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of the Malignity of her Nature,
and illneſs of Diſpoſition: But to the
buſineſs in hand; that which ſhe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
is grounded on Proofs ſo preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and Reaſons ſo clear, that her
Malice hath compaſſed the effect ſhe
deſired. Whether ſhe was jealous of
you, or in diſguſt with the <hi>Baſſa</hi> I
know not, but ſhe is the cauſe of the
diſorder you have ſeen; which, if not
remedied, may prove the ruin of
the Kingdom: The <hi>Dey</hi> was at <hi>Cheſs</hi>
when word was brought him, that a
Lady from the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s <hi>Seraglio</hi> deſired
to ſpeak with him on buſineſs of great
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103330:72"/>
importance. Inſtantly he quitted his
Game, and retiring into a Chamber
to give the Woman Audience, he ſees
<hi>Chabania</hi> enter, attended with her
<hi>Eunuchs</hi> who Uſher'd her, who falling
before him on her knees, ſpake to this
purpoſe. <hi>Sir, I bring you News, which
doubtleſs will trouble you. But if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
Death for not being able to endure
an injury done to your Royal Blood, and
the whole Nation, without giving you
Advertiſement, I am content to ſuffer for
it, having the ſatisfaction to ſee you Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the wrong has been done you, which
is, that your Daughter is gone, that ſhe
is delivered over into the hands of that
Chriſtian who ſailed away this Morning,
and that a pitiful Slave is to ſucceed in
her place, to the infinite diſhonour of your
Highneſs and the Nation. Take your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of the Author of this diſorder, and
execute that Juſtice which you ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſo cruel an attempt, acted to the
diſhonour of God, the injury of your Blood,
and diſhonour of your Country.</hi> Scarce
had ſhe made an end, but the <hi>Dey</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
with Anger, and extreamly
enraged, called in thoſe who had
waited in the Anti-chamber, and ſcarce
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103330:72"/>
able to ſpeak for the Paſſion he was
in, made <hi>Chabania</hi> repeat before them
all that ſhe had ſaid to him. It un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
fell out that all who were
there, were Enemies to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and
inſtead of appeaſing the <hi>Dey,</hi> took the
preſent occaſion to animate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
him to get ſatisfaction for ſo
cruel an outrage. Women and <hi>Eunuchs</hi>
were ſent from the <hi>Dey</hi> to the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> on purpoſe to know the truth
and particulars of this Affair, who
made their report, that the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi>
was not there, that no body knew
what was become of her, and that
you only were able to give us any
news of her. A Meſſenger was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
diſpatched to <hi>Gouletta,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
at the Caſtle, if there were not
a Woman in the Chriſtian Veſſel that
ſail'd away this Morning; the anſwer
he gave was, that the Veſſel was ſail'd
away without being ſearch'd, and that
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had ſent order to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
by the Captain of his Guards,
who accompanied the Chriſtian a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
the Ship. Theſe Circumſtances
ſo clear and apparent, did but too
much confirm what <hi>Chabania</hi> had ſaid.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103330:73"/>
Hereupon divers Councils were held;
and the Aſſembly conſiſting of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ill-affected to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> or at leaſt
too Zealous for the <hi>Dey,</hi> the Reſult
was, that Revenge ſhould be taken.
I cannot conceive how it was poſſible
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had no news what paſt, the
report having been preſently noiſed
over the Town. It was deſigned he
ſhould be ſurprized at <hi>Bardou,</hi> where
it was believed he would have lain <hi>this
Night.</hi> But News being brought, that
he was on his way hither, the <hi>Dey</hi>'s
<hi>Aga</hi> had Order, if deny'd entrance,
to ſet upon the Palace, and ſeize
his Perſon living or dead. And I
at the ſame time was to go to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi>
and to carry you away. They
miſs'd of him, and it was well for you
he eſcaped; for had he been taken,
both he and you had been by this
time dead. But having ſo luckily
made his eſcape, and being Maſter of
the Militia and <hi>Moors</hi> of the Kingdom,
he may become formidable to the
<hi>Dey,</hi> and be in a capacity to deliver
you from danger.</p>
               <p>The unfortunate <hi>Laura,</hi> too much
acquainted with the unkindneſs of her
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103330:73"/>
Stars, did nothing but ſigh and groan
at the apprehenſions of the new ſtorms
that threatned her. She knew better
than any, the little reaſon they had to
charge the <hi>Baſſa</hi> with the flight of the
<hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> and being of Opinion, that
by juſtifying the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> her cauſe would
appear better before the <hi>Dey;</hi> ſhe told
this <hi>Turk,</hi> that her Patron was not,
perhaps, ſo guilty as they thought. I
know not, continued ſhe, what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> ſince ſhe left
the <hi>Seraglio</hi> this Morning; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
you have expreſt in me, in the
freedom of your ſpeech to me, and
your generous carriage obliging me
not to be ſo reſerv'd to you, as I would
to another; and ſeeing the extremity
matters are reduced to, I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you, that if the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſent away
the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> with the Chriſtian, as is
reported, ſhe was very willing to go.
And becauſe it is probable you will
hardly believe me, without telling you
more, I ſhall be forced to relate part
of a ſtory which may ſerve at leaſt
to excuſe, if not juſtifie the <hi>Baſſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You know, Sir, ſaid ſhe, that the
<hi>Sultaneſs</hi> loved <hi>Alexander;</hi> and that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103330:74"/>
ſhe loved him entirely, the occaſion
was this: The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> whom every one
knows to have had a mighty affection
for that Chriſtian, had a longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
(whether for Divertiſement, or
to faſten him more cloſely to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon)
to ſee him Love with ſome La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and was of Opinion, I might be
fit for the purpoſe, if he could but
contrive how to bring us together.
But becauſe I ſtirred not out of the
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> and that it would have been
a very ſcandalous thing, to ſee a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
enter a Palace, where none of
your Religion but <hi>Eunuchs</hi> have acceſs;
he put the ſtranger into the habit of
an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and having prevailed with
me to accept of a Viſit from him,
brought him to me one Evening. The
<hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> already full of good thoughts
for the Chriſtian, whom the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had
a thouſand times ſpoke to her of, was
extreamly glad to hear of the deſign,
to bring him to her very Apartment,
and with very great earneſtneſs pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, if poſſible, to procure her the
pleaſure of ſeeing him. This proved
no hard task for me to perform: The
<hi>Baſſa,</hi> who ſeldom came to viſit the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103330:74"/>
                  <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> ſending him almoſt every
day diſguiſed like an <hi>Eunuch</hi> into the
<hi>Seraglio;</hi> ſo that I had no more to do
but provide for the Secrecy of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview
between my Miſtreſs and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi>
They had a ſight of each other;
and if <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſo handſom, as
to pleaſe the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that ſo Beautiful a Lady could
not diſpleaſe him. Their Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
day by day to that height,
that they ſaw one another very often.
The <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſeeing his Chriſtian in Love,
and thinking me the object of it, took
ſingular pleaſure in it. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> had
formerly had ſome kindneſs for me,
which cool'd by my reſiſtance; but
having one day for Divertiſement
cauſed <hi>Alexander</hi> to give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the progreſs of his Amour,
the fire of his Love ſo long raked up
and ſmothered, kindled afreſh into a
flame; and gathering from the ſucceſs
of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Addreſs, that I was not
inſenſible, as I pretended to him; he
renewed his Courtſhip, intermingled
now and then with Reproaches for
the little eſteem I had for him in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the affection of a Slave before
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103330:75"/>
his: I fore-ſaw the danger, but was
unwilling to make him ſenſible of his
miſtake, to ſave the two Lovers from
the inconveniences which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
attend the diſcovery. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
my ſelf a Sacrifice to the pleaſure
of the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> I let him believe I
was not inſenſible of the Merit of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi>
The affair thus managed, there
followed many pleaſant Adventures
and Intrigues, which for fear of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
you too much at preſent, I ſhall
defer the relation of it to a better Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.
The mean time, the <hi>Baſſa</hi>
extreamly preſſed me, and reproached
me daily for ſlighting his Paſſion, and
at the ſame time favouring a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
far leſs worthy of my affection. He
left no ſtone unturned to compaſs his
Amorous deſigns, inſomuch as at laſt
he found the means to have a private
and dumb interview in the dark with
his Wife, whom he miſtook for me,
and did her all the violence imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be revenged of the inſenſibility
I had for him. Having ſatisfied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he parted with her without
knowing her, bleſſing himſelf for the
good Fortune of having obtained that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103330:75"/>
which he might have commanded
every day. But grieved at laſt for
the outrage he thought he had done
me, and not knowing how to excuſe
himſelf to a Miſtreſs extreamly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
he judg'd no better amends
could be made for his fault, than ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at Liberty two Lovers, whoſe
Paſſion he had ſo unjuſtly injured, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having been not only the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but firſt Author of their Love.
He ſent me the News of his Reſolution
by a Billet he writ to me, wherein he
pleaded in excuſe the great Paſſion he
had for me; that to expiate his fault,
he would deprive himſelf for ever of
the ſight of me, and ſend me back with
my Love to my Country, being all
could be deſired from a generous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val:
And that if I were ſenſible of
the pain and regret my abſence would
coſt him, I ſhould find him puniſhed
beyond his deſert. My joy was not
greater than the trouble of the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi>
upon receiving this News, which put
her into an unſpeakable affliction. Her
Nights and her Days were wholly
ſpent in Tears; ſhe uſed all means
poſſible to prevent the misfortune ſhe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103330:76"/>
apprehended from <hi>Alexander</hi>'s return
into <hi>Italy.</hi> I gave her way, chooſing
rather to renounce my Liberty than
ſee her die for grief in the condition
ſhe was in. But the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> the firmeſt
of men in what he reſolves on, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the reaſon ſhe had to oppoſe
a deſign ſhe had more reaſon than he
to promote, conſidering the Paſſion
ſhe knew he had for me, which muſt
needs trouble her, was true to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution;
and knowing there was in
the Port a Chriſtian Veſſel ready to
Sail for <hi>Italy,</hi> he cauſed it to be ſtaid
for our Embarking therein. What a
trouble was it to the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> to ſee
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſo obſtinate, and us on the
point of departing! Never was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſo plunged in a Sea of deſpair,
never were ſighs ſo lamentable as hers;
I was resolved to entreat the <hi>Baſſa</hi> to
put off our departure to another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
that I might gain time to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
her to grant me the favour; but
whether it were for the ſhame to ſee
me, or for fear that the ſight of me
might melt him into a tenderneſs that
might alter the Reſolution he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
he appear'd not at the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> The
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103330:76"/>
Morning we were to be gone, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate
<hi>Sultaneſs</hi> reſolved to die, or to
follow us; ſhe had long ſtudied to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
a way how to do it: I was her
Bed-fellow, but neither of us ſlept a
wink. <hi>Laura,</hi> ſays ſhe, having conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
well what ſhe would do, thou
knoweſt the affection I ever had for
thee, that I have uſed thee more like
a Siſter than a Slave. Thou knoweſt
my heart, and I need not tell thee I
cannot live without <hi>Alexander.</hi> I deſire
no acknowledgment of what I have
done for thee, (added ſhe, kiſſing me
with her face all bath'd in tears) but
for pity ſake, forſake me not in the
moſt deſperate condition that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in Love as I am, can be reduced
to, but do ſomething to ſave my Life:
had ſhe deſired mine with ſuch melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
expreſſions, I could not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
it her, which ſhe might perceive
by the tears I ſhed to accompany hers.
Then ſhe told me of an intention ſhe
had thought of, whereby get aboard
with us, and that ſhe doubted not of
the ſucceſs, if <hi>Alexander</hi> had the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
he pretended to have for her; and
if he had not, ſhe would comfort her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103330:77"/>
and find pleaſure in Rage for the
abſence of ſo ingrate a Perſon; that
without the knowledge of any one in
the <hi>Seraglio</hi> ſhe would be carried to his
Lodging, and thence aboard the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
we were to Embark in; and that
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſending for me to be gone,
we might all three get aboard before
any Diſcovery could be made of her
departure. To give her content, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of what ſhe ſaid, but did really
apprehend the ſuceſs of this affair,
and preſage, I know not how, that I
ſhould be the ſufferer. 'Tis a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
buſineſs to yield ones ſelf up to
the conduct of Lovers, in that which
concerns the intereſt of their affections;
they are apt to flatter themſelves, to
puff themſelves up with hope, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of no fear. When the day began
to appear in our Chamber, we thought
it high time to ſet about and take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for what we thought neceſſary for
accompliſhing our deſires. We got up,
and the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> having put on a Suit
of mine, commanded me to call her
one of the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> who was Purveyor
for <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ready to Sacrifice
his Life for the Service of the <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:103330:77"/>
ſhe ſent him for the basket wherein he
uſed to carry the Proviſion, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
her ſelf in it, wrapt up in my
<hi>Barnus,</hi> commanded him to carry her
to <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Lodging. I ſaw her go
away in this manner, waiting with
fear and impatience enough to hear
the ſucceſs of this contrivance of the
<hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> and expecting every moment
Orders from the <hi>Baſſa</hi> for my going
away. At laſt, the time of Embarking
being over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
I was deſirous to be informed
how matters paſt, and underſtood with
aſtoniſhment and diſpleaſure enough,
that <hi>Alexander</hi> was gone, and that the
<hi>Baſſa,</hi> having brought him to the Port,
returned for <hi>Bardon.</hi> Then it was, Sir,
I felt the ſtroke of my ill Fortune, in
loſing, not only the hope of returning
to my Country, which might have
given me ſome comfort, but of ever
ſeeing the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> the Perſon of the
World I had moſt kindneſs for, and
one who rendred my Captivity plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.
I could not doubt but her flight
would be laid to my charge; but the
conſideration of a Life ſo unhappy
as mine, had produced in me ſo clear
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103330:78"/>
reſolutions for death, that, had you
taken notice at your arrival, you could
not obſerve any trouble in my counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
And in good earneſt the loſs
of my dear <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> afflicted me ſo,
that the appearance of death could not
have done more. They asked me of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
what was become of her? the
anſwer I made, was, that I knew not:
But having been long taken for her
Confident, I was ſhrewdly ſuſpected.
As for the reſt of her Servants, you
might have read in their countenances,
the trouble of their minds.</p>
               <p>This is that, Sir, I had to ſay to you
of the <hi>Sultaneſs;</hi> and if you think this
Story may be of uſe to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and
conduce to the procuring peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and the <hi>Dey,</hi> I ſhould be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
glad you would relate it to him,
though I may appear guilty of having
committed a crime againſt the one and
the other. But they have prudence
enough to be ſenſible of the condition
of a poor Slave, whoſe happineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in her complaisance to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
who loved her ſo well as to
make her confident in affairs of this
conſequence. The Turk made anſwer,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103330:78"/>
that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had ſo much kindneſs for
her, and ſo little for the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> that
he would eaſily pardon the Treaſon
ſhe was guilty of; and as for the <hi>Dey,</hi>
he could not be much offended with
her, for having done his Daughter ſo
eminent a ſervice, in aſſiſting her in a
piece of unfaithfulneſs to a Husband
who (the <hi>Dey</hi> knows) had not any
Love for her: and that he would make
uſe of the particulars of this Story to
reconcile them; that he would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
this buſineſs with ſome Friends of
the <hi>Divan,</hi> and particularly with the
<hi>Aga,</hi> the <hi>Deys</hi> favourite, who had
great influence over him, and though
a Renegade, loved the Chriſtians very
well, and might do her ſome ſervice.
To theſe expreſſions he added a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
aſſurances on his part, and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
enough to oblige her extreamly.
This done, he withdrew, to avoid the
ſuſpicion her Guard might have of a
longer diſcourſe, it being already very
late, but promiſed to ſee her again on
the morrow, and bring her News of
all that paſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> being now at the Head of
ſo many <hi>Moors,</hi> thought himſelf ſtrong
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103330:79"/>
enough to take the Field, and as ſoon
as it was day, marched down towards
the Town, to favour the retreat of his
Friends, and of the Souldiers who
came flocking in to him; ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
noon he had an Army of <hi>Moors</hi>
and <hi>Turks</hi> above ten thouſand ſtrong.
The <hi>Dey</hi> uſed all diligence poſſible to
arm his people, but found himſelf not
ſtrong enough that day to encounter
the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> whoſe Arms were already
grown terrible to his Enemies, who
from his juſt indignation againſt them
apprehended a Siege. But his quarrel
being chiefly to the <hi>Dey,</hi> and wanting
Cannon to attack him in the Caſtle
he was in, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> was forced to wait
the arrival of the Artillery he had ſent
for to the Port whereof he was Maſter.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, having aſſembled
the principal of his Friends, to make
his complaint to them of the unjuſt
proceedings of the <hi>Dey,</hi> and to demand
their advice, he was not a little ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to hear them all maintain the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the Galleys; that it was his
Wife was gone away with the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and that <hi>Laura</hi> ſtaid in the <hi>Seraglio;</hi>
and that the <hi>Dey</hi> had reaſon enough
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103330:79"/>
for what he had done, in the belief he
was in of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s intentions to make
away his Daughter. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> who
ſtill fancied that they were abuſed,
would not vouchſafe to contradict
them, but calling in the Captain of
his Guards, asked him before them, if
he had not the day before ſpoken with
the <hi>Sultaneſs.</hi> Poor <hi>Aly</hi> ſhivering for
fear, fell down at his feet with his face
to the ground, and confeſſed he had
thought the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had ſent him to the
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> on purpoſe to blind the world,
and that it was deſired he ſhould juſtifie
before the General of the Galleys, he
had ſeen the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> there, but that in
truth ſhe was not there, and that he
found only <hi>Laura</hi> weeping for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of her Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> for all this would not be
perſwaded, but ſaid, he muſt ſee the
Slave before he could believe it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
many Reaſons to the contrary,
when he received a Billet from the <hi>Deys</hi>
Secretary to this purpoſe.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> having read this Letter,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103330:80"/>
could no longer doubt of the truth of
the thing, knowing <hi>Aſſen</hi> to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

laught at the adventure, and could not

He was not much troubled at the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake

thought that in matters of Love, a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs

He never ſuſpected any treachery in

               <p>By that time he had written this
Billet, the night was far gone; yet
for more ſurety he would not let the
<hi>Moor</hi> go till three or four a clock in the
Morning. The Walls of <hi>Tunis</hi> are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
low, and in ſome places eaſie to get
over. True it is, they were then very
well guarded; but the bearer of the Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let

Secretary, there was no danger of his
being ſtaid; and accordingly he found
his paſſage free as he could wiſh.</p>
               <p>The generous <hi>Aſſen</hi> had been that
Evening to viſit his fair Priſoner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to promiſe, and given her an
account how matters ſtood, with ſome
hopes of accommodation between par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
at difference; for that it was clear
by the confeſſion of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> who
had carried the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> in the Basket,
that if the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had a hand in ſending
away the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> ſhe had contributed
not a little to her enlargement, out of
a criminal paſſion ſhe had for <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
by going to ſee him at his Lodging.
<hi>Laura</hi> well pleaſed with this News,
could not ſufficiently thank <hi>Aſſen</hi> for
the obliging care he had of her. He
had ſent ſo many ſeveral ſorts of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
refreſhments, that ſhe found her
ſelf better uſed in the Priſon, than in
the <hi>Baſſa's Seraglio;</hi> ſhe knew not what
to attribute ſo much goodneſs and
complaiſance to, and was a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
out of an apprehenſion ſhe had
there might be ſome love in the caſe;
for the <hi>Turk</hi> appeared ſo civil, ſo pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
and ſo full of kindneſs, above the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103330:82"/>
ordinary rate of thoſe of his Country,
that ſhe had cauſe to think him rather
a Lover of her, than a meer Friend of
the <hi>Baſſa's;</hi> yet had he not in a ſyllable
tranſgreſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the reſpect that was due
to her, which pleaſed her the more,
that ſhe had no cauſe on that account
to be angry with a Man who had done
her ſo many good Offices. And the
truth is, he acted only out of a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of generoſity, having been five or
ſix years a Slave in <hi>Italy</hi> to a Patron
who had uſed him very well; and
therefore being of a generous nature,
he held himſelf obliged to do the
Chriſtians good offices, as having for
them a more than ordinary Love and
Eſteem.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Laura</hi> was complaining of her
ill Fortune, which threw her out of
one miſchance into another, he pray'd
her to tell him how ſhe was made a
Slave <hi>Laura</hi> was ſo much obliged to
him, that the trouble ſhe might expect
in her ſelf, upon a freſh relation of her
misfortunes, could not hinder her from
giving him that ſmall ſatisfaction, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of the many ſervices
he had done her; ſo that having aſſured
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103330:82"/>
him there was nothing pleaſant in the
ſtory of her life, yet to let him know
the firſt riſe of her misfortunes, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
in this manner.</p>
               <p>Sir, I was born at <hi>Genoa,</hi> and of one of
the beſt Families of that Republick, but you
ſhall excuſe me, if I conceal the name: I will
ſave my Family that ſhame, ſince my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
can do it no credit. I was born in a
proſperous and flouriſhing Eſtate, and my
Parents having no other Child, I was bred
with that care and expence I may rather
call profuſe than great. It was my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
that my Mother died when I was but
12 years old, and that my Father, though
aged, married a young Lady more conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for Birth than Eſtate; but my Father
had ſufficient to ſatisfie the ambition or
pride of a woman of quality. But theſe were
not the Vanities my Mother-in-law was
ſubject to, it was Love had the Aſcendent
over her. My Father was old, ſhe was young
and handſom, and he had cauſe to be jealous
of her: He let her ſtir but very rarely out of
her Lodging, and never but in his company,
and then only to Church, or to make a viſit
to a Friend or Relation. But who can reſiſt
his fate? My Mother-in-law, little pleaſed
with the ſevere hand my Father held over
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103330:83"/>
her, found her inclination to be unfaithful
to him, increaſe more and more; nothing
provokes deſire more than reſtraint, and
difficulties and ſtraits are Siſters of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſhe made uſe of ſeveral to carry on
ſome little intrigues in the Town, but all to
no purpoſe; my Father, an old Maſter in
Gallantry, was ſo cunning and miſtruſtful,
that nothing could eſcape him. So that the
kind Lady deſpairing of relief from abroad,
was willing to try if ſhe could find at home
any means to ſatisfie her inclinations. She
caſt her eyes on a Man, of condition ſo
mean, I dare not for her reputation let you
know what it was, though otherwiſe very
handſom, honeſt, and till then very faithful
to my Father, who had more truſt in him,
than in any of his Domeſticks: this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
and familiarity ſo diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for a Lady of her quality, laſted for
ſome time without being diſcovered, till at
laſt by ill fortune for them and for me, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
laid me down to ſleep on a bed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in my Mother-in-laws chamber, I was
an eye-witneſs of their Infamy: they were
not aware of me, my Maid having by
chance covered me with a piece of Tapeſtry,
laid uſually on the bed. I ſaw them, and they
me, with what ſurprize you may imagine.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103330:83"/>
I was then 14 or 15 years old. Was he not
a Slave, ſays the <hi>Turk?</hi> interrupting with
a tone full of joy and ſurprize. Yes, Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
<hi>Laura</hi> (aſtoniſht at the Queſtion,
which made her look earneſtly on him) he
was a Slave, and of <hi>Turky.</hi> Ah Madam,
cries the other, as ſoon as ſhe had ſaid ſo, is
it poſſible you ſhould not know <hi>Aſſen?</hi> and
that you ſhould be Madam <hi>Elinor?</hi> At
this <hi>Laura</hi> was mute for ſome time, and
then recollecting her ſelf, Oh Heavens! is it
you, my poor <hi>Aſſen,</hi> ſays ſhe? By what good
fortune have I met you here, and fallen in
your hands? By the beſt fortune in the
world both for you and me, ſays the <hi>Turk,</hi>
raviſhed with joy to find himſelf in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to ſerve her, and being under the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
I am to you, I ſhould be the moſt
ingrateful of men, if I imploy not my ſelf
in your ſervice. I know you may accuſe me
on the account of your Mother-in-law, but
what could a poor ſlave have done, tempted
by the charms of a fair Lady, who offered
him Money and Liberty when he pleaſed?
You will confeſs, men are gain'd by leſs mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and that if I committed a Crime in
doing as I did, after the Confidence ſo good
a Maſter as your Father repoſed in me, and
the bounty he ſhewed me, yet it is pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103330:84"/>
at leaſt I believe I have made
ſome amends for my fault, in ſaving
your Lives, which your Mother would have
robbed both you and him of by poyſon. But I
had that influence over her Paſſion, that
I diverted her from it. She made me a
thouſand promiſes, if I would put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
that horrible deſign; but becauſe
you are ignorant what followed that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
I will tell you in few words.</p>
               <p>Your ſight of us, as you ſaid, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
extreamly both the one and the
other; and in that deſperate Paſſion
your Mother-in-Law was then in, I
know not what ſhe would have done
to have been rid of you. But, as I
told you, I oppoſed her, and made her
underſtand, that the courſe ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
would certainly plunge us into
irreparable Miſchiefs, and doubtleſs,
coſt us both our Lives. That it were
better to endeavour to gain you by fair
means, in hopes that being very good-natur'd,
you would not purſue our
deſtruction, by making your Father
acquainted with that which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be the cauſe of his Death, and
bring him to his Grave You cannot but
remember I went alone with you out
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103330:84"/>
of the Chamber to perſwade you.
And that I told you, it concern'd the
Honour of your Houſe to keep the
matter private, with ſeveral other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
with which you expreſs'd your
ſelf convinced. At laſt, you promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
me not to make any more noiſe
of it, if your Mother-in-Law would,
for the future, keep within the bounds
of her Duty. I made a relation of
all this to her, expecting that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of your diſcretion, ſo well
known in the Family, would have
paſt for current Security, for your
keeping your word. But it could not
ſecure her from ſtrange inquietude
and trouble of Mind. She could not
ſee you without ſhame, nor come near
your Father without trembling. She
buzz'd inſtantly in my Ears, that there
was a neceſſity of making you both a
Sacrifice to her Repoſe; and that till
then ſhe could not expect any Pleaſure
in her Life. She told me, I muſt help
her to effect the deſign, or expect to
be the firſt that ſhould feel the weight
of her wrath. I endeavoured the beſt
I could to reduce her to Reaſon, but
for ſome time ſhe would not hear any.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103330:85"/>
At laſt, her ill humour deſired only
the ſatisfaction of your being put out
of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your Lodging, and was content to
find out ſeveral pretences to perſwade
your Father to put you into a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery,
or at leaſt out of his Houſe.
Notwithſtanding all the Arts of her
Complaiſance and Cunning, ſhe found
it no eaſie matter to bring this about;
but for the quiet of the Houſe, it was
neceſſary to pleaſe her, and place you
under Penſion in a Nunnery. Shortly
after, whether it were that you had
diſcovered the buſineſs, or that ſhe
fear'd you had done ſo, or rather that
ſhe was willing to be rid of me, by
this Stratagem ſhe came one Night to
my Chamber, while your Father was
aſleep, and with a fright in her looks
told me, I was undone, that my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
knew all, and that I had no more
but that Night for to ſave my ſelf.
Whereupon ſhe gave me Money, and
ſeeing me reſolved to be gone, bid me
her laſt farewel. I kept, as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
the Keys of the Houſe, and
ſo got eaſily out. I had, for a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe,
taken a black Suit of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and as ſoon as it was day, and the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103330:85"/>
Port open, I hired a Felucca, which
carried me to <hi>Legorne,</hi> where I lay
private three days, ſtaying for a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of the Great Dukes, which was to
carry a Preſent to <hi>Mahomet Baſſa,</hi> my
Ancient Friend, who made uſe of
his Intereſt with the <hi>Dey</hi> to reſtore me
my Eſtate, which ſince I was a Slave,
had been Confiſcated, upon a belief
I was dead. But having fail'd of his
deſire, he procured me in recompence,
the Secretaries place, which is no
great matter here. This, Madam, is the
account of my Life ſince I left <hi>Italy.</hi>
You may oblige me in acquainting
me with yours, which I could not
come to the knowledge of, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard ſince from <hi>Genoa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which remains to be told you,
ſays <hi>Elinor</hi> (whom we will yet call
<hi>Laura)</hi> is a ſtory full of troubles and
misfortunes; the more difficult for me
to relate, that a Perſon of Quality
cannot but be aſhamed of them. But
I will be free with you.</p>
               <p>Having ſpent two Years in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
I was placed in, my Father mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with many tears, took me home;
where for the time I ſtayed there, I
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103330:86"/>
was under continual Perſecution from
my Mother-in-Law; who having got
the Aſcendent over the good Man,
made him believe what ſhe pleaſed.
She had new deſigns in her Head,
which you may believe was the
cauſe of the fear ſhe put you in: for
my Father never had the leaſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of your familiarity, and was much
troubled at your running away, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
he had loſt in you the beſt Servant
he had. He had deſigned to have ſet you
at Liberty, which was the reaſon he
ſent not after you as he might have
done. I was by this time become ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
clear ſighted, and what I knew
of my Mother-in-Law, made me ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
every thing ſhe did: I watched
her narrowly, and in few days diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
a new Gallant. You may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that after the miſchiefs ſhe had
done me, I fail'd not to do her all the
ill Offices in my power: it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of our Sex never to Pardon. But
beſides the pleaſure of Revenge, I was
engaged in Honour againſt her. This
raiſed a War between us more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
than ever, and my Father had
trouble enough to content us both.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103330:86"/>
At firſt ſhe thought her ſelf hard
enough for me, having once already
turn'd me out of the Houſe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſent you packing; and putting
on a bold face, fear'd nothing, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I would not accuſe her of any
thing, but her impudence could bring
her off, my Evidence being gone. But
when ſhe perceived by my obſtructing
her new practices, rallying her on all
occaſions, and other cutting effects of
my reſentment, that I underſtood her
Secrets, ſhe ſpared nothing that Rage
and Fury could ſuggeſt to her againſt
me. At laſt, ſhe fell heavy upon me
with my Father; and having not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with him to return me into the
Monaſtery, forced him to turn me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
out of his Houſe, and place me
with his Relations; where I paſſed ſix
Months with one, and ſix Months with
another, to the great diſpleaſure of the
Family. Till at laſt a Grandee of
<hi>Spain,</hi> an old Friend of my Fathers,
having been created Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi>
and paſſing by <hi>Genoa</hi> to go and take
Poſſeſſion of his Government, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intreated him to take me along
with him, which he readily did. The
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103330:87"/>
Viceroy and his Lady received and
entertained me, not only as the
Daughter of their intimate Friend, but
as their own, and honoured me with
ſuch expreſſions of Civility and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that I thought my ſelf too happy
in being of their Train. And the
truth is, I was not deceived; theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of kindneſs growing every
day to greater perfection, eſpecially on
the part of the Viceroy's Lady, who
appeared not able to live a moment
without me. She had been a great
Beauty, and was not then unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
though not very young. She
kept nothing from me, but imparted
to me her moſt private thoughts, and
made me the Confident of her deareſt
affections. This laſted as long as I
was diſintereſs'd, but there is no truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one another of our Sex, eſpecially
in matters of Love. I was reputed not
unhandſom, and having a full Purſe
at command, I lived at that Court
with Splendor enough. It was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
known, I was not the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
ſet off with a little Beauty, raiſed
ſo great a number of Pretenders to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103330:87"/>
me, that I could not paſs a day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
treats and addreſſes of Love. The
Court of <hi>Naples</hi> hath always paſs'd for
the moſt Gallant of <hi>Italy,</hi> by reaſon of
the multitude of Perſons of Quality
in the Kingdom, but was never ſo
pleaſant as then. I was ſo young that
I knew not what Love was, and was
not concerned to make haſte to learn
it, but made the Cares and Sighs of thoſe
in Love, my ſport and divertiſement.
But Love will in time be revenged,
and make ſport of us that made ſport
of him. I had not yet ſeen the man
who had the ſecret to affect my heart,
no not one who could pleaſe, though
that Court had of all ſorts, and ſome
very handſome. The Son of the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,
being a young Lord very well
accompliſhed, and not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for me, did but give me trouble.
But as I hinted before, I pay'd dear for
that indifference and thoſe ſlights I
gloried ſo much in Five or ſix months
after our arrival at <hi>Naples,</hi> there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
at Court a young Gentleman
whom Love ſeems to have raiſed up
for my ruin. It was the Marqueſs
<hi>Hippolito</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Accelyn,</hi> equally
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103330:88"/>
conſiderable for his good parts as his
Birth; a Youth whoſe outſide was
taking enough to charm at firſt ſight,
but as traiterous and wicked within,
as he was outwardly handſom and
well accompliſhed. When you have
heard out my ſtory, you will ſay I
ſpeak with too much moderation. It
is hard to hate what we have been
once truly in Love with. In ſpite of
that unpardonable outrage he did me,
I find that if I ſaw him, and had it in
my power to take my revenge of him
by death, which he hath but too
well deſerved, my reſentment would
give place to the inclination I had for
him. He was newly come from <hi>France,</hi>
and had got the Court-air, ſo peculiar
and natural to thoſe of quality of that
Nation. I was extreamly pleaſed to
ſee him, and looked upon him with
delight, the firſt time he appeared at
Court; and was ſenſible of it, though
with ſhame and anger at my ſelf. From
thenceforth he was conſtantly in my
thoughts, though very troubleſome to
me. I was diſpleaſed with my ſelf for
it, and would upon any terms have
put him out of my mind, but the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103330:88"/>
more I endeavoured it, the more I
found him ſettled there. I ſaw him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times after, and to the end the
War within me would fain have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
my ſelf, it was not for my
honour to entertain ſuch thoughts of
that Gentleman; but I found in the end
my ingenuity deceived me. That
which contributed moſt to my ruin,
that both by his looks and his actions
he ſeemed to prefer me before all the
Ladies of the Court, and though he
did not declare ſo much, yet I could
obſerve he had more than an ordinary
reſpect for me, and would now and
then ſay to my ſelf ſome things I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
he might and would have ſaid to
me. At laſt I made my ſelf of his Party,
and blaming my paſt coyneſs, I thought
it very allowable and juſt, to have
ſome eſteem for a man who merited
it from all the World: Having once
entertained this thought, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of it as reaſonable, my paſſion
and Love finding my heart already
more than half open, preſs'd in and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
took it. The <hi>Viceroy</hi>'s Lady, who
often diverted her ſelf in entertaining
me with all the Intrigues of the Court,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:103330:89"/>
having one day told me ſeveral Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
asked me if I knew the Marqueſs
<hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Miſtreſs, for that, for ſome
days paſt, ſhe obſerved him very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
and out of humour, which ſhe
took for an effect of ſome inclination.
Had ſhe look'd upon me when ſhe
asked me the queſtion, ſhe might read
in my countenance how much I was
concerned; for I chang'd colour three
or four times. But being upon the
Tarraſs of the Palace on the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
ſide, ſhe was looking that way
and took no notice of me; ſo that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
time to recover my ſelf, I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an affected coldneſs, that he
was a dull young fellow, and I believed
incapable of Love: and thereupon out
of Jealouſie her queſtion had raiſed
in me, I made a deſcription of him as
really unlike him, as contrary to the
thoughts I had of him. The Viceroy's
Lady fell a laughing, and having look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon me ſo, as ſhe believed, would
have put me out of countenance; is it
poſſible, ſays ſhe, that you ſhould think
ſo of a man whom all the other Ladies
eſteem the handſomeſt of the Court?
If I were not very well perſwaded of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103330:89"/>
your indifference for all men, I ſhould
believe of you quite contrary to what
you ſay. But look to your ſelf, for
ſooner or later you will be met with,
and your inſenſible heart ſhall have
her turn as well as others. As for me,
I confeſs, were I as you, that young
Gentleman would pleaſe me, and I
would not have you ſlight him: think
of it, he is a Perſon of merit and worth,
and wants nothing of what may juſtly
deſerve Love from a fair Lady as you
are. Who would not have believed but
ſhe ſpoke in good earneſt? Who could
have miſtruſted her after ſo many
kindneſſes and favours ſhe daily laid
out on me? I know not whether
I was to blame, but muſt confeſs I
yielded my ſelf to be taken, and
was ready to unſay in her preſence
all that I had ſpoken againſt the
Marqueſs <hi>Hippolito,</hi> and to acknowledge
I had prevented her in the thoughts ſhe
had been pleaſed to inſpire into me of
him, but my modeſty reſtrained me. I
thought my ſelf concerned in honour,
to expect an Addreſs from him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I would confeſs my ſelf taken. I
could never diſcover perfectly this
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103330:90"/>
Ladies deſign, but as far as I can gueſs
by the conſequence, ſhe queſtion'd
me of pure jealouſie, endeavouring to
diſcover whether I had any affection
for the Marqueſs. She had often ſeen us
talk together; judging by her thoughts
of him, that it was hard enough for
a Lady to be acquainted with a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of ſo many charming Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
without loving him; ſhe had
doubtleſs ſome apprehenſion I had
on his account ceas'd to be inſenſible.
But finding by what I ſaid, that I
continued indifferent, her jealouſie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
place to Love-policy, ſhe deſired
to ſettle ſome friendſhip between him
and me, to ſerve her for a pretence to
ſee him as oft as ſhe deſired. At leaſt I
am of opinion theſe were the reaſons
obliged her to ſpeak of me as ſhe did,
and to tell me, if ever I meant to love, I
could not make a better choice. I ſtood
out ſtifly to the end, telling her, my
Liberty was ſo precious, that I would
not part with it for any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the World, if the keeping de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
wholly on me: But becauſe
thoſe of my condition were not born
to enjoy it all their Life; whatever I
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:103330:90"/>
endured, I would be guided by my
Friends, and abſolutely obey their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
who had the right to diſpoſe of
me. Hereupon ſhe embraced me, and
ſaid, All the Maids of the World would
be wiſe, were they of my humour, and
followed my example. In the mean
time, ſince I was reſolved not to ſlight
the Counſel of Friends, it was her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
I ſhould admit the Marqueſs <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>
to ſee me ſometimes. But Madam,
ſaid I, interrupting her, hath he deſired
leave to do it, and is it at his requeſt
that you make the motion? She
anſwered, ſaying, that I need not
trouble my ſelf for that, but might
believe this overture came not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
from her; and that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
had found me out as well as
others. You may imagine what a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſhe did me, in telling me this, who
deſired nothing more than the love of
that Gentleman.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe being over, we parted
extreamly miſtaken in our thoughts
of one another. She imagin'd I was
ſtill the ſame, and altogether inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of love; and I thought ſhe had
ſpoken as a Friend, and really deſired to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103330:91"/>
ſee me in love with the Marqueſs:
We began to have the young Lords
company, after the particular kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
between him and <hi>Don Alphonſo,</hi>
Son to the Viceroy, gave him free en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
where he pleaſed; and the
Viceroy having no ſmall eſteem for the
Marqueſs, was not only glad to ſee him
at Court, but ingaged him by his Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
to come to him oftner. I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
mentioning what the Lady con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
on her part; but you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it very probable, that having the
kindneſs ſhe had for him, ſhe omitted
nothing in her power to further theſe
Viſits. At firſt he was altogether for
me, at leaſt in appearance; for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
days he wanted nothing of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
or complaiſance to pleaſe me.
Whereever I went he ſtill waited upon
me, approved all that I ſaid, and
took my part on all occaſions. In a
word, he practiſed all that may be
done, for gaining a-Miſtreſs; and was
preſently looked upon in Court as a
new Servant of mine. Many of my
Friends congratulated my Conqueſt,
and I could not but laugh at them. Not
but that I believed it, being eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103330:91"/>
to credit what I ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
but that I was afraid to believe it
ſo ſoon, and was unwilling it ſhould be
known, to avoid the ſhame that might
attend a miſtake. He had not as then
ſpoke to me of Love; and the leaſt I
could do, was to expect he ſhould
declare himſelf. A Lover of ſo much
Wit as the Marqueſs, could not fail of
finding an occaſion. But I know not
whether fortune befriended him ſo ill,
as not to afford him one. However, 'tis
certain he never took any to diſcover
his Paſſion by Speech: All that I
knew of it, was from his looks and
his ſighs, which perhaps my kindneſs
interpreted too favourably. Men being
now accuſtomed to a general Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that in ſhew and appearance, both
their words and their actions ſpeak
altogether of Love. Theſe promiſing
bloſſoms of an apparent affection, were
all blaſted on the ſudden. I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at it to aſtoniſhment, to ſee him
ſo far advanced to make ſo ſudden
a ſtop, at a time I leaſt expected it,
and prepared my ſelf to give occaſion
to diſcover his affection, which I
fear'd his reſpect for me, or his fear
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103330:92"/>
to diſpleaſe me, had hindered from
doing. I could not imagine the cauſe
of ſo ſudden a change; for three whole
days he abſented from the Court, and
when he appeared there, he looked like
a man ſo cold, ſo altered, as if he durſt
not caſt an eye upon me, whereas before
he was jovial and complaiſant, and his
eye never off me, you cannot eaſily
imagine how terribly this vext me. I
was upon the point of asking him the
reaſon, and had certainly done it, but
that I was over-rul'd by a little haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs
and pride, which making me
look on his inconſtant proceeding, as
an effect of manifeſt Treachery, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
me with ſcorn and averſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him; which however I ſmarted
for in the end: for two whole days I
did nothing but weep and complain of
Love and my own wickedneſs. The
Viceroy's Lady obſerving me ſad and
dejected, though I did all in my power
to hide part of my trouble, asked me
what I did ail, which probably ſhe knew
but too well, but was willing to have
the pleaſure of hearing what I would
ſay, I, who till then had not the leaſt
reaſon to diſtruſt her, made no ſcruple
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:103330:92"/>
of telling her in plain terms the cauſe
of my grief, and told her, ſhe had
more than any contributed thereto.
This made her bluſh, and comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the ſudden what I meant, but
thinking without doubt I had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
her ſecret. But I fell unhappily
to explaining my ſelf, and ſeriouſly
confeſs'd to her, that what ſhe had ſaid
to me of the Marqueſs <hi>Hippolito,</hi> had
produced in me ſome diſpoſition of
kindneſs for him, which coſt me then
very dear, having been very confident
ſhe would not have deceived me, but
that the Marqueſs had now deceived
us both. I muſt confeſs, ſays the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
I was willing to conceal from
you the inconſtancy and change of a
fooliſh young flaſh, and did deſign
not to ſpeak to you any more of him,
not thinking you could be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for him after what I had heard
you ſay of him. But ſince you are
aware of his inconſtancy, and ſo much
concern'd at it, I muſt tell you, that to
my grief as much as yours, I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
he is otherwiſe engaged.
She perceived me bluſh extreamly at
that word, and in truth I was ſo
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103330:93"/>
diſordered within, it was impoſſible
to hide my deſpair. Otherwiſe enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged!
Madam, ſaid I, ſighing: Yes,
anſwered ſhe, to a new Miſtreſs very
lately. Judge you, continued ſhe,
what I ſaid to him on that occaſion,
and whether he did deſerve to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
having expreſt ſo much
paſſion for you, that I thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
a man could have been more
deeply in Love. Oh Heavens, cry'd
ſhe, how deceitful are men now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days!
He excuſed himſelf by the
Friendſhip he hath for my Son; that
to be his Rival, were to betray him,
and that the confidence he had in him,
in acquainting him at his arrival, with
his affection for you, obliged him to
make a Sacrifice of his heart, to ſerve
my Sons intereſt. Sorry excuſes, I
confeſs ſays ſhe, but how can we help
it? 'Tis a mercy however, he knows
not the favourable inclination you
have for him, for which he is unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
beholding to me, as the cauſe of
your kindneſs. He ſhould never have
known theſe worthy inclinations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
I: I never diſcovered them to
any but your ſelf Madam, for whom
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103330:93"/>
I had no reſerve, and I hope you have
not told him. Think not, ſays ſhe, I
could ſo far forget my ſelf; though I
were not ſo much your Friend as you
know I am; I know very well with
what caution to manage their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
who repoſe a confidence in me.
Then I asked her trembling, whether
ſhe knew the fair Lady had robbed us
of him? That, ſays ſhe, I cannot learn
of him, but I will endeavour to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it by my Son, who without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
knows who ſhe is; leave that to me,
and I will bring you news of her as
ſoon as I can diſcover her.</p>
               <p>Thus did my Rival triumph and
laugh at me. I muſt confeſs I was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Fool, in that I had not then more
wit, than to truſt any Woman; but it
was the confidence I had in her, that
blinded me. Yet when I call to mind
a thouſand things then ſpoken and
done, I cannot but wonder, I who had
ſeen ſo much of the world, could not
make diſcovery of the treachery they
acted againſt me. I did nothing
but torment my ſelf night and day,
and avoided all occaſions of being
with the Marqueſs, for fear my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:103330:94"/>
ſhould to my diſgrace prevail over
my reſolutions. I ſaw him entertain
himſelf commonly with the Viceroys
Lady, and asking her one day, what
it was they diſcourſed of; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhe had diſcovered the ſecret I
was ſo deſirous to know; ſhe anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, no, but that I ſhould not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
my ſelf, for the Marqueſs would
come to me again; and that ſhe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
how to bring it about. I was
vext at this, and told her I did not
deſire it: that ſhe might do her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
but that I deſired to be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
And the truth is, the pains I
endured, would, I believe, by degrees
have made me inſenſible, and cured
me at laſt. But on a day the Viceroy
treated us in the Garden, I quitted
the Company, and walking aſide to
muſe in a dark and ſolitary place, I
met with the Marqueſs. I thought it
an effect of the Ladies care, and that
ſhe had made uſe of this occaſion to
reconcile us. I know not whether he
took the haughtineſs and ſeriouſneſs
of the Looks I entertain'd him with
for an ill Omen, or not; but ſure I
am, he trembled as he approached me,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103330:94"/>
and with a very ſettled tone, told me,
it was very ſtrange to ſee a perſon of
my Humour finding out ſo ſolitary a
Walk, there being ſo much good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in the Garden: it had been, ſaid
he, excuſable in any other, as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of ſome amorous thoughts; but
for you Madam—for me, replied I,
interrupting him, and who hath told
you but I may have been led hither
by Love? Ah Madam, anſwered he,
we know you too well to entertain
any ſuch ſuſpicion; and I am ſure, if
you can love any thing, it muſt be
only your ſelf, 'Tis well, replied I,
if it be true as you ſay, that I love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all; but as for what you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
me with, 'tis reported you are
not altogether indifferent: there is
ſome ground for the report, Madam,
indifference being a Quality I never
ſtood much upon, eſpecially towards
you of all the people in the World.
What not towards me? replied I,
when you knew me inſenſible. 'Tis
true, Madam, anſwered he, I was told
ſo, but ſubmitted however to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny
of thoſe many unfortunate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
you have made ſuch in this
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103330:95"/>
Court. In matter of affection, ſaid I,
we are not to be led by example; ſome
have more merit, or at leaſt better
Fortune than others; we are ſenſible
towards ſome, when we are not ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
others: One perſon ſhall pleaſe,
without knowing wherefore amongſt
an infinite of others who ſhall not
have that advantage though equally
handſom. In a word, every one hath
his lucky moment: you may believe
I could not have ſaid all this without
bluſhing. The Marqueſs having heard
me with ſuch attention, as clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
him ſurpriz'd at my diſcourſe,
was juſt going to anſwer me, when
the Viceroys Lady, who would never
with her good will have us both out of
her ſight, unhappily interrupted us,
and ſurprizing us on the ſudden, ſaid,
I dare lay a good wager you were
ſpeaking of Love: 'tis true, anſwered
I ſmiling, we were diſcourſing of a
very pleaſant queſtion, occaſioned by
being reproached by the Marqueſs for
my inſenſibility. He hath reaſon,
Madam, replied the Lady<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to prevent
an anſwer from the Marqueſs; he who
is ſo deeply in Love, may juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103330:95"/>
you: if you know it not, I
can aſſure you of it, and will in time
tell you more. I thought, ſaid I, we
had not been ſo great ſtrangers, but I
might have known it from himſelf,
without being obliged to another for
the News, and if we two were alone,
I know how I would quarrel with him
for it. All this was ſpoken with an
air of raillery, which wrought very
effectually on the inclinations of the
Marqueſs, which the Lady diſcourſed
of; I applied to my ſelf, imagining
what ſhe ſpoke of it, was done for my
honour, and to engage me to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
anſwer which I gave. She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
fell into other diſcourſe, and
led us inſenſibly towards the company.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, the Marqueſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
muſed all night on what I had
ſaid, found me alone looking out at a
window of the Palace, and falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
on the diſcourſe of the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
asked me, though I had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to love, whether I would be
diſpleaſed at one who loved me
with the greateſt paſſion in the
World: I anſwered, there were
but few I would allow that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103330:96"/>
to; and that in the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
I knew but one I could permit to
uſe that priviledge. I believe he could
not but underſtand I meant him, and
my looks did but too much confirm
him in the opinion; he, though he
obſerv'd it, but would not take notice
of it. I know, Madam, ſays he, it is
extreamly imprudent to propoſe a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a meaner rank than yours, or
one of ſmall merit, or not Maſter of
Qualities worthy your eſteem; but
the perſon I ſpeak of, is beyond all
exception. Finding him take a courſe
ſo contrary to what I expected, I had
not patience to permit him to make
an end, having ground enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
it was not for himſelf he made
this Declaration; and interrupting
him briskly, A Lover, ſaid I, (bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with anger and ſhame) perhaps
would not diſpleaſe, provided he were
like the Marqueſs <hi>Hippolito;</hi> any other
may come too late. I had ſcarce ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
theſe words, but I repented me of
them, and unwilling to hear any more
in the confuſion the torrent of my
Paſſion had put me in, I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew.
Oh Heavens! cry'd he, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103330:96"/>
after to ſtay me, How unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
am I? Unfortunate, ſaid I, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
toward him: Is the eſteem I have
for you a means to make you unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate?
Yes, Madam, replied he with
a ſigh; that precious and charming
eſteem, I was made believe, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be gain'd, which I would have
purchaſed with all I have dear in the
World—He ſtopped there. Well,
ſaid I, what of that eſteem? Ah Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
anſwered he, they have made
me renounce it. I had no ſooner
heard theſe words but I went on my
way, having given him ſome looks
full of indignation; but ſeeing him
follow me, and not able for very grief
to ſpeak to him, I made ſigns to him
with my hand, that he ſhould come
no further. It is beyond imagination
what a deſperate condition I was in
that night: Rage, ſhame, ſpite, fury,
repentance; in a word, all the Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a Lover, mock'd, betrayed,
aſſaulted me by turns I fell ſo ſick, that
for many days I kept my Bed; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I reſolved to ſpeak to him once
more, to know who had cauſed him to
renounce my eſteem, as he had told me.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103330:97"/>
I preſently fancied it was <hi>Don Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo;</hi>
but was very deſirous to learn how
the matter had been managed, and
expected every day to ſee him with
his Friend, or with the Viceroys La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and that I ſhould find an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to ſpeak to him of it. In the
mean time he came not to my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
though all the Court did me that
honour, for the ſhort time I continued
indiſpoſed: this ſurprized me extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and hearing one day he was in my
Anti-chamber, I ſent <hi>Clarice</hi> my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to deſire him to come and ſee
me, having ſomething to ſay to him.
He would have come inſtantly, as the
Maid brought me word; but the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roys
Lady, with whom he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing,
ſtay'd him: at which I was not
a little aſtoniſhed; but much more,
when ſoon after I ſaw him come in, in
the company of that Lady. He looked
very pale, and his countenance much
altered, which contributed not a little
to allay my bitterneſs againſt him,
though I had ſmall reaſon to think my
ſelf concerned in honour of that
change that appeared in his looks. You
ſee, Madam, ſaid I to the Lady at their
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103330:97"/>
entrance, this Gentleman muſt be ſent
for, if we deſire the pleaſure of his
Company. Theſe are favours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
I, not uſual with me, and ſuch
as I would not by any means have
done him, while it was in my power
to have any eſteem for him. But
ſince he hath told me, they have made
him renounce my eſteem, you may
believe, Madam, I am not much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to have any eſteem for him;
and that what I now do, proceeds not
from any ſuch cauſe. 'Tis true, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the Lady, he does not deſerve
your eſteem, but you muſt pardon his
Youth. I will pardon him, replyed
I, on condition he will tell me who
had the power over his Heart or Wit,
to make ſlight of an eſteem not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unworthy a Gentleman of
his Quality; and 'tis for that purpoſe
I have ſent for him hither. He ſtood
mute; ſo that turning my Head to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Lady, to ask her the reaſon
of his ſilence, I was again ſurpriz'd
to find the Lady in greater diſorder
than he. I was juſt ſpeaking to him
again, when I ſaw him riſe to tell me
with trouble in his face; I will ſatisfie
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103330:98"/>
you, Madam, in that particular, but
intreat you let me take a fitter time.
A fitter time, ſaid I, and why not
now? Is it my Lady that hinders
you? You know I conceal nothing
from her. Ah, if it be I, ſaid the
Lady, I will withdraw to leave you
at liberty; and with that ſhe retired
towards a Window, in far greater
diſorder than if ſhe had been angry.
This made me more curious than ever
to hear what the Marqueſs would ſay
to me. Yet he declared himſelf no
further, but reaching forth his hand
towards me, he ſhewed me a Billet,
which I would not have received on
any other occaſion; but in this
Conjuncture I made no ſcruple of it,
believing I ſhould find in it the Secret
I longed for: Hereupon he withdrew
without ſaying a word. And the Lady
returning towards me; Well, Madam,
ſaid ſhe, how comes it he is gone,
without naming to you the Perſon
you have ſo much cauſe to hate? I
muſt tell you, 'tis I, and that will ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
you. It really did ſo, the word
ſhe had ſpoken having aſtoniſh'd me,
I could ſcarce make her an anſwer:
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103330:98"/>
You muſt know then, continued ſhe,
that having told me he had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
on the account of my Son to
change his thoughts of you, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
himſelf to another Beauty; I
preſſed him for your ſake to tell me
who it was; and after a long refuſal,
he had the inſolence to tell me, 'twas
I. You may imagine how I uſed him
on ſuch an occaſion: However, I was
of Opinion, that a little more than
ordinary complaiſance I had expreſs'd
for him, had given him that Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
But finding him ſenſible of
his error, I was a little better pacified,
and let him ſee he was miſtaken on all
hands. That he ſhould not have quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the deſign of ſerving you, being
unqueſtionably the beſt deſerving in
this Court of Paſſion and eſteem of
a Perſon of his Quality, and that he
was very ill adviſed to make addreſſes
to me, who was neither for Gallant,
nor Gallantry. I was no ſtranger to
the Character of this Lady, and knew
very well what ſhe ſaid was quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the inclinations of her temper.
And having had leiſure while ſhe
ſpoke, to recover my ſelf from the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103330:99"/>
aſtoniſhment ſhe had caſt me in at the
beginning of this Diſcourſe, and to
obſerve the alteration of her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
I made no doubt of her perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs.
This, Madam, ſaid I very
ſeriouſly, was to engage further in my
concerns than I deſerved, and in truth
than I deſired. You had formerly told
me, this young Gentleman would have
pleaſed you, had you been as I; and
ſince he preferred you before me, it
was too much for you to part with
him for my ſake. I did, ſays ſhe, but
what I ought both for you and my
ſelf. This, Madam, replyed I, is a
piece of more than ordinary Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
and I queſtion very much, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
among the beſt Friends of our
Sex, the pleaſure of being beloved by
a Perſon whom all the Ladies of the
Court own to be the handſomeſt and
beſt accompliſh'd in <hi>Naples,</hi> would not
prevail over their Friendſhip, and make
it appear that one Woman ſeldom
ſcruples to be treacherous to another
in caſes of this Nature. But, Madam,
methinks what you now ſay, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
contrary to what you formerly
told me of the Paſſion of the Marqueſs
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103330:99"/>
then wholly for me. I thought ſo
then, I confeſs, ſaid ſhe, but I was
miſtaken. And is it not poſſible, you
ſhould be now alſo miſtaken, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I, for I have ſome reaſon to doubt
it. You do but deceive your ſelf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
ſhe. Well, Madam, ſaid I with
ſome heat, let us try which of us is
deceived; peradventure it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in this Billet I received from him.
Whereupon I fell to the opening of it.
The Lady much ſurpriz'd, asked me,
if it came from the Marqueſs. I told
her, it did; and that nothing but the
curioſity I had to clear this Affair,
could have prevail'd with me to take
it from him. Alas, ſays ſhe, what aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
can that give you of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
of a man who changes them
every moment; and will, it may be,
tell you the ſame he hath told me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
I was in ſuch haſte to open
the Letter, that I made her no anſwer,
but fell to reading it, being to this
purpoſe.</p>

That which your Eyes have done

               <p>Ah, Traytor, cry'd the Viceroy's
Lady, as ſoon as I had done reading
the Billet, is it poſſible he ſhould have
the Confidence to juſtifie the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
inconſtancy man was ever guilty
of, and to accuſe others of it? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
ſaid I without any Paſſion, 'tis
fit we ſhould hear him ſpeak for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and if you pleaſe to ſtay, we will
ſend for him, and ſee how he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
himſelf againſt you. Alas, ſays
ſhe, what ſhould I ſtay for? I am not
otherwiſe concerned than on your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
You may now do as you pleaſe,
but if you will be adviſed by me, ſee
him no more. That muſt not be,
Madam, replyed I, though it were
but to know who they are he ſpeaks
of in the Billet; I muſt ſee him once
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103330:101"/>
more, and then I ſhall underſtand
what meaſures to take. I had hardly
done ſpeaking but the Marqueſs came
in. He thought without doubt the
Vice-Roy's Lady would not have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
me ſo long with her company
after he had been gone; and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
he had to know how I took
what he wrote in the Billet, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to tell me what made me ſo
earneſt to be informed of, made him
preſently return. He was not a little
ſurprized to find us together. He was
juſt ſtepping back to be gone, but I
prayed him to come in. The Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy's
Lady ſeeing him, and confounded
at the ſight of him, or for fear I
would put him upon making the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
before her, as I had certainly
done in the condition things were in,
ſtood up, and taking him by the hand,
turning towards me: I have ſomething
(ſaid ſhe) to tell him; after which
you may ſatisfie your ſelf. This action
of hers moved more my pity than my
jealouſie. I know very well ſhe was
not a Woman of the beſt conduct in
the World, but I ſhould never have
imagined her Paſſion could have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103330:101"/>
her ſo far as (after all ſhe had ſaid
to me) as to make her give in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
ſuch an inſtance of her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
I let them go without ſaying a
word to one or other, but expected to
ſee the Marqueſs again, and aſſured
my ſelf of very pleaſant divertiſement
by what he ſhould tell me of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
But he came not at all that day,
which anger'd me not a little. On
the morrow I perfectly recovered. My
malady was a pure effect of jealouſie
and vexation, and when I knew how
matters ſtood, I was ſoon cured of
both: Not but that I had reaſon to
fear the <hi>Vice-Roys</hi> Lady. But the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
courſe I ſaw her take, and her piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
conduct, ſecured me from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of any harm ſhe could do
me: I was well enough to appear at
Court, but hearing there was a Ball
at night, I reſolved to be ſick one day
more, that I might ſteal at night in
<hi>Maſquerade</hi> to the <hi>Ball,</hi> and there ſpeak
with the Marqueſs. My deſign took
not, for he came not thither all the
while I ſtayed. But by reaſon of my
going to and fro to ſeek him out, the
<hi>Vice-Roys</hi> Lady knew me, and being
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103330:102"/>
Alarm'd at my Diſguiſe, followed me
to my Chamber, where I was amazed
to ſee her, and could not believe it
was ſhe. Well, and what News of
the Marqueſs, ſaid ſhe? I muſt know
that of you, Madam, anſwered I, for
I have not ſeen him ſince yeſterday,
when you denied me the pleaſure to
diſcourſe him one moment in a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
you and I were ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to be ſatisfied in. I believe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
ſhe, you are now to ſeek for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
How can that be, reply'd
I, when I have not ſpoken with him
never ſince. It is reported however,
anſwered ſhe, you were this Evening
together in Maſquerade. Thoſe, ſaid
I, who report it, are very much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken;
but I muſt beg your pardon,
Madam, if I tell you there is not any
one but you capable of ſuch a miſtake.
I know what becomes me, and there
are but few who make a doubt of it:
Perſons of my Honour are ſeldom
guilty of ſuch faults. The <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>'s
Lady having a deſire to vex and fall
out with me, never gave over till I
had told her part of my mind, and let
her underſtand I was not to be fool'd
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103330:102"/>
by her. The truths I told her, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her to that degree, that ſhe broke
out into expreſſions ſo cruelly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
I could not forbear crying, and
unwilling ſhe ſhould have the pleaſure
to ſee the Tears run down my Cheeks,
I roſe up to retire into my Cloſet.
What, ſays ſhe, I interrupt your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
in the Charms of your fine
Marqueſs, is not that the cauſe of your
withdrawing? Or rather, continued
ſhe, to provoke me yet more, are you
going to ſeek him in your Cloſet where
you have hid him? That which you
ſay, Madam, doth ſo little become
you, that nothing but extream mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
could have made you think ſo
unworthy of me; but I ſee what pleads
your excuſe. What, reply'd ſhe, I hope
I have not great reaſon to truſt her that
will not truſt me. And the right I
have to over-ſee and regulate your
Conduct gives me the priviledge to
viſit any place I ſuſpect. With that
ſhe took up a Flambeau that lay lighted
on my Table, and went up towards
my Cloſet: I looked upon her with
that ſlight and indifference as wholly
unconcern'd at her action, which
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:103330:103"/>
angred her more than any thing I
could have ſaid to her. I do not yet
know what was her deſign; for ſhe
knew me too well to have the leaſt
ſuſpicion of what ſhe charged me
with, but it ſeems ſhe was reſolv'd to
try me to the utmoſt, and be reveng'd
of me that way. In the mean time,
by very ill Fortune for me, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
was in the Cloſet, and ſhe was
the firſt that diſcovered him; ſhe
ſhrieked out with the ſurprize of it,
which made me turn about that way,
and put me into ſuch a fright, that
together with the diſpleaſure that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
gave me, caſt me into a ſound,
and made me fall as dead upon the
Bed near which I then ſtood. The
Marqueſs ſeized with true or feigned
grief for his being the cauſe of ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
an accident, begged my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
on his knees with tears in his Eyes.
What the Lady ſaid to this I know
not, but one of my Chamber-Maids,
who came to help me, told me ſhe
ſaw her go out ſo angry, that fire
ſeemed to ſparkle out of her Eyes.
When I was come to my ſelf, I ſaw
her not, but the Marqueſs kneeling
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:103330:103"/>
before me with a countenance ſo ſad
and ſo dejected, it melted me into
pity, and eaſed me of more than half
of my anger. What have you done,
Sir, ſaid I? you have utterly ruined
me. Go and ſee me no more but at
ſeaſonable hours, and when every body
might ſee me; after which, though I
was very well pleaſed with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
I pray'd him to withdraw, to
prevent further occaſion of Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I am ſenſible, dear <hi>Aſſen,</hi> I ſpend
too much time in relating particulars
ſo inconſiderable, and abuſe your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
in entertaining you with ſuch
trifles. But this having been the beſt
of my time in that Court, and beſt
part of my ſtory, you will excuſe the
difficulty I find in my ſelf to come to
the relation of Accidents ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for me, that the memory of them
is more terrible than Death. <hi>Aſſen</hi>
having anſwered, that all ſhe had ſaid
was very material; and that he thought
himſelf equally concerned in the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
Circumſtances of her Life, as well
as the greateſt, ſhe proceeded in this
manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:103330:104"/>
The <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>'s Lady having fallen
out with me, and finding reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of difference with the Marqueſs,
who in ſpight of her viſited me often,
you may believe ſhe paſt her time very
melancholy and ſad. The firſt time
the Marqueſs came to ſee me, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
that if he deſigned to pleaſe me,
he ſhould begin to do it by telling me
in particular all the kindneſs and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes
paſt between the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>'s Lady
and him. But he intreated me with
ſo much Ingenuity not to make uſe of
the power I had over him, to oblige
him to a thing ſo mean, that his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
prevailed over my Curioſity,
and made me eſteem him the better
for it: however he let me know 'twas
of her he ſpoke in the Billet, as I had
eaſily gueſs'd. The diſconſolate Lady,
who could not but be concern'd for
us, was willing to ſeek Peace, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found a fair pretence for it, ſent
me word by one of her Women, that
I might do her a pleaſure if I would
give her a Viſit, which I fail'd not to
do. She received me chearfully, and
with ſmiles in her Countenance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Excellent Miſtreſs of the Art
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:103330:104"/>
of Diſſembling, after ſome Civilities
ſhewed me, ſhe brought me to the
Cloſet, where beginning her diſcourſe
with a very great ſigh, Well, my dear
<hi>Elenor,</hi> ſaid ſhe, are you ſtill angry
with me? I am heartily ſorry, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
ſaid I, that you gave me cauſe,
who never deſerved it. Come, let us
agree, ſaid ſhe, to ſay nothing of what
is paſt, and give me leave to let you
ſee I am your Friend. It is that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
Madam, reply'd I; and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
I have always had for you, muſt
needs make you believe your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
very precious and dear to me.
'Tis enough, ſaid ſhe; come, tell me
preſently if there were a propoſal of
Marriage between the Marqueſs and
you; do you love him ſo well, as not
to refuſe him? Such a Propoſal from
her appears very ſuſpicious, and ſeeing
me laugh, as one who would not be
caught in that Trap, I do not ſpeak
to you now (continued ſhe, as a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val)
as you have believed me to be,
and as perhaps (added ſhe ſmiling)
I have formerly been; but as your
true and ſincere Friend I tell you,
that if you deſire to Marry the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103330:105"/>
it ſhall be your fault if it be
not done; with that ſhe ſhewed me
a Letter from the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
written to that purpoſe at the
requeſt of the Marqueſs, and ſaid,
your Father hath ſo much reſpect for
my Husband, that there is no doubt
but it will take effect; the Marqueſs
having deſired my leave to ſpeak of
it to the <hi>Vice-Roy:</hi> and finding by the
Character of the Letter, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
in good earneſt to unite me
to a Man who was furniſh'd with all
I could wiſh, as well for a ſettlement,
as to pleaſe my Affection; I was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed
with Joy, but let it appear as
little as I could, miſtruſting my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
eſpecially being in the hands of
a Perſon who would dearly repent it,
before it could be effected. I thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her with the moſt acknowledging
and affectionate expreſſions I could
invent; and there paſſed ſo many
Careſſes on the one ſide and on the
other, that you would have thought
we had never been ſo great Friends
before. At my return I found the
Marqueſs in my Chamber, where
he waited to bring me this pleaſing
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103330:105"/>
News, with a Countenance full of
Joy; and that the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> had given
him free liberty to viſit me. I told
him I had heard all this from a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he could not eaſily gueſs, and in
truth it was hardly credible it ſhould
be the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>'s Lady. I told him it
was ſhe, and related all our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>The Liberty granted the Marqueſs
to viſit me when he pleaſed, having
heightned the affection we had one for
another, degenerated by degrees into
a kind and tender familiarity. He took
a little more upon him than had been
allowed him, and more indeed than
I ought to have permitted him. But
'tis hard for one in Love, ſo deeply as
I was, to be proof againſt the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
aſſaults of a Man ſhe expects to
be her Husband on the Morrow. At
firſt I made reſiſtance enough, and
would not ſo much as give him my
hand to kiſs; but Love blinds ſo, that
he doth inſenſibly lead us away, and
accuſtom us to things we never durſt
think of. After the firſt bluſh, the reſt
follows of courſe. We expected with
equal impatience my Fathers anſwer.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:103330:106"/>
We were already mutually engaged,
ſo that if his anſwer ſhould not have
proved favourable, we were reſolved
to compleat our happineſs: Such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
given to ſave a Maids Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
are but ſnares Love lays for her
Virtue. The Marqueſs, as all true
Lovers, being impatiently earneſt for
the poſſeſſion of my Perſon as well as
Affection, whereof he was aſſured,
and fearing croſs Accidents that might
hinder our Bliſs, let me know, amongſt
ſome little favours I allowed him to
take, that he was very deſirous to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of my gift what I had forbid him
to hope without my Fathers conſent;
and that if I loved him, I would make
it appear in obliging him in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
I made as if I did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
him, but by degrees he
ſpoke ſo intelligibly, that I was under
the neceſſity of being very angry
with him, or of defending my ſelf with
Arguments: Finding it impoſſible to
be angry with a Man I loved, I fell
to Diſputing, but he was too hard for
me. And certainly, in matters of
Love, a Maid that comes to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
is in danger of being loſt.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103330:106"/>
However our combat laſted long
enough, to make me fancy I had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
my humour; but at laſt I muſt
yield. I thought there needed not ſo
much caution, with a perſon who had
given the <hi>Viceroy</hi> his word that he
would marry me, and aſſured me (as
I believed) by a thouſand Oaths, that
he would make me his Wife. He was
to come to me in my Chamber at
night, an hour after all ſhould be in
bed; and becauſe my Chamber was
near that of the <hi>Viceroys</hi> Ladies, where
I had liberty of entrance at my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
I told him I would leave the
door open, and pray'd him not to
make a noiſe, or ſpeak a word, leſt
the Lady ſhould hear us. You ſee
<hi>Aſſen,</hi> I conceal nothing from you;
though I might alledge many reaſons
in excuſe of my fault. I cannot tell
you all this without bluſhing; for I
muſt confeſs had I been more wiſe, or
more prudent, I could not have been
ſo unfortunate as I am. The <hi>Viceroy</hi>
was gone that day out of Town; all
things ſeemed to favour us, but it was
for my ruin. The hour was come,
and I heard a man entring ſoftly into
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:103330:107"/>
my Chamber, for there was no light
to ſee him by, and I eaſily believed it
was my dear Servant. I received him
with the kindneſs of a Woman in
Love, and made no doubt but it was
he; for he had the ſame imbroider'd
Waſtcoat, which he had cauſed to be
made againſt our Wedding, being one
of the richeſt ever ſeen in the Court.
Part of the night we paſs'd in an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
ſilence, till at laſt he fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep.
As for me, I found my ſelf a
little indiſpoſed, and wanting a light
to find ſomething to take, I ventured
to go into the Ladies Chamber, which
commonly had a watch-light burning
all night. Having opened the door
from my Chamber to hers, I was not
a little ſurprized, when approaching
the watch-light, and caſting my eyes
towards her to ſee if ſhe were aſleep,
the Curtains being all open becauſe
of the hot weather, I ſaw a man in
his cloaths lying by her. I doubted
very much whether it were beſt to go
back whence I came, or take away
the watch-light; but the need I had
of this prevail'd with me to go on, and
light the candle I had in my hand:
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103330:107"/>
and having ſeen ſo much, I was
poſſeſt with a Spirit of curioſity to
know who that fortunate Gallant
might be; I perceived him in the
habit of Marqueſs <hi>Hippolito.</hi> I was
ſurpriz'd at the adventure, and had
I not been fully perſwaded I had
newly left him in my Chamber, I
do not know what extravagances
I might have run into. However
this Circumſtance inflamed my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of knowing who it was. I
perceived he was of the ſame ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the Marqueſs, and had
the ſame hair; the Ladies arm was
over his face, ſo that I could not
ſee it. I was at the beds feet, and
could not be miſtaken; I trembled
all over, as an Omen of my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.
Heavens! ſaid I within
my ſelf, am I awake or aſleep? is
not that the Marqueſs? could he
quit me this night to come to this
Lady? perhaps they held corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
together, and ſhe knew
he was to paſs this night with
me. All theſe Reflections were
made in a moment, and the next
moment after that, I came into
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103330:108"/>
my own Chamber, to find out the
truth. But how was I aſtoniſhed
to find the Marqueſs there too?
Oh Heavens! cry'd I, which of
the two is the counterfeit? And
drawing near him in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
I perceiv'd by the colour of
his Hair, how unhappily I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and that it was <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi>
was there. What a Fury,
what Rage did this put me in? I
ſeiz'd the Ponyard he had laid on
my Table, and not knowing with
which of the three to begin, being
all equally perfidious, I thought
the Marqueſs as moſt criminal, was
firſt to be ſacrificed to my juſt
revenge, for fear of an Eſcape. So
that I went into the other Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
but the noiſe that I made,
having awaked <hi>Don Alphonſo,</hi> he
was amazed to ſee a Light, and
perceiving me enter his Mothers
Chamber, he got up in a trice,
and frightned at the ſight of the
Ponyard in my Hand, he ran after
me, and laid hold on me by the
Arm, juſt as I was going to ſtab
that Traytor the Marqueſs: but he
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103330:108"/>
was alſo ſufficiently ſurpriz'd to ſee
me lifting up my hand to kill the
Marqueſs, lying by his Mothers
ſide. He was enraged at the ſight,
and to waſh away the ſtain of his
Family with the bloud of the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
was ready to execute that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
he had hindred me to take;
but I ſtaid him, and throwing my
ſelf upon him, Traitor, ſaid I, this
blow was not reſerved for thee,
thou ſhalt not have the pleaſure
of being firſt reveng'd. At theſe
words, and the buſtle that we
made, the Marqueſs and the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi>'s
Lady awaking, were at their
wits end, not knowing what reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to take. The Marqueſs judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Ponyard <hi>Don Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi>
had in his Hand, threatned on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
him, made uſe of the time I
held him, to lay hold of his own,
and ſtand on his Guard. I left
them in this furious Diſorder, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
they would ſufficiently revenge
one on another, for their Treaſon
againſt me; and re-entring my
Chamber, I ſhut the door on that
ſide, and having taken with me
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103330:109"/>
all that was conſiderable in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
or Jewels, I went out at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
door, and ran through the
Streets like a mad Woman, to ſeek
a Felucca in the Port, to carry me
to any place my deſpair would
lead me. I was ſo unhappy as not
to find one ready, and had not the
patience to ſtay, for fear of being
purſued, and forced back to that
Court, where I had rather die than
appear. At laſt with much ado I
found a Barque bound for <hi>Barcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona;</hi>
provided they went far enough
from <hi>Italy,</hi> and that my Name
and my Birth were concealed, I
cared not whither they carried me;
ſo that I went on board, without
taking a moment to conſider. 'Tis
not a ſingle Accident makes us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate;
the greateſt diſaſters have
commonly a large train of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes:
Thus far my ſoul enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
not a thought, but what the
tranſports of deſpair and reſentment
had ſuggeſted. But when I ſaw
my ſelf at Sea, and in no other
Company than that of five or ſix
poor Mariners, who knew not what
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:103330:109"/>
to think of me, my heart was ſo
full, that nothing could eaſe it but
a torrent of tears. I will not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you with a Relation of the ſad
thoughts I had for two or three
days that I had the opportunity of
a ſolitary entertainment; but on the
fourth I found my ſelf plunged into
new afflictions. About Sun-riſing the
Sea-men put up ſuch a lamentable cry,
it almoſt broke my heart: I thought
we had been Shipwrack'd, and asked
what the matter was, more out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
than any fear of death, being
the thing I heartily wiſh'd for. I
found the Gallies of <hi>Biſerti</hi> had us in
Chaſe, and took us an hour after: I
received this diſaſter with ſuch tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
of ſpirit, as really aſtoniſht all
the Spectators. All my fear was for
my perſon, having fallen into the
hands of men who are the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
and inhumane on earth, and
have no reſpect for our Sex. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
whether it was my particular
good fortune, or that they had ſome
regard for a Woman which appeared
of more than ordinary Quality, I may
truly ſay, that ſetting aſide the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103330:110"/>
and rudeneſs of their firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
in forcing open the door of
my Cabbin with their feet; I was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
uſed than the reſt, and more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
than I expected. As ſoon as
the Souldiers ſaw me, not one of them
entred; only the Captain of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
took that liberty, and very civilly
asked me in <hi>Italian</hi> who I was, and
for what place I was bound. I hid
from him both my Name and my
Quality, telling him, I was called
<hi>Laura,</hi> and went for <hi>Barcellona</hi> to my
Father, then in the ſervice of the
King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Then I put into his
hand a little Box, in which were my
Money and my Jewels; and the more
to oblige him, I told him I made him
a Preſent worth above twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Crowns (as in truth it was) and
that I might have thrown it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
as moſt of the Sea-men had
done their Cloaths and their Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize.
The acknowledgment I deſired
of him, was that I might be civilly
uſed; which he promiſed me, and the
ſame time told me, I ſhould ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Box, aſſuring me of a
ſhare at our arrival at <hi>Tunis.</hi> I was
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:103330:110"/>
raviſhed at this Conjuncture, not ſo
much for the hopes he gave me of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
part of my Jewels, but becauſe
this ſecret rendred me uſeful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the Captain, and obliged
him to a greater care of me. And the
truth is, I had no reaſon to complain;
he cauſed me to be preſently carried
aboard his Galley, and gave me his
own Cabbin, and never came into it
till we arrived at <hi>Biſerti.</hi> Our Voyage
was not long; we had a great Calm,
and having in three days gain'd the
Cape of <hi>Carthage,</hi> we got ſafe on the
fourth into the Port of <hi>Biſerti;</hi> where
being landed, I was put into a kind of
Litter carried by a Camel, and ſo
carried to <hi>Tunis,</hi> under a Guard of five
or ſix Horſe-men. I fell to the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s
ſhare, who joyful of it, made a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of me to his Lady.</p>
               <p>Thus you have, dear <hi>Aſſen,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of a Maid born of an illuſtrious
Family, and to a plentiful Eſtate, as
you very well know. The <hi>Turk</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perfectly acquainted with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of her Family, could not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
admire the ſtrangeneſs of her
fate, and aſſured her of his beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103330:111"/>
to make her more happy for the
future, and to gain her liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to her Countrey, which ſhe had
no cauſe to ſcruple; That the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
at <hi>Naples</hi> was a diſaſter to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied
by her Marriage with the Son
of the <hi>Vice-roy,</hi> who doubtleſs would
be glad of it: That if it ſhould fall out
otherwiſe, ſhe had many excellencies
and advantages to comfort her againſt
all the diſaſters of her life: That her
misfortune in the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Court
could not be laid to her fault, but the
infamous Treaſon of a man, who ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or later was ſure to be puniſhed for
his Crime. In a word, after long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to this purpoſe, he renewed
proteſtations of his readineſs to ſerve
her, and to leave no ſtone unturned
to free her from her miſery: That he
had many good Friends about the <hi>Dey,</hi>
and was very well aſſured he could
not take any ſiniſter reſolution againſt
her, but he muſt have notice of it
time enough to prevent, or eſcape it.
<hi>Laura</hi> was not wanting to her duty of
gratitude, for theſe ſignal teſtimonies
of Affection to her Family and her;
and could not ſufficiently thank Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:103330:111"/>
that in the midſt of her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
ſhe had met a Man ſo devoted
to her Service, and of unqueſtionable
fidelity.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Aſſen</hi> left her a little comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt the malignity of her deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and promiſed to come again,
and paſs part of the night following
with her, being obliged that day to
wait on the <hi>Dey,</hi> to ſee how Matters
were carried.</p>

in the preſent conjuncture, to be found
to have held correſpondence with

The thought of this kept him
from ſleeping; but at length the <hi>Moor</hi>
arriv'd, and having given him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
what had ſtaid him ſo long,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:103330:112"/>
diſſipated his fears, and quieted his

and as ſoon as it was night, ſent

he to him, with ſome diſorder in
his looks,</hi> what think you of me
when I tell you I intend to lye at
<hi>Tunis</hi> to night. I muſt tell you Sir,
<hi>ſays</hi> Romadan <hi>the Maſter of the
Gallies,</hi> I think you too wiſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
your ſelf to that hazard without
aſſurance from our Friends there, that
they will open you the Gates; nor do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you can take pleaſure in putting
your Country to Fire and Sword. You
underſtand me not, <hi>replies the</hi> Baſſa,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:103330:113"/>
when I tell you I deſign to lye at <hi>Tunis</hi>
to night, 'tis not to execute my juſt
vengeance againſt it; I am too ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Blood of my friends, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
my ſelf by night, when I cannot
diſtinguiſh my Friend from my Foe;
I ſpeak of going thither, only attended
by a <hi>Moor</hi> I have here, to ſpeak
with <hi>Aſſen,</hi> to learn what paſs'd at
the <hi>Divan,</hi> to enter the Caſtle, ſee <hi>Laura,</hi>
and return, Romadan <hi>heard him with
that attention and ſilence, which ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
expreſs'd his wonder and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment.
He thought it unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to uſe reaſons to diſſuade
him from a deſign ſo raſh and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant.
The</hi> Baſſa <hi>who read in
his looks the ſubſtance of what he
might have ſaid to him.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
<hi>ſays he,</hi> I expoſe my-ſelf to ſome
hazard, and that it is impudence, or
(you may call it) folly to run ſuch
a riſque; but that matters not, and
to eaſe you of the fear of being charg'd
for not telling me what you think of
the buſineſs, I declare to you, I ſent
not for you to have your advice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I ought to put it in execution or
not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that's already reſolved. The
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:103330:113"/>
ſtory they tell me of my Wife, that ſhe
is gone away with the Chriſtian, and
that <hi>Laura</hi> is at home with the <hi>Dey,</hi>
are the things that prevail with me,
nothing but a ſight of her, can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
me 'tis true; the more I think
of it, the more it perplexes me: I
would be ſatisfied at leaſt how the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
was carried, and there is no
knowing it but by the Slave. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
were the reaſons I have told you,
not ſufficient to make you approve of the
deſign, I cannot refuſe an irreſiſtible paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſo ſmall a compliance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> having ſaid this, held
his peace, in expectation of <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>'s
anſwer, who having for ſome
time fixt his eyes on the ground,
lift them up on the ſudden, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>God preſerve you Sir from the
miſchief you run into; but if it be
ſo ordained, you cannot avoid your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny.</hi>
Then he ſhewed him the many
obſtacles and dangers he ſhould meet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with before he could get to <hi>Aſſen.</hi>
How impoſſible it was to effect ſome
of the things he deſired; that he could
not enter the Caſtle without being
diſcovered, and that for a ſight of a
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:103330:114"/>
Chriſtian Girl his Slave, he hazarded
the ruin of himſelf, his friend, and
his party, that a little patience would
make him maſter of his deſigns
without pains or danger. The <hi>Baſſa,</hi>
inſtead of being perſwaded by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madan</hi>'s
reaſons, expreſs'd by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
a viſible impatience to hear
a diſcourſe ſo unneceſſary and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
after the reſolution he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
His paſſion tempted him to
try his fortune, and deprived him
of patience as incompatible with
love.</p>
               <p>The night being pretty well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
he diſguiſed himſelf the beſt
he could; and having given <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>
ſuch orders as were neceſſary,
that his abſence might not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
he went away with the <hi>Moor,</hi>
who led him a way he came the
night before: they entred the Town
without meeting any, but being heard
by <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s Houſe, they fell among
a company of People belonging to
the <hi>Divan,</hi> the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s ſworn Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
But by good fortune he
paſs'd undiſcovered, for which he
was obliged to the <hi>Moor,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:103330:114"/>
a witty fellow, told thoſe who
would have ſtaid them, that he was
one ſick of the Plague, whom he
had in charge to carry to the Peſt-houſe.
This made them ſtand at a
diſtance, and give them free paſſage;
though that diſeaſe be not ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
there as in other places, being
very common and ordinary in thoſe
parts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was glad of ſo eaſie an
eſcape; and when he got to <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s,
he rewarded the <hi>Moor</hi> according to
the merit of ſo conſiderable a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>Aſſen <hi>was abroad at the</hi> Baſſa<hi>'s
arrival, but was extreamly ſurprized
at his return to ſee the</hi> Baſſa <hi>there.</hi>
Ah! Sir, <hi>ſaid he, embracing him,</hi> is
it poſſible you would hazard your ſelf
thus? it might have been excuſable
in a hare-brain'd young fellow, who
had nothing to loſe but his life, but
for a man of your prudence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
(being the ſecond Perſon of the
Kingdom) to come, without deſign per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
at leaſt without neceſſity to
throw your ſelf into your Enemies
hands, and expoſe your life to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:103330:115"/>
dangers. This Sir, how ill ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you take it, is a thing I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pardon you: For Sir, <hi>adds he,</hi> what
could have oblig'd you to hazard your ſelf
thus?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> fell a laughing, and
taking all in good part that was
ſpoken by <hi>Aſſen,</hi> whoſe kindneſs
he was aſſured of, asked him if
he had ever been in love, and
whether he knew not that love had
made the greateſt of men guilty
of faults, and that thoſe faults had
always their pardon: <hi>But Sir,</hi> ſaid
<hi>Aſſen, what have you to do with love?
is it not</hi> Laura <hi>you are in love with?
and is not ſhe in the Caſtle? Yes,</hi>
replies the <hi>Baſſa, but being in your
cuſtody, it cannot be impoſſible to
have a ſight of her. Aſſen</hi> would
have diſſuaded him from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
as the moſt extravagant and
raſh he had ever enterprized;
but prevailed no more than the
maſter of the Gallies. Strength of
reaſon and fear of dangers are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles
too weak to ſtop the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of a paſſionate Lover. Love feeds
upon hope, and death is not half
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:103330:115"/>
ſo formidable as the happineſs of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Miſtreſs is charming and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.
The <hi>Baſſa</hi> reſolved, whatever
befell him, to go into the Caſtle. But
it was impoſſible to do it by Night,
the Gates being then open only for
<hi>Aſſen,</hi> and others the <hi>Dey</hi>'s principal
Officers. So that it muſt of neceſſity
be between Nine in the Morning and
Six at Night; and the ſtrict Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they uſed in that time would have
cool'd any Man but the <hi>Baſſa</hi> from
proceeding in ſo deſperate a deſign.
But thoſe <hi>Southern</hi> Lovers are too hot
to be cold by Obſtructions that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
invincible to others. Aſſen <hi>told
him, he had no better way than to put
him into one of the Meal-ſacks he had
order to ſend into the Caſtle on the morrow
in a Cart.</hi> The <hi>Baſſa</hi> was content,
and thought it an excellent invention;
and that there could be no danger in
it at all. Having reſolved on this,
they paſt part of the Night in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the preſent poſture of Affairs,
what paſt at the <hi>Divan,</hi> what deſigns
the <hi>Dey</hi> had, what Forces were raiſed,
and ſuch other particulars as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the <hi>Baſſa</hi> to know. After
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103330:116"/>
this, they went to Bed, where <hi>Aſſen</hi>
took his reſt; but as for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he
had no mind to ſleep, he dreamt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the happineſs of ſeeing the
fair <hi>Laura</hi> on the morrow.</p>
               <p>At length the day appear'd, and the
Cart was loaded with Meal-ſacks for
the Caſtle, and among them the Bag
with the <hi>Baſſa</hi> in't, was ſo plac'd, that
he lay pretty conveniently. The <hi>Moor</hi>
led the Horſes, and <hi>Aſſen</hi> walked at
ſome diſtance before; the Caſtle-gate
was opened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no ſearch made in
the Cart, the <hi>Dey</hi>'s Secretary was Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally
Convoy to. They paſt freely
to the Magazin of Victuals, where
ſeveral <hi>Moors</hi> inſtantly attended to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load;
but <hi>Aſſen</hi> very dextrouſly got
rid of them, ſending them away on
ſeveral Errands. This was well for
the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who having been almoſt
ſtifled in the Bag, had untyed it, to
take a little breath, and had certainly
been diſcovered, had thoſe <hi>Moors</hi> ſtaid
in the Magazin. <hi>Aſſen</hi> left him there
all that day, not thinking it fit to
bring him to <hi>Laura</hi> till Night; ſo
that he locked him up there, took
the Key in his Pocket, and went
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:103330:116"/>
to the <hi>Dey</hi>'s Palace to learn what
News.</p>
               <p>Poor <hi>Laura</hi> being all day alone,
thought it very long, and with great
impatience wiſh'd for the Night, that
ſhe might have a ſight of her dear
Friend <hi>Aſſen.</hi> At length the hour
came he uſually viſited her, but no
news of <hi>Aſſen,</hi> which troubled her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly.
At laſt, ſhe heard the Door
open, and riſing to meet him, <hi>Did you
but know,</hi> Aſſen, ſays ſhe, <hi>the Sufferings I
lye under in the condition I am in, having
no Friend but you, you would not have
made me pine ſo long for a ſight of you;
for in good truth, I am half dead with
ſtaying for you. Aſſen</hi> fell a laughing,
and turning about to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who
followed him, here is one, <hi>ſays he,</hi> knows
how to bring you to Life again, and
I doubt not but for his ſake you will
pardon my long ſtay. <hi>Aſſen</hi> had not
told the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Ancient intimate
Acquaintance he had with <hi>Laura;</hi> this
made him interrupt her ſo quickly,
to make her take notice of him. But
he was ſo white all over with lying in
the Meal-ſack, that ſhe took him for
one of <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s Men; but ſeeing him
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:103330:117"/>
laugh, ſhe viewed him more narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and knew him, <hi>Oh Heavens! is it
you, Sir?</hi> ſays ſhe. <hi>Oh! whither are
you come in ſearch of an unfortunate
wretch, which hath already given you
ſo much trouble, and too great cauſe of
complaint!</hi> It is eaſie, anſwers the <hi>Baſſa,</hi>
to pardon thoſe we love. But is it
poſſible you are here, and that the
<hi>Sultaneſs</hi> is gone away in your ſtead?
tell me, was it ſhe that betray'd you,
or was it <hi>Alexander?</hi> I know not what
to think of it; but when I conſider his
proceedings in this laſt adventure, I
cannot ſuſpect him treacherous. For
'twas not his fault I diſcovered not the
<hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> it was I hindred him to take
off her <hi>Barnus,</hi> that I might ſee her,
However, if ſhe loved you, I am ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
Reveng'd of you, for you
have loſt more than I, and if he was
falſe to you, you may comfort your
ſelf with the aſſurance of the affection
of a Perſon not ſo unworthy of your
favour as he was. Theſe laſt words
put <hi>Laura</hi> to the bluſh; but making
no anſwer to them, <hi>As for me, Sir,</hi>
ſaid ſhe, <hi>I neither loſt a Lover in him,
nor have cauſe to charge him with falſhood,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:103330:117"/>
but muſt lay on my ill Fortune all the blame
of my being left behind him.</hi> You ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
me much, replies the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and
make me conclude you an excellent
Diſſembler, or my ſelf the moſt abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Man in the World. <hi>Call to mind,
Sir,</hi> ſays Laura, <hi>what I told you ſo often,
that my affection for</hi> Alexander <hi>was very
indifferent; and to be taken off when I
pleaſed. The Ladies of your Country dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
very much from thoſe of Chriſtendom
in their courſe of Love; yours are very
ſuſceptible, eaſily take impreſſion, and are
equally unconſtant. Ours are more ſhie
of engaging in Love, but when engaged,
their love is more laſting. You believed
me a</hi> Turk, <hi>and ſeveral times did me
Honours, due only to the</hi> Sultaneſs, <hi>whom
you often miſtook for me.</hi> The <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi>
replies the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> much ſurpriz'd at the
News. <hi>The very ſame, Sir,</hi> ſays Laura,
<hi>for 'tis now time to diſabuſe you; and ſince
I may juſtly glory to have made of my
Paſſion for</hi> Alexander <hi>a Sacrifice to her
Love, I may now be allowed to declare it,
when ſhe is out of all danger of inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
by my owning it.</hi> The <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi>
Sir, continued ſhe, more affected than
I with the good qualities of that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:103330:118"/>
looked upon him as worthy of
her Love. But permit me to ſay, you
may thank your ſelf for it, who firſt
ſought out the means to gain the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of finding a Gallant for your
Lady. You may believe, replies the
<hi>Baſſa,</hi> I deſign'd no ſuch matter, yet
I pardon it in a Woman I had no
kindneſs for. But the falſeneſs of the
Chriſtian was unpardonably baſe, who
beſides the regard he ſhould have had
for the daily favours I did him, ought
to have obſerved at leaſt the Laws of
Hoſpitality. The <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> Sir, ſaid
<hi>Laura,</hi> had a Beauty of power to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the moſt upright of Men; and
had ſhe been anothers Wife, I durſt
not have undertaken for your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
in the caſe. I had a deſire to
ſee the Chriſtian; you brought him
into the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> ſhe had a ſight of
him: He was handſom, ſhe loved
him, and told him ſo; what could he
do? The <hi>Baſſa</hi> could not forbear
laughing at her relating the ſtory.
And 'tis all the concern the <hi>Turks</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
for the falſeneſs of their Wives,
eſpecially thoſe they have no love for,
having <hi>Seraglio's</hi> well ſtor'd, and the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:103330:118"/>
priviledge to change Wives at pleaſure.
The <hi>Baſſa</hi> very patiently took the loſs
of his <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> and told <hi>Laura</hi> it
muſt be her fault if he ſhould not be
now more happy than ever. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Slave, very ſenſible how uſeful he
might be to her in the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture,
thought it unſeaſonable to
give him a repulſe, but reſolv'd to
manage to advantage ſo good an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
ſhe told him only, that was not
a time to make Love. <hi>You ſee, Sir,</hi>
continues ſhe, <hi>I am here in a Priſon, I
know not how to get out of.</hi> But I know
how to do it, replies the <hi>Baſſa</hi> haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily;
and if within three days you be
not at Liberty, I'le fill the Streets of
this Town with the Bodies of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.
<hi>Ah Sir! anſwers</hi> Laura,
<hi>that were the way not to ſave me, but to
haſten my Death. And it beeing known
I am the cauſe of this Diſorder, you may
eaſily gueſs what Mercy I ſhall find. If
you have, Sir, any value for my Life,
ſince it may be ſaved without ſhedding
Blood, and that matters are now in a
way of accomodation, let me intreat you
not to think of thoſe horrible extremities.</hi>
Believe me, ſays the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> 'tis their
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:103330:119"/>
deſign to amuſe me, till the Troops
they expect from <hi>Tripoly</hi> be arriv'd;
but I ſhall take Order for that, and
if you will prevent inconveniences
that may happen, you muſt reſolve to
get out hence this Evening, and go
along with me. <hi>Get out hence, Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies</hi>
Laura, <hi>and how ſhall it be done, out
of a Caſtle where I am under Guard, and
have ſo many Gates to paſs?</hi> You ſee,
ſays the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> ſpight of all thoſe Guards,
and thoſe Gates, I have entred, and
reſolve to get out again; and may not
you ſo too? <hi>But, Sir,</hi> ſays Laura, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
I am a Woman, and however diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed,
may be eaſily diſcovered by my
gate, or my ſtature; and the leaſt obſtacle
we meet with, will put me into ſuch a
fright, will infallibly ruin both you and
me.</hi> Aſſen fortified her Reaſons with
his, and abſolutely condemned the
Enterprize propoſed, as expoſing the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> and her to apparent danger of
inevitable ruin. You ſhall ſee, <hi>Sir,</hi>
adds he, by the difficulty you and I
ſhall find to get out, the trouble we
ſhould have to get a Woman along
with us. I am of Opinion with the
reſt of your Friends, 'tis beſt to come
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:103330:119"/>
to an accommodation. The Troops
from <hi>Tripoly</hi> will be long a coming,
and if you keep the Town ſtreightly
block'd up a few days longer, you will
oblige the People to Petition the <hi>Dey</hi>
to make Peace, which we of your
Party will not fail to help forward:
And the <hi>Dey</hi> being of a timerous irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
temper, will be glad of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to come to an Agreement.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> though more inclin'd to
violent than moderate actions, yielded
this time to the perſwaſion of two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who were the deareſt to him of
any, and whoſe intereſt he knew it
was not give him any Counſel to
his diſadvantage. He told them he
would ſtay a Week longer, but if in
that time neither the Threats nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
of his Friends ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
he would make uſe of ſome Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem
to reduce the Town; and if
that failed, he would employ all his
Force to bring the <hi>Dey</hi> to Reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſen</hi> was eaſily induced to aſſent to
all this, knowing the Town was ill
provided of Corn, and that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
began already to be ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and murmured at the exigences
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:103330:120"/>
they were reduc'd to, and not without
cauſe, although it was given out theſe
murmurs were raiſed by thoſe of the
<hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Party, in favour of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſhifting his Diſcourſe from
the general affairs to his private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
deſired <hi>Laura</hi> to give him a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
account of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Amour
with the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> which <hi>Laura</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the moſt civil expreſſions ſhe
could, not forgetting the Adventure
in the Chamber of Repoſe, where
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had miſtaken his Lady for
her: the <hi>Baſſa</hi> could hardly believe
this, and was more vext at it, than all
the reſt of the ſtory. Then ſhe told
him the deſign the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> and ſhe
had to go both aboard, and why the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs</hi>
had put her ſelf into the Basket
without acquainting <hi>Alexander</hi> with
her intentions. I do verily believe it,
ſaid the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> for I was in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
when the Basket was brought in,
and feign'd it was you; and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
<hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould do you the
leaſt violence. I gave Order my ſelf
to have it carried aboard, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>Alexander</hi> went along with
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:103330:120"/>
it to the Port. <hi>Aſſen</hi> and <hi>Laura</hi> could
not forbear laughing. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> told
them he was as ready to laugh at it as
they, but that <hi>Laura</hi> made one of the
party, and had a hand in putting the
trick on him. For as for his Wife,
the hatred he bore her Father, and the
ſmall kindneſs he had for her, were
ſufficient aſſurances he was not ſorry
to be rid of her. But he expected ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
from <hi>Laura</hi> for the ill Offices
ſhe had done him; none being more
guilty than ſhe of the Treaſon of the
<hi>Sultaneſs.</hi> Raillery made up the reſt
of the Diſcourſe, and the Night being
far gone, <hi>Aſſen,</hi> not affected as the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> with the Charms of <hi>Laura,</hi> told
him it was time to withdraw. The
<hi>Baſſa</hi> intreated him to ſtay a little
longer, and ſaid, while Night laſted,
he thought there was no danger; and
that he had not taken ſo much pains
to enjoy that lovely Girl only for a
moment. At laſt, <hi>Laura</hi> acquainted
him with the fear ſhe was in, having
been ſo long together, which height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the danger; giving the Guards
cauſe to ſuſpect ſo long an interview,
and to ſtop his paſſage if he ſtaid
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:103330:121"/>
much longer. The <hi>Baſſa,</hi> to ſatisfie
her, retired, making new proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a Paſſionate Lover, who
would rather periſh a thouſand times,
than not ſee her delivered from the
hands of her Enemies by an Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Peace, or a bloody War.</p>
               <p>A new invention muſt be thought
of for the getting out of the Caſtle,
where the Examination was as ſtrict
almoſt at going out as at entrance.
<hi>Aſſen</hi> led the <hi>Baſſa</hi> back again to the
Magazin, and having daubed his
Face ſufficiently with Meal, laid a
parcel of empty Sacks on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
without any diſturbance, paſt
all the Guards with him, as a Servant
of <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s. It was not yet day; and
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> thought it fit to make uſe of
his time, to return before Morning to
the Camp, where he thought his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
very neceſſary. <hi>Aſſen</hi> bore him
company to the Walls of the Town,
and having help'd him over, took his
leave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laura</hi> longed extreamly to hear
what was become of him, and could
not reſt till ſhe ſaw <hi>Aſſen. Cheer you,
Madam,</hi> ſaid he, as he entred her
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:103330:121"/>
Chamber. <hi>The</hi> Baſſa <hi>is out of danger,
and all will be well. Alas! dear Aſſen,</hi>
anſwers ſhe, <hi>peradventure things may
go well, but not for me.</hi> You will be
certainly ſet at Liberty, replies <hi>Aſſen,</hi>
and in very few days. <hi>Yes,</hi> ſays <hi>Laura,
I ſhall be ſet at Liberty from the</hi> Dey,
<hi>to be made Priſoner to the</hi> Baſſa, <hi>whoſe
Paſſion will render my Impriſonment a
thouſand times more unfortunate than
my preſent reſtraint. Heard you not
what he ſaid? And what will become of
me, when in his power? Ah,</hi> Aſſen,
adds ſhe, with Tears in her Eyes, <hi>I
did but too clearly fore-ſee the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
that did threaten me, unleſs Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
divert them. A Maid of my Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
had better die a Priſoner, than buy
her Liberty at that rate. Aſſen</hi> ſighing
for pity, anſwered, he had already
thought of all ſhe ſaid, and that it
was not without cauſe, he ſo much
oppoſed the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s deſigns of taking
her away that Night. That he could
have found means enough for it, had
he thought it for her advantage;
But that he reſolved to repreſent
to her firſt, how much harder it
would be for her to get out of the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103330:122"/>
                  <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s hands than the <hi>Dey</hi>'s. And
that he was very glad ſhe had firſt
ſpoken of it; that he would keep his
word with her, to do her all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
he could, to help her back into
her Countrey; that he was very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
it was as much as his Fortune
was worth, and perhaps his Life;
both which he muſt hazard in the
caſe: but that he never ſcrupled to
expoſe the one, or the other, but was
ready to ſacrifice both for the intereſt
of a Family he was more indebted
to; and that he was very willing to
return among the Chriſtians, whoſe
Religion and Cuſtoms he loved far
better than thoſe of his Countrey.</p>
               <p>This uſhered in a long Diſcourſe of
the Buſineſs in hand; the Concluſion
was, that <hi>Aſſen</hi> ſhould uſe the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of his Friends with the <hi>Dey,</hi> to
perſwade him to ſet <hi>Laura</hi> at liberty,
and ſend her back into her Country,
to prevent the Confuſion to be feared,
if he ſhould be obliged to reſtore
her to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and ſee her ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
his Daughter St. <hi>Room.</hi> That,
if this would not take, he ſhould
try the utmoſt extremities, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:103330:122"/>
the getting her on board
a <hi>Brigandine</hi> of his, which ſhould
be made ready to carry her away
with the firſt Opportunity. Poor
<hi>Laura,</hi> deeply ſenſible of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
ſhe had to ſo honeſt a
Man, told him more than once,
he might aſſure himſelf, ſhe would
not be ungrateful for ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Services; and that he ſhould
never fail of a Friend while ſhe
lived, but might command any
thing in the power of her Family.
<hi>Aſſen,</hi> who needed no promiſes to
perſwade him in this particular, took
his leave; and went to ſpend the
reſt of the Night in thinking of the
buſineſs, for which his inclination
and gratitude were motives ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
powerful to engage his utmoſt
endeavours. He ſlept not a wink,
but as ſoon as it was day, he went to
viſit thoſe he thought to make uſe of,
to ſpeak to the <hi>Dey.</hi> Of theſe, <hi>Beyran-Aga,</hi>
the <hi>Dey</hi>'s Favourite, was one, in
whom he placed moſt confidence, as
moſt favouring the Chriſtians, and his
particular Friend. He found him
ready to ſerve him, but at the ſame
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:103330:123"/>
time, he deſired the favour of ſeeing
the Slave. <hi>Aſſen</hi> fearing the effects
of her Beauty on a young man, as
the <hi>Aga,</hi> might obſtruct the deſign,
was ſo far from expreſſing a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to comply with him, that he
ſtrained his invention to find the moſt
ſpecious pretences to divert him. <hi>Bey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
took it for a denyal of his Requeſt,
and was ſomewhat diſpleaſed. He
thought <hi>Aſſen</hi> was in Love with her,
and told him only, he would do him
all the Service in his power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
the <hi>Dey</hi> to give the fair Slave
her Liberty. But the truth is, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
it but coldly; ſo that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Dey</hi> believed, a time might
might come he might give <hi>Laura</hi> in
exchange for his Daughter, or that
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> loving her as he did (in caſe
of neceſſity) to make Peace with
him, would for her ſake grant him
better Conditions, he was not of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s Friends, who adviſed
him to be rid of her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſen</hi> much troubled his project had
failed, reſolved to put himſelf into a
condition of ſtealing her away, helping
to effect it as a thing depending intirely
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:103330:123"/>
on himſelf. <hi>Beyran</hi> whoſe deſires to ſee
<hi>Laura</hi> increaſed, by the difficulty he
found of obtaining it from <hi>Aſſen,</hi> would
not ask it of him the ſecond time; but
went ſtraight to the <hi>Dey,</hi> to beg leave
to ſee her, under pretence of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from her, the truth of what was
reported concerning the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> and
the Chriſtian, who was fled. The
<hi>Dey</hi> too well aſſured of the amour
betwixt them, by the evidence of the
<hi>Moor,</hi> who carried the Basket; and
of ſeveral Women of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi>
and other Circumſtances little needed
further Information. But <hi>Beyran</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Favourite, and thinking his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
proceeded meerly from curioſity
of ſeeing the fair Slave, he granted it;
and gave order to <hi>Laura</hi>'s Guards to
let him ſee her.</p>
               <p>This Favourite had heard the Slave
was very handſom, but could not
learn how long ſhe had been at <hi>Tunis,</hi>
nor how taken; fortune having ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it, that he addreſſed his inquiry
to Perſons that could give him no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
account.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:103330:124"/>
                  <hi>Aſſen</hi> had been buſie that day, arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his <hi>Brigandine</hi> under pretence of
ſending her a cruiſing, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his People, being almoſt all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Slaves, to be ready at the Cape of
<hi>Carthage</hi> to ſail with the firſt Orders.
<hi>Laura</hi> was diſpos'd the night before,
to venture paſſing the Sea in that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Veſſel: The weather was fair, the
Seaſon pleaſant, and they hoped, if
the wind ſerved, to reach the Iſle of
St. <hi>Peter</hi> in two days. <hi>Aſſen</hi> goes to
viſit her, and finds her trembling for
fear: <hi>Madam,</hi> ſays he, this is not a
time to tremble, but to arm your ſelf
with Reſolution and Courage. <hi>I am a
Woman, Aſſen,</hi> anſwers ſhe, <hi>and one unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
enough to have cauſe to fear the worſt,
both for you and my ſelf. Aſſen</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to hearten her, ſaying, ſhe
ſhould be ſet at liberty on the morrow,
and that he would take her out of the
Caſtle without difficulty or danger.
<hi>Laura</hi> was in fear ſtill, and ſo much
diſordered, ſhe knew not where to
begin to provide for her eſcape; when
on the ſudden, ſhe heard her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
door open, and turning about,
ſaw a man enter, which frightned her
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:103330:124"/>
ſo (apprehending a diſcovery) that
ſhe fell in a Swoon with theſe words
in her mouth; <hi>Ah! Lord we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done!
Aſſen</hi> extreamly ſurprized at the
accident, and the <hi>Moor</hi> foreſeeing the
<hi>Aga,</hi> knew not what to think might
occaſion his company thither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
it could not be, but in behalf
of the <hi>Dey.</hi> Both <hi>Beyran</hi> and he were
buſie about <hi>Laura,</hi> holding her up, but
of the two <hi>Beyran</hi> ſeemed moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd.
He viewed and reviewed her
Countenance, her ſtature, her hair,
her hands, with a diligence and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
too extraordinary, not to ſurprize
<hi>Aſſen,</hi> to whom he had not yet ſaid
a word. But all on the ſudden, giving
free paſſage to a thouſand ſighs, his
ſurprize had ſtopt or ſuſpended:
<hi>Oh Heavens!</hi> Cries he as a man tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
<hi>'tis ſhe, 'tis ſhe, my Dear</hi> Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.
And at the ſame time falling
down at her knees, embraced them
with that tenderneſs and height of
affection, you would have thought
he would have died there for joy.
Theſe words and tranſports, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him call her <hi>Eleanor,</hi> ſurprized
<hi>Aſſen,</hi> he knew not whether it was the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:103330:125"/>
                  <hi>Aga</hi> he ſaw there, or ſome other that
had borrowed his ſhape. <hi>Laura</hi> the
mean while was pretty well come to
her ſelf, and angry at ſeeing at her
feet a man ſhe knew on no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
but that the ſight of him had
almoſt coſt her life, ſtruggled the beſt
ſhe could to get from him But the <hi>Aga,</hi>
with eyes full of tears, and not able to
ſay a word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> held her ſo much the faſter.
<hi>Laura</hi> extreamly aſtoniſh'd, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſays
ſhe, <hi>if this be an effect of pity, you have
for the fortune of an unfortunate Slave,
I have done ill to be ſo much alarm'd
at the ſight of you. But I thought you
came on a deſign contrary to my wiſhes.</hi>
You little know, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſays the
<hi>Aga,</hi> with a languiſhing tone, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
proſtrate before you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laura,</hi> feigning ſhe knew the voice,
fixt her eyes on him to take a
better view: <hi>Heavens!</hi> cries ſhe, <hi>what
do I ſee, is it poſſible it ſhould be he?</hi>
With that ſhe falls into a ſecond
Swoun into the arms of <hi>Aſſen,</hi> who
much troubled at it, intreated the
<hi>Aga</hi> to withdraw a little, fearing
the ſight of him might be the death of
the poor Maid, not knowing who he
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:103330:125"/>
was. <hi>What ſay you,</hi> ſays the <hi>Aga?
Alas! ſhe knows me too well, being the
ſole cauſe of all her misfortunes. Aſſen,</hi>
I know you be honeſt, and my very
good Friend, and therefore I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
no danger in telling you, ſhe is
a Perſon, whoſe Merits as well as Birth
make her worthy your Care; and one
for whom I would loſe a thouſand
Lives to ſave her from harm. <hi>Aſſen</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, fell from one aſtoniſhment to
another, and would have fain cleared
the Myſtery of the Adventure, but was
ſo buſied with endeavouring to fetch
<hi>Laura</hi> again, that he thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to reſpite the Diſcourſe to a
fitter Opportunity. The <hi>Aga</hi> extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerned, aſſiſted him with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
diligence; and <hi>Laura</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to take breath, <hi>Aſſen</hi> asked
her, if ſhe deſired that <hi>Turk</hi> ſhould
quit the Room, and told her, he was
the <hi>Aga,</hi> the <hi>Dey</hi>'s Favourite, he had
told her of. She making no anſwer,
turned her dying Eyes towards the
<hi>Aga,</hi> and with a languiſhing voice,
<hi>Ah cruel,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>What Fate brought
thee hither to perſecute me to Death?
Beyran</hi> could not hear that Language,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:103330:126"/>
without falling the ſecond time at her
feet, and waſhing them with a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of tears without ſpeaking a word:
<hi>Leave me Traytor,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>leave me,
that I may dye in quiet, rather than be
deluded again with thy tears, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully
as they are, have but too ſtrong
an effect on my feeble heart. Aſſen</hi> the
ſpectator of ſo tender a Scene, having
freſh in memory the ſtory of <hi>Laura,</hi>
with <hi>Marqueſs Hippolito,</hi> and <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo,</hi>
knew not what to think of it.
The <hi>Aga</hi> was a Renegado arrived at
<hi>Tunis</hi> a year before; and <hi>Aſſen</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
he might be one of thoſe Lovers,
and rather the <hi>Marqueſs Hippolito,</hi> than
<hi>Don Alphonſo. Laura</hi> in the height of
her anger, having expreſs'd a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for him, which ſhe could not
have retained, but for one ſhe had
loved. He had a deſire to know the
bottom of the buſineſs, but thought
it unſeaſonable to interrupt them, and
was in hopes this Scene would end in
a diſcovery of the Myſtery. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf ſtraightned in time, and
that they were fallen into a deep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
uſing only expreſſions of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
ſighs. He thought fit to ſay to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:103330:126"/>
the <hi>Aga</hi> (whom he ſufficiently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
no Enemy of <hi>Laura</hi>'s) had my
<q>former acquaintance with you been
too ſmall to give me hopes, you
would not croſs the deſign we have
in hand; yet Sir, what I have but
now ſeen and heard, were enough
to perſwade me, you will be ſo far
from obſtructing it, that I aſſure my
ſelf, we ſhall have your aſſiſtance to
compaſs it. By my requeſt to you
yeſterday, you know my endeavours
for the Liberty of this Slave: thoſe
proved ineffectual but I have
thought of other means, which if
you pleaſe, we will execute this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
You know well enough the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> is paſſionately in love with her,
if we give him time to ſee her once
more, it will not be in our power to
get her out of his hands: If a War
be reſolved on, it will be equally
difficult to ſave her: And who knows
but ſhe may be put to death here,
the People being already extreamly
incenſed againſt her, as the cauſe of
all this diſorder; and upon the noiſe
of a War, they will be too apt to
make her a Sacrifice. Let us be wiſe
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:103330:127"/>
in time, all things are in readineſs,
and if you will make uſe of them
preſently, I do warrant the ſucceſs.</q>
The <hi>Aga</hi> looked upon him as a man
newly out of a Trance, and oppreſs'd
with grief. Let us do, <hi>Dear Aſſen,</hi>
ſays he, whatever you think fit; for in
the condition that I am in, I am not
capable to give you any reaſonable
Counſel, but will do all you ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of me, and imploy my whole
power in the Caſtle to favour your
deſign, and help this Lady out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
<hi>Ingrateful man,</hi> anſwers <hi>Laura,
do you ſpeak of helping me out of danger?
you who are the cauſe of all my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
Go wretch, go, I'le never be ſo
much obliged to you, but chuſe rather to
dye here in Priſon, than not to have ſtill
juſt cauſe to reproach you.</hi> This is not
time, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſays <hi>Aſſen,</hi> (whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
were too groſs to apprehend
the delicacy of her Sentiments) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
any help, eſpecially the <hi>Aga</hi>'s,
who being Captain of the Guard, can
give order for opening us the Gates,
when we pleaſe, without ſtop or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.
<hi>What confidence can we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi>
anſwers ſhe, <hi>in the moſt perfidious
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:103330:127"/>
of men? No, no,</hi> Aſſen, <hi>were it poſſible
for him to be more honeſt on this occaſion,
than he was faithful in his love, I will
rather dye than make uſe of his aſſiſtance,
after the double Treaſon he committed
againſt me: The very thought of it,</hi> adds
ſhe with tears, <hi>is more cruel than Death.</hi>
'Tis true, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſays <hi>Beyran,</hi> with
the moſt moving action imaginable:
I have deſerved death, yet peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
I am not ſo guilty as you think
me. <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> and <hi>Clarice,</hi> who
betrayed us both, have expiated their
Crimes with their Death, and if mine
muſt be puniſhed with equal rigor, my
life is at your diſpoſe. You ſee me in
a Country, <hi>Madam,</hi> whither nothing
but deſpair on the news of your death,
occaſioned my coming; for after dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
ſearch of the way you had taken,
having been told you were embarqued
for <hi>Barcellona,</hi> I took the ſame road, and
arrived at that City, where ſoon after
it was reported, the Veſſel you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
in was caſt away, and not
one Perſon ſaved. Never was grief
equal to mine, every one pittied me;
nor had I eſcaped death, but that
Heaven moved at my tears, reſerved
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:103330:128"/>
me the happineſs of ſeeing you again,
to juſtifie my ſelf before you, and not
dye in your ill opinion, the thing next
the loſs of you, I was moſt of all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for. The life I have ſince led,
hath been full of afflictions ſufficient
to expiate any Crime, if not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt you. <hi>Laura</hi> took pleaſure
to hear him, and heartily wiſhed to
find it true. He was not ſo much to
blame as ſhe believed. But the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
was ſo apparent againſt him,
that the very thought of what ſhe had
ſeen, made her more angry than ever,
ſo that ſhe commanded him out of
her ſight, bid him quit the Town, and
never ſee her more. Poor <hi>Beyran</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill on his knees, endeavoured with
the kindeſt and moſt tender expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
imaginable to pacifie her. <hi>Aſſen,</hi>
who by this time was ſufficiently aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
he was the <hi>Marquiſs Hippolito</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of <hi>Beyran,</hi> moved with
his tears, took his part againſt <hi>Laura,</hi>
whom he thought not inflexible, and
intreated her to have ſome regard to
the penitence of ſo tender a Lover,
ready to deliver her out of all her
troubles, and free her from Slavery
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103330:128"/>
which he had occaſioned; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
without any fault of his, and ſo
againſt his will. But <hi>Laura</hi> more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
than before (at leaſt in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance)
anſwered, ſhe valued not her
Slavery, but would chooſe rather to
return to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> than go away
with a man ſhe hated worſe than
Death. This troubled <hi>Aſſen,</hi> but he
could not deſpair to ſee the fair Lady
yield at laſt to the pains and tears of a
Lover, though ſhe appear'd unwilling
to be overcome by the perſwaſions of
a Friend.</p>
               <l>For anger in a Ladies heart,</l>
               <l>Is but ſhort liv'd, though it may be ſmart,</l>
               <l>Againſt their Crimes who have the Art</l>

               <l>Kneel, ſigh, look ſad, and drop a tear;</l>
               <l>But they with eaſe,</l>
               <l>A pardon for the offence obtain,</l>
               <l>And are admitted into Grace again:</l>
               <l>While the fair Judge, whoſe angry brow,</l>
               <l>Lowr'd, and look'd terrible but now,</l>
               <l>To the poor Lover there below,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:103330:129"/>
Finding her tender heart relent,</l>
               <l>Begins her Anger to repent;</l>
               <l>Thinks her ſelf Criminal, that ſhe,</l>
               <l>So rigorous to him could be;</l>
               <l>Owns her Severity a fault,</l>
               <l>And that ſhe may it expiate,</l>
               <l>Submits his Priſoner to remain,</l>
               <l>Bound in her own affections Chain.</l>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laura</hi>'s heart was of this temper, ſhe
thought her ſelf concerned in honour
not to yield too ſoon. <hi>Aſſen</hi> did
her no ſmall pleaſure in taking the
part of <hi>Marqueſs Hippolito,</hi> whom we
will yet call <hi>Beyran.</hi> And ſhe was
very willing <hi>Aſſen</hi> ſhould have the
honour of obtaining from her a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for the ungrateful <hi>Beyran,</hi> if he
could plead any thing to juſtifie
himſelf, or extenuate the Treaſon
he was guilty of, but that would
have uſhered in a Diſcourſe too
long for the preſent conjuncture, and
<hi>Aſſen</hi> told the <hi>Aga,</hi> if he had a mind
to execute the deſign he had told him
of, he muſt be at the Cape of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
before day; for there the <hi>Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi>
waited their coming. <hi>Beyran</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
it was impoſſible to get that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:103330:129"/>
night out of the Caſtle, the <hi>Dey</hi> having
not above two hours ſince had news
from the Spies, he maintained about
the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> that the night before, the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> entred the Town, whereupon
the <hi>Dey</hi> gave ſtrict order no Perſon
ſhould go out or in but by day. <hi>Laura</hi>
and <hi>Aſſen</hi> were ſurprized at the news,
and perceived the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had been in
danger. <hi>Beyran</hi> ſeeing <hi>Laura</hi> a little
mollified, was extreamly deſirous to
improve ſo happy a beginning by a
ſuitable progreſs to an intire pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But though ſhe ſaw him much
troubled and very penitent, ſhe gave
him not the comfort of a kind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
or look, but againſt her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
forced her ſelf to appear
harſh, and act the cruel againſt him.
<hi>Aſſen,</hi> who thought one night at leaſt
neceſſary to be afforded <hi>Laura,</hi> to
diſpoſe her ſelf for an intire Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation;
and that being upon the point
of executing ſo hazardous a deſign,
care ſhould be had to take their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
aright, asked the <hi>Aga</hi> whether
he thought it not fit to retire, leſt
being ſeen to come from <hi>Laura</hi> ſo
late, he might give cauſe of ſuſpition.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:103330:130"/>
The <hi>Aga</hi> anſwered, he need fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
the <hi>Dey</hi> having given him full
power to ſtay as long as he pleaſed.
But <hi>Laura,</hi> who had more reaſon to
be of <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s than of the <hi>Aga</hi>'s opinion,
who was wholly led by his paſſion,
ſpoke to him, though ſomewhat
againſt her will, to withdraw. The <hi>Aga</hi>
ready to obey this order, begged the
favour of her to give him hopes at
leaſt, ſhe would pardon him, if he
made it appear he was altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
as to the matter of <hi>Alphonſo,</hi>
and that her hatred of him ſhould
be at an end. She made him no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
but her eyes betrayed her heart;
and ſpoke clearer in his favour than
her voice could have done, <hi>Beyran</hi>
kiſſed one of her hands, which ſhe
could not refuſe him, and left her full
of that evenings adventures which
found her entertainment. The reſt
of that night not knowing what to
think of <hi>Beyran</hi>'s fortune, whom ſhe
believed, turned Turk for deſpair;
at the thought of this, the tears
trickled down her Cheeks, and ſhe
perceived, that if what he told her
was true, of her having been betrayed
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:103330:130"/>
by her Maid, and that he had not any
hand in <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s baſe action, as in
truth it was ſcarce credible he had,
ſhe would love him more than ever,
and pardon his being found with the
Vice-Queen, though this was a tender
point, and not to be remembred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a volley of ſighs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſen</hi> found the <hi>Aga</hi>'s news true,
and not able to get out of the Caſtle,
went with him to his apartment, where
the pretended Renegado cauſed a Bed
to be provided him, but they ſpent
the whole night in diſcourſe. <hi>Aſſen</hi>
you may believe had an itching
curioſity to hear the ſtory of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
Hippolito,</hi> having heard <hi>Laura</hi>'s;
<hi>Aſſen</hi> as ſoon as they were private,
fell into that diſcourſe. The <hi>Aga,</hi>
who knew how much he wanted
<hi>Aſſen</hi>'s help to plead for him to <hi>Laura,</hi>
was ready to pleaſure him with the
relation, and having underſtood <hi>Laura</hi>
had told him part of what concern'd
her, he was willing to acquaint him
with what came not to her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and began thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:103330:131"/>
                  <hi>When I arrived at</hi> Naples, <hi>I found
there the Vice-Roys Son, whom I was
acquainted with in my younger days,
and renew'd our friendſhip, eſtabliſh'd
rather in the conformity of our age,
than of our Inclinations: he brought me
to Court, and eſteemed it neceſſary a
new-comer ſhould be a little inſtructed
in the paſſages there, he took the pains
to tell me all the principal Intrigues and
Affairs of Love, and made me the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of his Paſſion for the fair</hi> Eleanor,
<hi>expecting from the fair friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, I would, when acquainted with
her, do him the beſt ſervice in my
power; I had a ſight of her, and by the
firſt effects of that view, could eaſily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
there was no continuing</hi> Alphonſo<hi>'s
Friend, without becoming his Rival: I
was troubled at it, and reproached my
ſelf for my unfaithfulneſs; but what
ſignified that when there was love in
the caſe? There was no reſiſting</hi> Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
<hi>charms, and I had inſtantly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the reſolution to love her, had not
the Vice-Queen uſed all poſſible arts to
divert me; ſhe expreſs'd no ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance
for me, which I attributed to
the friendſhip between her Son and me.</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:103330:131"/>
But having found me one day in
deep meditation, ſhe asked me, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I would freely acknowledge the
cauſe of my melancholy, if ſhe could gueſs
what it was, and might ſerve me in
the buſineſs?</hi> I aſſur'd her I would;
ſhe adds, <hi>I was under the Fate of
many other unfortunate Lovers, who could
not ſee</hi> Eleanor, <hi>without being affected
with the excellency of her Beauty.</hi> I was
ſtrangely ſurpriz'd, to find a paſſion
ſcarce entertained in my Soul, already
known to the Vice-Queen, and could
not imagine how ſhe came by the
diſcovery of a ſecret, I had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to keep cloſe as long as poſſibly
I could: it was not in my power
to deny it; the trouble in my face
and change of my colour, having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
her ſufficient evidence, how truly
ſhe had gueſſed. I told her I found
my ſelf too weak to reſiſt the Charms
of that beautiful Maid, and was ſorry
only <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> her Son, and my
Friend was concern'd: ſhe anſwered,
that a paſſion we cannot maſter,
was not to be complain'd of, nor
blam'd, and that her Son could not be
ſo unreaſonable, as not to pardon my
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:103330:132"/>
falling into a diſtemper, himſelf had
been afflicted with. But ſhe believed,
I ſhould prove as unfortunate as her
Son; but to keep her word with me,
ſhe would let me ſee, my concerns
were more dear to her than the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of her Son: but I muſt not blame
her, if her endeavours ſhould prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual,
which ſhe had too much
cauſe to expect, from the ſtrange and
unparallel'd inſenſibility of that fair
Maid, that ſhe would ſpeak for me
that very day, and ſee what hopes of
a favourable reception, and whether
ſhe defi'd Love, out of a general aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for Mankind, or a particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt
againſt ſome of that Sex. The
ſame time ſhe aſſigned me Ten a
Clock at night, to meet her in the
great Walk in the Garden, to receive
an account of her Negotiation: I was
there to wait for her, and ſhe kept her
Aſſignation. I ſaw her come with
one of her Maids, who was her Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
and having given her my hand
to lead her into a Bower, I went in
with her trembling, for fear of having
ill News, which I preſently appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
from her Countenance. Poor
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:103330:132"/>
                  <hi>Marqueſs,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>you have no better
fortune than others; this Girls heart is
proof to all Eſſays; and did you but know
that ill-favoured deſcription and ſcurvy
character ſhe gave of you, you would ſoon
judge it to no purpoſe to apply your ſelf to
her: but I would have you believe, I ſay
not this to diſcourage you, but ſhould be
ſorry to ſee a young Gentleman as you,
have qualities worthy the eſteem of a fair
Lady, ſhould imploy them, where there is
not any hopes to prevail.</hi> I had certainly
ſuſpected this extraordinary conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion,
and goodneſs of the Vice-Queen,
had not what ſhe ſaid been
agreeable to the report of the whole
Court, that the fair <hi>Eleanor</hi> was the
moſt inſenſible perſon in the World.
I knew well enough, 'twas not any
concern ſhe had for the paſſion of her
Son, made her ſpeak as ſhe did; ſhe
loved him very little, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance
ſhe had expreſs'd for me, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
me on that ſide. I might have
been ſo ſagacious and quick-ſighted,
as to ſee ſhe ſpoke for her ſelf, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
me to quit the thoughts of <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi>
to gain her ſelf Advantage; but I
was ſo oppreſt with grief at the News,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:103330:133"/>
that I was utterly incapable of making
any reflection: ſhe was a Lady, the
moſt dexterous and inſinuating on
Earth, and made ſo good uſe of the
power ſhe had over me, that ſhe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhook the paſſion I was under, but
help'd me to take reſolution to rid my
ſelf of it, though with the loſs of my
life. To bring this about, I thought
it neceſſary to find another Beauty to
amuſe my Affections; but where-ever
I caſt my eyes, in the Court, or out
of it, I could diſcover nothing capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make me forget one moment,
the Charms of the beautiful <hi>Eleanor.</hi>
The Vice-Queen having after that
evening ſaid nothing to me of it, ſaw
me one morning alone in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where her Son had newly left
me; ſhe asked me ſmiling, <hi>Whether I
had taken her advice, and followed her
Counſels?</hi> Madam, <hi>anſwered I,</hi> that
cannot be done, without my having
equal command over my Affections,
as you have over yours; or finding at
leaſt in another Lady, thoſe Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
I admire in the fair <hi>Eleanor.</hi> This
Diſcourſe had not pleaſed her, could
ſhe have thought her ſelf of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:103330:133"/>
of thoſe others I mentioned, not
comparable to <hi>Eleanor.</hi> But the good
opinion ſhe had of her ſelf, and the
reſpect due to her quality, contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the good conſtruction ſhe made
of my expreſſions, ſo that my words
gave no offence; but on the contrary,
being extreamly glad, no Beauty at
Court but <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s pleaſed me, ſhe
told me ſmiling, <hi>She would find me out
a Perſon, that wanted nothing of what
might engage the affections of a gallant
man, and that ſhe was very well aſſur'd,
I would not deny it.</hi> I gave her a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
thanks, not doubting in the leaſt
of the good ſucceſs of her choice, but
was very unwilling to abuſe her great
goodneſs: that as to <hi>Eleanor,</hi> ſhe had
done her pleaſure; but that the reſpect
due to her, would not permit me to
give away, ſhe ſhould be at the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to find me a Miſtreſs. She told
me, ſhe took delight in't; that ſhe
was loth any ones Affections ſhould be
loſt for want of being engag'd; and
that knowing my merit, ſhe would
think it a pleaſure to ſerve me, and
take care I wanted nothing in her
Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:103330:134"/>
All this ſhe ſaid with an air ſo free,
ſo full of goodneſs, it charm'd me:
And I had almoſt anſwered, She
might without further ſearch, find in
her ſelf what ſhe promiſed me elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
The truth is, ſetting aſide her
Age, ſhe might have paſs'd for one of
the faireſt and beſt humoured Women
of the Kingdom; but I was not willing
to venture ſo far for fear of miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and was content to wait for a ſight
of her, ſhe would provide for me. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
her not to make me languiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an impatient Lover, and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
required preſent remedy. She
aſſur'd me, I ſhould hear from her that
day, and that I had no more to do, but
prepare my ſelf to be deeply in Love.</p>
               <p>At this we were interrupted by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
coming in, which oblig'd me to
withdraw. I ſpent the reſt of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in muſing of what paſs'd between
us, gueſſing ſometimes ſhe meant one
Lady, ſometimes another of thoſe I
knew moſt intimate with her, and moſt
proper for the deſign, but could not fix
my judgment on any. This gave me
ſome diſquiet and trouble, with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
deſire to ſee the Vice-Queen
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:103330:134"/>
again. I made in the afternoon forty
journeys to Court, to ſee if ſhe had any
thing to ſay to me; ſhe laughed at my
haſte, and at length told me, my hour
was not yet come, nor the day gone;
that I ſhould go home and have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and when the time came, ſhe
would ſend me news. Night came, but
no news from the Vice-Queen, which
made me believe, ſhe fool'd me; ſo that
I could not forbear returning to the
Palace, where I heard ſhe was gone to
viſit a Lady her Friend. I was ſo ready
to imagine it was the Lady ſhe ſpoke
of, that I enquired her name, and where
ſhe lived; but could not learn either.
The caution ſhe had uſed in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
fully convinc'd me, ſhe was gone
about my buſineſs, and that ſhe made
the viſit private, that my love might be
as ſecret; and the Court kept ignorant,
how far her complaiſance had carried
her to ſerve me.</p>
               <p>I return'd in all haſte to my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as aſſur'd of all this; nor was I much
miſtaken, for I was ſcarce got thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but I received from her a Billet,
brought me by a Lady attended with
two Chairs, and expreſs'd as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:103330:135"/>
I have done what you deſired, and I
think, found out the perſon you wanted;
you will eaſily confeſs I am very much your
friend: the ſole acknowledgment I expect is,
you would not make me a Lyar, having
promiſed the Lady that upon the bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
I made you of her, you would bring
her a heart full of love. See you do it,
for it you deceive me in this, I ſhall never
pardon you the fault. You have no more to
do but follow her that brings you this Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
without noiſe or attendance; for you
are to come into a place of ſafety.</p>
               <p>Had it come from any other I
ſhould not have gone without a Guard
at diſtance, but coming from the Vice-Queen,
I could not ſuſpect danger.
All I thought of it was, that being a
jovial and pleaſant Lady, ſhe had a
frollick in her head, and reſolved to
put on me ſome pleaſant trick: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more ado, I made me ready to
laugh with her in good earneſt: I
went into one of the Chairs, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
her who brought the Billet, and
was got into the other. They carried
us a great way into a private part of
the Town, and there ſet down the
Chairs which my Guide ſent away, and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:103330:135"/>
we marched a little further, till we
came to a houſe which made a fair ſhew;
I learnt afterwards it belong'd to a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of her Bed-Chamber, her Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
who indeed was my Guide, and
having open'd the door, made me go
in without noiſe: I ſaw neither lacquey
nor light. This ſurpriz'd me, and made
me the more confident, ſome frollick
intended: I ſald not a word but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd,
in caſe things went not as I could
wiſh, to have my ſhare of the mirth
with them, who came to laugh at my
coſt. At laſt the Lady took me by the
hand to lead me up a pair of ſtairs in
the dark, which brought us to a room
no lighter then the ſtairs, and thence
into a Chamber where were two
Flamboys lighted. It appeared a good
room, but what pleaſed me moſt
was, the ſight of a fair Lady, who
careleſly laid on a very rich bed, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
aſleep with her hood over her face.
I began to repent my cenſure of the
Vice-Queen, whom I then thought to
have written in good earneſt: I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this Lady but what pleaſed
me extreamly, and to ſpeak the
truth, it was the ſole moment I
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:103330:136"/>
may be ſaid to have forgot the fair
<hi>Eleaner,</hi> ſince I loved her. She was
in a looſe dreſs, but handſom, and
rich beyond expreſſion: I had not ſeen
the like at Court, and knew not what
to think, the Richneſs of the furniture,
as well as her dreſs declaring her to
be a Lady of no ordinary quality:
but I was very much perplext to gueſs
who ſhe was. I made up to her, and
ſpoke; and the amorous impatience I
had to know her not permitting the
uſe of much Ceremony towards the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that ſtayed for me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I put my knee to
the Ground, and laying Hold on one
of her fair hands, which ſhe allowed
me to kiſs; It was but reaſon, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
ſaid I, <hi>I ſhould have languiſhed all
this day as I have done, who could
not expect this happineſs, without being
put to the pain at leaſt of longing for it.</hi>
I looked for an anſwer in hopes to
know the voice, but ſhe ſaid not a
word. I intreated her to eaſe me of
the pain, ſhe might believe I was in,
and that if ſhe reſolved not to be ſeen,
ſhe would however vouchſafe to ſpeak
to me, that where I was directed
to bring a heart of love, I hoped to
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:103330:136"/>
ſee a Lady that had Beauty and Wit;
that as yet ſhe had only moved my
curioſity, but if ſhe meant to reach
my heart, I muſt ſee her. As I ſpoke
thus, I perceived her laugh, which gave
me the boldneſs to lift up her hood:
She put back my hand, but ſo weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I thought it would not diſpleaſe
her to preſs a little further: there were
but we two in the Room, her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
having doubtleſs received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to withdraw, and I was ready to
put her to the ſqueek, when at laſt
ſhe threw off her hood. But how was
I ſurpriz'd to ſee 'twas the Vice-Queen.
Well <hi>Sir,</hi> ſays ſhe, bluſhing, <hi>will you
be content with your good fortune? And
will it not be preſumption in me to fancy
my ſelf capable to make you forget all
other Beauties.</hi> I anſwered her more
like a Gallant then a Lover: ſhe
was ſatisfi'd however, and without
ingaging further in the relation of a
diſcourſe, of which you may gueſs
the conſequence, I will tell you only
that having ſpent two or three hours
in her company, I return'd to my
lodging the way I came, and ſhe to
the Pallace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:103330:137"/>
I ſaw her on the morrow, and our
Correſpondence held for ſome time,
but cur'd not my paſſion. Her Son
with whom I had particular as well
as general reaſons to maintain a fair
Correſpondence, expreſt more friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
for me then I could have wiſht:
he was not content to make me the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of his affection, but imploy'd
me to ſpeak for him to the fair <hi>Eleanor,</hi>
expecting more benefit from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
of ſuch a Friend, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
addreſſes of his own: I did, and
you have doubtleſs heard from her;
ſhe let me underſtand, I ſhould ſpeed
better in ſpeaking for my ſelf then for
him, 'twas then I thought my ſelf the
moſt unfortunate of men, for believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo eaſily what the Vice-Queen
had ſaid to me, whoſe conduct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
me ſufficiently, how far ſhe
concern'd her ſelf in my buſineſs. I
deſign'd that moment to abandon
her favour, and give my ſelf up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to my firſt paſſion; but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the trouble I might expect from
the Vice-Queen, if ſhe knew it, I
thought fit to diſſemble a little, and
diſingage my ſelf by degrees with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:103330:137"/>
declaring on the ſudden for <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</hi>
I obſerved the beſt I could the
meaſures I had taken, but 'tis a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
matter to conceal a paſſion from a
jealous and a witty Woman. The
Vice-Queen perceived my relapſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I made <hi>Eleanor</hi> acquainted with
it; ſhe puniſhed my Apoſtacy with a
thouſand reproaches, which were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
with tears, and I (the better
to manage her) pretended a firm Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingagement
to her. But what will
not a ſlighted Lady do? or what
more dangerous than a jealous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?
I was thenceforward more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of ſeeing and ſpeaking with the
beautiful <hi>Eleanor,</hi> and avoided the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
of being found in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
which the Vice-Queen was
by, but all to no purpoſe: the Vice-Queen
knew all, and ſo well diſcern'd
what was true, from what was feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that ſhe gueſſed exactly right of
the privateſt of my thoughts. One
day as I walked with her in the
Garden, ſhe told me, we had both loſt
time to no purpoſe, I in forcing
my ſelf againſt my Inclination, to
pretend continuance of affection
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:103330:138"/>
for her, and ſhe in endeavouring to
make me love, though againſt my
will: That ſhe ſaw well enough what I
now did, was but the effect of my civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to a Lady of her quality, who
had expreſt kindneſs for me. But 'twas
time to put an end to our pain, and to
ſatisfie me ſhe intended it. She aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me, ſhe would no longer oppoſe
my Inclination, and that I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, upon the Confeſſion ſhe made
me, that I might expect from <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>
not only a kind reception, but
ſomething of love; yet I put no great
confidence in all theſe good words, as
coming from a party too lyable to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition:
But when by an Exceſs of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhe added, that to convince me,
ſhe was more my Friend then I
could Imagine, ſhe would contribute
more then any other to my ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and procure a Letter from the
Vice-Roy to <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s Father, to
perſwade him to conſent I ſhould have
his Daughter I was ſo tranſported
with joy, I could not forbear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her very large acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
She told me, I ſhould ſee by
the anſwer to that Letter what good
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:103330:138"/>
Service ſhe had done me: She did as
ſhe promiſed, and after the Letter ſhe
procured from the Vice-Roy, I doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not of being compleatly happy in
few days. The news was confirmed
by the beautiful <hi>Eleanor,</hi> and I had
the pleaſure to ſee her glad of it as
I was: nothing troubled me then but
the ſlow pace of time. The Vice-Roy
had ſent an expreſs to <hi>Genes,</hi> but
the Courier was ſcarce got a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
but I wiſh'd him return'd: every
moment ſeemed a year by my longing
and impatience: the only pleaſure I had,
was the time I was in <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
who aſſur'd on her part of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the Vice-Roy's Recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who had great Intereſt with her
Father, and ſenſible of the pain I was
in to have the matter confirmed;
had not the power to deny my paſſion
the favour of a viſit, which I begged I
might make her, having ingaged my
ſelf to her with all the promiſes and
oaths, to be expected on ſuch an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
from a Lover belov'd. The
aſſignation was made, and her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
agreed for the place of Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.
<hi>Pardon me, my dear</hi> Aſſen, <hi>for
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:103330:139"/>
fetching a ſigh at the remembance of
that day, which ſhould have been a time
of love and of joy, but was the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
and unfortunate of my life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Night was come, and when I
thought my ſelf juſt ready to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
of ſo great a happineſs, <hi>Clarice,</hi>
who waited on <hi>Eleanor</hi> in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and was her intimate Confident,
brought me a Billet, I will ſhew you,
having by good fortune kept it ſafe to
this minute. With that he took out a
little Purſe from his pocket, and out of
the Purſe the Billet, which he read to
<hi>Aſſen</hi> in theſe words.</p>
               <p>I am heartily ſorry, my dear <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lito,</hi>
I muſt fail my aſſignation. But an
unhappy accident I muſt not now tell you
of, will for a few days retard our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
you may believe me, as ſenſible of it
as you are, but love me as you have done.
Love will furniſh us with opportunity
enough, <hi>Adieu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I had never received a Letter from
<hi>Eleanor,</hi> nor knew her Character; ſo
that it was eaſie for <hi>Clarice</hi> to make
me believe that Billet came from her:
I asked her what her Miſtreſs ail'd;
<hi>Nothing,</hi> ſays ſhe laughing, <hi>but that ſhe
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:103330:139"/>
is not very well this evening.</hi> I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
I underſtood her meaning, and
examin'd her no further; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
ſufficiently diſpleaſed with my
ill fortune that night, when a Page
of the Vice-Queens met me coming
down ſtairs, and told me, his Lady
deſired to ſpeak with me. In the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
I was in, I could have wiſh'd a
Diſpenſation from waiting upon her;
but not knowing what excuſe to make
being ſo near her, and fearing ſhe
might have ſomething to tell me from
<hi>Eleanor,</hi> being the common ſubject of
her diſcourſe with me, I followed
the Page into her Chamber, where
I found her expecting my coming:
ſhe was at her Toilet, and the Vice-Roy
being out of Town, as ſoon as
ſhe ſaw me, ſhe reproached me for
deſerting her ſo: ſhe could of late
ſcarce ſee me in the croud; that if I
would not out of Gallantry, I ſhould at
leaſt out of civility have afforded her
my company, when deſtitute of other.
I was not diſpoſed for giving her
ſo pleaſing an anſwer as I would
have done another time, however I
ſaid not any thing to diſoblige her:
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:103330:140"/>
I was melancholy and vext, but ſo
deeply in love, I had a ſtock of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and complaiſance which abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
furniſhed me with pleaſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
which the Vice-Queen did
not diſapprove of: I had not ſeen her in
a better humour; and falling into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
ſhe kept me with her a great
part of that night; but ſhe thought me
out of humour, and quarrelled with
me upon't: I excuſed my ſelf, as having
ſat up all the night before at play.
Hereupon ſhe invited me to lye on her
Bed; I was priviledg'd to be familiar,
and without further intreaty made uſe
of my liberty: for the truth is, I was
almoſt dead for want of ſleep; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
leſs than two hours I was awak'd
on the ſudden by the light of a Flam-boy,
held before my eyes, and the firſt
object I ſaw, was <hi>Eleanor</hi> with a Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
in her hand, to take away my
life, had not <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> laid hold on
her arm, and prevented the ſtroke.
Judge you what amazement I was
in, I might with ſome reaſon have
ſuſpected all this a Dream: But my
Rival having ſeized the Ponyard, to
execute what he had hindered <hi>Eleanor</hi>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:103330:140"/>
to do, had ſhe not done me in her
turn the like Service. I thought it high
time to take care of my life, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to my Arms, put my ſelf in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of defence. The Vice-Queen half
dead with the fright, came running
to part us, but was like to have been
kill'd by her Son, who ſeemed as
eager to diſpatch her as me: I happily
ſaved her two or three times, and at
laſt ſtanding before her, the fury <hi>Don
Alphonſo</hi> was in, made him run on my
Weapon, and kill himſelf rather than be
killed by me: I ſaw him fall, which
troubled me extreamly, foreſeeing the
dreadful Conſequence of ſuch a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.
I turn'd towards the unhappy
Mother, to ask her what ſhe would
do, and found her ſwoun away, and
lying without motion: I was ſo
much afflicted with the ſpectacle, I
wiſh'd my ſelf dead: at laſt neceſſity
preſſing me to withdraw, I entred
<hi>Eleanor</hi>'s Chamber, to ſee her once
more, and dye at her feet, if ſhe deſired
my life to expiate my fault, but I found
her not, and ſo left the Pallace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any obſtacle. My deſign was to
paſs into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and being in ſearch of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:103330:141"/>
a <hi>Felucca</hi> to embark in, found <hi>Clarice</hi>
almoſt drown'd in tears at the Port.
I knew her, and asked whither ſhe
went, and what ſhe would have: <hi>Ah
Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I have been looking for my
Miſtreſs, who the Mariners tell me, is
embarqued not a quarter of an hour
ſince for</hi> Barcellona. I was ſtrangely
ſurprized at the news, and without
further deliberation, took the firſt
<hi>Felucca</hi> I met, and <hi>Clarice</hi> being very
willing to go with me in ſearch of her
Miſtreſs, or rather to get away from
a Court, where ſhe had reaſon to fear
the ſevereſt extremities, after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
lately happen'd, wherein ſhe
knew her ſelf concern'd; I put her
aboard, and had the weather ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable,
we hoped to reach <hi>Barcellona</hi>
before <hi>Eleanor</hi> could be there. I took
care to inquire the Name of the <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucca</hi>
ſhe was embarqued in, and the
Maſters. I was till then ſo diſtracted and
oppreſs'd with grief and deſpair, it was
not in my power to make any reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on all theſe misfortunes; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
got to Sea, I recollected my ſelf,
and conſidered all thoſe diſaſters; but
the more I thought on them, the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:103330:141"/>
more was I perplex'd about them. I
could not imagine by what accident
<hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> and <hi>Eleanor</hi> ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
to ſurprize me in the Vice-Queens
Chamber; unleſs we had been
betray'd, or <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> more in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with <hi>Eleanor</hi> than I believed: and
if that were ſo, why ſhould my Rival
prevent my death, as he did, and why
did ſhe take her turn too, to ſave
my life from <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> unleſs both
were ambitious of the hour to have
killed me. However I muſt confeſs I
deſerv'd death, and wiſh I had received
it at <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s hand; I ſhould not then
have had the diſpleaſure of imbrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my hands in the Blood of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who had all the reaſon in the
World to be reveng'd of me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clarice</hi> was very ill in the <hi>Felucca,</hi>
of the fright ſhe had taken, or elſe
Sea-ſick. I had not ſeen her all the
time of the diſaſter at <hi>Naples,</hi> I told her
part of the ſtory, and found it ſo much
afflicted her; eſpecially when I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
her with the death of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo,</hi>
ſhe grew worſe and worſe: I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her ſeveral queſtions, which ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
with a great deal of trouble, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:103330:142"/>
Ignorance, but in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as gave me cauſe enough to ſuſpect
the contrary, and believe ſhe was more
concerned in this buſineſs than I was
aware of: I was unwilling to preſs her
in the condition ſhe was in, to reveal
the ſecret, though I was curious of a
diſcovery, but hoped to make it, when
ſhe ſhould be a little better.</p>
               <p>We arriv'd at <hi>Barcellona,</hi> but no
news of the Bark <hi>Eleanor</hi> went aboard
of: I reſolved to have patience a
while, as well as the Merchants, who
had effects in it of great value: But
how careful ſoever I was of <hi>Clarice,</hi>
ſhe grew worſe than at Sea, and all the
Phyſicians could do for her, prevented
not her being reduced to that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
they gave her over as deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
ſo that finding her ſelf at
deaths door, ſhe ſent for me to her
Chamber, and having deſired to ſpeak
with me in private, the reſt of the
company quitted the Room, and ſhe
told me, that <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> having
gained her, ſhe did him all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
ſhe could againſt me with her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs;
and having over-heard part of
my laſt diſcourſe with <hi>Eleanor,</hi> ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:103330:142"/>
acquainted my Rival with it,
who tranſported with rage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
againſt a deſign ſo fatal to his
Affection, reſolved by any means to
defeat it, and if poſſible make advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of it for himſelf. That in order
to this, he made her write a Letter,
and carry it me, as from her Miſtreſs;
that <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> took his time, and
his meaſures accordingly, having
learnt from her the hour, and the
manner of my coming to <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s
Chamber; that he got in without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty:
but what paſs'd further, ſhe
knew not; only ſome hours after,
hearing the noiſe of Swords, ſhe ran
in, where ſhe found her Miſtreſs all in
diſorder, packing away; that ſhe
would have followed her, but her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
begg'd of her to let her go alone.
At laſt finding the noiſe increaſe in
the Vice-Queens Chamber, ſhe was
frighted, and went towards the Port,
where I found her; with that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Girl with abundance of tears,
begged that now at her death, I would
pardon her a Crime had coſt her her
life. She ſaid no more, but two hours
after died: I will not tell you the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:103330:143"/>
different motions of my heart, during
the diſmal Relation this Wretch made
me; but the appearance of Death in
her face made me pardon her. As for
<hi>Don Alphonſo,</hi> I heartily wiſh'd him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
again, as not ſufficiently puniſhed
by one Death for his Treaſon; but
the Traytors being both in another
World, I had no Subject to exerciſe
my Revenge on, unleſs my ill Fate,
againſt which I ſpent my time in fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Complaints.</p>
               <p>To compleat my miſery, News
came, the Bark we expected was loſt,
which was confirmed by Advice from
ſeveral Parties. Never man in ſuch
deſpair as I; I will not tell you the
extravagancies it made me run into;
it diſtracts me to think on't: there
was no other remedy to bring me to
my ſelf, but to perſwade me the News
from Sea were not ſo ſure, but that
we had reaſon to expect further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
and that Veſſels reported
caſt away, came frequently ſafe into
Port: that the Sea was a large Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and one Veſſel might be eaſily
miſtaken for another, and that many
fell into the hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:103330:143"/>
were ſuppoſed to have been wracked,
becauſe they were not heard of. This
gave me but ſmall comfort; yet I
thought I had ſome reaſon of hope,
undertaking a Voyage to viſit all
the Ports of the <hi>Levant,</hi> till I ſhould
learn ſome certainty of the <hi>Felucca</hi> I
was in ſearch of.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aga</hi> having finiſhed his Story,
<hi>Aſſen</hi> told him, he was very glad for
his ſake, that Matters paſs'd otherwiſe
than <hi>Eleanor</hi> believed; that it would
be no hard matter to make his peace,
when ſhe underſtood the Treachery of
her Chamber-maid; that he was not
to wonder at the Anger ſhe expreſs'd
againſt him, for that ſhe knew not
any of the Particulars he related to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
himſelf, but ſuſpected him of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
with <hi>Don Alphonſo</hi> to betray
her. <hi>Heavens! is it poſſible,</hi> cries Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito,
<hi>ſhe ſhould do my Love the injury,
to entertain ſuch a thought of me! had I
not loved her as I did, could ſhe fancy me
capable of ſo much baſeneſs?</hi> Sir, ſaid
<hi>Aſſen,</hi> when there's Evidence againſt
us, and no Plea in defence for our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
we are eaſily caſt: what
could you expect a Lady diſhonoured
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:103330:144"/>
by the Son, ſhould have believed of
you, whom ſhe found in the Arms of
the Mother, but that he ſacrificed the
one to you, that you might leave him
the other. <hi>Ah!</hi> Aſſen, replies the
<hi>Aga</hi> with a ſigh, <hi>let's talk no more of
what's paſt; as innocent as I am of the
one ſide, I muſt acknowledge my ſelf guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the other.</hi> But let me entreat you
to excuſe and extenuate the fault as
much as you can before her; or rather
never ſpeak of it, but endeavour only
to diſabuſe her, and alter the ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ſhe hath of me, and aſſure your
ſelf, what-ever Fortune befal me, I
will not be ungrateful for the Service
you will do me. I believe you have
heard from her who I am, and if the
condition ſhe is in, or any other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
hath oblig'd her to conceal her
Birth, and other things concerning
her, that might render her more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the zeal you have for her Service,
I will ſatisfie your curioſity in every
particular. <hi>Aſſen</hi> thanked him, and
fell a laughing, and anſwered, He had
known her too long to want Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in thoſe Particulars, and could
give a better account of her Birth and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:103330:144"/>
Family than any Perſon what-ever.
The <hi>Aga,</hi> ſurpriz'd at it, entreated
him earneſtly to let him underſtand,
how he being a <hi>Turk,</hi> ſhould ſo long
and ſo particularly know her. <hi>Aſſen</hi>
told him the Story, and part of what
happen'd at <hi>Genes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was day by that time <hi>Aſſen</hi> had
done, which put them in mind of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſome reſolution about the deſign
in hand, and the means to be made
uſe of, to get <hi>Laura</hi> out of the Caſtle
without danger. They thought of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ways, but all appeared full of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
and inconvenience; yet
they two could beſt do it of any, the
one having all the power over <hi>Laura</hi>'s
Guards, and the other over the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Caſtle. But all things were
ſo ſtrictly examined by the vigilance
of the inferior Officers, whom the
<hi>Dey</hi> (a man as vigilant as fearful) had
ſtrictly commanded to be always on
Guard, and not permit any to come
in, or go out, without taking exact
notice of them, that it was abſolutely
neceſſary to take right meaſures, and
ſtill fear the ſucceſs. <hi>Aſſen</hi> at length
bethought himſelf of a Stratagem, the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:103330:145"/>
leſs ſubject to diſcovery, as covered
under a cloak of Religion, though in
truth, apt to ſtartle a nice Girl as <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi>
There was a Souldier of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
dead the night afore, to be buried
that day; he reſolved to lock up the
Corps in a Chamber, and carry out
<hi>Laura</hi> on the Bier, as if ſhe had been
the Souldier, to be buried in the
Church-yard behind the Caſtle. The
<hi>Aga</hi> was of opinion, there could be no
danger in the expedient, but doubted
much whether <hi>Laura</hi> could be induc'd
to make uſe of it; yet after long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation,
and diſcourſe of other
means, they thought that not only the
beſt, but the only one they could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
themſelves a good deſign from.
But to prevent the trouble <hi>Laura</hi> might
have upon the apprehenſion of Death,
or other ſad Accident, they agreed
not to tell her of the Bier, but propoſe
carrying her out in a Chair. This
being reſolved on, <hi>Aſſen,</hi> who was to
ſee her that morning, undertook to
perſwade her to it, and the <hi>Aga</hi> in the
mean time gave order, the dead Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
ſhould not be buried till the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
He recommended to <hi>Aſſen,</hi> the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:103330:145"/>
care of his Affairs with his Miſtreſs,
gave him <hi>Clarices</hi> Letter to produce in
juſtification of him; and after a great
deal of Civility and Kindneſs on both
ſides, they parted, to meet again at
Dinner at <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s, for fear their long
Conferences in the Caſtle might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſuſpicion in the Garriſon, being
extreamly jealous and miſtruſtful.
<hi>Laura,</hi> who had ſcarce reſted all night
for Dreams, which troubled her, was
very joyful to ſee <hi>Aſſen</hi> come ſo early,
to divert her from the thoughts of
them. <hi>Well, dear</hi> Aſſen, ſays ſhe, <hi>ſhall
we be once eaſed of our Chains? and muſt
we carry this Traytor along with us?</hi>
Traytor, <hi>Madam,</hi> anſwers <hi>Aſſen,</hi> he
is the moſt honeſt and moſt paſſionate
of Lovers. <hi>Ah!</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>I foreſaw he
would corrupt even your fidelity; I know
too well the power he hath to gain affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and had reaſon enough to diſtruſt him.</hi>
Be not ſo haſty, <hi>Madam, replies the
Turk,</hi> to condemn a man unheard.
Why, <hi>what ſays ſhe,</hi> can he offer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
what I have ſeen? Did not I
find him with the Vice-Queen? Was
it not he that help'd the Traytor <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi>
to abuſe me? No, <hi>Madam,</hi> I
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:103330:146"/>
aſſure you, <hi>anſwers Aſſen,</hi> be pleaſed
to let me tell you, what you know
well enough, that he loved you too
well, to be capable of an action of
that kind; and to clear all your doubts,
<hi>adds he,</hi> ſhewing her <hi>Clarices</hi> Letter,
Know you that Character? <hi>Well,</hi>
ſaid ſhe, ſomewhat ſurpriz'd, <hi>'tis my
Chamber-maids: Read it,</hi> replies <hi>Aſſen,</hi>
and you ſhall ſee who was guilty of
the Treaſon. <hi>Laura</hi> read it, and had
ſcarce done, when relenting at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
done <hi>Hippolito,</hi> or troubled for the
Treachery of a Maid, ſhe had ſo much
confided on; <hi>O God of Vengeance,</hi>
cry'd ſhe with tears, <hi>wilt thou leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed
a Wretch ſo treacherous, and one
who hath been the cauſe of ſo many diſaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?</hi>
No ſure, <hi>ſays Aſſen,</hi> for ſhe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
dead, if not as her Treaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
yet for grief of having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it. With that he related to
her, what ſhe knew not of the Story
of the <hi>Marqueſs,</hi> and found it not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
buſineſs to appeaſe the great wrath
ſhe had expreſs'd againſt him, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
him her general pardon, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
her conſent for his going along
with them. <hi>Aſſen,</hi> like a dexterous
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:103330:146"/>
Confident, ſaid not a word of what
concerned the Vice-Queen; and <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
who had no deſire to be any more
angry with her dear Servant, was not
very curious to queſtion him on that
point: ſhe was content to believe him
innocent of one ſide, and to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with a pretence not to hate him;
ſo hard a matter is it to uſe ill thoſe
we love, how criminal ſoever. <hi>Aſſen</hi>
then told her of the reſolution taken
by the <hi>Aga</hi> and him, to have her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out in a Chair, and found her
diſpoſed to do what-ever they ſhould
think fit, but with condition there
ſhould be no more danger for them
than for her. <hi>Aſſen</hi> undertook it, and
told her, ſhe had no more to do, but
make ready againſt the firſt Watch,
whilſt the <hi>Aga</hi> and he took Orders for
other things. <hi>Aſſen</hi> went home, where
<hi>Beyran-Aga,</hi> came ſhortly after, and
gave him an account of all he had
done. <hi>Aſſen</hi> laboured with much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and dexterity to ſee the <hi>Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi>
well ſtored with Neceſſaries; you
may believe, <hi>Beyran</hi> failed not, as bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
as he was, to deſire an account of
what moſt concerned him, the ſtate
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:103330:147"/>
of his Affair with his Miſtreſs. His
dear Confident acquainted him with
what ſucceſs he had diſcharged the
Commiſſion he gave him, which <hi>Bey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
was ſo glad of, as it was not in his
power to expreſs his Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
All was ready, and <hi>Aſſen</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out the neceſſary Orders, as well
for the <hi>Brigandine,</hi> as for Horſes and
Men. The <hi>Aga</hi> and he went together
to the Caſtle, where the <hi>Aga</hi> made him
a Preſent of all the Jewels he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
at ſeveral times from the <hi>Dey,</hi>
and entreated him to accept them not
as a ſatisfaction, but a pledge of the
aſſurance he had given him to be ever
his Friend, and ſerve him on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
<hi>Aſſen,</hi> who endeavoured, but
in vain, to refuſe his liberality, would
not accept of it, but on condition
the <hi>Aga</hi> would make uſe on all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of what he had beſtowed, as ſtill
his own, and believe <hi>Aſſen</hi> ſenſible,
he had not ſufficiently obliged him
to merit ſo rich a Preſent. They
went from the Caſtle, to make their
Court to the <hi>Dey;</hi> and the hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come, <hi>Aſſen</hi> firſt changed <hi>Laura</hi>'s
Guards, relieving them by three of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:103330:147"/>
his Servants, whom he was to take
with him, that none might be left
behind to diſcover the Deſign, or
the Road they ſhould take. The
<hi>Aga</hi> quickly followed him, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſee <hi>Laura;</hi> he fell down at
her feet in ſuch a Tranſport of Joy
and Love, it moved her to that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
ſhe could not forbear em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
him. As ſhe raiſed him
from the Ground, they were falling
into amorous Diſcourſe; but <hi>Aſſen</hi>
told them, it was not a time to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
but to put their Deſign in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
unleſs they had a mind to ſee
it miſcarry; and that when they
ſhould be once out of danger, they
ſhould have leiſure enough to ſay
what they pleaſed. <hi>Laura</hi> and <hi>Beyran,</hi>
who deſired nothing more than to
ſee themſelves at liberty, were eaſily
perſuaded to follow his Advice. And
the Chair being brought by the <hi>Aga</hi>'s
Order, who had hidden the Corps,
they wrapt up <hi>Laura</hi> in a clean Sheet,
and without ſaying a word of the Bier,
put her in it, and cauſed it to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of her Chamber, where having
according to the cuſtom of the Place,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:103330:148"/>
thrown a Carpet over her, one of <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s
men took the Lanthorn, and the other
two carried the Bier; <hi>Beyran</hi> leading the
Van, and <hi>Aſſen</hi> bringing up the Rear.
A Corps is a ſacred thing among the
<hi>Turks;</hi> nor would any of the Guard have
thought of ſearching the Bier, though
neither <hi>Beyran</hi> nor <hi>Aſſen</hi> had been with
it. They went to the Church-yard,
where having taken <hi>Laura</hi> out of her
Grave, they marched towards the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage-gate,</hi>
which the <hi>Aga</hi> commanded
to be opened, that they might take
Horſe, which attended them hard by.
<hi>Laura</hi> and the <hi>Aga,</hi> whom we will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
call by their names, could not yet
take any pleaſure to ſee themſelves out
of the Caſtle and City, for fear of ill
Accidents, but long'd to ſee themſelves
at Sea; however they were glad they
got happily ſo far, in hopes Fortune
would in favour of Love, improve
that lucky beginning to a ſuitable
end. But this ſmall Lightning of Joy
quickly vaniſhed, being daſh'd out by
the cruelty of their Fate; for being
arriv'd, where they expected to take
Horſe, they found by <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s Servants,
the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Sophies had taken them
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:103330:148"/>
away. In what perplexity then was
this unfortunate Company? they
were five or ſix Leagues diſtant from
the Cape of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandine</hi>
was; they had no time to loſe,
and knew not what to reſolve on,
when on the ſudden they heard the
noiſe of Horſes making towards them.
<hi>Aſſen</hi> hid <hi>Eleanor</hi> and <hi>Hippolito</hi> under
an old Wall, and advanced with ſome
of his people towards the Horſe-men:
They marched apace, and quickly
asked, who is there? <hi>Aſſen</hi> told them
who he was, and by good fortune,
found it was <hi>Romadan,</hi> the Maſter of
the Gallies, coming from <hi>Port-farm</hi>
with a Guard. He told him, the <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi>'s
Sophies had taken from his people
ſome Horſes he had in readineſs to go
for <hi>Cape-Carthage,</hi> to ſee a <hi>Brigandine</hi>
he was ſending out to Sea. <hi>Romadan,</hi>
who knew the reſpect the <hi>Baſſa</hi> had for
<hi>Aſſen,</hi> was angry for what was done
by the Sophies; and to remedy the
inconvenience, told <hi>Aſſen,</hi> he might
take his choice of what Horſes he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of his Troop, and not trouble
himſelf for his own, they ſhould be
ſent him where he pleaſed to order.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:103330:149"/>
                  <hi>Aſſen,</hi> glad of the opportunity, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his offer; and <hi>Romadan</hi> taking him
aſide, told him, The <hi>Baſſa</hi> had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to come again to him, and by
any means to get <hi>Laura</hi> out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
and that he would do well in his
return from <hi>Cape-Carthage,</hi> to take the
Camp in his way, and endeavour to
divert the <hi>Baſſa</hi> from ſo dangerous an
Enterprize. <hi>Aſſen</hi> having promiſed
it, diſ-engaged himſelf from <hi>Romadan</hi>
as ſoon as he could; but <hi>Romadan</hi>
would oblige him at parting, with
two of his Horſe-men, to accompany
him, and ſerve him from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that were abroad, and might ſet
upon him unknown. This put <hi>Aſſen</hi>
into a little perplexity, but he would
not refuſe the kindneſs, for fear of
giving cauſe of ſuſpition: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken his leave, he advanced
towards his company, and acquainted
the two Lovers in few words, what
fortune he had met with. All mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and <hi>Eleanor</hi> in Boys Cloaths,
paſs'd for a young Slave of <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s,
the night helping to cover the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe,
they made all the haſte poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<hi>Hippolito</hi> being ſtill at <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:103330:149"/>
elbow, the Maſter of the Gallies
Horſe-men led the Van, to anſwer
thoſe they met; and <hi>Aſſen,</hi> as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
in chief, ſometimes on one
ſide, ſometimes on the other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
affecting much to be near <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>
or <hi>Eleanor,</hi> by the help of the
Horſe-men they had free paſſage;
and were ſeveral times ſaved from
being taken and carried before the
<hi>Baſſa.</hi> At laſt being come to the
<hi>Brigandine,</hi> they delivered the Horſes to
be reſtor'd to the owners, and having
rewarded them well for their pains,
<hi>Aſſen</hi> ſent them back with this Letter
to the <hi>Baſſa.</hi>

Was it poſſible,</hi> adds ſhe bluſhing, <hi>you

not conceive how it could be ſo in

he ſhould at the ſame time do <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>

               <p>I told you formerly of the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I took, of ſearching every Creek
of the Mediterranean, for the Veſſel
this Lady embarqued in: I did ſo for
ſeven or eight months, in a little Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
with ſix pieces of Ordinance,
wherein I was at laſt taken by a
Veſſel of <hi>Tripoly</hi> of no leſs than thirty
Guns, after ſix hours Fight, and the
loſs of almoſt all our men: I was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to <hi>Tripoly,</hi> where they preſented
me to the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who upon the good
report they gave of my behaviour in
the Fight, uſed me very civilly, and
having in few days expreſs'd no ſmall
affection for me, wiſhed I would turn
Turk, and ſent me for the purpoſe to
a famous Cady to be inſtructed in
their Faith: this <hi>Mahometan</hi> Doctor
was a very honeſt man, and witty;
he was the Son of a Renegado, and
had leſs Faith than his Father in
what he taught others: he ſpoke very
freely to me, and I opened my ſelf
to him, and pray'd him to make the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> believe I was turn'd Turk; he
did ſo, the <hi>Baſſa</hi> believed it on his
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:103330:151"/>
word, and expreſs'd for me more
kindneſs than ever; but he had a
Nephew who was jealous of it, and
often quarrelled with me on that
ſcore, which might afterwards have
produced further inconvenience. The
<hi>Baſſa,</hi> who had a tender love for this
Nephew, foreſaw what might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and reſolved to part us for ſome
time, till this Nephew were cured of
his jealous and tempeſtuous humour;
he ſent me with great Preſents to
the <hi>Dey</hi> of <hi>Tunis,</hi> his intimate Friend,
recommending me very earneſtly and
affectionately to him. The <hi>Dey</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a week after my arrival, made
me his <hi>Aga:</hi> You know <hi>Aſſen,</hi> what
a ſad life I led; but who would have
thought, <hi>ſays he,</hi> addreſſing himſelf
to <hi>Eleanor,</hi> I was ſo near what I
ſearched for, and loved above all the
World, yet knew nothing of it; and
that my Fate ſhould make me ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
when I was juſt upon loſing you.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Marqueſs</hi> and <hi>Eleanor</hi> entred
into further diſcourſe of their adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and the Maſters of the Veſſel
coming to conſult <hi>Aſſen,</hi> he left them
together to go on with their ſtories.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:103330:152"/>
The wind chopped about, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a Storm, the Veſſel being ſmall,
they thought it inconvenient to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
further to Sea: They tack'd
about, making towards <hi>Biſerti,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to ſail near the Coaſt of
<hi>Barbary,</hi> till they ſhould come over
againſt <hi>Sardinia,</hi> that they might
croſs over (as ſoon as the weather
ſerved) into the Iſles of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
where they hoped to anchor. This
was their reſolution, and 'twas well
for them they followed it, for the
Storm was ſo great, they were forced
to lye at Anchor three or four days
among the Rocks on the Coaſt of
<hi>Barbary.</hi> They were ſo far from
<hi>Tunis,</hi> they had no cauſe to fear
purſuit, being at Anchor in a place
where a thouſand Veſſels might have
paſs'd by without diſcovering them in
the ſtorm.</p>
               <p>The ſtorm at length was pretty
well over, and the <hi>Brigandine</hi> purſu'd
her Voyage along the Coaſt of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary;</hi>
meeting by the way ſeveral
Creeks, floating Hogſheads, and Planks,
and other pieces of broken Ships,
which they doubted not were caſt
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:103330:152"/>
away in the laſt ſtorm. For two days
they cruiſed along that Sea; they
were frequently entertained with
thoſe lamentable ſpectacles, and at
laſt heard the voice of a Man, which
they fancied muſt have come from
a Rock at leaſt three miles diſtant
from Land; they preſently concluded
it was one eſcaped out of the late
Shipwracks. <hi>Eleanor</hi> was moved to
pity at the cry, and <hi>Aſſen</hi> at her
requeſt, turn'd the prow of his <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandine</hi>
towards the Rock. The Sea
was then calm, and when they got
within ſome paces of the Rock, they
ſaw a man almoſt naked, without
Hat, without Stockins, without Shoes,
ſo maimed and disfigured, they knew
not whether they ſhould more fear
him or pity him. <hi>Aſſen</hi> having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Sea-men to ceaſe rowing,
asked him in <hi>Moreſque,</hi> how he came
upon that Rock, and what he would
have. I am an unfortunate Chriſtian
<hi>(anſwers he in Italian)</hi> and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to you, and if you will take
the pains to get foot on land here,
you will find what perhaps you are
in ſearch of, but you muſt loſe no
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:103330:153"/>
time, otherwiſe your help may come
too late. <hi>Aſſen</hi> amazed to hear him
ſpeak ſo, obſerved ſomething in his
Countenance, made him think he had
ſeen him elſewhere. <hi>Eleanor</hi> was
particularly aſtoniſhed at his voice,
and fancied ſhe knew it; but the man
was ſo disfigured, ſhe could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
call to mind who he was
<hi>Aſſen</hi> asked him his name, and where
he had ſeen him to know him: I tell
you, <hi>anſwers the man,</hi> I have here
what you perhaps go in ſearch of
much further; the man you ſee is
<hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Slave, and if
he has ſent thee for his Wife, thou
may'ſt find her on this Rock half
dead with her Sufferings theſe two
days we have been here: he had
ſcarce done ſpeaking, but <hi>Eleanor</hi>
invaded at once with joy and grief
cry'd out, which made the man turn
his face, and ſhe knew him to be
<hi>Alexander. Ha Sir,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it ſhould be you, and not know</hi>
Laura? As ſhe ſpoke thus, <hi>Aſſen</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
commanded the Oars to turn
the prow to land, ordered a Plank
from the Veſſel to the Rock, and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:103330:153"/>
paſs'd over it firſt, <hi>Hippolito</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with <hi>Eleanor</hi> by the hand, and
all to embrace poor <hi>Alexander,</hi> who
was ſo tranſported with joy, he could
not ſay a word: he pray'd <hi>Aſſen</hi> to
get him ſomething from aboard to
comfort his dear <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> who had
not eat any thing for three days
paſt. They gave order accordingly,
and inſtantly ran towards the place
where the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> lay under a
Buſh, where they found her half
dead; a ſad ſight for <hi>Laura,</hi> yet mixt
with joy to ſee her; but what an
aſtoniſhing ſurprize was this to the
<hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> who could ſcarce open her
eyes, and knew not whether ſhe
were awake or in a Dream, and
whether what appeared to her, were
Perſons or Spirits. You may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
the haſte <hi>Eleanor</hi> made to help
her, being readily ſeconded with
<hi>Hippolito</hi>'s aſſiſtance: <hi>What are you
here</hi> Laura, ſays the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> with a
feeble and languiſhing tone, <hi>and am
I not miſtaken? what good Angel hath
ſent thee to reſcue me from the Jaws
of Death?</hi> Heavens! my dear <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs</hi>
anſwers <hi>Laura,</hi> not able to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:103330:154"/>
forbear crying, <hi>Heavens! which hath
had pity on us, and delivered me alſo
out of the hands of the</hi> Baſſa. The
<hi>Sultaneſs</hi> began to recover, but had
not ſtrength to ſpeak long. <hi>Aſſen</hi>
told <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhe would be better
aboard than at land, the Sea being
ſtill. The Count, who had not yet
had leiſure to diſcourſe them, asked
where they were bound for, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
underſtood they ſail'd for <hi>Italy,</hi>
he could not ſufficiently bleſs Heaven
for ſo happy an accident. The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi>
was carried aboard, and the weather
being fair, they reſolved to put out to
Sea, and divert their courſe for <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laura</hi> was ſo careful of the <hi>Sultaneſs,</hi>
that ſhe began to gather ſtrength;
<hi>Aſſen</hi> and <hi>Hippolito</hi> did their part with
the Count, who had no leſs need of
nouriſhment and reſt: This took up
one day; on the morrow the weather
continuing fair, and the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her ſelf in a condition to diſcourſe,
they related to her what paſs'd at <hi>Tunis</hi>
ſince her departure, and deſired Count
<hi>Alexander</hi> to inform them how they
came to be wrack'd, and by what For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:103330:154"/>
they got upon the Rock; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>You have heard without doubt, how
the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> was carried aboard by
the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s order, who thought (as well
as I) it was <hi>Laura:</hi> You may imagine
my ſurprize great, and my joy inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible.
At our putting to Sea we
had a good wind, but ſcarce paſt the
Cape of <hi>Carthage,</hi> but we ſaw the
<hi>Heavens</hi> cloudy on the ſudden, and had
the wind in our Teeth, and ſo ſtrong
a Gale, that our Veſſel being ſmall,
and the ſtorm increaſing, we were
driven on this Coaſt and caſt Anchor;
preſently a violent and moſt terrible
<hi>Hurricane</hi> broke our Cables, ſet us
a-drift, and caſt us upon the Rocks. I
leave it, to you to gueſs, what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
this was for a Lover, having
her he loved above the World ready
to be loſt before his face, which height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the utmoſt the terrours of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and death: I ſtood by the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs,</hi>
who with grief and fear was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
half dead; and reaching out her
hand, <hi>Dear</hi> Alexander, ſays ſhe, <hi>ſince
the hour is come we muſt dye, let us dye
together.</hi> Theſe words ſo reſolute and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:103330:155"/>
kind, pierced my very heart, and
turned me into a Statue, leaving me
without ſenſe or motion. All I could
do, was embracing my dear <hi>Sultaneſs</hi>
for a final Adieu, when the Veſſel
giving a great crack, made me turn
my eyes towards the Window of my
Cabin, where I ſaw a Rock almoſt
touching the Poop; this ſurprized me
not a little, and taking a ſuden reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
I placed the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> on my
back, got upon the Deck, and in ſpite
of the Sea-men, who would have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
me, I leaped on the Rock
without doing my ſelf or the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi>
harm. A moment after, the Sea which
caſt the Veſſel on the Rock, carried
it off again, leaving me and the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs</hi>
there helpleſs of help, unleſs our
Sea-men would pity us, but they could
not maſter the winds, and the night
was far gone, ſo that no good was to
be expected from them till the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
if the ſtorm would over. A ſad
night it was, the poor <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to comfort me with hopes the
Mariners would not forſake us; but
what a lamentable ſpectacle had I at
break of day, to ſee ſome Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:103330:155"/>
half a Ship a float, which by the
number of People I ſaw returning
from one end to another to get nearer
land, was ſunk by the greatneſs of the
waves, and all the men drown'd. What
afflicted me moſt, was the ſight of the
<hi>Sultaneſs,</hi> though ſhe by I know not
what preſage, would not deſpair of
good Fortune, but would tell me ſtill,
<hi>Heaven</hi> had not ſaved us from the Sea,
to let us periſh on that Rock; but
would ſend to our aid one of the many
Veſſels that paſs'd by that way. It was
a piece of good Fortune I did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
yet I looked conſtantly about to
diſcover ſome ſail, when at laſt having
almoſt loſt hope, having for two days
ſeen nothing on the Sea, I ken'd on
the ſudden ſomething floating on the
water, but being at diſtance, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
no ſail, I knew not whether
to think it a Wrack, or ſome ſmall
Veſſel with Oars; yet ſeeing you
draw towards the Coaſt, and the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the objects magnifying them
every moment, I knew it to be a <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandine</hi>
that brought the <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> the
News, who was not much pleaſed
with it, fearing the Veſſel came from
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:103330:156"/>
                  <hi>Tunis,</hi> and being more willing to dye
on the Rock, than return thither, I
hollowed, and cry'd, and had the good
luck to be heard by you; and if I did
not preſently expreſs that joy which
might have been expected upon know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you, you will pardon it as an
effect of the miſerable condition I was
reduced to, and will eaſily believe it
could not but be great.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Alexander</hi> having ended his
diſcourſe, every one ſpoke his thoughts
of all theſe adventures, mingling ſighs
with their joy, which increaſed at the
news of one of <hi>Aſſen</hi>'s Servants, that he
diſcerned land, and that it could be
no other but <hi>Sardinia:</hi> He was in the
right, but they could not anchor till
the morrow; and the weather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
good, within eight days they
arrived at <hi>Genes,</hi> to the infinite ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of this happy company, and
all <hi>Eleanor</hi>'s Friends. Her Father was
dead, and thoſe who were intruſted
with the tuition and diſpoſal of her
(if heard of) were eaſily induced to
conſent ſhe ſhould be married to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
Hippolito,</hi> who found means to
make his Peace with the Vice-Roy of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:103330:156"/>
                  <hi>Naples.</hi> The <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> turn'd Chriſtian,
and Count <hi>Alexander</hi> married her:
<hi>Aſſen</hi> followed the example of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs,</hi>
and Count <hi>Alexander</hi> as well
as <hi>Marqueſs Hippolito</hi> ſerved him with
their Credit and Eſtates, to make his
Fortune, and live happily the reſt of
his days.</p>
