         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That the Publick

               <argument>
                  <p>1. That there is ſomething in the Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
World anſwerable to what we call
Primum Mobile in the Heavens.
2. That every thing actually mov'd,
owes its motion to ſome forreign im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.
3. Several obvious demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
of this Truth.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Know not, if what Aſtronomers
ſay, be a real Truth, or a meer
groundleſs ſuppoſition, That a
Superiour Heaven, they call <hi>Primum
Mobile,</hi> turneth round the world with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51702:14"/>
it ſelf by its rapid motion all th' other
inferiour Orbs; but ſure I am there
is ſome ſuch thing as a <hi>Primum Mobile</hi>
here below, that over-ruleth the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Microcoſm</hi> it ſelf, that untoward
and unweildy Animal call'd Man.
This I fancy you will eaſily agree to,
if you do but allow, with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Philoſophers, nothing to be
put in motion but by ſome other
thing of a diſtinct nature from it ſelf:
for though this receiv'd principle be
ingeniouſly contradicted by a late
Author, I am ſtill inclin'd to believe
it no untruth, by an infinite number
of obvious and unanſwerable inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
clearing all our doubts about
this old Maxim, <hi>quicquid movetur, ab
alio movetur,</hi> that every thing actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moved, owes its motion to ſome
forreign impreſſion. Thus when a
Stone falls downwards, I conceive
it to be preſs'd towards the Earth
by the weight of the <hi>Atmoſphere;</hi> or
as others will tell you more obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the magnetical attraction of
the Center of the Univerſe: When
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51702:14"/>
the ſame heavy body is toſs'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
it is natural to us to think
with the <hi>Ariſtotelians,</hi> of an impreſs'd
Quality, or of a certain Impulſe
help'd forward by the liquid ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
till the greater preſſure of the
incumbent air return it home again to
the Earth, from whence it came;
and if this be apparently true in a
rectiline motion, we need not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to judge after the ſame manner
of a circular one, or of a body turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
round ſome Center or other:
for I am not as yet thoroughly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd
to the Opinion of thoſe who
will have the Sun, Moon, and other
Planets to turn round the world
without the help of an <hi>Ariſtotelian
Intelligence.</hi> But we need not climb
ſo high, to make new diſcoveries of
ſo probable a Truth: Does a Ship ſail
without a good gale? Does the Earth
produce its fruits unmanur'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till'd?
Can the powers of our Soul
move themſelves without a previous
impreſſion from the Object? Fire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and Water too aſcend ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51702:15"/>
up into the air, but by the
ſtrong preſſure of heavier bodies that
thruſt them upwards: and may not I
be allowed to ſay, that if God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
were mutable, he could not be
wrought upon but by a Being diſtinct
from himſelf? So true, one would
think this hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controverted
Maxim
to be,<note place="margin">My Lord <hi>Stares</hi> his new principles.</note> though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
doubtful to a great man of
this Age.</p>

a Gentleman.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I doubt not but that there is ſuch a
thing in the World as Religion, yea,
and true religious men too of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religions; yet beſides that, they
are ſo hard to be known, that the

ſometimes their man, take ſuch
to be undoubted Saints, who are no
better than Dunghills covered with
Snow, or finely painted Tombs, the
number is ſo inconſiderable, that true
Vertue has always been the rareſt
thing in the world, as Vice the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneſt;
which I can aſcribe to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but to the Almighty Power
of temporal intereſt ſo abſolutely ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51702:17"/>
upon the matter, 'tis a harder
fate than one would think to be bred
a Tradeſman, becauſe 'tis a great
temptation to him who muſt live by
trading, if not a ſort of indiſpenſible
neceſſity to purſue his Intereſt, right
or wrong, to the ruine of his Soul
and Conſcience. The <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> and
Divines may ſet what Rates they
pleaſe upon his Goods, and declare
what Gain is reaſonable and lawful,
and what is by the Law of God and
right Reaſon forbid, notwithſtanding
all their preſcriptions, the Dealer will
ſtill think all Fiſh that comes into the
Net, and that whatever he can get,
he may lawfully take, were it ſix
times the value of what he diſpoſeth
of. 'Tis upon this account, that, as
<hi>Cicero,</hi> if I miſremember not, ſays
ſomewhere, No Tradeſmen are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to be Gentlemen, <hi>quia nihil
proficiunt, niſi mentiuntur,</hi> becauſe
they can hardly become rich without
cheating and lying, which true Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
ſhould not do, though too
many among us, pretending to this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51702:18"/>
Quality, are as guilty of both as the
meaneſt Tradeſmen. We are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd
by the <hi>Turks</hi> upon this very
Head, more than upon the account
of our Religion, which many of
them have a reſpect for, as aiming at
nothing more than good manners
and holineſs of life. 'Tis a common
word among them, That they are
neither Cheats in their dealings, nor
perfidious, nor Lyars, as the <hi>Infidels,</hi>
meaning the Chriſtians; though they
themſelves are of late generally as
guilty of thoſe Crimes as we are; and
no wonder, ſince they have not the
ſame advantages that we have to rid
our ſelves of the Tyranny and Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of ſelf-intereſt, which yet we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to clear our ſelves of before
men, by a thouſand proteſtations of
our juſt and fair dealings, being
aſham'd to be thought concern'd for
our ſelves in what we pretend to do
meerly for others. This is the Vizard
we put on in all our ſpecious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to Honeſty and Juſtice, leſt we
are at laſt diſcovered to be what we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51702:18"/>
really are, and will by no means
own. By how many horrible and
repeated Oaths will not ſometimes a
greedy Tradeſman endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
a credulous Cuſtomer, that he
uſes him kindly, when at the ſame
time his deſign is Extortion, and an

That what they loſe by

the Arguments drawn from Intereſt,

misbehaviour or misfortune; or
that Uſury, ſo much condemn'd by

call <hi>damnum emergens,</hi> and <hi>lucrum

to be expoſed to, by lending our

two things, ſince they may always be

lend your money without

So far it is from allowing

                  <hi>Simony,</hi> that is the ſelling of the

ſuch as could give moſt money

it is hard, if not impoſſible for them

the Charms of this bewitching
Metal: Upon this account 'tis a piece
of Wit and Wiſdom too in a Prince
to beſtow large Salaries upon his chief
Miniſters of State, leſt they be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
through want to comply with
the ſecret Offers of a rich Enemy.
This Maxim is carefully obſerv'd by
the <hi>French</hi> King, no Prince in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
allowing, or perhaps able to
allow greater Salaries to ſuch as he
thinks fit to be employed in State
Affairs: Hence it is that he is ſeldom
betrayed by his Subjects, not that
they are of a more generous temper
than other people, but becauſe their
covetouſneſs being glutted at home,
they are not ſo eaſily overcome by
what may be offered them from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
The <hi>French</hi> King owes not
only the Loyalty of his chief Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to his great Rewards, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
almoſt all his Conqueſts, and
the great Reputation he has got of a
ſucceſsful Politician. The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
of late are no more eſteem'd for
their Politicks, as they were of old,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51702:23"/>
though they be ſtill the very ſame
Men, of the ſame Temper and
Reach, and as wiſe as ever; but
the ſecret of the matter is, that they
have wanted for ſeveral years the
neceſſary Tool to ſhew themſelves
great Politicians; that is, Money e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to put in Execution their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
either of Peace or War. 'Tis
an eaſie matter for a ſenſible man to
imagine great things, and great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns;
yea, and to propoſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the fitteſt Methods to compaſs
'em; but when all this is done, if he
is not able to bring his Speculations
to practice, for want of the great
Inſtrument to put Politick Projects
in execution, Gold and Silver, his
Enterpriſes may eaſily miſcarry, not
only to the loſs of his Goods and
Eſtate, but alſo of his former Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Wit, Conduct, Judgment
and Inſight in Affairs: Whereas, if
he were ſufficiently provided with
Riches and Treaſure, were he but a
man of an ordinary reach, he might
undoubtedly take ſuch meaſures as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51702:23"/>
would ſoon gain him the Fame of
an extraordinary Politician: So the
<hi>Spanivrds,</hi> I fancy, when they are
once become as rich as formerly
they were, will on a ſudden turn
good Politicians again; and if the
<hi>French</hi> King's Treaſures, by an eaſie
turn of the Wheel, in caſe his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
can but agree a while among
themſelves, are once exhauſted, I am
much miſtaken if he proves not a
very inſignificant Politician, and his
State-Council too as weak as that of

Circumſtances would heartily abhor,
Covetouſneſs preſſing no leſs hard

nothing that can increaſe their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
How great a ſin Treaſon is,
and how heinous a Crime 'tis for a
man to betray the Truſt he is ſworn
to, is ſo generally known, that I
need not tell you 'tis <hi>malum per ſe,</hi> a

not only <hi>extrinſecally,</hi> if
I may ſo ſay, and upon the account
of ſome Written Law or other that
forbids it: Nevertheleſs, what more
common than to ſee Servants betray
their Maſters, Subjects their Princes,
and ſometimes Wives and Children
their very Fathers, for a Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney?
So true it is, that the deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hunger after Gold and Silver, <hi>auri
ſacra fames,</hi> forceth men ſometimes
upon the horrideſt Crimes. But if
Treaſon be ſuch a heinous ſin, it is
never lawful for any man to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to the committing of it, as
thoſe are, who in an open War con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
Cities by corrupting and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51702:26"/>
their Governours to betray
their Maſters; yet this Antichriſtian
Practice is common all the Chriſtian
World over, as much as any where
elſe. The <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> I know, who take
upon them ſometimes to excuſe the

and Great Men, whom they have
perhaps ſome reaſon to flatter, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that a declared War implies an
<hi>implicite</hi> leave to do one another all
the hurt they can by what means ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:
But ſurely, ſince this is to be
underſtood of lawful means, it is
clear, that to decoy another Princes
Subject into a Treaſonable Practice
againſt his Soveraign, is ſinful: If
Princes were made ſenſible of their

they would act more Chriſtianly and
more generouſly with their very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
in caſe Intereſt hindered them
not ſometimes to ſee what in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

I be allowed in this place to adviſe

upon what Penalty the Papiſts are
oblig'd to break their Oaths made to

               </argument>
               <p>Though nothing ſhould be more
binding than an Oath, yet if we
look narrowly into the general pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of mankind, it binds no longer
than men think it their advantage to
keep it. This ſeems to be the ſecret
Condition to be underſtood in all
Publick Treaties confirm'd by Oaths,
ſince the Chriſtians, to their ſhame,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51702:29"/>
make as little ſcruple to break them
as the <hi>Mahometans</hi> upon the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of their Intereſt: For what
other Apology can we make for the
breach of a perpetual Peace, or a
Temporal Truce between Nation and
Nation, ſo ſoon as we find our ſelves
in a poſture to enſlave our unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Neighbours? But I doubt, if the
great Rewarder of Vertues, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher
of Crimes, will hold us guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
when we break our Oaths and
Promiſes, becauſe, forſooth, we find
it our intereſt to act contrary to what
we had ſworn or promis'd. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
are generally thought to be more
obnoxious to the breach of Oaths
than any other people in the world,
and deſervedly too, if we conſider,
that others break their Oaths through
Humour, and the Papiſts by Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
I ſpeak of ſuch Oaths as relate
to the maintaining of Hereticks and
Hereſie, which they are oblig'd not
to ſtand to, under a no leſs pain
than that of Eternal Damnation, in
caſe they are in a poſture to break
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51702:29"/>
them ſafely, and without danger for
themſelves, by deſtroying ſuch as they
call Hereticks: It were uſeleſs to give
Inſtances of this common practice,
ſince the learned part of the world
is ſufficiently ſatisfied of the Truth
of the matter. Beſides what has
been already ſaid, Two things the
Papiſts have contrived, and I am
afraid the Proteſtants likewiſe make
ſometimes uſe of them both upon
occaſion, to ſwear without any ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
according to the Dictates of their
own intereſt: and theſe are Mental
Reſervation and Equivocation, both
invented to untie all the Knots of
Humane Society, but with a deſign
to promote private mens Temporal
Concerns: for when a man is obliged
by his Oath to declare whatever he
knows of any particular matter of
Fact, the ungodly and intereſted <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſt</hi>
will ſoon reſolve him upon the
matter, that he may ſwear to the
Caſe propos'd in ſome ſence or other
that may ſecure the Intereſt he is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in purſuit or poſſeſſion of, which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51702:30"/>
is all that he cares for: But the <hi>Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts</hi>
bait to draw him into this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs
is this, That he clears his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
likewiſe by telling him, that
what he does he may lawfully do,
without any offence, though I doubt
if either the <hi>Caſuiſt</hi> or his Pupil can
be ſo invincibly ignorant as not to
underſtand, that in all proceedings
of this kind there is ſtill a cheat put
upon Man, and conſequently a ſin
committed againſt God. But thus
prevailing Intereſt puts a Veil before
their Eyes, though I fear, not to the
quieting of a diſturb'd Conſcience,
becauſe that part of man's Soul, if
I may ſo ſpeak, commonly called
Conſcience, is incorruptible, and not

               </argument>
               <p>But what is an inducement to ſin,
and ſometimes to the greateſt of
Crimes, is often the occaſion and
chief cauſe of good and laudable
actions: This I ſay, becauſe I have
obſerved in Popiſh Countries, that
the Preachers generally, eſpecially of
the Begging Orders, employ all the
force of Art and Eloquence, to ſhew
the great Merit, as they ſpeak, of
Almſ-giving. My deſign is not to
blame them for ſerving thus the poor,
but only by the way, to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this odd <hi>Phenomene, viz.</hi>
Why they inſiſt more frequently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Preachers, and thoſe of ſome other
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51702:31"/>

for God's ſake, if it be not meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as I believe it is not in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
is at leaſt a very ready means
to procure from our heavenly Father
a full remiſſion of our ſins. It is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
to find out the Reaſon of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
behaviour of the Begging Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Tribe from other Preachers, that
either are richer, or depend not ſo
much upon the publick Benevolence,
becauſe the firſt know they are to be
the beſt ſharers themſelves in the
Alms they exhort the people ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly

generally ſo zealous upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
'tis for ought I know upon this

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51702:31"/>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. The Popiſh Principles coin'd in the
Mint of Intereſt. 2. Purgatory how
advantageous to Rome. 3. A ſhort
account of the Virgin Mary of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>But to purſue my deſign ſomewhat
more particularly, I ſhall mind you
of another ſelf-evident Truth, That
the new Doctrines of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> have been all coin'd in the
Mint of Intereſt. For 1. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
conſidering, that the Belief of
a Purgatory contributed more than
any thing elſe to the increaſe of the
Revenue of their Church, agreed
together in the Conventicle of <hi>Trent,</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:51702:32"/>
to make it an Article of Divine Faith,
That the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> might be
oblig'd for ever, to pay into the
Church the Daily and Yearly Rent
it produceth; and that the ſimple Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots
might be the more encourag'd
to redeem themſelves out of its
flames with ready Money, their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
do generally teach, That they
are every whit as violent and ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the fire of Hell it ſelf, with
the difference only in their duration,
which they allow to be longer or
ſhorter, according to the greater or
ſmaller Sum given to ſhorten the
Soul's ſtay in Purgatory. I ſhould
wonder then if <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi>
being once perſwaded, that
there is ſuch a place as this is, and
that they may ſuffer there the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
torments imaginable ſeveral
hundreds of years together, if they
leave not to the Church a part of
what they have, to redeem their
Souls out of ſuch a Priſon as this is
ſuppoſed to be: I ſhould wonder, I
ſay, if they payed not liberally in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51702:32"/>
this life, to eaſe themſelves of the
torments of the other, which they
think the very <hi>Venial,</hi> as they ſpeak,
and ſlighteſt ſins expoſe them to.
Upon this account I was not at all
amaz'd, during my long Reſidence
in, and Travels through Popiſh
Countries, to ſee ſuch vaſt Sums of
Money payed daily and yearly into
the Church-Exchequer, and far leſs
to hear the Prieſts preach to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
with ſo much true, or counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
zeal, the danger they were in
to ſuffer in Purgatory, a fire to
which all our fierceſt fires being
compared, are but painted ones, and
flames in repreſentation only, and
that perhaps till the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
unleſs they prudently took
care before their departure out of
this world, to lay down to them
their Ranſom. 2. The <hi>Romiſh</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints is ſuch another
piece of intereſted Contrivance:
When a Saint is once Canoniz'd, if
the Prieſts can but impoſe upon the
credulous multitude a Miracle done
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51702:33"/>
by or at his Image, they have done
their buſineſs effectually, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
is on a ſudden enrich'd by the
daily concourſe of ſilly people with
Preſents, for Maſſes to be ſaid in the
Honour of the Saint to their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
Pilgrims flock thither in crowds,
but never with empty hands, leſt the
Prieſts ſhould not make them wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
'Tis well known what infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Riches the Chappel of the Virgin
<hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Loretto,</hi> has already brought,
and is as yet like to bring to the

               </argument>
               <p>Indulgences in their firſt inſtitution
were nothing elſe but a remiſſion of
Canonical Pains; that is, of Pains
inflicted by the Canons of the Church,
which, no doubt, had power like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to remit them: but Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſoon ſtretch'd them farther, and
to other ends, and chiefly to the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of Moneys for the uſe of the
Pope and his Cardinals, who made
the ignorant Mobile believe, that by
faſting, praying in ſome ſet form,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51702:34"/>
and particularly, by paying certain
Sums appointed, according to every
mans ability, they ſhould not only
eaſe the Souls of the departed of
their torments, but likewiſe deliver
them out of Purgatory. This abuſe
ingenuouſly acknowledg'd by ſome
Popiſh Authors, gave occaſion to a
thorow Reformation, firſt in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
and afterwards in moſt parts
of <hi>Europe.</hi> But nothing ſtirr'd up
more the deluded Chriſtian Princes,
to enrich the Popiſh Clergy, than
their being wrought into the belief
of the Prieſts pretended Power over
Chriſts Natural Body; which, if true,
would ſeem to imply likewiſe an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Power over his Political Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
that is, over all the Members of
the Catholick Church. At leaſt, it
is certain the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the firſt as an Article of Divine
Faith, ſince they hold <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi>
to be one: and I may ſafely ſay they
pretend likewiſe to the latter, exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>themſelves above all that is called
God.</hi> But not to alarm too much the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51702:34"/>
world with their ambitious Projects,
they allow the Pope to be Soveraign
in ſpiritual things only, not in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
concerns. This famous diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
narrowly look'd into, is frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and chiefly invented to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the unwary, there being ſuch
a connection between the ſpiritual
and the temporal, that whoſoever
is ſuppoſed to be Maſter of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
may diſpoſe of the latter at his
pleaſure, as whoever Lords over my
Soul, may influence as he pleaſes my
body, becauſe the motions of the
one depend much upon the free or
neceſſary determinations of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
However, to return to what I
firſt hinted at, the pretended Power
of Prieſts over Chriſt's Body, has
been one of the Chief Cauſes, and
the Original Prop of the now Popiſh
Grandeur: For no wonder, if the
Laicks are real Slaves to ſuch as they
look upon as the Makers, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Maſters, in a manner, of Chriſts
Body, ſince they can multiply it,
they ſay, as often as they conſecrate
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51702:35"/>
Bread and Wine. Their Churchmen
owe to this aſſum'd Power the infinite
Treaſures of Gold and Silver they
are poſſeſs'd of, there being few
Churches in any conſiderable City,
but which are richly furniſh'd with
golden <hi>Melchiſedecks,</hi> as they call
them in <hi>Flanders,</hi> or <hi>Suns,</hi> as they
ſpeak in <hi>France,</hi> to lodge the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
Wafer in, beſides Altars of
Maſſy Gold and Silver, Golden Cups
of all ſorts, and other precious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
belonging to the Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of their own hands, Chriſt's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
by an imaginary, that is, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible

Canonization of their Saints is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a groſs Contrivance, to enrich
that part of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church which
reſides at <hi>Rome:</hi> Without Money,

               </argument>
               <p>'Tis upon the ſame account that
Images, not miraculous, are of little
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51702:37"/>
or no value in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Convents,
becauſe they are looked upon but as
barren Ornaments, that ſerve only
to adorn their Walls, and not to
feed their dainty Palates: But their
deſign'd work is done, if they can
but once perſwade the people, that
ſome have been deliver'd from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Diſtempers, by praying to
the Saint before his Image or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
which they never fail to take
evidence of by engaging the Man or
the Woman upon whom the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Miracle is wrought, to hang up in
the Church or Chappel, <hi>ad perpetuam
rei memoriam,</hi> in remembrance for
ever of the wonder, the figure of
that part of the Body, which is ſaid
to be cured, either in Gold or Silver,
or in Wax at leaſt, in caſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
party cannot be at greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences:
Now this Ceremony is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
attended with great Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to the good Fathers, who do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
laugh heartily in their Long

multitude, ſo eaſily decoy'd
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51702:37"/>
into the belief of whatever they
pleaſe to impoſe upon them. Such
another kind of pious Fraud is the
Holy Oyl, or rather Vial, <hi>La Sainte
ampoulle,</hi> which I have ſeen in the
Church of St. <hi>Remigius</hi> of <hi>Reims,</hi> in
<hi>Champagne:</hi> It was brought from
Heaven by a Pigeon, to anoint the
firſt Chriſtian King of <hi>France,</hi> the
Oyl being in a congeal'd-like form,
and made uſe of in the Coronation
of the <hi>French</hi> Kings, without any
real, if you believe the Common
People, or at leaſt, without any
ſenſible diminution of its Subſtance,
becauſe of the little quantity they
take of it, to mix with other Oyls,
in order to the anointing of a new
King: Is it not ſtrange, that ſuch a
groſs and groundleſs Fable as this is,
ſhould paſs ſo current and uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
among ſenſible men, that the
Citizens of <hi>Reims</hi> have created <hi>des
Chevaliers de la Sainte ampoulle,</hi>
Knights of the Holy Vial to be its
Angel-Guardians, leſt any body
ſhould rob them of it: Yet I am of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51702:38"/>
Opinion, leſt I ſhould think them
down-right Fools, that their Zeal
for its preſervation is not ſo much
grounded upon their belief of the
Truth of the thing, becauſe I can
by no means believe 'em ſo ſilly and
ſenſeleſs, as upon the great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
they get weekly and yearly by
keeping it within their own Walls,
firſt from all ſorts of Strangers going
thither very thick, to ſee what ſort
of Oyl is made in Heaven: ſecondly,
from the King and the whole Court,
during their ſtay there, both before
and after the Coronation is over.</p>

to the maintaining and enriching of

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51702:40"/>
of Religious Orders, and now more
frequent Jubilees than formerly were
uſed to be. One of the chief Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
of the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> was
that of the Quality of Chriſt's Vicar-General
upon Earth, not to mention
the Title of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop</hi> they
likewiſe laid claim to: But ſurely
they could not be convinc'd in their
Judgment, that either of theſe Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
did really belong to the Biſhop
of <hi>Rome;</hi> becauſe the firſt is neither
grounded upon Reaſon, Scripture,
nor upon Tradition it ſelf; and the
latter would imply the Biſhop of that
See to be the only Biſhop in the
World, or that none are Biſhops but
by derivation of their Power and
Dignity from the Pope, which is
manifeſtly falſe. Allowing then the
Popes to have been men of Sence, as
undoubtedly they were, they had
certainly ſome other fetch than meer
Ambition, in pretending to ſuch
high and groundleſs Titles: and this
was nothing elſe but the encreaſe of
their Treaſures by the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51702:40"/>
upon this account, of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Ambaſſadours from all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

to the advantage and enriching of the
Citizens, becauſe of the vaſt Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of thoſe Forreigners among them,
whereby they are the better enabled
to pay the Pope's Taxes. The reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
likewiſe of the Generals of moſt
Religious Orders at <hi>Rome,</hi> does not
a little encreaſe his Holineſs's Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue:
For though ſome of them live
in other Kingdoms, yet the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
make their abode there;
and the General Congregations, or
Synods of the Regular Clergy, ſit
commonly upon occaſion in this City,
whither every Province ſends Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or <hi>Procurators,</hi> from other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
to debate and decide Matters
of Concern; which muſt needs
bring great Treaſures to that City,
each Religious Envoy being allowed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51702:41"/>
Fifty or Threeſcore Pound for the
Expence of his Journey, beſides
what he muſt ſpend during his ſtay
in <hi>Rome.</hi> It is likewiſe obſervable,
that whatever Power is given to
Prieſts in Full, Plenary, General In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences
and Jubilees, to diſpenſe
with reſerved Caſes, the Vows made
by Votaries to viſit Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s

alone, that the deluded <hi>Romaniſts</hi>
may be ſtill oblig'd to come, and
ſpend their Money there: But leaſt
the deſign of Intereſt ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered

the Pope never fails to except at the

made by the bigotted Papiſts to go

               <p>But let us leave the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>
to conſider a little how Intereſt plays
its part at the Bar, and in Courts of
Juſtice. I ſhall begin with an Advice
to Clients, not unlike to that which
I gave in the <hi>Diſcourſe of Wit</hi> to Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51702:42"/>
not to truſt too much either to
the undoubted Juſtice of their Caſe,
or to the great Skill of their Lawyers:
For grant they are men both of an
extraordinary Reach and of a very
good Conſcience too; yet 'tis not in
their power to move briskly, and to
the purpoſe about your buſineſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
firſt mov'd by large Fees, either
ready payed, or in proſpect; which
is not ſo much to be aſcrib'd to their
Natural Covetouſneſs, as to the very
Nature of Mankind: for ſince we
generally ſerve God chiefly in hopes
of the Reward, though infinitely
beyond our real merits, as I have ſaid
before, it is not to be expected that
we ſhould behave our ſelves other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
towards men, than upon the
account of proportionable Returns
for the Services done 'em. This puts
me in mind of what a <hi>Scotch</hi> Lawyer
is reported to have ſaid to one of his
Clients, who had delivered up to
him the Papers relating to his Affairs:
The Client calling ſome days after to
know how his Caſe ſtood, and what
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51702:42"/>
hopes he had of gaining his Cauſe,
the Lawyer told him, he could not
read his Papers, though written in a
very fair hand: The Client under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his meaning, preſented him
immediately with Five Broad Peices
of Gold, Two of which the Lawyer
putting between his Eyes, and the
Scrowls told him at the ſame time
he had recover'd his Sight again, and
both could and would peruſe his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
to the beſt advantage, with the
help of ſuch Spectacles. But, for
ought I know of the matter, this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Metal blinded him, and darkn'd
rather than clear'd his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
in caſe he knew the Cauſe he
was to undertake to be unjuſt, or not
to be gain'd but by ſome Trick or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
eaſily found out by experienc'd
Lawyers, if ſufficiently encourag'd
by their Clients. I muſt give you in
this place, ſince it makes for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
a not unpleaſant paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the late Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi>
and the Right Honourable the Earl of
<hi>Rocheſter,</hi> as I heard it related by the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51702:43"/>
latter to the Honourable <hi>Robert Boyle.</hi>
A <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentleman having intreated
the Earl of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> to ſpeak to the
Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> upon the account
of a buſineſs that ſeem'd to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by a clear and undoubted
Right; his Lordſhip, very obliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
promis'd to do his utmoſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to engage the Duke to ſtand his
Friend in a Concern ſo juſt and ſo
reaſonable as his was; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
having conferr'd with his Grace
about the matter, the Duke made
him this very odd return, That
though he queſtion'd not the Right
of the Gentleman he recommended
to him, yet he could not promiſe
him an helping hand, and far leſs
ſucceſs in his buſineſs, if he knew not
firſt the man, whom perhaps his
Lordſhip had ſome Reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal;
becauſe, ſaid he to the Earl, <hi>If
your Lordſhip were as well acquainted
with the Customs of</hi> Scotland <hi>as I am,
you had undoubtedly known this among
others: Show me the Man, and I ſhall
ſhow you the Law;</hi> giving him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,

that the Law in <hi>Scotland</hi>

When the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was
High Commiſſioner for King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Second, in the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
there was held, by his Orders,
in <hi>Holyrood-Houſe</hi> at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> a

to conſult together, whether the

clear, and could admit of no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,

of his being real Fleſh and Blood, if
the conſtant Teſtimony of Seeing,
Feeling, Touching, Taſting, deceive
us, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> tell us they do in

The Prieſts, I ſay, having learned by

were againſt underſtanding
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> betook themſelves to the

great Rewards from King <hi>James</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the firſt occaſion, and from both
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51702:47"/>
King and Pope, by the Mediation of
his <hi>Nuncio</hi> then reſiding in <hi>London,</hi>
in caſe they had to do with Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
And 'twas generally obſerv'd,
that ſuch as went that way to work,
were more ſucceſsful than thoſe who
undertook to argue the caſe with
their Adverſaries, becauſe their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
being generally meer <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſms,</hi>
laid always open the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Arguer as well as of the
Argument. But many more yeilded
to the ſtronger Reaſons from Intereſt,
Worldly Grandeur, and ſuch other
advantages as the Churchmen of
<hi>Rome</hi> are us'd to propoſe to hook
men into the boſome of their Church.
And indeed I often wonder how it
comes to paſs, that they make ſo
few voluntary Converts, ſince they
propoſe ſo great advantages to ſuch
as come over to them, upon what
account ſoever. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand, if I knew not by my
own Experience, the almoſt irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
impreſſion of Divine Grace, and
the great force of the diſcovered
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51702:48"/>
Truth, I ſhould far more wonder,
that a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> could ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to turn <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> becauſe new
Converts are generally either coldly
receiv'd by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> or ſeemingly
miſtruſted by ſuch as having nothing
but the out-ſide of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
are diſpoſed to think others
as great Hypocrites as they know
themſelves to be: So that if an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
and learned <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
turn from <hi>Popery</hi> to <hi>Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
his Converſion to be ſure is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
becauſe he is not allured to our
ſide by any Temporal Advantages to
be expected from us, who commonly
take ſo little notice of new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
that we let them often want
Neceſſaries, if they cannot do for
themſelves: But if a knowing <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi>
ſurrenders himſelf to the weak
<hi>Popiſh</hi> Arguments, I queſtion not in
the leaſt but that he has ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Intereſt in proſpect: For
why ſhould we think that a man
would pull out his Eyes, lay aſide
the uſe of his Reaſon, ſubmit to an

implicite Faith, and turn a Fool for

the ſecret Ambuſhes they have laid,
they overthrow their Enemy, by
rendering him obnoxious to the
Prince's Wrath, or the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth's
Indignation; their next ſtep
is to get into his Employment Civil
or Military, if perhaps he was in a

troubleſome and factious Intrigues

notice of in this place, as if it were
hard to gueſs at the true Cauſe, and
ſecret Spring of the Plottings of great

is one thing not ſo obvious to every

occaſion to the uneaſineſs of moſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51702:51"/>

often Men unfit for buſineſs, to ſay
nothing worſe, are ſet over their

to preſent largely ſome body or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who upon this encouragement
repreſented them to the Soveraign as
Men of great Worth and Integrity,
and fit to ſerve him in any Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whatſoever: But the pity is,
that Kings muſt of neceſſity ſee with

often diſcover, that their ſincereſt
Friends are commonly no partakers

they have not wherewithal to

others leſs deſerving do, or becauſe
they are miſrepreſented to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns,
as if they ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid

'tis in vain to complain of this, and
other Abuſes of this kind to be met

for let Princes take what meaſures
they pleaſe, to give every one his
due, prevailing Intereſt both in

ſuch as cannot go on with their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
by the ordinary methods of

               </argument>
               <p>I have been ſometimes concern'd
to know the true Cauſe of the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> againſt ſuch
as are not of their own Religion,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51702:53"/>
and more eſpecially againſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants:
I was at firſt of Opinion it
was a meer Zeal, like that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
who would have conſum'd
the <hi>Samaritans</hi> to aſhes, for not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
our Saviour into their City:
I concluded then ſometimes with my
ſelf, that their fooliſh perſwaſion of
our being Reprobates, if we die not
in their Communion, was the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the pains they take to pervert
us to their principles, by all poſſible
means, whether lawful or unlawful:
And really the ignorance of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Mob, as likewiſe of the ſimple
and blunt Fryars, is ſo groſs, that
not a few among them are acted by
ſuch a blind Zeal as this is. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
and Clergy of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> are no leſs zealous than the
unlearnedeſt Prieſt, to root out what
they think, and call Hereſie, either
by fair means, if againſt Sence and
Reaſon they can impoſe upon the
unthinking Multitude their new
coin'd Articles, or by the <hi>French</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Converting, and Dragoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51702:53"/>
Men into the Popiſh Religion:
But, no doubt, in all ſuch proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
they propoſe to themſelves ſome
other end than the meer ſaving of
Souls; for I can hardly think them
ſo great Fools, as to believe really
that there is no way to Heaven but
by and through the particular Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now what this is you
may diſcern more diſtinctly by the
following and ſhort account of the
Popiſh Hierarchy and Clergy: The
Power over Chriſt's Natural Body,
aſſum'd by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts in the
Conſecration of Bread and Wine, has
by degrees ſwell'd them ſo big with
the Opinion of their own Authority,
that in the Council, if I miſremem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
not, of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
declared, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Inſtitution of the Sacrament
by Chriſt himſelf in both kinds, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church continued during the
ſpace of Fourteen Hundred Years,
yet they, yea, they forſooth, thought
fit to Order, Command and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51702:54"/>
That the Lay-Chriſtians ſhould
be partakers of the ſame, but under
one kind only, or that they ſhould
eat the Bread alone, without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Cup. If we conſider more
particularly the preſent Condition of
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſhall find,
that there is no Prince in the World
ſo abſolute as he is over thoſe of his
Communion: He abſolveth them
when he pleaſes from their ſworn Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to their Princes; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
as he often expreſs'd himſelf
in his Bulls, to the Power of <hi>Scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>Gathering,</hi> of <hi>Settling</hi> and
<hi>Pulling down,</hi> of <hi>Planting</hi> and <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
up</hi> again at pleaſure, by Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
Excommunication, Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Soveraign Princes, if they
act againſt his Authority, he being
the only Prince in the World inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of doing any wrong, in the
Opinion of ſuch as believe him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.
The Inferiour Biſhops are
of late, but chiefly in <hi>France,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as abſolute, every one in his
own Dioceſs, as the Pope himſelf in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51702:54"/>
that of <hi>Rome;</hi> and generally the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Churchmen are become every
where ſo vaſtly Rich, that their
Treaſures make at leaſt a Third part
of what the Prince they live under
enjoys. You ſhall find in <hi>France,
Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> Convents and Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries
poſſeſs'd of Three or Four
Thouſand Pounds <hi>Engliſh,</hi> of year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Revenue, to maintain Fifteen or
Sixteen lazy Monks, to whom what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is given, or left by Teſtament,
can be of no further uſe to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
as lying buried among them,
without ever circulating any more
thence to the advantage of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
We may now begin to
gather from the Premiſes the true
Cauſe of the Popiſh Zeal, either to
deſtroy or convert Proteſtants, which
is no other, if narrowly look'd into,
but their own Temporal Intereſt,
grounded upon that Natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to maintain and keep what one
has once acquired, by what means ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:
for the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts cannot
but know, that wherever the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51702:55"/>
prevail, they muſt of courſe
loſe their Ground and Authority,
and muſt Lord it no more over their
Brethren, as they now do: So that
if the people were once thoroughly
reform'd, they would put an end,
as they have effectually done in
<hi>England, Germany, Danemark</hi> and
<hi>Swedeland,</hi> to the Tyranny of
the Papiſts over Mens Bodies by
their Antichriſtian Inquiſitions and
Perſecutions, as well as over their
Souls, by an abſolute Command to
lay aſide the Uſe of their Reaſon,
and ſubmit blindly to their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
infallible Deciſions. A thorough
Reformation would likewiſe occaſion
a more equal diſtribution of the
Treaſures the Churchmen of <hi>Rome</hi>
heap up for themſelves, among the
Members of the Commonwealth: So
that the vaſt Riches that are now in a
few hands, would ſoon circulate to
the Relief of the Poor, to the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
encreaſe of Trade, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of Induſtry. No wonder
then if the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> did ſo
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51702:55"/>
much oppoſe a thorough Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for it being made up of Rich
Cardinals, Biſhops, Abbots, Generals
of the Regular Orders, and of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen
of all ſorts, they foreſaw their
Fate, if they diſcouraged the Abuſes
ſlipt into the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Yet
the Popes were ſo afraid, that ſome
knowing, and well-meaning Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, for they were not all
of the ſame Temper, ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the new modelling of their
Church into a better frame, that
they ſuffered nothing to be done in
the Council but by and with the
Conſent of their own Legates, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponentibus
legatis;</hi> which gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

becauſe of the Pope's ſending
his weekly Inſtructions to the Fathers,
with expreſs Orders to act according
to the ſecret Reſolutions of his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-Council.
Let us not then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after

no other thing recommend them to
our Eſteem. There is another thing
to be conſidered in this place, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a-kin to what I was ſaying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
That as the Poor have no
Friends at all, or very few, ſo the
Rich never want great Numbers, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of true or pretended ones, and
that meerly upon the account of their
Riches. When Fortune ſmiles upon
a Man, his Relations, that ſhunn'd
his Company when it frown'd upon
him, flock to him again, as if he
were come from a ſtrange Countrey,
to welcome him home: They now
offer their Services with a Thouſand
Proteſtations of the ſincereſt Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51702:57"/>
to him, whom a little before
they denied to have a Drop of their
Blood in his Veins: But his Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being now alter'd, though he was
degraded at firſt by his Want, he is
reſtored to his Honour again by his
Plenty, to the great ſatisfaction of
his Friends, who on a ſudden are
become his Courtiers, Slaves, and
Creatures too, in a manner, rather
than his Equals, or Superiours: And
ſince ſuch great things are done by
Riches, who can blame Gentlemen,
yea and Perſons of an higher Quality,
for binding their Children, if they
cannot allow them ſufficient Portions
to Tradeſmen, that by their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
they may get in time the only
thing Men are generally valued for;
that is Money: For though upon dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Experience we muſt confeſs it to
be the ordinary occaſion of Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality,
Luxury, Murder, Rebellion,
Sedition, and generally of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rideſt
Crimes; yet on the other
hand 'tis no leſs certain, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
want of this neceſſary Tool, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51702:58"/>
often way for the very ſame ſins
and immoralities: So that a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Fortune is the only thing to be
wiſh'd and prayed for in this World,
leſt we be either tempted to Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
through a too great Plenty, or
preſs'd into Deſpair by the ſting of a
pinching Neceſſity.</p>

               <p>We ought to conſider ſomewhat
more particularly in this place, what
I have but ſlightly hinted at in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
how Men change often their
Opinions, according to the different
appearances of their Intereſt: for
how many have written ſeriouſly for
abſolute Monarchy, who have prov'd
afterwards zealous promoters of a
Commonwealth, when it ſeem'd
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51702:58"/>
more favourable to their Concerns;
in ſo much, that not a few have
contradicted themſelves, by anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe very Arguments, which in
another juncture of Affairs they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to the World, as undeniable
Truths. With what heat was not
the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Intereſt oppos'd
by ſome known Writers, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
better conſider'd of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that is, of their Intereſt, chang'd
their tune ſo ſoon as they ſaw him in
a poſture to ſerve their turns. 'Tis
confeſs'd on all hands, that <hi>Oliver
Cromwell</hi> was both an Uſurper and
a Tyrant, yet the ſame Pen, as I am
inform'd, that wrote for him, wrote
afterwards the deſerved Praiſes of
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second, the undoubted
Heir of the Crown. So true it is,
that a preſent Intereſt repreſenting to
us the worſt of Objects by the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſide, either gives us no time at all
to conſult with our ſelves, if what
we undertake be commendable or
not, or cauſeth us to look upon all
Reaſons contrary to it ſelf, as weak,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51702:59"/>
unconcluding, and of no weight,
though formerly, when our Affairs
were in another ſituation, we took
'em to be true Demonſtrations. We
have a conſiderable Inſtance of what
I do here affirm in a late Biſhop, who
though a Proteſtant, was ſo charm'd
by the Favours he had received, and
hop'd to receive from King <hi>James,</hi>
that he ſtrain'd his Parts to clear the
Papiſts of Idolatry, by ſuch a falſe
Notion of this heinous Crime, that
none but a Man as intereſted as he
was, could have ventur'd to publiſh
it: <hi>His beſt Body of Divinity,</hi> as he
ſaid once, <hi>a Coach and Six Horſes</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
ſometimes a greater impreſſion
upon a covetous Mind, than the
ſtrongeſt Reaſons of the ableſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
not ſupported by a Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Intereſt. Though I doubt not
but that ſeveral of the <hi>French Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi>
have complied in the late perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
againſt the ſevereſt Checks of
their own Conſcience, yet I am of
Opinion, that many of them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
are real Converts to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51702:59"/>
Principles, becauſe Intereſt by
degrees blindeth ſometimes the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
Underſtandings, ſo as to cauſe
Men not only to act, but alſo to
think quite contrary to the firſt
Grounds they built their Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
A Man thus tempted to change
his Religion, begins firſt to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Arguments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as not ſo abſurd as he thought
them to be; then after ſome Debate
with himſelf, he concludes them to
be probable; and laſtly, by the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible
Eloquence of Intereſt, he
believes them to be true. 'Tis much
after the ſame manner, that Men
turn not only Papiſts, but likewiſe
<hi>Mahometans:</hi> For if Worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
did not influence Mens Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſo powerfully as really they
do, how comes it to paſs, that the
very Chriſtians, if not ſo ſoon, at
leaſt very often, a little after they
are conquer'd by the <hi>Turks,</hi> turn
zealous <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and bigotted
<hi>Renegado</hi>'s; the chief Reaſon why
<hi>Mahomet</hi> ordered his Religion to be
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51702:60"/>
propagated by the Sword, being
this, That he thought Temporal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
would draw greater Numbers
to his ſide than any other Arguments
whatſoever. Wherein he was not
much miſtaken, ſince conſidering the
duration of both Religions, the
higher and Divine Inducements to
Chriſtianiſm, have made fewer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
than the Temporal Advantages
he propoſed to his Followers, if it
be true, as I believe it to be,
That the <hi>Mahometans</hi> are now much
Superiour in Number to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
I ſhall add upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That I doubt not but if King
<hi>James</hi> had been ſucceſsful in his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
many, if not moſt of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> had embrac'd Popery by
Force at firſt, and perhaps at laſt by
free Conſent, and a real Submiſſion
of their Judgment to enjoy peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
thoſe Advantages they could
not pretend to without changing
their Principles, it being obſerv'd in

                  <p>1. The Being of God known by its ſelf,
as a Self-evident Principle. 2. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Demonſtrations of the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence

endeavour to deny this important

               </argument>
               <p>Intereſt does not only put Men
upon odd Practices, but likewiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51702:62"/>
very unaccountable Speculations.
I know nothing in Nature ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable
as the Being of God, and
whatever School-Divines teach to the
contrary, I am irreſiſtibly inclin'd
to contradict them, when they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
affirm this Propoſition, <hi>Deus
eſt,</hi> God exiſts not to be a Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Principle: For if God is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Being, as we all conceive him
to be, then this very <hi>Idea</hi> implies
his actual Exiſtency; or if a Being
infinitely perfect be poſſible, as all
Chriſtians ſay 'tis, then to be ſure it
really exiſts, becauſe actual Exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
muſt of neceſſity be reckon'd one,
yea, and the very Foundation of all
his other Perfections. This unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
Demonſtration to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Reader, may be propounded thus
in a few words: <hi>A Being infinitely
perfect, implies no Contradiction;
therefore it actually exiſts;</hi> the firſt
Propoſition is agreed to on all hands
among Chriſtians, and cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
by Atheiſts themſelves, upon any
probable Grounds; the Inference was
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51702:62"/>
proved a little before: but becauſe in
anſwer to the firſt Demonſtration,
the Atheiſts allow no being to be <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi>
I muſt cloſe in with them,
and endeavour their Conviction, by
an unanſwerable Demonſtration,
though I confeſs it neither to be <hi>a
Priori,</hi> as the School-men ſpeak, or
from the Cauſe, becauſe there can
be none ſuch, God being the Firſt
Cauſe of all things; nor <hi>a Poſteriori,</hi>
in the Rigour, or from any Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of God; yet from an undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Falſhood, which muſt needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
upon our allowing with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts,
this Principle, <hi>That all things,
without exception, are contingent;</hi> and
it is in ſhort this, <hi>That all poſſible
things might become impoſſible, if all
things were contingent;</hi> which no man
of common Sence will grant: For
let us ſuppoſe what is really poſſible,
if all things are <hi>contingent,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
actually is, ſince a <hi>contingent</hi>
Being is that which may be, or not
be. Now in this caſe all poſſible
things, that is, all <hi>contingent</hi> things
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51702:63"/>
are impoſſible, becauſe that is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
which has no Cauſe to bring it
out of the boſome of nothing. But
there is no Cauſe to bring <hi>contingent</hi>
things out of the boſome of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
if they once are not in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
therefore they are then abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
impoſſible. That there is no
Cauſe to bring <hi>contingent</hi> things out
of the boſome of nothing, if they
once are not in being, 'tis clear from
the ſuppoſition of nothing actually
exiſting: For firſt, grant to the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt
all things to be <hi>contingent:</hi> And
ſecondly, allow this ſuppoſition
not impoſſible, if all things are
<hi>contingent, that nothing is actually in
being.</hi> Then to be ſure there can be
no cauſe to bring any thing out of
the boſome of nothing; that is, to
produce any thing, becauſe nothing
can act unleſs it have an actual foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
both in Eſſence and Exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which is not here allowed of,
becauſe we ſuppoſe nothing to exiſt;
for ſince the Atheiſt grants all things
to be contingent, he muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51702:63"/>
confeſs, that they may not be; and
in this caſe, as I have ſufficiently
prov'd, they are all impoſſible. From
the Premiſes 'tis clear, That unleſs
we admit of a neceſſary Being that
is the Cauſe of all things we muſt
confeſs againſt the cleareſt evidence
of Reaſon, <hi>That all things poſſible may
become impoſſible, if all things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent,
Quod erat demonſtrandum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe this Metaphyſical way
of reaſoning is not fitted to a vulgar
Capacity, I ſhall endeavour to prove
the Being of God, by ſuch an eaſie
and obvious Argument, that I am
concluded by it my ſelf to believe,
that there can be no ſuch thing as a
down-right Atheiſt, in the groſſeſt
ſence of this word, becauſe all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
being Eye-witneſs of the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Natural Motions, whither in the
Heavens, or in this Globe we dwell
upon, the very dulleſt ſort cannot
but know, that a conſtant Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in Motion muſt of neceſſity
proceed from the over-ruling Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of an Underſtanding Being,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51702:64"/>
ſince no fortuitous Motion can either
be durable or regular: For if the
Stars, for Inſtance, mov'd in their
reſpective Orbs by meer chance, and
not by certain Laws preſcrib'd to 'em
by the Author of Nature God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
could any man be ſo unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as to think, that their riſing,
and their going down, their month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and yearly motions, and all their
other <hi>Phenomena</hi>'s, or appearances,
could prove ſo conſtantly regular as
we obſerve them to be? Would not
thoſe vaſt Celeſtial Bodies, tumbling
up and down thoſe huge Orbs,
without the concurrence of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
Being to direct them,
fall often foul one upon another, and
repreſent to us every Day New Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to look at, by their daily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous
Combinations? Certainly, if
nothing but chance govern this
World, we muſt believe that to be
moſt falſe which we know by daily
Experience to be moſt true, that a
Clock, or a Watch, is made by the
fortuitous concourſe of the Spring,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51702:64"/>

which is neceſſary to ſhew the

luckily, but fortuitouſly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
rais'd all the Cities and Stately
Palaces of great Princes, without any
Architect or Overſeer of the Work,
that the Body of Man ſo admirable
for the Excellency of its Structure, is
not the product of Art, but a meer
fortuitous Coalition of Atomes.</p>
               <p>But though this viſible World
prove to us the Being of God, by
as many convincing Arguments as
there are Creatures in the Univerſe;
yet ſo irreſiſtible is the Impreſſion of

they could give no rational account
why they flatly deny ſuch an almoſt
ſelf-evident Truth: For ſince they

that Vertue is not always rewarded

               <p>'Tis upon the ſame account, that
ſo many fancy themſelves Slaves, and
deprived of all Freedom of Will,
yea, and ſeem to be ſure of what
they ſay, 1. From the Foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God. 2. From our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency
upon him. Yet 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
on the other hand, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Preſcience, or Fore-knowledge,
is not deſtructive to our Liberty,
though I deny not but that our
Actions, becauſe of God's Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
may be call'd, to uſe
a School-Expreſſion, <hi>Hypothetically,</hi>
or <hi>Conſequentially</hi> neceſſary, as the
Fall of a Man into a Precipice, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51702:67"/>
in the ſame ſence, if I ſee
him fall; in which Caſe it cannot be
ſaid, that my looking on throws
him head-long into the Ditch. This
Vulgar Example may help us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
this not inconſiderable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
againſt an experienc'd and felt
Truth, as that of our being free,
and not neceſſary Agents. As to
what is us'd to be ſaid of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency
of our Freedom, in act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with our Dependency upon
God, 'tis but a very illuſory and
frivolous Objection: For though I
be ſuppos'd to act freely, 'tis certain,
that this very Power of acting freely
is from God: <hi>Quid enim habes quod
non accepiſti,</hi> ſays the <hi>vulgate</hi> Edition
of the Bible ſomewhere, <hi>What haſt
thou that thou haſt not received?</hi>
Therefore it cannot be ſaid, that I
do not depend upon God in acting,
unleſs it be firſt made out, that I
have received this Power from ſome
other Being. As then a careful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
giving money to his Son, giveth
him at the ſame time this whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51702:68"/>
and Fatherly Advice: <hi>Though
I leave you to your own Liberty, my
Intention is, that you ſhould make a
right Vſe of this Gold, and not throw
it away upon ſinful Recreations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I am reſolved to puniſh you, if
you apply this Money to other Ends
than I intended it for; and to reward
you, if you comply to my earneſt and
juſt Deſires.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By what this Father ſays to his
Son, we may conceive how God
hehaves himſelf towards us, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us the Power to do good and
evil, but with a Deſign that we
ſhould do good and not evil, leſt
we be ſeverely puniſh'd for omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
what we ſhould have done, the
former being intended, and not
the latter, though we be free to do
either; elſe we could neither be
ſaid to deſerve Praiſe for the one,
nor Puniſhment for the other. To
conclude, we muſt either ſay, that
God could not create Man free;
or in caſe he created him free, that
he allowed him the Power to do
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51702:68"/>
good and evil, and that he is, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
this allowance, abſolute
Maſter of all his Actions, becauſe he
may hinder them when he pleaſes,
by either deſtroying or ſuſpending
the Power they ſpring from. As I
am then of Opinion, That ſome
other Reaſon engageth ſo many
Chriſtians to embrace this immoral
and dangerous Doctrine, ſo I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it to be nothing elſe but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
kind of Intereſt. Though not
a few, I confeſs, of a good Life and
Converſation, deny flatly the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Humane Will to do good
or evil, yet 'tis, I fancy, impoſſible
they ſhould owe their Goodneſs to
this <hi>Predeſtinarian</hi> Principle, becauſe
if once believed, it muſt ſet a man
extreamly at eaſe, and make him
wholly unconcern'd in his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
how unlawful ſoever the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
may be he goes about: For
why ſhould a man ſcruple at any
thing, if 'tis not in his Power not
to do what he does. That I may
be the better underſtood, I ſhall
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51702:69"/>
ſtate the Caſe thus: Suppoſe a man
much ſtronger than my ſelf, laying
hold on me, killeth another man
with my hand, am I guilty of the
Murder, or he, who makes uſe of
my Arm to commit this Crime, in
a manner irreſiſtible on my ſide?
The Application of this Example is
ſo eaſie, and ſo obvious to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Capacity, that I need not enlarge
upon it: For, as no man having his
Wits about him, will think that I
ought to ſuffer upon the account of
the forementioned Murder, which I
could not hinder; ſo I cannot fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
my ſelf liable to be puniſh'd by
the Laws of a Juſt God, becauſe of
my committing a Crime which I
could not poſſibly avoid. 'Tis true
we kill noxious Animals, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the hurt they do, or may do
to the Members of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
but yet we are not ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
as to think them guilty
of Sin upon that account. If then
we follow the <hi>Predeſtinarian</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
we muſt of courſe fancy our
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51702:69"/>
ſelves guiltleſs, whatever Sin we
commit, ſince we have no freedom
to ſhun it. I deſire to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do with Men thus Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,
becauſe if I do them a good
turn, I ſhall not be thank'd for it;
and they being acted in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
Fancy, like meer. Machines
and Slaves, rather than acting like
Free and Rational Men, will not
ſcruple to do me an ill one upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
becauſe in their Opinion they
cannot help the doing of it: for
whether they keep or break the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi>
of God, this is never aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd
by them to choice, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to their irreſiſtible Fate.</p>

to allow us a true liberty of doing
good and evil, and to confeſs upon
all occaſions, That Man is, and
always was a Free Agent; yet
the Chief Freedom they ſeem to
aim at, is that of committing what
Crime they pleaſe, without the leaſt
Check of a Wounded Conſcience,
ſince at the ſame time they maintain
all our Actions to be Neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
forſooth, they are Voluntary;
as if a Horſe, for inſtance, in the
more probable Opinion of his not
being a meer piece of Mechaniſm,
were a Free Agent upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
That he goes on with all
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51702:70"/>
imaginable inclination to eat up the
Hay or Oats in his view. Such men
ground this dangerous Opinion upon
this falſe Suppoſition, That we have
loſt the Liberty that <hi>Adam</hi> enjoyed,
and conſequently, that we have no
Freedom at all to do good or evil,
to obey or not obey: Which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
may eaſily be redreſs'd, if we
conſider, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Liberty conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
in this, That he had the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to do good and evil, to obey or
not obey, with a greater Propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Will, if I may ſo ſay, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the good than towards the
evil; whereas we, through his fault,
are born with a greater inclination
to evil than good, becauſe of our
Original and Hereditary Corruption:
But withal 'tis certain, that we are
free in the foreſaid manner, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Teaching, Preaching, Adviſing,
Commanding to be of ſome uſe or
other to Mankind, or for ſome end
or other: For let men pretend what

with the uſefulneſs either of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51702:71"/>
Counſel or Command, as likewiſe
with the Juſtice of him who pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
me for what I could not
avoid; as for inſtance, Is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
that I ſhould be puniſh'd for
committing a Fornication that I
could not reſiſt? And how could I
reſiſt the Temptation, if I commit the
Crime through an unavoidable Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
as the <hi>Predeſtinarian</hi> Tribe
teacheth us admitting this ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident
Contradiction, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is done voluntarily is done free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and yet neceſſarily at the ſame
time: Whereas the real Freedom,
upon which depends all the Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Immorality of our Actions is
that, and no other, which excludes
all Neceſſity. To be ſhort, our
preſent Condition, notwithſtanding
the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> is ſtill this, that
<hi>We</hi> can freely do good or evil;
whereas the <hi>Elect</hi> in Heaven can do
no evil, and the <hi>Reprobates</hi> in Hell
can do no good; the former being
upon that account moſt happy, and
the latter moſt unhappy, while <hi>We</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:51702:71"/>
are between both, in a meer Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of being either, by the good
or bad uſe of our Free Will. But
ſince 'tis ſo evident that we are free
Agents, or real Actors upon the
Stage of this World, and not meer
Machines, how comes it to paſs,
that many, and thoſe too of good
Reputation in the World, for their
good Life and Behaviour, are of a
contrary Opinion? To this I anſwer,
That whatever other Rational Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

how averſe ſoever we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

much if they ſcruple the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of it, when they conſider

ſo pinching, that 'tis not much

Untruths: They knew very well that

But I need not enlarge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of our Reaſons, that at laſt,
after a thorough Conviction, they
may embrace that which we think
Truth, as if it were not in reality
all one, to force a man to change

the <hi>French</hi> Mob, becauſe of their
preſum'd Intrigues with the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> the moſt powerful Prince
then in <hi>Europe;</hi> yea, 'tis not long
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51702:77"/>
ſince the very <hi>German</hi> Jeſuits were
generally thought inclinable to the
<hi>French</hi> Intereſt, though I am now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
that they begin to look
home again, becauſe of the growing
Power of their immediate Maſter the
Emperour.</p>
               <p>The Remiſneſs of the Moral Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
uſually aſcrib'd to them, is not
ſo much the Product of their real
Sentiments, as of their private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt:
For conſidering that too much
Severity would hinder people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to them for advice in doubtful
Caſes, they thought it was fit and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for their own ends, to give
as much ſcope as poſſibly they could
to Humane Frailty, in order to gain
both the Eſteem and Love of the
people; wherein ſome of them ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
ſo well, that they were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
cryed up for the only heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healing
Phyſicians; yea, and call'd
too by ſome in a Blaſphemous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>The Lambs of God that take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

whatever perplex'd Caſe was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

to 'em by their Votaries, they
were ſure to reſolve it according to
their Inclinations, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the ſtrict Preſcriptions of
the Goſpel, which they never fail'd
to put that Senſe upon they judg'd
moſt agreeable to their own ſecret
Concerns. Thus they found out a
Thouſand Tricks to elude the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of reſtoring other Peoples
Goods and Good Name, with that
unhappy ſucceſs that neither <hi>Simony</hi>
nor <hi>Vſury</hi> were to be met with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Dealers, becauſe of the Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Maxims they had learn'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
both upon Occaſion: But the
World beginning to hearken to the
more Goſpel-like Doctrine of the

Humour of the Age: For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

judg'd it neceſſary for their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

but that there are a great number of

                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:51702:79"/>
The Jeſuits from their very firſt
Foundation have had, it ſeems, a
Deſign to reap the Profit both of
the very begging <hi>Orders,</hi> and of
ſuch as live upon their own Yearly
Revenue. Their <hi>Profeſs'd Houſes,</hi>
as they call them, enjoy all the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
and Priviledges of the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant</hi>
Orders, being maintain'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Publick, or rather Private
Benevolence, very plentifully, and
without ſending about to gather it,
after the manner of the Friars, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
upon call from private hands
enough to ſupply not only their
Wants, but likewiſe their Luxury.
Their Colledges and Seminaries, on
the contrary, are all well founded,
though not all equally rich, either by
Princes or Private Men, or upon the
Ruines of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks, a
part of whoſe Eſtates they have got
into their Hands, both in <hi>France,
Italy,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> by their ſecret
Intrigues at Court, becauſe they are
thought more uſeful to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
upon the account of their
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51702:80"/>
preaching, teaching, and breeding
up every where the Citizens and
Gentlemens Children <hi>gratis</hi> indeed,
and for nothing in appearance,
though they be well paid for their
pains, becauſe they never accept of
a Colledge under Six or Seven Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Pounds <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
beſides what they receive Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
in ſuch Colledges as take Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,
as <hi>Clermont</hi> in <hi>Paris, Ponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſſon</hi>
in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>But to give you ſome further
Hints of what I was ſaying in the
beginning of this Article, of their
covering all their Deſigns with the
faireſt pretences to Piety and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
they pretend always to act
not only for the Glory, but for the
greater Glory of God, this being
the fam'd <hi>Motto</hi> of the Order, <hi>ad
Majorem Dei Gloriam:</hi> Though if
we look narrowly into their real
Projects, they aim more at their
own Glory than at the Glory and
Honour of him they pretend only
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51702:80"/>
to glorifie, inſomuch that they would
not be called <hi>Loyolites,</hi> or <hi>Ignatians,</hi>
from <hi>Loyola</hi> or <hi>Ignatius,</hi> their firſt
Patriarch and Founder, but the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Jeſus,</hi> forſooth, <hi>la Compagnie
de Jeſus;</hi> as if they were the only
People in the World that deſerved
this Title; Whereas none have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
leſs Right to it, becauſe of the
inſufferable Pride they are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and deſervedly too accus'd of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great Deſpiſers of the Secular
<hi>Clergy,</hi> and of all the other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Orders, as looking upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as the chief, if not the <hi>only</hi>
Supporters of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
though they are ſo far from appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
intereſted, and covetous of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for what Service they do the
Publick, that they are oblig'd to
teach, preach, and ſay their <hi>Maſſes,</hi>
without the leaſt hopes of any Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for their pains; yet they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for nothing, and expect to be
conſidered for their very <hi>Maſſes,</hi> not
under the Notion of a Reward, but
of an Alms either given or promiſed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51702:81"/>
before the Work is begun: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Condition is much better
than that of the <hi>Mendicant Friars,</hi>
becauſe the begging Tribe depend
only upon either publick or private
<hi>Charity,</hi> without any Yearly Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue:
Whereas the ſubtler Jeſuits
have got the benefit of both, as I
was ſaying before, their <hi>Profeſs'd
Houſes</hi> being maintain'd by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and their Colledges upon their
own Stock and Fond. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not indeed to take <hi>any Money</hi>
with ſuch as they admit into their
<hi>Society,</hi> yet they have always a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
regard to One of theſe Three
following things in their Choice, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Riches, Quality, or great
Parts: If their <hi>Proſelyte</hi> be rich, let
him be never ſo great a Blockhead,
they are ſure to catch at him greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
If he is of a Noble Extraction,
and well allied, they are likewiſe
for his admittance, becauſe of the
ſupport they get by it from his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Friends; and if he is a Man of
Great, Natural, or Acquired Parts,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51702:81"/>
they think him the fitter for their
buſineſs, which is generally Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Preaching, and Intriguing in
all Courts, and private Families for
their own Ends.</p>

               <p>The Pope's Pretences to Piety and

a favourable Opinion of his

chiefly aim'd at in all his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Apoſtolical Undertakings. 'Tis
not for nothing that he has erected
the Colledge <hi>de propagandâ,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>de congregandâ ſide,</hi> allowing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51702:82"/>
a Yearly Penſion to all Secular
Prieſts employed in the Converſion
of <hi>Hereticks:</hi> Wherein, though ſome
of them perhaps through a miſtaken
Zeal, intend nothing elſe but the
Good of Souls; yet ſure I am the
Governours of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
have a Temporal proſpect upon the
matter of recovering one day thoſe
vaſt Revenues they have loſt, by
the withdrawing of ſo many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the Popiſh Yoke. I doubt
not then but ſome ſilly ignorant
Prieſts may fancy they do God
Service in doing their utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to convert <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to
their Principles; but the <hi>Conclaves</hi>
aim in puſhing them on to the Work,
is the hopes they ſtill are in of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
<hi>Peter's Pence</hi> again, and of
enriching <hi>Rome</hi> once more, as of
old, with the Spoils of <hi>England.</hi>
Now as Children follow commonly
the Example of their Fathers, the
Popiſh Princes imitating exactly the
Popes Politicks, endeavour likewiſe
the Converſion of Mankind to their
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51702:82"/>
principles for the ſame Ends. One
would take the late Kings of <hi>Spain</hi>
and <hi>Portugal</hi> for true Apoſtles, to
judge of them by their apparent
Zeal to convert both <hi>Indies:</hi> The
King of <hi>Portugal</hi> wrote himſelf to
<hi>Ignatius</hi> of <hi>Loyola,</hi> Patriarch of the
Jeſuits, for ſome of his <hi>Society</hi> to
convert the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Faith; and he was ſo earneſt
upon the Matter, that he ſpar'd no
Expences to promote the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
Intereſt in thoſe parts; And
though the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
of the Two, did out-do him
in this political Zeal, ſending great
numbers of Churchmen, of all ſorts,
to <hi>Florida,</hi> to <hi>Mexico,</hi> to the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi>
Iſlands, and other places con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd,
or to be conquer'd by his
Victorious Arms; Yet <hi>Lewis</hi> the
Fourteenth ſheweth himſelf more
zealous than either of them, by
Dragooning his Subjects into <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
The Apoſtles themſelves never
dream'd of his Method of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Souls to the Chriſtian Religion:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51702:83"/>
the only way they underſtood and
practis'd of making <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> was
that of perſwaſion, of preaching,
teaching, arguing, and exhorting.
This Method is far more efficacious;
Turn ye muſt, or burn: The <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooning</hi>
Sword unties ſooner the Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Knots of Religious <hi>Myſteries</hi>
than all the ſubtleſt Arguments ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Philoſophers or Divines.
This is a Secret, till of late, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
and how Antichriſtian ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the only that I can imagine,
or contrive, to make all Nations
outwardly agree as to Matters of
Religion.</p>
               <p>If the ſimpler Mob be of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that the Princes I have
mentioned, undertook the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> meerly upon
the account of Religion, I am ſure
the wiſer ſort of Mankind will both
think and ſay, That Intereſt, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Conqueſt, were their <hi>chief,</hi>
if not <hi>only</hi> Inducements to ſuch Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51702:83"/>
love to flatter them, or are
not clear ſighted enough to ſee
through the ſpecious pretences of
Deſigning Men. For 'tis certain,
that the two firſt had in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
as they have yet at this very
day, the Conqueſt of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and
<hi>Weſt Indies:</hi> Which Attempt they
thought would prove both eaſie,
and without hazard, if they could
once engage the ignorant <hi>Indians</hi> to
ſubmit to an Implicite Faith, and a
blind Obedience to the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> wherein they ſucceeded ſo
well, that the Emperour of <hi>Japan</hi>
became, not without Reaſon, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of the great numbers of the
New Converts in his Dominions;
and upon notice given him by the

Deſign in ſending ſo many Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries

the very Papiſts themſelves confeſs,
that he is no more concern'd for
Religion, whatever he may appear
to be to the ſimpler World, than
if he pretended to none at all; and
that all the noiſe he makes about

comes from a ſecret Ambition of

               <argument>
                  <p>1. Why the Papiſts keep the People in
Ignorance. 2. The Silence of the
Scripture about the Fundamental
Principles of Popery. 3. Why the
Church of Rome allows not of the
Common Vſe of Scripture.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>'Tis, one would think, an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
thing, that the Papiſts
will not allow the Scripture to be
tranſlated into Vulgar Languages;
Yea, nor the publick Prayers to be
either read, or ſaid in a known
Tongue, ſince nothing ſeems to me
more directly contrary to their own
Intereſt, than to keep the People in
Ignorance of the chief Matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to their own Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſo long as they are in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
they may be eaſily carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by the Wind of any Doctrine,
upon the firſt charitable inſtruction,
or friendly invitation to open their
Eyes, and make uſe of their Reaſon,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51702:85"/>
for the chief end God has allowed it
to Mankind; that is, the ſaving of
our Souls: Whereas, while they live
in a ſtate of Ignorance, they are in
a meer Capacity to any thing, by
reaſon of their Want of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Papiſts themſelves could
afford them, if they ſpoke not to
them from the very Altar in a ſtrange
and unknown Tongue.</p>
               <p>But what I wonder moſt at, is this,
that they ſuffer the illiterate Men,
and ſilly Women to ſay their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in <hi>Latin,</hi> which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not, as if the Heart could be
moved without the underſtanding
be firſt illuminated. Whatever may
be the Effect of Ignorance in other
caſes, ſure in this it can never be the
<hi>Mother of Devotion:</hi> For how can a
Man pray heartily to God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when he knows not whether
what he ſays be Senſe or Nonſenſe;
or, for ought he knows of the
whole Matter, downright <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi>
That the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſhould publiſh
the Scriptures in an unknown tongue,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51702:85"/>
'tis odd indeed, ſince they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for all Mankind; Yet not much
to be wonder'd at, becauſe they do
not deſign them to be read by the
unlearned Tribe: But to allow the
unlearned <hi>Mob</hi> to read, and ſay <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
Prayers they underſtand not, is
a thing they can hardly account for.
Nevertheleſs, ſince we know the
Papiſts to be like the Children of
this World, <hi>wiſe in their Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and their Church to be a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
rather than a Religious Body,
we muſt of courſe conclude, that
they do not commit ſuch palpable
Irregularities, but upon a fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of ſome very conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
for themſelves: and this is
chiefly the maintaining of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in their blind Obedience to the
Authority of their Church; which,
notwithſtanding all her pretences to
Infallibility, holds it to be both law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and uſeful for Men to make their
Spiritual Exerciſes in an unknown
Tongue, though this be ſuch a piece
of blind Obedience, as would make
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51702:86"/>
us ſay to God in our daily Addreſſes;
we knew not what, ſince the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
general Intention of the
Church, they pretend to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in this caſe, could never ſupply
the particular want of Knowledge in
what relates immediately to the
good of our Souls.</p>
               <p>Now how Antichriſtian ſoever
you may judge it to be, to keep
the Scriptures, that are God's Letters
Patents to all Mankind, from the
common people; Yet the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are
oblig'd, through a principle of Self-preſervation,
to condemn the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
uſe of ſo dangerous a Book, as
they call the Scripture. And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
it to be ſo for them, as mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no where the fundamental and
diſtinguiſhing Articles of <hi>Popery,</hi> the
Infallibility, I mean, and Univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
the Tranſubſtantiation of the Bread
and Wine into the Body and Blood
of Chriſt, that are now in Heaven,
the Lawfulneſs of Image-Worſhip,
Relick-Worſhip, of Prayers to the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51702:86"/>
Saints, and for the delivery of the
Souls pretended to be in <hi>Purgatory,</hi>
&amp;c. If the people were made ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that theſe things were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
in the Word of God, they
would, without any longer delay,
ſhake off the inſufferable Yoke of
<hi>Popery,</hi> ſince they might ſoon under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
by the daily peruſal of the
Holy Writ, that theſe, and the like
new coin'd Articles are meer humane
Inventions, and not God's reveal'd
Word. The <hi>Papiſt</hi> then, I fancy,
how fooliſh ſoever you may think
him, acts wiſely, and according to
the great Law of Self-preſervation,
in not allowing the people to read
the Scripture, becauſe the common

prove the utter ruine of the <hi>Romiſh</hi>

ſhe had been overcome by the
fair words, and reiterated promiſes
of a deceitful Lover. The Young
Lady having liv'd till then in great
Reputation among her Neighbours,
was thought a true Pattern of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Modeſty, by all that knew
her; Whereas her Siſters were
known to be guilty of lying, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
of detracting of all Mankind;
to ſay nothing of their inſufferable
Vanity and Pride; of their Gaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
late and early, or rather whole
Nights and whole Days, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other immoral Exerciſes of that
kind; for which their godly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
never ſo much as once check'd
them in good earneſt, though upon
the firſt diſcovery of her Eldeſt
Daughters Misfortune, ſhe fell upon
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51702:88"/>
her in ſuch a fury, that had ſhe not

               <p>You may eaſily think I deſign,
by this ſhort paſſage, to tell you, that
ſuch as are meer pretenders to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
mind always more their own
Concerns than thoſe of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
whom yet they ſeem to
honour ſo much with their lips, as
to check and condemn all ſuch as
make not ſo great a ſhow of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
as they upon all publick occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
commonly do. The ſins of the
Siſters I was ſpeaking of, were ſins
indeed againſt God; but the Fault
committed by the Ladies Eldeſt
Daughter, was ſomething elſe, as
being a diſgrace, and a ſtain to
the Family: and that I fancy, this
<hi>Old Lady</hi> was chiefly, if not only
concern'd for; or that her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
by this unhappy accident, had
loſt that which did beſt qualifie her
for a rich, and honourable Match.

What Obligation <hi>Charles</hi>

Party in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:51702:89"/>
'tis too well known to be told
again in this place. How many,
both Noblemen and Gentlemen,
ſtood up for him in the worſt of
Times, to the hazard and loſs of
their Lives and Fortunes, ſuffering
patiently, till he came home again,
the greateſt Extremities that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
and Want could expoſe
them to: Who had not thought but
that upon the Return of King <hi>Charles</hi>
to <hi>England,</hi> they had been all nobly
rewarded for their paſt Services and
Sufferings, for their conſtant loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and daily endeavours to ſet
things again upon their firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation:
And I doubt not but King
<hi>Charles</hi> II. had been very willing to
gratifie, and reward too his diſtreſs'd
Subjects, had he not judg'd ſuch a
piece of Gratitude quite contrary
to his real Intereſt: For conſidering
that ſuch as ſtood up for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
were ſo entirely conſecrated
to his Service, that no hard uſage
on his ſide could break them off
from their loyalty to the Royal line,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51702:90"/>
he thought he could uſe them as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
as he pleas'd; yea, and
ſlight them too without their taking
much notice of it, provided they
were now and then commended
for the conſtant performance of
their Duty in the hardeſt times:
But as for the downright Rebels,
and all ſuch as oppos'd moſt his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
becauſe they were the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Men in the Nation, and the
moſt conſiderable, upon the account
of their Authority among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he very prudently clos'd in
with them, as being the ſureſt props
of his new ſetled Throne. So that
whatever good Service we do to
our Friends, if they find it their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
to make us no Returns for
our Kindneſs, we muſt not rely
too much upon what we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
expect from them, and they
ought to do for us.</p>
               <p>But yet King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second
dealt not ſo harſhly with his real
Friends, as <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth with
the <hi>French Hugonots,</hi> who having
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51702:90"/>
declared themſelves for his Right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the then Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi>
caus'd the whole Kingdom of <hi>France</hi>
to take his part in oppoſition to the
ambitious pretences of that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Antagoniſt. Becauſe every one
is not particularly acquainted with
the Matter of Fact, I ſhall upon this
occaſion give you a particular and
ſhort account of the whole paſſage,
that the World may be thoroughly
inform'd, how injuſtly the <hi>French</hi>
Proteſtants have been dealt withal
by <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great: The Prince of
<hi>Condè</hi> conſidering firſt, That <hi>Lewis</hi>
the Fourteenth was born near Three
and Twenty Years after <hi>Lewis</hi> the
Thirteenth, his Father, was married,
and ſecondly, That this Prince had
been always ſo ſickly and weak, that
ſome doubted very much if he could
be the true Father of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV.
Upon this grounded ſuſpicion, he
immediately declared his Right to
the Crown, as next Heir; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
marching with a powerful
Army towards <hi>Paris,</hi> forc'd the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51702:91"/>
the Queen, and the Young
King to fly as far as <hi>Amiens,</hi> before
any of the <hi>French</hi> Cities would take
notice of him, till the Cardinal ſent
to the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> to deſire their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in ſuch a dangerous Juncture
as that was: Who unanimouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
to give him all the Succours
they could raiſe for his Service,
frightn'd the Prince back again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
executing his Deſign. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
upon the News of his Retreat,
the ſtrong Cities, that till then had
ſhut up their Gates, not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the flying King, but furniſhing
him with all Neceſſaries, enabled
him to march back to <hi>Paris</hi> again
with an Army, where though op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
at firſt by <hi>Madamoiſelle,</hi> he
was at laſt admitted with great
ſhouts and acclamations of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Though this was ſuch a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
piece of Service, as deſerved the
greateſt reward; yet when the King
came to age, in a great Council
held in his preſence, the thorow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> was fully
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51702:91"/>
reſolved upon: Which ſo ſtartl'd the
King himſelf at firſt, that he told
plainly his Counſellours, He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
been inform'd, That the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi>
had ſettl'd the Crown upon his
Head, in oppoſition to the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi>'s aſpiring Ambition: But it was
immediately reply'd by the Council,
That for that very Reaſon he ought
to leave no ſtone unturn'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
'em, <hi>becauſe if they had been
not very long before powerful enough to
ſettle the Crown upon his Head, they
were then able enough, if they pleas'd,
to pull it off again.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. That Riches change Mens Tempers.
2. And why. 3. What the Papiſts
us'd to ſay of the New Converts in
the late Reign.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>'Tis commonly ſaid, That a change
of Fortune for the better, alters
a Man's Humour and Temper;
<hi>Honores mutant Mores.</hi> But it's not
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51702:92"/>
obvious to every common Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
why it does ſo: For
though it be generally true, That
Men become prouder by great Riches
acquired, and Eminent Dignities
conferr'd upon them, it muſt be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inquir'd, what is the true
Cauſe of this Pride, which renders
them ſo unſociable to ſuch as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were their Equals and Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
May not I then be allow'd to
ſay, That their Pride being perhaps
more affected than real, 'tis chierly
grounded upon Intereſt; which I
make out in ſhort thus: If Men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they are promoted to great Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
whether Eccleſiaſtical or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
behav'd themſelves towards their
once familiar Acquaintances with the
ſame Exteriour Humility and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Heart they were us'd to do
before their promotion, they would
be forc'd, in a manner, to make
them ſhare in their Eſtates likewiſe,
as well as in their intimate Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:
'Tis then a piece of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in them, according to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51702:92"/>
Maxims of Self-intereſt, to
break off all intimacy with their
old, if poor, Friends, leaſt
they be ſolicited to ſupply their
Wants, to the leſſening of what
they themſelves muſt ſpend in Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities:
And for this very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
I am of Opinion, That the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociableneſs,
if I may ſo ſpeak, of
moſt men under the Circumſtances
we are diſcourſing of, comes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
from their greedineſs to keep
what they have got, leſt by their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
with their former Friends,
they be oblig'd, in point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
not to let them want upon
occaſion: For 'tis generally obſerv'd,
That the ungratefulneſs of moſt men
to their trueſt Friends, and greateſt
Benefactors, is always to be aſcrib'd
to their unreaſonable Covetouſneſs
upon the ſudden change of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
either becauſe of their great
and neceſſary Expences in a higher
poſt, or upon the account of their
new ambitious projects they muſt lay
up for, being never contented with
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51702:93"/>
their preſent condition, how flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
ſoever, becauſe the more
they have, the more they covet;
<q>Quo plus ſunt potae plus ſitiuntur
aquae.</q>
Upon this account we may truly
ſay, That all Men are equally poor,
and in Want, becauſe no man thinks
he has enough to anſwer his preſent
occaſions: So unſatisfied we ſtill are
with the plentifulleſt Enjoyments of
this World. Since then, in all our
Attempts, we purſue always our
own Intereſt, notwithſtanding our
pretences ſometimes to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
we ſhall be reckon'd to act like
Politicians, if we mind what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
advantage every man aims at,
that ſo knowing what he may be
gain'd by, we may take our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
accordingly, for our own ends.
This Maxim being carefully obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the late King, in preferring
upon all occaſions the New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
to confirm them in his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51702:93"/>
by the actual poſſeſſion of that,
the very hopes of which had brought
them over to it, gave occaſion to
the old <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to ſay,
<hi>That the Kings Papiſts got all, but

either by Penſions or Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
whereas ſuch as were bred

were commonly ſlighted, or ſeldom
taken notice of, becauſe 'twas thought
that the latter being Papiſts by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
would not eaſily leave their
Religion; and that the former being
only ſo through Intereſt, could not
ſtay long in it without a preſent and
competent Reward.</p>

to a diſcerning Eye in the wonderful

we are ſurrounded with on all ſides,
and not think, at the ſame time of

of him, <hi>qui lucem habitat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſibilem;</hi>
who inhabiteth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible

as being thrown into the
midſt of the <hi>Vortex,</hi> or Heaven we
are inclos'd in, without either foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

Fingers as it produceth Plants

Wiſdom, and Goodneſs of an inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
God? And can we, opening our
Eyes, look upon the orderly ebbing
and flowing of the Ocean, without
raiſing our Minds towards him, who
has ſet bounds to the Sea? To be
ſhort, we need not conſult Books
about the Being of a God, nor read

the inviſible things by ſuch as
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51702:95"/>
are viſible, and obvious to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Eye. Since then, as I was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before, nothing is ſo viſible, in
ſome ſenſe, as God himſelf in the
Works of his Power; I muſt, in
purſuance of my Deſign, inquire in
this place, why men have Eyes, and
ſee not what they may ſee, with the
leaſt attention, in every Object of
their very Senſes:

               </p>
               <p>If we gaze a while at a great and
ſtately Palace, beautified with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Art and Wit can contrive, we
call preſently to mind either the
Architect or the Owner, admiring
both the Skill of the one, and the
Riches and Power of the other,
who could raiſe at his own Expences
ſuch a ſtately Building: Now can
we imagine any Earthly Palace in
the leaſt comparable to the World it
ſelf, either as to Beauty or Statelineſs,
the very Roof, if I may ſo ſpeak, or
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51702:95"/>

               <p>But to come to a Concluſion upon
the whole Matter, What is the True
Reaſon why beholding daily and

mean the World we live in, we ſcarce
ever enquire either after the Maker
or the Owner, who are both in this

God himſelf? 'Tis eaſie to gueſs
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51702:96"/>
what I muſt anſwer to this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not ſo much in order to follow
out my deſign, as becauſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Truth of the Matter of
Fact, That Temporal Intereſt ties
our Hearts ſo ſtrongly to Earthly
Things, that moſt men behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
no otherwiſe than if they
look'd upon the very Fundamental
Article of all true Religion, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a God, as a meer Politick
Contrivance to frighten the ſimpler
ſort into Honeſty and Morality; Or
if they are not throughly ſo guilty,
conſidering how they ſpend their
whole life in Gaiming, Trading,
Fighting, Eating, Sleeping and
Drinking, without having perhaps
ever thought once ſeriouſly of a
God, we have Reaſon to think, that
their whole Soul is ſo applied to their
worldly concerns, that they never
remember of a <hi>Deity,</hi> unleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

Years without making that uſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51702:96"/>
of this Viſible World 'twas chiefly

how it comes to paſs, That the

it being undeniable, that they may,
and do burn as often, if not oftner

preſcrib'd by the Scripture it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſuch an ordinary frailty? Sure
they cannot pretend to a greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,

in their Opinion, are really ſinful,
If it be a ſin to put a ſtop, as much
as in us lies, to the propagation of
Mankind, in a lawful way, though

the Creation; or if it be a ſin, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to reject the very Remedy God

that is, againſt <hi>Burning;</hi> or to ſay

they are in a ſtate of Damnation,

               </argument>
               <p>Publick Protection given to lewd
and debauch'd Women, is ſuch a
piece of Scandal, that <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf
might be aſham'd of it: But the
leaſt ſmell of Gain out of any thing
whatſoever, <hi>dulcis odor lucri,</hi> &amp;c.
being ſo ſweet and comforting, we
need not wonder to ſee the Pope
himſelf ſlight his own Good Name
and Reputation for a Yearly Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
he gets by protecting ſuch Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
as give themſelves up to the
publick Luſt. Though the Matter
of Fact be very certain, and no
where doubted, yet becauſe the
manner is not ſo generally known,
I ſhall give you a true and ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51702:99"/>
of it upon this occaſion: When
Women are reſolv'd to turn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
looſe, they are oblig'd to make
their appearance before Two Publick
<hi>Notaries,</hi> or before Two Judges, in
order to renounce ſolemnly their
Names, Families, and Reputation:
Which being perform'd in the uſual
manner, they are allowed a <hi>free
Trade,</hi> provided firſt they live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in certain noted places; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
ſecondly, they wear ſomething
or other they may be known by; and
thirdly, that they fail not to pay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Year a certain Sum into the
Pope's Exchequer for their Freedom.
The <hi>Romans</hi> chief Apology for ſuch
an unchriſtian Toleration, is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of ſhunning a greater Crime,
I do heartily abhor to name, as well
as to think on, otherwiſe, they ſay,
unavoidable in that Climate, if the
former <hi>Conveniencies</hi> were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of: which, they add, is ſo
true, that one of the Popes having
baniſh'd all the Courteſans, was not
only forc'd to call them back to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51702:99"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> again, upon his Diſcovery of
a greater and daily abomination, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
by their abſence; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
that there might be nothing
wanting on his ſide for putting a
ſtop to one ſin, and promoting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
caus'd a conſiderable Sum of
Money to be diſtributed among
them, to enable them to buy ſuch
things as might fit them the better
for the uſe they were deſign'd for.
So one only among the Popes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to clear <hi>Rome</hi> of lewd Women,
and, for ought I know, none will
ever attempt the like again, becauſe
of the Conſiderable and Yearly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
the Apoſtolick Chamber gets by
thus indulging Humane Frailty. 'Tis
true, there is a Monaſtery appointed
for the uſe of the Repenting Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans:
But through this very pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Zeal, we may eaſily diſcover a
real Deſign of Gain and Intereſt:
For ſince 'tis certain, that the Pope's
Revenues are Yearly better'd by the
multitude of the Courtiſans, there
could be no Contrivance ſo plauſible,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51702:100"/>
nor ſo uſeful for the Pope's Deſign,
as that of a Monaſtery, or Retreat
for them in their Old Days, when
ſin has left them, becauſe Young
Women conſidering, that they can
provide for themſelves, with the help
of the <hi>allowed Trade,</hi> during their
greener and flouriſhing Years; and
that they are ſure to be provided for
when Old Age comes on, in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery
deſign'd for them, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
thereby encourag'd to
turn Courtiſans, upon ſuch a fair
proſpect of never wanting neither
Young nor Old, in caſe of a true
or feign'd Repentance.</p>
               <p>But what I have ſaid of <hi>Rome,</hi> I
may likewiſe ſay of a very Reform'd
City, <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> and that Intereſt
obligeth not only the Papiſts, but
alſo the beſt ſort of Chriſtians to
connive ſometimes at the greateſt
Crimes and Abuſes. The <hi>Muſick-Houſes,</hi>
as they call them in <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
are allowed of by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
all the Year round, becauſe of
the Money ſpent daily there, to the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51702:100"/>
great benefit of the City, by lewd
Women, and ſuch as come to meet
them in theſe places. As I could
not but diſcover ſometimes my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
concern to ſee a Reform'd
City guilty almoſt of the ſame abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
we ſo often reproach <hi>Rome</hi>
with, I was told by an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Hollander,</hi> That the Toleration
of the forementioned Houſes, how
ſcandalous ſoever, was very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
and politically allowed of by
the Magiſtrates of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> upon
this account, that the Pay near of
Twenty Thouſand Seamen comes
home to them that way again, it
being generally obſerv'd, that ſuch
Houſes are moſt reſorted to by idle

end; Godly, I ſay, at leaſt in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
as thinking that Piety
which the Scripture ſays is uſeful for
all things, <hi>utilis ad omnia Pietas,</hi> may
likewiſe be uſeful for the getting of

concern'd to do ill, than to do ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
becauſe by the former they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
God only, whereas by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they commonly give offence to
men, whom they regard more than
him they ought only to fear: Upon
this account 'tis that they are careful
to avoid no ſin but that of Scandal,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51702:101"/>
being ready, upon any advantage, to
lye, cheat, and murder, to commit
Theft, Fornication, and Adultery,
if they can but do it ſecretly: They
are, I fancy, of the <hi>Italians</hi> Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That <hi>what is not known is not
done;</hi> that is, as good as not done,
becauſe it puts no ſtop to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of their Intereſt ſo long as hid,
and kept from the knowledge of
ſuch as would be very loth to help
them either with their Purſe or Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
if they were inform'd of their
ſecret Life and Converſation. Since
then the World is ſo deceitful, for
our own private meaſures we ought
particularly to take notice of ſuch as
court us unexpectedly, and at an
extraordinary rate, with a ſhow of
Humility and Modeſty, beyond their
Temper and Cuſtom upon other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
becauſe, to be ſure, they
either intend to put a Cheat upon
us, or to obtain from us, or by our

But thoſe ſort of Hypocrites are moſt
of all guilty, who under the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51702:102"/>
pretence of Religion, cover their

as generally the Papiſts do,
when pretending to gain our Souls,
they aim chiefly at our Goods and
Eſtates, as may be eaſily made out by
whatever they have undertaken of
moment, either at home or abroad;
and I wiſh I had no reaſon to ſay,
That they are not imitated in this by
ſome of the Reform'd part of the
World, who tho they pretend not to
Infallibility, act nevertheleſs, as if
they believ'd themſelves infallible, in
depriving, either directly or indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of their Eſtates all ſuch as cannot
in Conſcience conform to their way
of Worſhip: Which gives us juſt
grounds to ſuſpect, that this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Concern is the chief thing they
aim at, notwithſtanding all their

<hi>Woes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Wo unto you Scribes

for ye ſhut up the kingdom
of Heaven againſt men; for ye neither
go in your ſelves, neither ſuffer ye
them that are entering to go in.</p>
               <p>2. Wo unto you Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,
Hypocrites; for ye devour Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows

long prayers: therefore ye ſhall receive
the greater damnation.</p>
               <p>3. Wo unto you Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,
Hypocrites; for ye compaſs Sea
and Land to make one Proſelite, and
when he is made, ye make him two-fold
more the child of Hell than your
ſelves.</p>
               <p>4. Wo unto you ye blind guides,
which ſay, Whoſoever ſhall ſwear by
the Temple it is nothing, but whoever
ſhall ſwear by the Gold of the Temple,
is a debter.</p>
               <p>5. Wo unto you Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,
Hypocrites; for ye pay the Tithe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51702:103"/>
of Mint, and Anniſe, and Cummin,
and have omitted the weightier matters
of the Law, Judgment, Mercy, and
Faith; theſe ought ye to have done,
and not to leave the other undone.</p>
               <p>6. Wo unto you Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,
Hypocrites; for ye make clean the
out-ſide of the Cup, and of the Platter;
but within they are full of Extortion
and Exceſs.</p>
               <p>7. Wo unto you Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,
Hypocrites; for you are like unto
whited Sepulchres, which indeed appear
beautiful outward, but are within full of
dead mens bones, and of all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

though little reflected on, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of the very Houſe of God, the
Church, to make ſuch a Figure in it,
as may either occaſion an inward
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51702:107"/>
Conſent to ſin in the weak behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
or withdraw the attention they
ought to give to the Preacher. This
practice of wearing coſtly Apparel
on the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> though contrary
to the Primitive Times, is ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
upon the account of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
Intereſt, which is, in ſhort,
this, That as not a few ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in all their Glory in the Church,
upon a ſecret Deſign of enſnaring
ſome of their Admirers for their
own private ends; ſo others do it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a more honeſt account, That
ſpreading their Nets after ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting
way, they may catch at laſt
good and rich Husbands.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. The Cheats of Vulgar Chymiſts.
2. The Three beſt Catholick Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
3. Method of little uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Chronical Diſtempers.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I always look'd upon Chymiſtry as
a moſt neceſſary and uſeful Study,
though I have but very little Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for the common Chymiſts, and
ſuch among them as have neither the
Skill nor the Honeſty of the deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
Famous <hi>Robert Boyle,</hi> of whoſe
Chymical Preparations I can ſay upon
my own Experience, That they are
the beſt that ever I tried in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of <hi>Europe:</hi> But the Fault
I find with the generality of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Tribe of Chymiſts, is this, That
they all pretend to <hi>Panacea</hi>'s, to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
or Univerſal Remedies, as
<hi>Potable Gold, Miraculous Liquors,
Powders</hi> and <hi>Elixirs</hi> of all kinds and
Names, in order to get great Rates
for what coſt them but little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51702:108"/>
their Pains excepted: For
when the pretended Secret is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
'tis ſometimes found not to
be ſo much as Diſtill'd, Calcin'd, or
Chymically prepar'd: As it happen'd
to <hi>Talbot</hi>'s Famous <hi>Febrifuge,</hi> thought
at firſt in <hi>France</hi> ſome Extraordinary
and Excellent Chymical Preparation:
Whereas it was known at laſt by
what the <hi>French</hi> King's firſt Phyſician
publiſh'd of it, in a <hi>French</hi> Treatiſe,
to be nothing elſe but the <hi>Jeſuits
Powder,</hi> ſometimes taken in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
ſometimes in a Tincture,
with ſeveral harmleſs Additions, to
hide it the better from the Eyes of
the Curious: yet if all the Chymical
Remedies, and pretended <hi>Panacea</hi>'s
were as powerful againſt moſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,
as the <hi>Peruvian Bark,</hi> if
skilfully handled, is againſt Agues,
and intermitting Fevers, I ſhould
neither think the Praiſes commonly
given them, for Intereſt's ſake, by
deſigning men, too great, nor their
Price, whatever it were, unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
But daily Experience teacheth
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51702:109"/>
us, That generally the common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Panacea</hi>'s, are either meer
harmleſs things, whether ſimple or
compounded, or at the beſt, but
ordinary Remedies, under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
of a <hi>Vehicle,</hi> of a peculiar Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
or Mixture. Though I
grant indeed, That there are ſome
Excellent, and ſcarce ever failing
Remedies againſt ſome particular
Diſtempers; ſuch I reckon to be the
Powder made of the <hi>Peruvian Bark,</hi>
againſt Agues, <hi>Opium</hi> for allaying of
Pain, the Solution of Seed-Pearl by
a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> neither <hi>Vrinous, Acid,</hi>
nor <hi>Alcoliſate,</hi> againſt Conſumptions
and inward Decays, againſt Heats,
Morphew, Wrinkles of the Face,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> if outwardly applied: Yet I
do affirm, That becauſe of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
infinite Variety both of Mens
Tempers, and Diſtempers, we muſt
confeſs, and upon daily Experience
too, That there is no <hi>Panacea,</hi> or U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal
Remedy of all the Infirmities
incident to Humane Bodies yet ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
upon; and that whoever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51702:109"/>
to ſuch a rare piece of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
deſigns, in all likelihood, to
put a Cheat upon Mankind, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt's
ſake: I ſhould nevertheleſs
be miſunderſtood, if I were thought
not to put a greater value, in ſome
Caſes, upon a good Remedy, than
upon the moſt rational Method, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſuch a help: For though Method
in acute Diſtempers be abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
nevertheleſs againſt confirm'd
and Chronical Infirmities, 'tis of little
or no uſe without a good Tool: So
that all the Aphoriſms, either of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrate,</hi>
or others, will avail but little
to the ableſt Phyſician call'd to cure
an old and inveterate Diſeaſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Knowledge of a good <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,</hi>
or of a Medicine known by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
to be prevalent in ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
if skilfully prepar'd and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
preſcrib'd.</p>
