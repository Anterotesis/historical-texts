         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Rebells under the pretence of ſaving the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,
Phillip</hi> of <hi>Relley,</hi> told the people of <hi>Belturbet</hi>
that hee came to ſave them from the enemy, and
wiſhed them to ſee what weapons every man had, and to
bring them to him, which the poore people did, and when
hee had gotten the weapons, he cauſed them preſently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man to goe into their Houſes and not to ſtirre till hee
called on them, but as ſoone as they were in, they cauſed
the doores to be made faſt, and a guard at every doore, and
then the falſe villaines began to pillage them, but ſtill
promiſing them faire quarter, and that they ſhould have
their goods againe, and carriages to carry them away
which he did, but no ſooner had they put up their goods,
but preſently it was taken from them, and every man wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and child ſtripped naked and ſent away towards <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
where they told them that they ſhould have but cold
entertainement for it was taken, but they lyed I thanke
God: but when they heard the plott was diſcovered, the
Rogues were ready to hang themſelves, which no good

time paſt I hope they will be hang'd or killed. There did
come in one company at leaſt 1500 men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and they all were ſtarke naked as my poore Vnckle
<hi>Swamſon</hi> told me, and no ſooner did they get a ragg to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their nakedneſſe, but a Rogue of ten yeares old would
ſearch them, and if it were worth the taking they would
have it, and had their skenes in their hands to kill any that
did reſiſt, and were robbed 22 times before they came to
the <hi>Cavane,</hi> and many killed and ſtarved with the cold,
the like damnable and inhumane doing was never heard of
before they tooke the ſucking children, and ſtript them
and flung them with pitchforkes into the River, and they
tooke above a hundred of the diſtreſſed ſoules and broke a
wodden bridge that they were to goe over, &amp; made them
goe over the broken bridge that they were all drowned,
and ſuch as could ſwimme, they went on both ſides of the
River and killed them with ſtones and clubs: in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
was Maſter <hi>Follerton</hi> my Lord Primates Chaplaine,
and he would not ſting himſelfe into the River, but ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himſelfe to bee cut in peeces, and one more with him,
ſuch as they got with them to Maſſe for feare, the next
day they would tell them, now that wee have ſaved your
ſoules wee will hang you, and did one Maſter <hi>Midleton;</hi>
they killed my coſin <hi>Francis Sullian</hi> in his wives armes, and
had almoſt cut her fingers off becauſe ſhee would not let
him goe, and after dragged him in the dirt, they tooke
one, <hi>Trafford</hi> a Miniſter at <hi>Longford,</hi> and ripped up his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
this your Vnckle <hi>Iohn</hi> told mee, who ſcaped very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
from them; they got one <hi>Sharpe</hi> a Miniſter at the
<hi>Navane,</hi> and cut him in peeces, and his poore wife think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63526:3"/>
of <hi>Derry</hi> his brother in law at <hi>Caſhell</hi> and ſtripped him, and
whipt him about the ſtreets, and after put him in the
ſtockes, and there he remained ſtarke naked till they were
going to Maſſe, then they put an old ragg about him, and
pricked him behind with their ſwords and skenes into
Maſſe, and whether hee be dead or alive it is not knowne,
this <hi>Deane Thrope</hi> told me: nay there is a more inhumaine
thing then all this, the damned Rogues did ſerch the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
privie parts for money, and would make the poore
good women to dance naked with a bagpipe, and beeing
neere a Thatcht houſe the poore ſoules would catch of the
ſtraw, and hold it before them, but the Rogues would
catch it from them: againe I could ſend you ten times
