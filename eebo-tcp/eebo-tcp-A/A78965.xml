         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
RIGHT HONOVRABLE
Thomas Adams Lord Mayor, and
to the Right Worſhipfull the Sheriffes
and the Aldermen his brethren, and
the reſt of the Common-Councell.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Read in the Book of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that when
the <hi>wall</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was in building, the
<hi>builders</hi> met with ſo much <hi>oppoſition,</hi> that
they were forced to build with their <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons</hi>
in one hand, and with their <hi>working
tools</hi> in the other. They had <hi>enemies</hi> from without, and
they had ſecret enemies amongſt themſelves. They met
with many diſcouragements; but <hi>God</hi> carried them
through all, and at laſt they finiſhed the <hi>wall</hi> to the
confuſion of their enemies, and the rejoycing of their
friends. <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> condition is our condition. The
<hi>Diſcipline and Government of the Church,</hi> is to the <hi>Church</hi>
as a <hi>wall</hi> is to a <hi>City.</hi> A <hi>City</hi> without <hi>wals</hi> is expoſed to
every enemy: ſo is the <hi>Church</hi> without a <hi>Government.</hi>
This <hi>wall</hi> is now in building: the <hi>Parliament</hi> (bleſſed
be <hi>God</hi>) hath contributed very much to this building;
but yet we meet with mountains of oppoſition, and with
many diſcouragements. Our enemies ſay, <hi>What doe
theſe feeble Presbyterians meane? will they fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
will they make an end in a day? will they revive
<pb facs="tcp:113468:3"/>
the ſtones out of the heaps of the rubbiſh which are burnt?
Even that which they build, if a Fox goe up, he ſhall even
break down their ſtone-wall.</hi> Our enemies alſo raiſe falſe
reports to weaken the <hi>hands</hi> of the <hi>builders,</hi> and to
make us afraid, as they did, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6. 6. 10. They ſay, that
the <hi>Presbyterian Government</hi> (which is the <hi>Government</hi>
that comes neereſt the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Government</hi> of the
beſt Reformed Churches) will prove <hi>Tyrannicall,</hi> and
<hi>Epiſcopall.</hi> And that it is better to be under one <hi>Biſhop</hi>
then under a <hi>hundred.</hi> But we anſwer, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did,
Neh. 4. 4. <hi>Hear ô our God, for we are deſpiſed; and turn
their reproach upon their own head.</hi> And as Neh. 6. 9. <hi>Now
therefore, ô our God, ſtrengthen our hands.</hi> But that which
is worſer then this, is; that our ſeeming friends ſeek
to undermine us, and to terrifie us, and ſay, as <hi>Neh.</hi> 4.
11. <hi>They ſhall not know, neither ſee, till we come in the
midſt among them, and ſlay them, and cauſe the work to
ceaſe.</hi> And others are ready to diſcourage us, and ſay as
it is, <hi>Neh. 4. 10. And</hi> Judah <hi>ſaid, The ſtrength of the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbiſh, ſo
that wee are not able to build the wall.</hi> It is impoſſible
(ſay ſome) to purge our <hi>Churches</hi> according to the <hi>rule,</hi>
they are ſo full of <hi>rubbiſh,</hi> and therefore it is better and
ſafer to ſtudy <hi>Separation</hi> from, rather then <hi>Reformation</hi>
of our <hi>Churches.</hi> But yet notwithſtanding all theſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
and diſcouragements, I doubt not but <hi>God
Almighty</hi> will in his due time finiſh this <hi>wall</hi> of his,
and ſo perfect his own work, that all the <hi>enemies</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſhall <hi>caſt down their eies, and perceive that this work
was wrought of our God,</hi> Neh. 6. 16.</p>
            <p>For the effecting of this bleſſed work, God hath
raiſed us up a <hi>happy Parliament.</hi> And alſo <hi>God</hi> hath raiſed
you up (<hi>Right Honourable, Right Worſhipfull,</hi> and <hi>the reſt
<pb facs="tcp:113468:3"/>
of the Common Councell</hi>) and hath raiſed up your <hi>ſpirits</hi>
to ſtrengthen our hands to this work, and to build the
<hi>wall</hi> together with us, (each of us in our places) that
ſo the <hi>Church</hi> may no longer lye waſte, and open
to all <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and that we may be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
a <hi>reproach</hi> to all other reformed Churches. This
work by your help will quickly bee finiſhed, as it is
written, Neh. 4. 6. <hi>So we built the wall, and all the wall
was joyned together unto the half thereof, for the people had
a minde to the work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The times wherein you live are indeed very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome:
but be not diſcouraged; for it is foretold, <hi>Dan.</hi>
9. 25. <hi>That the wall of Jeruſalem ſhall be re-built, even in
troublous times.</hi> And let me ſay to you as <hi>Mordecai</hi> to
<hi>Eſther,</hi> Eſther 4. 14. <hi>Who knoweth whether God hath not
raiſed you up to be Mayor, to be Sheriffs, Aldermen, and
Common Councell men for ſuch a time as this is?</hi> Go on
courageouſly, and <hi>God</hi> will trouble thoſe that trouble
you, and bring good to you, and to the <hi>Church</hi> out of
theſe troubles. We reade of the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> that
when the <hi>water</hi> was <hi>troubled,</hi> then it became a <hi>healing
water.</hi> The <hi>untroubled water,</hi> was an <hi>unhealing water.</hi>
So will <hi>God</hi> doe with you; he will make the <hi>troubled
waters</hi> of the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> to become <hi>healing waters:</hi> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as we all ſhall ſay, <hi>Periiſsemus niſi periiſſemus;</hi> We
ſhould have been <hi>undone</hi> had we not been <hi>undone.</hi> One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be <hi>ſtrong and of a good courage:</hi> I ſay it again, <hi>be
ſtrong and of a good courage.</hi> I ſay it the third time (for
ſo did God to <hi>Joſhua</hi> in 4 verſes, <hi>Joſhuah</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8, 9.
<hi>Be ſtrong of a good courage.</hi> The Lord hath made you
inſtruments to doe much good for <hi>Church and State;</hi> the
ſame <hi>God</hi> make you every day more and more inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:113468:4"/>
And be not <hi>terrified and diſmayed</hi> becauſe of the many
<hi>Hereſies and Errors</hi> that are in the City. For as when the
<hi>wall</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was once built, all their enemies did
immediately vaniſh into nothing, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6. 16. So when
the <hi>wall of the Church</hi> ſhall be once erected, I doubt not
but theſe <hi>prodigious errours</hi> will all vaniſh.</p>
            <p>And as when the Sun ariſeth, all <hi>wilde beaſts</hi> goe to
their <hi>dens;</hi> ſo when the bright <hi>Sun of Chriſts kingly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
ſhall appear in our <hi>Horizon,</hi> I truſt all theſe
<hi>beaſtly errours</hi> will betake themſelves to their <hi>dens</hi> of <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity</hi>
and <hi>oblivion.</hi> It was ſaid of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> that when
he was firſt <hi>Emperour</hi> he found <hi>Rome</hi> in a <hi>poor condition,</hi>
but he left it in a <hi>glorious condition; Invenit lateritiam,
ſed reliquit marmoream.</hi> My prayer ſhall be (and oh that
<hi>God</hi> would hear me!) that you may be able to ſay, When
I was firſt <hi>Mayor,</hi> or firſt <hi>Sheriffe,</hi> or firſt <hi>Common-councell
man,</hi> I found the <hi>City</hi> a City full of <hi>diviſion,</hi> full of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe,</hi>
full of <hi>errors and hereſies;</hi> but now I ſhall leave
it full of <hi>truth,</hi> full of <hi>holineſſe,</hi> and a <hi>City at unity within
it ſelfe. Inveni lateritiam, reliqui marmoream.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the better bringing of this to paſſe, you did lately
renue your <hi>ſolemne League and Covenant;</hi> at which time
this enſuing Sermon was preached. Since which time,
not only the Sermon, but the <hi>Preacher</hi> of it, hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
many <hi>harſh and bitter cenſures.</hi> It is the <hi>wickedneſſe</hi>
of theſe dayes to build their own deſignes upon the ruine
of other mens <hi>good name.</hi> But ſurely <hi>God</hi> will never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper
ſuch <hi>bloody practiſes.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> a <hi>vilde
perſon, Dan. 11. 28. That his heart ſhall be againſt the holy
Covenant.</hi> We have many amongſt us, that in this are
like unto <hi>Antiochus,</hi> whoſe <hi>hearts, tongues,</hi> and <hi>hands,</hi> are
not only againſt our ſolemne League and Covenant; but
againſt all that <hi>preach</hi> for it, or <hi>write</hi> in the defence of it.
<pb facs="tcp:113468:4"/>
There is indeed a <hi>Covenant</hi> that ſome do much contend
for, and make the very form of a particular <hi>Church,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which a <hi>Church</hi> cannot be a true <hi>Church,</hi> which is
called a <hi>Church-covenant.</hi> For my part, I conceive that
whoſoever ſhall ſay, that a <hi>Church-covenant</hi> (I meane an
oath expreſſed by formal words) is an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and neceſſary to the very being of a <hi>viſible Church;</hi> doth
not only <hi>un-church</hi> moſt of the <hi>Churches of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
but doth alſo ſet up his own <hi>invention</hi> for an <hi>Ordinance
of Chriſt.</hi> In the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> we reade of no ſuch
<hi>Church-oath</hi> at the admiſſion of Members. And there is
no place in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> (for ought I could ever
reade) that ſpeaks of a <hi>Church-oath</hi> to be taken at our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
into <hi>Church-fellowſhip.</hi> Indeed we have mention
made of a <hi>Nationall Covenant,</hi> and of the <hi>Covenant of
grace,</hi> and of <hi>ſubſcribing with our hands unto the Lord.</hi> But
what are theſe to a <hi>Church-oath;</hi> without which, no
man is to be accounted a <hi>Church-member,</hi> or to have right
to the <hi>ſeales</hi> of the <hi>covenant of grace?</hi> To urge this as an
<hi>Ordinance of Chriſt,</hi> is to ſet our <hi>poſts</hi> by <hi>Gods poſts,</hi> and our
<hi>threſhold</hi> by <hi>Gods threſhold, Ezek.</hi> 43. 8. But if I ſhould
expatiate any further in this point, I ſhould exceed the
limits of an Epiſtle, and therefore I forbear.</p>
            <p>My hearty deſire is, That this <hi>Covenant</hi> which you
have now taken the ſecond time, may be carried about
you in continuall remembrance. And that it may ſerve
in ſtead of a thouſand <hi>Arguments</hi> to make you zealouſly
ſerviceable, to <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> It is reported
of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> that he was ſo taken with the wonderfull
works of <hi>Hercules,</hi> that he could not ſleep for thinking
of the <hi>wonders of Hercules;</hi> and when he ſlept, he <hi>dreamt
of Hercules wonders;</hi> and was never ſatisfied till he had
imitated him in working wonderfull things alſo. And
<pb facs="tcp:113468:5"/>
it is alſo related of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> that he had alwayes in
his thoughts by night and by day, the victories of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiades,</hi>
and this made him inſatiable till he had imitated
him. Oh that you would thus deale with the <hi>Covenant!</hi>
That you would think of it in your <hi>bed,</hi> in your <hi>cloſets,</hi>
in your <hi>walks;</hi> and think of what particulars you have
ſworn unto, and never leave thinking untill you have
fully performed your <hi>Oath and Covenant.</hi> And if you
<hi>keep Covenant</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> the great <hi>God</hi> will <hi>keep Covenant</hi>
with you, and all the <hi>bleſsings</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> which
are mentioned in the <hi>book of God,</hi> which is the <hi>book of the
Covenant,</hi> ſhall be your portion for ever and ever. Which

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou are here met this day, to humble your
ſoules before the Lord, and to renue your
ſolemne League and Covenant; I ſay, to
renue it, and take it the ſecond time. It
is no unuſuall thing for the people of God
to repeat and reiterate their Vows and
Covenants. The great and ſolemne vow
which we made to <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> is renued every time we
come to the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> And upon every <hi>Faſt day</hi> wee
binde our ſelves anew to <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Covenant.</hi> The people of
Iſrael entred into covenant, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 3. And the ſame peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(as <hi>Chronologers</hi> obſerve) did re-engage themſelves in the
ſame <hi>Covenant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Compare Ezra 7. 7. with Neh. 1. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Neh.</hi> 10. The Scripture tels us, that <hi>Almighty

into a <hi>Nationall Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>ſix reaſons</hi> to juſtifie this dayes ſolemnity before<note place="margin">Six Reaſons to juſtifie the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing of the Covenant.</note>
God and all that require ſatisfaction about it.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe this <hi>Nationall Covenant</hi> hath been a long time as
it were dead and buried and quite forgotten amongſt moſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113468:6"/>
people. And therefore it is high time to raiſe it out of the
grave of forgetfulneſſe: and I hope this day will be to the
<hi>Covenant as a Reſurrection from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Becauſe of the great ſcorn and contempt that is caſt
upon it by divers ſorts of people. The <hi>Malignants</hi> call it a
<hi>conſpiracy;</hi> others, though not <hi>Malignants,</hi> yet <hi>maligne</hi> the
<hi>Covenant,</hi> and call it a <hi>ſnare,</hi> a <hi>trap,</hi> a <hi>temptation,</hi> and account
it a ſigne of a tender conſcience to boggle at it, and of a looſe
conſcience to ſwallow it without ſcruple. And therefore to
<hi>vindicate</hi> the honour and reputation of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and to
wipe off the aſperſions that are caſt upon it, you doe well
to take it the ſecond time.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe there are ſome that do openly profeſſe their
ſorrow that ever they took it, and would fain recant and
retract what they have done. And therefore to manifeſt that
you are ſtill of the ſame <hi>judgement,</hi> and that you doe not
<hi>repent</hi> of what you have done, you doe well to take it the
ſecond time.</p>
            <p>4. Becauſe of the proneneſſe that is in all men (even the
beſt of men) to <hi>break covenant with God.</hi> A Covenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is a <hi>golden Girdle</hi> to tye us <hi>faſt</hi> to <hi>God;</hi> it is a <hi>joyning and
glewing our ſelves to the Lord.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
an <hi>Oath,</hi> comes from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which ſignifieth a <hi>Hedge.</hi> An
Oath and Covenant is a <hi>ſtrong hedge</hi> to keep us from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out into diſobedience. It is an entring into <hi>bond</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the <hi>Lords;</hi> it is a <hi>binding our ſelves apprentice to God.
Voluntas</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aquinas) per votum immobiliter firmatur in
bonum.</hi> But yet notwithſtanding, the nature of the beſt man
is very apt to <hi>break</hi> theſe <hi>bonds,</hi> and to run away from his
great <hi>Lord and Maſter,</hi> to ſuffer this <hi>Hedge</hi> to decay, and
this <hi>golden girdle</hi> to looſen and untye, and to <hi>disjoyne</hi> and
<hi>unglew</hi> himſelf from God. And therefore it is not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
but very neceſſary (and for this cauſe you are met
this day) to enter into bond the ſecond time, to <hi>binde and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll</hi>
your ſelves again unto the Lord; to make up this <hi>hedge,</hi>
to tye this <hi>golden girdle</hi> yet faſter, and to joyn and glew your
ſelves once more unto the Lord in a perpetuall Covenant
never to be forgotten. It is reported of Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113468:6"/>
when he was at the ſtake to be burnt, the Officers offered to
tye him to the ſtake: but he ſaid, You need not tye me, for
that <hi>God</hi> that call'd me hither will keep me from ſtirring; and
yet becauſe I am partly fleſh, I am willing you ſhould tye me
faſt, leſt I ſhould ſtir. So may the beſt Chriſtian here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſay: <hi>Lord I am carnall, ſold under ſinne,</hi> I have broken
thoſe golden cords of the Covenant with which I have tyed
my ſelfe unto thee. Though I am <hi>ſpirit,</hi> yet am I <hi>fleſh</hi> alſo:
And therefore I come to binde my ſelfe anew. As <hi>Dalilah</hi>
dealt with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> &amp;c. ſo do I deſire to deale with my ſelf,
and to tye my ſelf yet faſter and faſter to God, if by any
meanes I might be kept firme to him.</p>
            <p>5. Becauſe of the many <hi>glorious deliverances</hi> and <hi>ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
which God hath vouchſafed unto us. For ſince June laſt,
we have had about 60 conſiderable bleſſings and mercies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which all are as 60 <hi>Arguments</hi> to call upon us not only to
renue our thankfulneſſe, but our Covenant alſo. Thus the
<hi>people of Iſrael,</hi> when God had delivered them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
renued their <hi>Covenant</hi> at <hi>Horeb, Exod.</hi> 19. And when they
were delivered from their Wilderneſſe-enemies, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.
And the ſame people did afterwards, when God had given
them the poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan,</hi> re-oblige themſelves by a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>6. Becauſe of the <hi>ſad</hi> condition the <hi>Church of God</hi> is in at
this time. For though God hath given us glorious victories
over our enemies, yet the Churches of Chriſt lye deſolate,
<hi>Church-reformation</hi> is obſtructed, <hi>Church-Diſcipline</hi> unſetled,
<hi>Church-diviſions</hi> increaſed. The famous City of <hi>London</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an <hi>Amſterdam, Separation</hi> from our <hi>Churches</hi> is <hi>counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced,
Toleration</hi> is cried up, <hi>Authority</hi> lyeth aſleep. And
therefore it is high time to take the Covenant again, that ſo
you may endeavour with renued ſtrength, as one man, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
and courageouſly, for the ſetling of the <hi>tottering Ark</hi>
according to the ſphere of capacitie in which God hath put
you. You ſhall reade in Scripture, that the people of <hi>God</hi>
did never any great ſervice for the <hi>Church</hi> till they renued
their <hi>Covenant;</hi> and you ſhall never read but that they did
very great and glorious ſervices for the <hi>Church,</hi> after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113468:7"/>
of their <hi>covenant</hi> with God. In <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> time the
Temple-work ceaſed for many yeares; but after <hi>Ezra</hi> and
<hi>Nehemiah</hi> cauſed the people to enter into <hi>covenant</hi> with
<hi>God,</hi> it went on proſperouſly and uninterruptedly. What
famous things did the people of God after <hi>Jehojada</hi> had
drawn them into a covenant! 2. <hi>Kings 11. 7. 18. All the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Lord went into the houſe of Baal, and brake it downe,
his Altars and his Images brake they in pieces throughly, &amp;c.</hi>
The like we reade of <hi>Aſa, 2 Chron.</hi> 15. 14, 15, 16. and of King
<hi>Joſiah, 2 Chron.</hi> 34. 31, 32, 33. And thus I doubt not but you
will endeavour to do in an orderly way according to your
places.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Arguments to juſtifie this dayes work before
God to all the Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>To help you in this, ſo pious, ſo Chriſtian, ſo neceſſary, ſo
ſolemne a buſineſſe, I have choſen this Text. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Chapter the Apoſtle tels us the condition that
the Church of God ſhould be in, in the laſt dayes. <hi>This know
alſo, that in the laſt dayes perilous time ſhall come.</hi> In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Verſe he tels us the reaſon why <hi>theſe</hi> times ſhould be
<hi>ſuch hard and dangerous times; For men ſhall be lovers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
covetous, &amp;c.</hi> The reaſon is not drawn from the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries</hi>
and <hi>calamities</hi> of the laſt times, but from the ſins and
iniquities of the laſt times.<note place="margin">2 Chro. 15. 1.</note> 
               <hi>It is ſin and iniquity that makes
times truly perilous.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſay 42. 24. 25.</note> Sin, and ſin onely, takes away Gods
love and favour from a Nation,<note place="margin">Iudg. 6. 13.</note> and makes God turn an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to it.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28. 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>Sinne cauſeth God</hi> to take away the purity and
power of his <hi>Ordinances</hi> from a Nation. <hi>Sin</hi> makes all the

to fight againſt us.<note place="margin">Job 5. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Sin</hi> is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of all the <hi>cauſes</hi> of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
times. <hi>Sin</hi> is the cauſe of our <hi>civill warres, 2 Sam.</hi> 12.
11. <hi>Sin</hi> is the cauſe of our <hi>diviſions, James 4. 1. Sin</hi> is the cauſe
why men fall into ſuch dangerous errours, 2 <hi>Theſſ. 2. 11. Sin</hi>
brings ſuch kinds of judgements which no other enemy can
bring. <hi>Sin</hi> brings inviſible, ſpirituall, &amp; eternall judgements.
It is <hi>ſin</hi> that makes <hi>God</hi> give over a Nation to a <hi>reprobate
ſenſe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom, 1. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Sin</hi> makes all times dangerous. Let the times be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo proſperous, yet if they be ſinfull times, they are times
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113468:7"/>
truly dangerous. And if they be not <hi>ſinfull,</hi> they are not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
though never ſo miſerable. It is <hi>ſin</hi> that makes <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
to be the fruits of <hi>Gods revenging</hi> wrath, part of the
<hi>curſe</hi> due to ſin, and a beginning of <hi>Hell.</hi> It is <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that imbitters every affliction. Let us for ever look upon
ſin through theſe <hi>Scripture-Spectacles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle in four Verſes reckons up 19 <hi>ſins,</hi> at the cauſes
of the miſeries of the laſt dayes. I may truly call theſe 19 <hi>ſins,
Englands Looking-glaſſe,</hi> wherein we may ſee what are the
<hi>clouds</hi> that <hi>eclipſe</hi> Gods <hi>countenance</hi> from ſhining upon us:
the Mountains that lye in the way to hinder the ſettlement
of <hi>Church-diſcipline.</hi> Even theſe 19 <hi>ſins</hi> which are as an <hi>Iron
whip</hi> of 19 <hi>ſtrings,</hi> with which God is whipping <hi>England</hi> at
this day; which are as 19 <hi>Fagots,</hi> with which God is burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and devouring <hi>England.</hi> My purpoſe is not to ſpeak of
all theſe ſins: Only let me propound a <hi>Divine project</hi> how
to make the times truly happy, for ſoul and body. And that
is, To ſtrike at the root of all miſery, which is <hi>ſin and iniquity.</hi>
To repent for, and from all theſe 19 ſins, which are as the <hi>Oyl</hi>
that feedeth, &amp; encreaſeth the flame that is now conſuming
of us. For becauſe men are <hi>lovers of themſelves, Vſque ad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptum
Dei &amp; Reipublicae.</hi> Becauſe men drive their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
not only to the neglect, but contempt of God, and the
Common-wealth. Becauſe men are <hi>covetous,</hi> lovers of the
world more then lovers of God. Becauſe they are <hi>proud</hi> in
<hi>head, heart, looks,</hi> and <hi>apparell.</hi> Becauſe they are <hi>unthankfull,</hi>
turning the mercies of God into inſtruments of ſin, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Darts with Gods bleſſings to ſhoot againſt God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
men are <hi>unholy</hi> and <hi>heady,</hi> and make many covenants,
and keep none. Becauſe they are (as the Greek word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
<hi>Devils,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> acting the Devils part in accuſing the brethren,
and in bearing falſe witneſſe one againſt another. Becauſe
they have a <hi>form of Godlineſſe denying the power thereof, &amp;c.</hi>
hence it is that theſe times are ſo ſad and bloody. Theſe are
thine enemies, ô <hi>England,</hi> that have brought thee into this
deſolate condition! Theſe are the ſins that will recruit the
Kings army, if ever it be recruited: and if ever God lead us
back into the wilderneſſe, it will be becauſe of theſe ſinnes.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113468:8"/>
And therefore if ever you would have bleſſed dayes, you
muſt make it your great buſineſſe to remove theſe 19 moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and to repent of theſe land-devouring, and ſoul-deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abominations.</p>
            <p>At this time I ſhall pick out the firſt, and the tenth ſin to
ſpeak on. The firſt is <hi>ſelfe-love,</hi> which is placed in the <hi>fore-front;</hi>
as the cauſe of all the reſt. <hi>Selfe-love</hi> is not only a ſin
that makes the <hi>times perilous,</hi> but it is the cauſe of all thoſe ſins
that make the times perilous. For becauſe men are <hi>lovers of
themſelves,</hi> therefore they are <hi>covetous, proud, unholy,
&amp;c.</hi> The tenth ſinne is <hi>truce-breaking,</hi> and for feare leſt
the time ſhould prevent me, I will begin with this ſinne firſt.</p>
            <p>The tenth ſin then is <hi>truce-breakers,</hi> or, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 33. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-breakers.
The Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
three things. Firſt ſuch as are <hi>foederis neſcii,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it; or as others, <hi>infoederabiles;</hi> that is, ſuch as refuſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into Covenant. Or ſecondly, ſuch as are <hi>foedifragi, qui
pacta non ſervant,</hi> (as <hi>Eſtius</hi> hath it) or <hi>ſine fide,</hi> as <hi>Ambroſe;</hi>
that is, ſuch as break Faith and Covenant. Or thirdly, ſuch
as are <hi>implacabiles,</hi> or as others, <hi>ſine pace;</hi> that is, ſuch as are
<hi>implacable,</hi> and <hi>haters of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to this three-fold ſenſe of the word, I ſhall ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
theſe three obſervations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That to be a Covenant-refuſer, is a ſin that makes
the times perilous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. That to be a Covenant-breaker, is a ſin that makes
the times perilous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. That to be a peace-hater, or a truce-hater, is a ſin
that makes the times periloùs.</p>
            <p>To begin with the firſt.</p>
            <p>Doctrine the firſt.<note place="margin">Doct. the firſt.</note> 
               <hi>That to be a Covenant-refuſer, is a ſinne
that makes the times perilous.</hi> To be <hi>foederis neſcius,</hi> or <hi>infoede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derabilis.</hi>
For the underſtanding of this, you muſt know that
there are two <hi>ſorts of Covenants.</hi> There are <hi>devilliſh</hi> and <hi>hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Covenants,</hi> and there are <hi>godly and religious Covenants.</hi>
Firſt, there are devilliſh Covenants, ſuch as <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 12. and
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> 28. 15. ſuch as the <hi>holy league</hi> (as it was unjuſtly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
<hi>in France</hi> againſt the <hi>Hugonites,</hi> and that of our Gun-powder
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113468:8"/>
Traitors in England: ſuch are our Oxford Covenants
for the deſtruction of the Parliament, and godly party. Now
to refuſe to take ſuch Covenants, is not to make the times
perilous, but the taking of them makes the times perilous.
Secondly, there are <hi>godly and religious Covenants;</hi> ſuch as
<hi>Job</hi> 31. 1. I have made a <hi>Covenant with mine eyes, why then
ſhould I thinke upon a maid?</hi> Such as <hi>Pſal. 119. I have ſworne
I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgements;</hi> ſuch
as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 14. And ſuch as this is, which you are met to
take this day. For you are to ſweare to ſuch things which
you are bound to endeavour after, though you did not ſwear.
Your ſwearing is not <hi>ſolum vinculum,</hi> but <hi>novum vinculum,</hi>
is not <hi>the onely,</hi> but onely a <hi>new</hi> and another bond to ty you
to the obedience of the things you ſweare unto; which are ſo
excellent and ſo glorious, that if God give thoſe that take it a
heart to keep it, it will make theſe three Kingdomes the glory
of the world. And as one of the <hi>Reverend Commiſſioners of
Scotland</hi> ſaid when it was firſt taken in a moſt ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by the <hi>Parliament</hi> and the Aſſembly;
<hi>That if the Pope ſhould have this Covenant written upon a wall
over againſt him ſitting in his chair, it would be unto him like the
hand-writing to</hi> Belſhazzar; <hi>cauſing the joints of his loynes to
looſe, and his knees to ſmite one againſt another.</hi> And I may
adde, that if it be faithfully and fully kept, it will make all
the <hi>Devils in hell</hi> to tremble, as fearing leſt their Kingdome
ſhould not long ſtand. Now then for a man to be an <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenanter,</hi>
and to be ſuch a <hi>Covenant-refuſer,</hi> it muſt needs
be a ſin that makes the times perilous.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon is,<note place="margin">Reaſon. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1 Becauſe you ſhall find in Scripture that when any nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
did enter into a ſolemn religious Covenant, God did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
bleſſe and proſper that nation after that time; As
appeares, 2 Chron. 15. 19. 2 Kings 11. 20. And we have a
promiſe for it, Deut. 29. 12, 13. <hi>That thou ſhouldeſt enter
into Covenant with the Lord thy God, &amp;c. That he may eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
thee to day for a people unto himſelfe, and that he may be
unto thee a God, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore to be a <hi>Covenant-refuſer,</hi>
is to make our miſeries perpetuall.</p>

2 Becauſe as it is the higheſt act of <hi>Gods love</hi> to man,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> to
vouchſafe to engage himſelfe by <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> to be his
God,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 8.</note> ſo it is the higheſt <hi>demonſtration</hi> of mans <hi>love to God,</hi> to
bind himſelfe by <hi>Oath and Covenant</hi> to be Gods. There is
nothing obligeth <hi>God</hi> more to us, then to ſee us willing to ty
and bind our ſelves faſt unto his ſervice. And therefore they
that in this ſenſe are <hi>Anticovenanters,</hi> are ſons of <hi>Belial;</hi> that
refuſe the yoake of the Lord, that ſay, as <hi>Pſalm. 2. 3. Let us
breake his bands aſunder, and caſt away his cords from us;</hi> ſuch
as <hi>Oderunt vincula pietatis,</hi> which is a ſoul-deſtroying, and
land-deſtroying ſin.</p>
            <p>3 Becauſe that the union of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> 
               <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
into one <hi>Covenant,</hi> is the chief, if not the onely <hi>preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative</hi>
of them at this time. You ſhall find in our <hi>Engliſh
Chroniclers,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> was never deſtroyed, but when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
within it ſelf. Our civill diviſions brought in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
the <hi>Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normans.</hi> But now the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenanter,</hi>
he divides the Parliament within it ſelf, and the
City within it ſelf, and England againſt it ſelf; he is as a <hi>ſtone
ſeparated</hi> from the building, which is of no uſe to it ſelf, and
threatneth the ruine of the building. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is called in
<hi>Scripture</hi> the <hi>corner-ſtone,</hi> which is a <hi>ſtone</hi> that unites two
ends of a building together; <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is a ſtone of union,
and therefore they that ſow diviſion, and ſtudy unjuſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
have little of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in them. When the <hi>ten
tribes</hi> began to divide from the other two tribes, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
began to warre one againſt another, and to ruine one
another. The <hi>Anticovenanter</hi> he divides, and ſeparates, and
diſunites; and therefore he makes the times perilous.</p>
            <p>The uſe is,</p>
            <p>1 To reprove thoſe that refuſe to enter into Covenant
with God;<note place="margin">Vſe. 1.</note> and more particularly, thoſe that refuſe to take
this ſolemne League and Covenant. Theſe are of two ſorts.
1. Such as refuſe it out of <hi>Malignity:</hi> 2. Such as refuſe it out
of <hi>unneceſſary ſcrupuloſity;</hi> that raiſe and foment doubts, to
hinder themſelves and others from taking it. As for the firſt,
I will not call your goodneſſe and my charity ſo much in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
as to ſpend time about them. And for the ſecond, I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113468:9"/>
conceive that thoſe that ſcruple it, are amongſt the number
of thoſe that are abſent, and therefore I ſhould but idle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
precious time to ſatisfie the objections of thoſe that are
not preſent, to recover ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>There are ſome men of whom I may ſay as the Apoſtle doth
to the <hi>Galatians, Gal. 1. 6. I marvell that you are ſo ſoon removed
from him that called you, &amp;c.</hi> And as <hi>Gal. 4. 15. I beare you
record, that if it had been poſſible, you would have plucked out
your own eyes, and given them to me; Am I therefore become
your enemy, &amp;c.</hi> So may I ſay of many: <hi>I wonder and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell</hi>
to ſee how ſuddenly they are changed from that good
opinion they once had of the <hi>Covenant;</hi> For I bear the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> record,
that there was a time when they not onely took it willingly,
but would have hazarded their very lives in defence of it;
How is it then that the Covenant is become an enemy to
them, and they unto the Covenant? Surely the <hi>change</hi> is not
in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> but in the <hi>Covenanters.</hi> I have much to ſay
in defence of it, and did ſay much when it was firſt taken;
which now to repeat will not be uſefull, and I believe for the
company here preſent, very unneceſſary; and therefore I
forbeare.</p>
            <p>The ſecond uſe is to exhort you to be Covenant-takers
this day,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> and to take it with theſe qualifications.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Solemnly, and ſeriouſly,</hi> and tremblingly; as in Gods
preſence, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 3.</p>
            <p>2. With hearty griefe and ſorrow for all our former Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſies
and Covenant-breakings, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 4. 5.</p>
            <p>3. With <hi>judgement and underſtanding, Neh.</hi> 10. 28. right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
informed of the true ſenſe and meaning of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
            <p>4. With a <hi>full aſſurance</hi> that it is an act very pleaſing unto
God, and that God is much honoured by it.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Freely</hi> and <hi>cheerfully,</hi> as they did, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 14.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Faithfully</hi> and <hi>ſincerely,</hi> with all your hearts and ſoules,
and with your whole deſire; 2 <hi>Chron. 15. 12. 2 Chron.</hi> 34. 31,
32. with a <hi>purpoſe</hi> to joyn your ſelves to the Lord in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Covenant, never to be forgotten. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 5.</p>
            <p>As for motives to perſwade you to the practice of theſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113468:10"/>
things, and for rules and directions about the manner of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of it, I ſhall leave them wholly to my Reverend brother
who is to ſucceed; who will undertake this work fully and at
large. My chief aym is at the ſecond doctrine, which is,</p>
            <p>That for a Covenant-taker to be a Covenant-breaker,<note place="margin">Doctrine 2.</note> 
               <hi>is a</hi>
ſin that makes the times perilous.</p>
            <p>For the opening of this point, I muſt diſtinguiſh again of
<hi>Covenants.</hi> There are <hi>civill,</hi> and there are religious <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</hi>
A <hi>civill Covenant,</hi> is a <hi>Covenant</hi> between <hi>man and man;</hi>
and of this the text is <hi>primarily,</hi> though not <hi>onely</hi> to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.
Now for a man to break promiſe and Covenant with
his brother, is a <hi>land-deſtroying,</hi> and <hi>ſoule devouring abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
We read 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. that becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> had broken the
<hi>Covenant</hi> that <hi>Joſhuah</hi> made with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> God ſent
a famine in <hi>Davids</hi> time of three yeares continuance: To
teach us, <hi>that if we falſifie our Word and Oath,</hi> God will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<hi>covenant-breaking, though it be forty yeares after.</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
is that text, <hi>Jer. 34. 17, 18, 19, 20. Becauſe the Princes
and the People brake the covenant which they had made with
their ſervants</hi> (though but their ſervants) God tels them.
<hi>Becauſe ye have not hearkned unto me in proclaiming liberty
every one to his brother, &amp;c. Behold, I proclaim liberty for you,
ſaith the Lord to the ſword, to the peſtilence, and to the famine;
and I will make you to be removed into all the Kingdomes of the
earth; &amp;c.</hi> We read alſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. 18, 19, 20. That God tels
<hi>Zedekiah</hi> becauſe he brake the covenant he had made with
the King of Babylon, that therefore <hi>he would recompence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his head the oath that he had deſpiſed, and the covenant that
he had broken, &amp; would bring him to Babylon, and plead with him
there for the treſpaſſe which he had treſpaſſed againſt the Lord.
David</hi> tels us, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 15. 4. that it is a ſin that ſhuts a man out of
heaven. The Turkiſh hiſtories tell us of a covenant of peace
made between <hi>Amurath</hi> the great Turk, and <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> King
of Hungary; and how the <hi>Pope</hi> abſolved <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> from his
oath, and provoked him to renue the warre. In which war
the Turk being put to the worſt, and deſpairing of victory,
puls out a paper which he had in his boſome wherein the
league was written; and ſaid, <hi>O thou God of the Chriſtians, if
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113468:10"/>
thou beeſt a true God, be revenged of thoſe that without cauſe
have broken the league made by calling upon thy name.</hi> And the
ſtory ſaith, that after he had ſpoken theſe words, he had as it
were a <hi>new heart</hi> and <hi>ſpirit put into him, and his ſouldiers,</hi> and
that they obtained a glorious victory over <hi>Ladiſlaus.</hi> Thus
God avenged the quarrel of mans covenant. The like ſtory we
have of <hi>Rodolphus Duke of Suevia,</hi> who by the <hi>Popes</hi> inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
waged war with <hi>Henry the fourth Emperour of Germany,</hi>
to whom he had ſworn the contrary. The Pope ſent a <hi>Crown</hi>
to him with this Motto: <hi>Petra dedit Petro, Petrus diadema
Rodolpho;</hi> but in the fight it chanced that <hi>Rodolphus</hi> loſt his
<hi>right hand;</hi> and falling ſick upon it, he called for it, and ſaid,
<hi>Spectate hanc dextram legitima ſupplicia expendentem, quae
fidem ſacramento munitam, &amp; Henrico Domino meo datam, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis
urgentibus, praeter aequum &amp; jus temere violavit.</hi> Behold
this right hand with which I ſubſcribed to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
with which I have violated my oath, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I am rightly puniſhed. I will not trouble you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the gallant ſtory of <hi>Regulus,</hi> that choſe rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
himſelfe to a cruell death, then to falſifie his oath to the
<hi>Carthaginians.</hi> The ſumme of all is, if it be ſuch a <hi>crying abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi>
to break <hi>covenant</hi> between man and man, and if
ſuch perſons are accounted as the <hi>off-ſcouring</hi> of men, not
worthy to live in a <hi>chriſtian,</hi> no not in a <hi>heathen Common-weal:</hi>
If it be a ſin that drawes down vengeance from heaven, and
excludes a man from heaven; much more for a man to enter
into a covenant with the great Jehovah, and to break ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
engagement; this muſt needs be a deſtroying and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning
ſin. And of ſuch religious covenants I am now to ſpeak</p>
            <p>There are two covenants that God made with man, <hi>a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of nature,</hi> and <hi>a covenant of grace.</hi> The covenant of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(or of works) was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and all mankind in
him. This covenant <hi>Adam</hi> broke, and <hi>God</hi> preſently had a
quarrell againſt him for breaking of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8, 9. And to
avenge the quarrell of the <hi>covenant,</hi> he was thruſt out of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe;</hi>
and there was a <hi>ſword</hi> alſo placed at the Eaſt end of the
Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> to avenge covenant-breaking. And by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
we are all children of wrath, heirs of hell, becauſe of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113468:11"/>
breach of that covenant. And therefore we ſhould never
think of <hi>originall ſin,</hi> or of the <hi>ſinfulneſſe and curſedneſſe of
our naturall condition, but we ſhould remember what a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
ſin Covenant-breaking is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after man was fallen, God was pleaſed to ſtrike a new
covenant, which is uſually called a covenant of grace, or of
reconciliation; a copy of which you ſhall read, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 7, 8, 9.
This was firſt propounded to <hi>Adam</hi> by way of <hi>promiſe, Gen.</hi> 3.
<hi>The Seed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head.</hi> And
then to <hi>Abram</hi> by way of <hi>Covenant, Gen. 17. In thy Seed ſhall
all the nations of the world be bleſſed.</hi> And then to <hi>Moſes</hi> by
way of Teſtament, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. It is nothing elſe but <hi>the free
and gracious tender of Jeſus Chriſt and all his rich purchaſes to
all the loſt and undone ſons of</hi> Adam, <hi>that ſhall beleeve in him; or,</hi>
as the phraſe is, Iſai. 56. 4. <hi>that ſhall take hold of the covenant.</hi>
Now you muſt know that Baptiſme is a ſeal of this covenant,
and that all that are baptized, doe ſacramentally at leaſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
themſelves to walk before God, and to be upright; and
God likewiſe engageth himſelf to be their God. This cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is likewiſe renued when we come to the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi>
wherein we bind our ſelves by a ſacramentall oath unto
thankfulneſſe to God for Chriſt. Adde further, that beſides
this generall covenant of grace whereof the Sacraments are
ſeales, there are particular and perſonall, and family, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
covenants. Thus <hi>Job</hi> had his covenant, <hi>Job</hi> 20. and
<hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. 106. And when he came to be King, he
joyned in a covenant with his people, to ſerve the Lord.
Thus <hi>Aſa, Jehoiada,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the people of Iſrael
had not onely a covenant in <hi>circumciſion,</hi> but renued a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in <hi>Horeb,</hi> &amp; in <hi>Moab;</hi> and did often again and again bind
themſelvs to God by vow and covenant. And thus the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the Chriſtians, beſides the vow in Baptiſme, have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
perſonall and nationall engagements unto God by
covenant, which are nothing elſe but the renovations, and
particular applications of that firſt vow in Baptiſme. Of this
nature is the covenant you are to renue this day, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now give me leave to ſhew you what a <hi>ſword-procuring,</hi>
and <hi>ſoul-undoing</hi> ſinne, this ſin of <hi>Covenant-breaking</hi> is; and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113468:11"/>
ethen th reaſon of it. Famous is that text, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 25.
<hi>And I will ſend my ſword which ſhall avenge the quarrell of my
covenant.</hi> The words in the Hebrew run thus: I will avenge the
avengement. In Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The Latin, <hi>ulciſcar
ultionem;</hi> which importeth thus much. That God is at open
war and at <hi>publique deſiance</hi> with thoſe that break his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
he is not onely angry with them, but he will be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of them. The Lord hath a controverſie with all cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breakers,
<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 1. or as it is, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 23. The Lord will
walk contrary to them. In the 29. of <hi>Deuter.</hi> firſt God takes
his people into covenant, and then he tels them of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
condition they ſhould bee in if they did keep cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
But if they did breake couenant, he tels them, <hi>verſe</hi>
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. <hi>That the Lord will not ſpare him; but
the anger of the Lord and his jealouſies ſhall ſmoak againſt that
man, and all the curſes that are written in this book ſhall lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under heaven.
And the Lord ſhall ſeparate him, &amp;c. And when the nations
ſhall ſay, Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this land?
What meaneth the heat of this great anger? Then ſhall men ſay,
Becauſe they have forſaken the covenant of the Lord God of
their Fathers, &amp;c.</hi> This was the ſin that cauſed God to
ſend his people of Iſrael into captivity, and to remove the
candleſtick from the Aſian Churches. It is for this ſin that the
ſword is now devouring Germany, Ireland, and England, &amp;c.
God hath ſent his ſword to avenge the quarrell of his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>The reaſons why this ſin is a God-provoking ſin are,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Becauſe that <hi>to ſinne againſt the covenant,</hi> is a greater ſinne
then to <hi>ſin againſt</hi> a <hi>Commandement</hi> of God, or to ſin againſt
a <hi>promiſe,</hi> or to ſin againſt an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God. Firſt, it is
a greater ſin then to break a <hi>Commandement</hi> of God. For the
more mercy there is in the thing we ſin againſt, the greater is
the ſin. Now there is more mercy in a <hi>Covenant,</hi> then in a bare
<hi>Commandement.</hi> The Commandement tels us our duty, but
gives no power to doe it. But the covenant of grace gives
power to doe what it requires to be done. And therefore if
it be a hell-procuring ſin to break the leaſt of Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113468:12"/>
much more to be a Covenant-breaker, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 28,
29. Secondly, it is a greater ſin then to ſin againſt a <hi>promiſe</hi>
of God, becauſe a Covenant is a promiſe joyn'd with an oath,
it is a mutuall ſtipulation between God and us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if it be a great ſin to break promiſe, much more to break
covenant. Thirdly, it is a greater ſin then to ſin againſt an
<hi>Ordinance,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Covenant</hi> is the root and ground of
all the Ordinances. It is by virtue of the <hi>Covenant</hi> that we
are made partakers of the <hi>Ordinances.</hi> The <hi>Word</hi> is the <hi>book</hi>
of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments</hi> are the Scales of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
And if it be a ſin of an high nature to ſin againſt
the book of the <hi>Covenant</hi> and the <hi>ſeales</hi> of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
much more againſt the <hi>Covenant</hi> it ſelfe. To break
covenant is a <hi>fundamentall ſinne,</hi> it raſeth the very <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Chriſtianity,</hi> becauſe the Covenant is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all the priviledges, and prerogatives, and hopes
of the <hi>Saints</hi> of God. And therefore we reade, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12.
that a <hi>ſtranger from the Covenant</hi> is one <hi>without hope.</hi> All
hope of Heaven is cut off where the Covenant is willingly
broken. <hi>To break covenant is an univerſall ſin,</hi> it includes all
other ſins. By virtue of the Covenant, we tye our ſelves to
the obedience of Gods Commandements, we give up our
ſelves to the guidance of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> we take him for our
<hi>Lord and King.</hi> All the promiſes of this life and that that is
to come, are contained within the Covenant. The <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi>
are fruits of the Covenant. And therefore they that
forſake the Covenant, commit <hi>many ſins in one,</hi> and bring
not only many, but all curſes upon their heads. The ſumme
of the firſt Argument is: <hi>If the Lord will avenge the quarrell
of his Commandement,</hi> if God was avenged upon the <hi>ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherer</hi>
for <hi>breaking</hi> the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> much more will he be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
upon a <hi>Covenant-breaker.</hi> If God will avenge the
quarrell of a <hi>promiſe,</hi> if the <hi>quarrell</hi> of an <hi>Ordinance:</hi> if they
that reject the Ordinances ſhall be puniſhed; <hi>Of how much
ſeverer puniſhment ſhall they be thought worthy, that trample
under their feet the blood of the Covenant?</hi> If God was aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of thoſe that abuſed the <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> much
more will he puniſh thoſe that abuſe the <hi>Angell</hi> of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:113468:12"/>
The ſecond reaſon why <hi>covenant-breaking</hi> is ſuch a Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroying
ſin is,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> becauſe it is a moſt ſolemne and ſerious
thing to enter into <hi>covenant with God;</hi> a matter of ſuch great
weight and importance, that it is impoſſible but God ſhould
be exceedingly provoked with thoſe that ſlight it and diſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
it. The Vow in <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is the <hi>firſt,</hi> the moſt generall
and the ſolemneſt vow that ever any Chriſtian took, ſaith
<hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> wherein he doth not only promiſe, but engage
himſelfe by covenant in the ſight of God and his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
to be the ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore God will
not hold him guiltleſs that breaks this vow. The ſolemnity &amp;
weightineſſe of covenant-taking conſiſteth in three things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Becauſe it is made with the glorious</hi> Majeſty <hi>of Heaven
and Earth, who will not be trifled and baffled withall. And
therefore what</hi> Jehoſaphat <hi>ſaid to his Judges,</hi> 2 Chron. 19. 6.
Take heed what you doe, for ye judge not for men, but for the
Lord, who is with you in judgements; wherefore now let the fear
of the Lord be upon you, &amp;c. <hi>The like I may ſay to every one
that enters into covenant this day.</hi> Take heed what you doe,
for it is the Lords covenant, and there is no iniquity with the
Lord, wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you. For
our God is a holy God, he is a jealous God, he will not forgive
your tranſgreſſions, nor your ſins, <hi>as</hi> Joſhua <hi>ſaith,</hi> Joſh. 24. 19.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe the articles of the Covenant are weighty and
of great importance. In the Covenant of grace God inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
himſelf to give Chriſt, and with him, all temporall,
ſpirituall, and eternall bleſſings, and we engage our ſelves to
be his faithfull ſervants all our dayes. In this <hi>Covenant</hi> we
oblige our ſelves to do great matters that neerly concerne
the glory of God, the good of our own ſoules, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
of three Kingdomes. And in ſuch holy and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things which ſo neerly concerne our everlaſting eſtate, to
dally and trifle muſt needs incenſe the anger of the great
Jehovah.</p>
            <p>3. The manner uſed both by <hi>Jewes, Heathen,</hi> and <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
in entring into <hi>Covenant,</hi> doth clearly ſet out the <hi>weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe</hi>
of it, and what a horrible ſin it is to break it. The cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
amongſt the <hi>Jewes</hi> will appear by divers texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113468:13"/>
               <hi>Jer.</hi> 34. 18. it is ſaid, <hi>And I will give the men that have
tranſgreſſed my covenant, which have not performed the worde
of the Covenant which they had made before me, when they cut
the Calfe in twain, and paſſed between the parts thereof.</hi> The
words they uſed when they paſſed between the parts were,
So God divide me, if I keep not covenant. <hi>Neh. 5. 12. Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
took an oath of the Prieſts,<note place="margin">Gen. 15. 10. 17, 18,</note> and ſhook his lap and ſaid,
<hi>So God ſhake out every man from his houſe, and from his labour,
that performeth not this promiſe, even thus be he ſhaken out and
emptied. And all the Congregation ſaid, Amen.</hi> In the 15 of
<hi>Geneſis Abraham</hi> divided the Heifer, and ſhee-Goat, and a
Ram, &amp;c. <hi>And when the Sun was down; a ſmoaking furnace and
burning lampe paſſed between theſe pieces.</hi> This did repreſent
Gods preſence, ſaith <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and it was as if
God ſhould ſay: Behold, this day I enter into covenant with
thee, and if thou keepeſt covenant, I will be as a <hi>burning
lampe</hi> to illighten and to comfort thee: But if thou breakeſt
covenant, I will be like a <hi>ſmoaking furnace</hi> to conſume thee.
Thus alſo <hi>Exod. 24. 6. Moſes</hi> makes a covenant with Iſrael,
and offers ſacrifices, and takes the blood of the ſacrifice and
divides it, and half of it he ſprinkles upon the Altar, (which
repreſented Gods part) and the other half he ſprinkled upon
the people, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>As this blood is divided, ſo will
God divide you if you break covenant.</hi> This was the cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Jewes. Amongſt the Romans, <hi>Caeſa firmabant foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera
porca.</hi> And when it was divided, the <hi>Feciales</hi> gave one
half to one party, and the other half to the other, and ſaid,
<hi>So God divide you aſunder if you break this covenant, and let
God doe this ſo much the more by how much he is the more able.
Hinc foedus à foedo animali (ſcilicet porco) diviſo.</hi> Sometimes
they did make covenants by taking a ſtone in their hands and
ſaying, <hi>If I make this covenant ſeriouſly and faithfully, then let
the great Jupiter bleſſe me. If not, ſo let me be caſt away from
the face of the Gods as I caſt away this ſtone.</hi> This was called
<hi>Jurare per Jovem lapidem.</hi> All theſe things are not <hi>empty
notions,</hi> and <hi>metaphoricall ſhadowes,</hi> but reall and ſubſtantiall
practiſes, ſignifying unto us, That <hi>God will, and muſt</hi> (for it
ſtands with his honor to do it) <hi>divide and break them in pieces
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113468:13"/>
that break covenant with him.</hi> This day you are to take a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
by the lifting up of your hands unto the moſt high
God, which is a moſt emphaticall ceremony, whereby we do
as it were call God to be a <hi>witneſſe</hi> and a <hi>judge</hi> of what we
do, and a <hi>rewarder</hi> or a <hi>revenger,</hi> according as we keep or
break the Covenant. If we keep it, <hi>the lifting up of our hands</hi>
will be as an <hi>Evening ſacrifice;</hi> if we break it, <hi>the lifting up
of our hands</hi> will be as the <hi>lifting up of the hands of a Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
at the Bar,</hi> and procure woe and miſery and <hi>wringing of
hands</hi> at the great day of appearing.</p>
            <p>The third reaſon why God will be avenged of thoſe that
are Covenant-breakers,<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> is, becauſe that a <hi>Covenant</hi> is the
<hi>greateſt obligation,</hi> and the moſt forcible <hi>chain</hi> that can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
to tye us to obedience and ſervice. <hi>God</hi> may juſtly
challenge obedience without <hi>covenanting</hi> by virtue of <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
preſervation,</hi> and <hi>redemption;</hi> he hath made us, and
when loſt, he hath purchaſed us with his blood. But being
willing more abundantly to manifeſt his love, and that we
might be the more faſtned to him, he hath tyed himſelf to us,
and us to him by the ſtrong bond of a <hi>Covenant;</hi> as if God
ſhould ſay, Oh ye ſons of men, I ſee you are rebellious, and
ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> and therefore if it be poſſible, I will make you
ſure. I will engage you unto me, not only by <hi>creation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi>
and <hi>redemption,</hi> but alſo by the right of <hi>covenant</hi>
and <hi>aſſociation.</hi> I will make you mine by <hi>promiſe</hi> and <hi>oath.</hi>
And ſurely he that will break theſe bonds, is as bad as the
man poſſeſſed with the <hi>Devill</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> whom no chaines
could keep faſt. When we enter into covenant with <hi>God,</hi> we
take the oath of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and ſwear unto him that he ſhall
be our chief <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Governour,</hi> and that we will admit of
no forein power or juriſdiction, but that God ſhall be all in
all. We likewiſe take the oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to be his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and vaſſals, and that he ſhall be our Supreame in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals
and temporals. Now for a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> that believes there
is a <hi>God,</hi> to break both theſe oathes of <hi>allegiance</hi> and <hi>ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
it is curſed <hi>treaſon</hi> againſt the <hi>God</hi> of heaven, which ſurely
<hi>God</hi> will be avenged of. Amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> when any
Souldier was preſſed, he took an oath to ſerve his Captaine
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113468:14"/>
faithfully, and not to forſake him, and he was called <hi>Miles
per ſacramentum.</hi> Sometimes one took an oath for all the
reſt, and the others only ſaid, <hi>The ſame oath that A. B. took,
the ſame do I.</hi> And theſe were called <hi>Milites per conjuratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
or <hi>milites evocati.</hi> And when any ſouldier forſook his
Captain, he had Martiall law executed upon him. Thus it
is with every Chriſtian: He is a profeſſed <hi>ſouldier of Chriſt,</hi> he
hath taken preſſe-money, he hath ſworn and taken the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
upon it to become the <hi>Lords,</hi> he is <hi>miles per ſacramentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
&amp; <hi>miles per conjurationem.</hi> And if he forſake his <hi>Captaine</hi> and
break covenant, the great <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> will be avenged of
him, as it is written, <hi>Jer. 11. 3. Curſed be the man that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not the words of this covenant.</hi> To break covenant is a
ſin of <hi>perjury,</hi> which is a ſin of a high nature; and if <hi>for oathes
the Land mourneth,</hi> much more for breach of oathes. To
break covenant is a ſin of ſpirituall adultery; for by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting
with God we do as it were <hi>joyne our ſelves in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
to God,</hi> as the Hebrew word ſignifieth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 5. Now to
break the <hi>mariage knot</hi> is a ſin for which God may juſtly give
a Bill of divorce to a Nation. To <hi>break covenant</hi> is a ſin of
<hi>injuſtice;</hi> for by our covenant we do enter as it were into
<hi>bond</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and engage our ſelves as a creditor to his debtor,
Now the ſin of injuſtice is a <hi>Land-deſtroying ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth reaſon why God muſt needs be avenged of
thoſe that are <hi>covenant-breakers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> is, becauſe it is an act of the
higheſt <hi>Sacriledge</hi> that can be committed. For by virtue of
the <hi>Covenant</hi> the Lord layes claime to us as his peculiar inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
<hi>Ezek. 16. 8. I ſware unto thee, and entred into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with thee, and thou becameſt mine. Ier. 31. 33. I will be
their God and they ſhall be my people.</hi> It is worthy obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that in the <hi>Covenant</hi> there is a double <hi>ſurrender,</hi> one on
<hi>Gods part,</hi> another on our part. God Almighty makes a <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render</hi>
of himſelf, and of his <hi>Sonne,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
Behold, ſaith <hi>God,</hi> I am wholly thy <hi>God;</hi> all my power, and
wiſdome, and mercy, and goodneſſe, &amp;c. is all thine, my <hi>Son</hi>
is thine, and all his rich purchaſes. My <hi>ſpirit</hi> is thine and all
his graces. This is <hi>Gods ſurrender.</hi> On our parts, when we
take hold of the Covenant, we make a delivery of our bodies
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113468:14"/>
and ſoules into the hands of God, we chooſe him to be our
Lord and Governour, we reſigne up our ſelves into his hands.
Lord we are thine at thy diſpoſing; we alienate our ſelves
from our ſelves, and make a Deed of gift of our ſelves, and
give thee the lock and key of head, heart, and affections, &amp;c.
This is the nature of every religious Covenant, but eſpecially
of the Covenant of grace. But now for a Chriſtian to call in
as it were his <hi>ſurrender,</hi> to diſclaime his <hi>reſignation,</hi> to ſteale
away himſelf from God and to lay claim to himſelf after his
alienation; to fulfill his owne luſts, to walk after his owne
wayes, to do what he liſts, and not what he hath covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to do, and ſo to rob God of what is his, this is the <hi>higheſt
degree of Sacriledge,</hi> which God will never ſuffer to go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.
And ſurely if the ſtick-gatherer, that did but alienate
a little of Gods time; and <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
but ſome part of their eſtate: and if <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing
the conſecrated veſſels of the Temple were ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
puniſhed; how much more will God puniſh thoſe
that alienate themſelves from the ſervice of that God to
whom they have ſworn to be obedient? It is obſerved by a
learned Author, of three famous Commanders of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
that they never proſpered after they had defiled and robbed
the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, he went
into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> a place never before entred by
any but the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> and the Lord blaſted him in all his
proceedings after that time. <hi>Vt ille qui terram non habuit
ante ad victoriam, deeſſet illi terra ad ſepulturam:</hi> That he
that before that time wanted earth to overcome, had not
at laſt earth enough to bury him withall. The next was
<hi>Craſſus,</hi> who took away 10000 talents of gold from the
Temple, and afterwards dyed, by having gold poured down
his throat. The third was <hi>Caſſius,</hi> who afterwards killed
himſelf. If then God did thus avenge himſelf of thoſe that
polluted his <hi>conſecrated Temple;</hi> much more will he not leave
them unpuniſhed that are the <hi>living temples</hi> of the <hi>Holy
Ghoſt,</hi> conſecrated to God by a <hi>covenant,</hi> and afterwards
prove <hi>ſacrilegious,</hi> robbing <hi>God</hi> of that worſhip and ſervice
which they have ſworn to give him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:113468:15"/>
The fifth reaſon why this ſin makes the times perilous is,<note place="margin">Reaſon 5.</note>
becauſe <hi>covenant-breakers</hi> are reckoned amongſt the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of thoſe that have the <hi>mark</hi> of <hi>reprobation</hi> upon them. I
do not ſay that they are all Reprobates; yet I ſay that the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> makes it to be one of thoſe ſins which are committed
by thoſe that are given up to a reprobate minde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28.
31. The words are ſpoken of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of breaking of covenants made between man and
man. But then the Argument will hold <hi>à fortiori.</hi> If it be
the brand of a reprobate to break covenant with man, much
more to break a <hi>covenant</hi> made with the great <hi>Jehovah</hi> by the
lifting up of our hands to Heaven.</p>
            <p>The laſt reaſon is,<note place="margin">Reaſon 6.</note> becauſe it is a ſin againſt ſuch infinite
mercy, ſuch bowels of Gods unexpreſſible mercy. It is ſaid,
<hi>Jer. 31. 32. Which covenant they brake, although I was a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
to them.</hi> That is; Although I had choſen them for my
Spouſe, and married my ſelf unto them with an everlaſting
covenant of mercy, and intailed Heaven upon them, yet they
have broken my covenant. This was a great provocation.
Thus <hi>Ezek. 16. 4, 5. When thou waſt in thy blood and no eye pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
thee to have compaſſion upon thee, I ſaid unto thee when
thou wert in thy blood, Live;</hi> yea, <hi>I ſaid unto thee, Live.</hi> It is
twice repeated. As if God ſhould ſay, Mark it O Iſrael, when
no eye regarded thee, then I ſaid unto thee, Live. <hi>Behold,</hi>
ſaith God, verſe 8. <hi>Thy time was the time of love.</hi> Behold
and wonder at it, <hi>and I ſpread my skirt over thee, and covered
thy nakedneſſe: yea, I ſware unto thee, and entred into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with thee,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and thou becameſt mine.</hi> And
yet for all this thou haſt ſinned grievouſly againſt me. <hi>Woe,
woe unto thee, ſaith the Lord God, Ezek.</hi> 16. 23. There is a,
<hi>five fold mercy</hi> in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> (eſpecially in the covenant of
grace) that makes the ſinne of <hi>covenant-breaking</hi> to be ſo
odious.</p>
            <p>1. It is a mercy that the great <hi>God</hi> will vouchſafe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into <hi>covenant</hi> with duſt and aſhes. As <hi>David</hi> ſaith in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
caſe, <hi>Is it a ſleight matter to be the ſon in law of a King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
So may I ſay, Is it a ſleight matter for the Lord of Heaven and
Earth to condeſcend ſo far as to covenant with his poor
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113468:15"/>
creatures, and thereby to become their <hi>debtors,</hi> and to make
them as it were his <hi>equals?</hi> When <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into a covenant of friendſhip, though one was a Kings
ſon, the other a poor Shepherd, yet there was then a kinde
of equality between them. But this muſt be underſtood wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
according to that text 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 9. Bleſſed be God who hath
called us into the fellowſhip of his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
He is ſtill our Lord, though in fellowſhip with us. It is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of infinite condeſcenſion on Gods part, whereby he
enters into a league of friendſhip with his people.</p>
            <p>2. The mercy is the greater, becauſe this <hi>covenant</hi> was
made after the fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> after we had broken the firſt
covenant. That the Lord ſhould try us the ſecond time, is
not only an act of infinite goodneſſe in God, but of infinite
mercy. There is a difference between the <hi>goodneſſe</hi> and the
<hi>mercy</hi> of God. <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> may be ſhewed to thoſe that are
not in <hi>miſery:</hi> but <hi>mercy</hi> ſuppoſeth <hi>miſery.</hi> And this was
our condition after the breach of the firſt <hi>covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That <hi>God</hi> ſhould make this covenant with <hi>Man,</hi> and
not with <hi>Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. This ſets out the mercy of the <hi>covenant,</hi> becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
ſuch rare and glorious benefits, and therefore it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a <hi>covenant of life and peace, Mal. 2. 5. an everlaſting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
even the ſure mercies of David, Eſay</hi> 55. 3. It is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the <hi>waters of Noah, Eſay</hi> 54. 9. Famous are thoſe two
texts, <hi>Exod. 19. 5, 6. Ier.</hi> 32. 40, 41. Texts that hold forth
<hi>ſtrong conſolation.</hi> By virtue of the <hi>covenant,</hi> Heaven is not
only made poſſible, but certain to all believers, and certain
by way of <hi>oath.</hi> It is by virtue of the <hi>covenant</hi> that we call
God <hi>Father;</hi> and may lay claim to all the power, wiſdome,
goodneſſe, and mercy, &amp;c. that is in <hi>God.</hi> As <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> told
the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom he was joyned in covenant, <hi>I am
as thou art, my people as thy people, my horſes as thy horſes:</hi> So
doth God ſay to all that are in <hi>covenant</hi> with him; <hi>My
power is thine, my goodneſſe is thine, &amp;c.</hi> By virtue of this <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
whatſoever thou wanteſt, <hi>God</hi> cannot deny it thee, if
it be good for thee. Say unto God, <hi>Lord, thou haſt ſworne
to take away my heart of ſtone, and to give me a heart of fleſh.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113468:16"/>
Thou haſt ſworn to write thy law in my heart, thou haſt ſworn to
circumciſe my heart, thou haſt ſworn to give me Chriſt to be my
King, Prieſt, and Prophet, &amp;c.</hi> And God cannot but be a
<hi>covenant-keeper.</hi> By virtue of this <hi>covenant, God</hi> cannot but
accept of a poor penitent ſinner laying hold upon Chriſt for
pardon, 2 Chron. 7. 14. Jer. 3. 14. <hi>Promiſſa haec tuaſunt, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;
&amp; quis falli timet cum promittit ipſa veritas?</hi> In a word,
we may challenge pardon, and heaven by our <hi>covenant;</hi>
1 John 1. 9. God is not only <hi>mercifull,</hi> but <hi>juſt</hi> to forgive
us. We may challenge heaven through Chriſt out of juſtice.</p>
            <p>5. Adde laſtly, that the conditions of the Covenant on
our parts ſhould be upon ſuch eaſie termes, therefore it is
called a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Free-grace.</hi> All that <hi>God</hi> requires of
us, is to take hold of this Covenant; <hi>Iſ. 56. to receive this
gift of righteouſneſſe, Rom.</hi> 5. to take <hi>all Chriſt</hi> as he is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
in the <hi>Covenant.</hi> And that which is the greateſt conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of all, <hi>God</hi> hath promiſed in his Covenant to do our
part for us. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33, 34. Therefore it is called a <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
rather then a <hi>Covenant.</hi> (In the new Teſtament the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is alwayes uſed by the Apoſtle, and not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
<hi>Heaven</hi> is conveyed unto the elect by way of Legacie; It is
part of Gods <hi>Teſtament</hi> to write his law in our hearts, and
to cauſe us to walk in his wayes, &amp;c. Put theſe things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Seeing there is ſuch infinite mercy in the Covenant.
A mercy for <hi>God to enter into Covenant with us, to doe it with
us and not the Angels, with us fallen, with us upon ſuch eaſie
termes; and to make ſuch a Covenant, that contains ſo many, and
not only ſo, but all bleſſings here and hereafter in the wombe of
it;</hi> it muſt needs be a land-deſtroying and ſoul-deſtroying ſin
to be a <hi>Covenant-breaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The uſe and application of this doctrine is foure-fold.</p>
            <p>If it be ſuch a <hi>Land-devouring ſin</hi> to be a <hi>Covenant-breaker,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note>
let us from hence learn the <hi>true cauſe</hi> of all the miſeries that
have hapned unto <hi>England</hi> in theſe late yeers.<note place="margin">Of Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> The <hi>wombe,</hi> out
of which all our calamities are come. <hi>England</hi> hath broken
<hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> and now <hi>God</hi> is breaking <hi>England</hi> in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
even as a Potter breakes a veſſell in pieces. <hi>God hath ſent
his ſword to avenge the quarrell of his Covenant.</hi> As Chriſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113468:16"/>
whipt the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple, with whips
made of the cords which they brought to tye their oxen and
ſheep withall. A <hi>Covenant</hi> is a cord to ty us to God, and
now <hi>God</hi> hath made an iron whip of theſe cords which we
have broken aſunder to whip us withall.</p>
            <p>We are a nation in <hi>Covenant with God,</hi> we have the <hi>books
of the Covenant,</hi> the Old and New Teſtament; we have the
<hi>ſeales of the Covenant,</hi> Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper. We
have the <hi>Meſſengers of the Covenant,</hi> the Miniſters of the
Goſpell. We have the <hi>Angell of the covenant,</hi> the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt fully and clearly ſet out before us in the Miniſtery of
the Word. But alas, are not theſe bleſſings amongſt us, as the
Ark was amongſt the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> rather as <hi>priſoners,</hi> then as
<hi>priviledges;</hi> rather <hi>in teſtimonium &amp; ruinam, quam in ſalutem,</hi>
rather for our <hi>ruine,</hi> then for our <hi>happineſſe?</hi> May it not be
ſaid of us, as Reverend <hi>Moulin</hi> ſaid of the French Proteſtants;
<hi>While they burned us</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for reading the Scriptures, we
burnt with zeale to be reading of them: now with our liberty is
bred alſo negligence and diſeſteem of Gods word?</hi> So it is with
us. While we were under the <hi>Tyranny of the Biſhops,</hi> oh how
ſweet was a <hi>Faſting-day!</hi> how <hi>beautifull were the feet of
them that brought the Goſpell of peace unto you?</hi> How dear and
precious were Gods people one to another, &amp;c. But now
how are our <hi>Faſting-dayes</hi> ſleighted and vilified? how are
the people of God divided one from another, railing upon
(in ſtead of loving) one another? And is not the <hi>godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery</hi>
as much perſecuted by the tongues of ſome that would
be accounted godly, as heretofore by the <hi>Biſhops hands?</hi> Is not
the <hi>Holy Bible</hi> by ſome rather <hi>wreſted</hi> then <hi>read?</hi> wreſted
I ſay by ignorant and unſtable ſoules, to their own deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And as for the <hi>ſeales of the covenant.</hi> Firſt, for the <hi>Lords
Supper;</hi> How often have we ſpilt the <hi>bloud of Chriſt</hi> by our
unworthy approaches to his Table? and hence it is, that he
is now ſpilling our blood. How hard a matter is it to obtain
power to keep the blood of Chriſt from being profaned by
ignorant and ſcandalous Communicants? and can we think
that God will be eaſily intreated to ſheath up his bloody
ſword, and to ceaſe ſhedding our blood? Secondly, for the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113468:17"/>
               <hi>Sacrament of Baptiſme;</hi> How <hi>cruell</hi> are men grown to their
<hi>little infants,</hi> by keeping of them from the ſeale of entrance
into the <hi>Kingdome of heaven,</hi> and making their children
(their own children) to be juſt in the ſame condition with
the children of <hi>Turks and Infidels?</hi> I remember at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of theſe warres, there was a great fear fell upon godly
people about their little children, and all their care was for
their preſervation, and their ſafety; and for the continuance
of the Goſpell to them, &amp;c. But now our little children are
likely to be in a worſer condition then ever. The Oxford
Army labour to ſteale away the <hi>Goſpell</hi> from them, and the
<hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> labours to ſteale away the <hi>ſeale of the covenant of
Grace</hi> from them; and that which is worſer then all, there
are ſome <hi>godly people</hi> love to have it ſo. And all this is come
upon us as a juſt puniſhment of our <hi>Baptiſmall covenant-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</hi>
And as for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who is the <hi>Angell</hi> of the <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi>
are there not ſome amongſt us that <hi>un-god Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
and is it not fit and equall that <hi>God</hi> ſhould <hi>un-church</hi> us, and
<hi>un-people us?</hi> Are there not thouſands that have ſworne to
be <hi>Chriſts ſervants,</hi> and yet are in their lives the <hi>Vaſſals of
ſin and Satan?</hi> And ſhall not God be avenged of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as this? Theſe things conſidered, it is no wonder our
miſeries are ſo great, but the wonder is, that they are no
greater.</p>
            <p>The ſecond uſe,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> is an uſe of examination.</p>
            <p>Dayes of <hi>humiliation</hi> ought to be dayes of <hi>ſelfe-examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether we be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breakers or no.</note>
Let us therefore upon ſuch a day as this is, examine
whether we be not amongſt the number of thoſe that make
the times perilous, whether we be not <hi>covenant-breakers?</hi>
Here I will ſpeak of three covenants: Firſt, of the <hi>covenant
we made with God in our Baptiſme.</hi> Secondly, of the <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
which we have made with God in our diſtreſſes.</hi> Thirdly,
and eſpecially of this <hi>covenant which you are to renue this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt for the Covenant we make in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</note> of the <hi>covenant</hi> which we made in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
every time we come to the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and upon our
ſolemn dayes of faſting. There are none here, but I may ſay
of them, The <hi>vowes of God are upon you.</hi> You are <hi>ſervi nati,
empti, jurati;</hi> you are the <hi>born, bought,</hi> and <hi>ſworn ſervants</hi> of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113468:17"/>
               <hi>God,</hi> you have made a <hi>ſurrender</hi> of your ſelves unto <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Chriſt.</hi> The queſtion I put to you is this: How often have
you <hi>broke covenant</hi> with <hi>God?</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>Iſaiah 33. 14. The
ſinners of Sion are afraid: who ſhall dwell with everlaſting bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings?
who ſhall dwell with devouring ſire, &amp;c.</hi> When God
comes to a <hi>Church-ſinner,</hi> to a ſinner under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
much more to a <hi>Chriſtian ſinner;</hi> a ſinner under the
<hi>New Teſtament:</hi> and layeth to his charge his often covenant-breaking,
<hi>fearfulneſſe</hi> ſhall <hi>poſſeſſe</hi> him, and he will cry out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Oh! woe is me, <hi>who can dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> our
<hi>God</hi> is a <hi>conſuming fire,</hi> and we are as <hi>ſtubble</hi> before him.
<hi>Who can ſtand before his indignation?</hi> (Nahum 1. 6.) <hi>Who can
abide in the fierceneſſe of his anger? when his fury is poured forth
like fire, and the rockes are throwne down before him.</hi> Who can
ſtand? Of all ſorts of creatures, a ſinfull Chriſtian ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be able to ſtand before the Lord, when he comes to viſit
the world for their ſins. For when a <hi>chriſtian</hi> ſinnes againſt
God, he ſins not only againſt the <hi>Commandement,</hi> but againſt
the <hi>covenant.</hi> And in every ſin he is a <hi>commandement-breaker,</hi>
and a <hi>covenant-breaker.</hi> And therefore whereas the Apoſtle
ſaith, <hi>Tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoule that ſinneth, but
firſt upon the Jew; &amp;c.</hi> I may adde; Firſt upon the <hi>chriſtian,</hi>
then upon the <hi>Jew,</hi> and then upon the <hi>Grecian;</hi> becauſe the
covenant made with the Chriſtian is called a <hi>better covenant;</hi>
and therefore his <hi>ſins</hi> have a higher aggravation in them.
There is a notable paſſage in <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in which he brings the
Devill thus pleading with God againſt a wicked chriſtian at
the day of judgement. <hi>Aequiſſime judex, judica quod aequum
eſt, judica meum eſſe qui tuus eſſe noluit poſt renunciationem;
Vt quid invaſit pannos meos? Quid apud eum laſcivia, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinentia,
&amp;c. quibus ipſe renunciaverit? Quid intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia,
quid gula, quid faſtus, quid caetera mea? Haec omnia mea
poſt renunciationem invaſit. Meus eſſe voluit, mea concupivit;
Judica, aequiſſime judex, quoniam quem tu non dedignatus es tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
pretio liberare, ipſe mihi poſtmodum voluit obligare.</hi> That is,
Oh thou righteous Judge, give right judgement! Judge
him to be mine, who refuſed to be thine even after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
me in his Baptiſme; What had he to doe to wear my
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113468:18"/>
Livery? What had he to doe with gluttony, drunkenneſſe,
pride, wantonneſſe, incontinencie; and the reſt of my ware?
All theſe things he hath practiſed ſince he renounced the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
and all his works. Mine he is, judge righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
For he whom thou haſt not diſdained to dye for, hath
obliged himſelfe to me by his ſins, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now what can <hi>God</hi> ſay to this charge of the Devils, but,
<hi>Take him Devill,</hi> ſeeing he would be thine; take him, <hi>torment</hi>
him with <hi>everlaſting torments? Cyprian</hi> brings in the Devill
thus ſpeaking to Chriſt at the great day of judgement, <hi>Ego
pro iſtis quos mecum vides nec alapas accepi, nec flagella ſuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nui,
nec crucem pertuli, nec ſanguinem fudi, ſed nec regnum coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſte
illis promitto, nec ad paradiſum evoco, &amp; tamen ſe mihi
ſua<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> omnia conſecrarunt.</hi> I have not (ſaith the Devill) been
whipt and ſcourged, and crucified, neither have I ſhed my
blood for theſe whom thou ſeeſt with me. I do not promiſe
them a kingdome of heaven, &amp;c. and yet theſe men have
wholly conſecrated themſelves to me and my ſervice. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
if the Devill could make ſuch gainfull covenants with us,
and beſtow ſuch glorious mercies upon us as are contained
within the Covenant, our ſerving of Satan and ſinne might
have ſome excuſe. But when as his <hi>covenant</hi> is a <hi>covenant</hi> of
bondage, death, hell, and damnation: and <hi>Gods covenant</hi> is
a <hi>covenant</hi> of liberty, grace, and eternall happineſſe, it muſt
needs be a ſin inexcuſable, to be willingly and wilfully ſuch
a <hi>covenant-breaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Concerning our vowes to God in our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe.</note> let us examine concerning the <hi>vowes</hi> which we
have made to God in our <hi>diſtreſſes:</hi> in our Perſonall diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and our Nationall diſtreſſes. Are we not like the children
of Iſrael of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal. 78. 34. When he ſlew them,
then they ſought him, and they returned and enquired early af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
God, &amp;c. Nevertheleſſe they did but flatter him with their
mouth, &amp;c. for their heart was not right with him, neither
were they ſtedfaſt in his covenant?</hi> Are we not like unto little
children, that while they are whipping will promiſe any
thing, but when the whipping is over will perform nothing?
Or like unto Iron that is very ſoft and malleable while it is
in the fire, but when it is taken out of the fire, returns pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113468:18"/>
to his former hardneſſe? This was <hi>Jacobs</hi> fault: He
made a <hi>vow</hi> when he was in diſtreſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 22. But he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
his covenant, and God was angry with him, and chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him in his daughter <hi>Dinah, Gen.</hi> 34. 5. and in his two ſons
<hi>Simeon and Levi.</hi> And at laſt God himſelf was fain to call to
him from Heaven to keep <hi>covenant.</hi> And after that time God
bleſſed <hi>Iacob</hi> exceedingly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 9, 10, 11, 12. We reade of
<hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 66. 13, 14, 15. that he profeſſeth of himſelf, that
he <hi>would go into Gods houſe, and pay the vowes which his lips
had uttered, and his mouth had ſpoken when he was in trouble.</hi>
But how few are there that imitate <hi>David</hi> in this thing?</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Concerning the ſolemne League and Covenant. Queſtions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</note> let us examine our ſelves concerning the ſolemne
League and Covenant which we are to renue this day. And
here I demand an anſwer to theſe queſtions.</p>
            <p>1. Are there not many amongſt us that <hi>ſcorn</hi> it and ſpeak
<hi>reproachfully</hi> of it? That deal with it as the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
did with Manna, which at firſt they did ſo highly value,
as that they could not be kept within doors from gathering
of it,<note place="margin">Queſt. 1.</note> no not upon the Sabbath day; but afterwards they
came to loathe it as much as ever before they loved it. And
do not we deal ſo with the Covenant?</p>
            <p>2.<note place="margin">Queſt. 2.</note> Are there not ſome that write againſt it, and that ſay
in effect, That the <hi>perjury</hi> that is committed about it, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>taking</hi> of it then in <hi>breaking</hi> of it, and that it was not
a right, but a <hi>raſh oath?</hi> which I ſpeak not only to the ſhame
of thoſe that write thus, but alſo to the ſhame of thoſe that
ſuffer ſuch things to be written and to go unqueſtioned.</p>
            <p>3.<note place="margin">Queſt. 3.</note> Are there not ſome that put <hi>corrupt gloſſes</hi> upon it, and
deale <hi>falſely in the Covenant?</hi> that ſay, that by virtue of the
<hi>Covenant</hi> all <hi>Miniſters</hi> are bound to renounce their <hi>miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
(even that <hi>miniſtery</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath bleſſed and put his
ſeale unto by the converſion of thouſands) and either to take
it up again by <hi>Ordination</hi> from the <hi>people;</hi> or if we finde no
warrant in the Word for that way, then to turn <hi>Seekers,</hi> and
to wait till <hi>God</hi> ſend <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to ordain <hi>Miniſters?</hi> And yet
theſe men cannot but know that the <hi>Parliament</hi> in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
for <hi>Ordination</hi> of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> have declared, that this
is not the meaning of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> Others there are that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113468:19"/>
ſay; That by virtue of the <hi>Covanant</hi> no man ought to pay
<hi>tythes</hi> to his <hi>Miniſter</hi> unleſſe he will incurre the ſin of <hi>perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
Theſe men may as well ſay, That by the <hi>Covenant</hi> no
<hi>Tenant</hi> ought to pay rent to his <hi>Landlord,</hi> and that no man
ought to keep the laws of the Realm. For we challenge our
<hi>tythes</hi> by virtue of the Laws eſtabliſhed, &amp;c. We challenge
a ſufficient maintenance by <hi>Gods</hi> law. But as for the <hi>tenth
part</hi> (though there are ſome that ſay much out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for it) yet we require it as due only by the laws of the
Kingdome.</p>
            <p>4.<note place="margin">Queſt. 4.</note> Are there not ſome that deal <hi>hypocritically</hi> in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant?</hi>
that take it meerly to ſerve their own turns, to ſave
their credits, or to ſave their eſtates, or to hide their <hi>malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy?</hi>
That are like unto the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> of whom it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that when the <hi>Jewes</hi> were in adverſity, they would
renounce the Jewiſh religion and all alliance with them:
but when the <hi>Jewes</hi> were in proſperity, then they would
pretend kindred, and profeſſe themſelves to be of the <hi>Iewiſh
Religion.</hi> Juſt ſo do many <hi>Oxford-malignants</hi> deal with the
<hi>Parliament.</hi> While we are in proſperity, they are <hi>Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and for the Parliament. But if ever <hi>God</hi> ſhould bring us
again into a low condition, they would quickly appear to be
<hi>Anti-covenanters</hi> and <hi>Anti-parliamenters.</hi> I have heard a
ſtory of a Gaoler, that being required either to take the
Covenant, or to leave his place; he conſulted with his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
drunkard about it; and he anſwered, That he could not
deny but that the taking of the <hi>Covenant</hi> was a very <hi>bitter
pill:</hi> but ſeeing there was no remedy, his advice was, <hi>To
ſwallow it down and not to think on it.</hi> And ſhall not God be
avenged of ſuch a Nation as this?</p>
            <p>But the great queſtion, and that which doth moſt nearly
concerne us that are here, is;</p>
            <p>5.<note place="margin">Queſt. 5.</note> Are we not <hi>Covenant-breakers?</hi> Do we not make the
times perilous by our falſifying of our oath and <hi>covenant with
God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In our Covenant we ſwear to ſix things.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">Six things ſworn unto in the Covenant.</note> That we will <hi>endeavour</hi> to be <hi>humbled for our own ſins
and for the ſins of the Kingdome.</hi> But where ſhall we finde a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113468:19"/>
               <hi>mourner in England</hi> for his own abominations, and for the
abominations that are committed in the midſt of us? It is
eaſie to finde a <hi>Cenſurer</hi> of the ſins of the Land, but hard
to finde a true mourner for the ſins of the Land.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we ſwear <hi>that we will endeavour to goe before one
another in the example of a reall Reformation.</hi> But who makes
conſcience of this part of the Oath? What ſin haſt thou left,
or in what one thing haſt thou bin reformed ſince thou took<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
this Covenant? We read, <hi>Ezra 10. 3. That they entred
into Covenant, to put away their wives &amp; their children by them:</hi>
which was a very difficult and hard duty, and yet they did it.
But what boſome ſin, what beloved ſin, as dear to thee as
thy dear wife and children, haſt thou left for Gods ſake ſince
thou tookeſt this Oath? I read <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. 13. that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
took an Oath to make <hi>reſtitution,</hi> which was a <hi>coſtly du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and yet they performed it, ſaith the Text. But alas! where
is the man that hath made <hi>reſtitution</hi> of his ill gotten goods
ſince he took this Covenant? I reade, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 16. that
King <hi>Aſa</hi> depoſed his mother <hi>Maachah, her, even her, from
being Queen,</hi> after he had entred into Covenant: and that
the people, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 18. after they had ſworn a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
brake in pieces all the Altars of Baal thoroughly.</hi> But
where is this <hi>thorough Reformation,</hi> this <hi>thorough</hi> amendment
of life? Indeed here is much talk of a <hi>Reformation,</hi> but little
practice of a <hi>Reformation.</hi> We ſay we <hi>fight</hi> for a <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
but I fear leſt in a little time we ſhould <hi>fight</hi> away all
our <hi>Reformation:</hi> or if not <hi>fight</hi> it away, yet we ſhould <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute</hi>
it away. For now all our religion is turned into <hi>Vtrum's,</hi>
into <hi>Queſtions,</hi> inſomuch as that there are ſome that call all
<hi>religion</hi> into <hi>queſtion,</hi> and in a little while will loſe all
<hi>religion</hi> in the crowd of <hi>queſtions. Inter diſputandum veritas,
&amp; religio amittitur.</hi> There was a time not many years agoe,
when God did bleſſe our Miniſtery in the City, to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi>
of many people unto God; but now there are
many that ſtudy more to <hi>gain parties</hi> to themſelves, then to
<hi>gain ſouls to God.</hi> The great work of <hi>Converſion</hi> is little
thought on. And never ſo few (if any at all) converted as
in theſe days wherein we talk ſo much of <hi>Reformation.</hi>
And is this to keep Covenant with God?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:113468:20"/>
3. We ſweare <hi>to endeavour to amend the lives, and reforme
not only our ſelves, but all thoſe that are under our charge.</hi> But
where is this Family-reformation? Indeed I reade of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
that when he went to perform his vow and covenant, he
firſt reformed his family, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 3. And that <hi>Joſhua</hi> reſolved
(and performed it) <hi>for himſelf and his family to ſerve the Lord.</hi>
And ſo did <hi>Joſiah, 2 Chron.</hi> 34. And oh that I could adde,
<hi>And ſo do we!</hi> But the wickedneſſes committed in our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
proclaim the contrary to all the world. What <hi>Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
what <hi>Aldermans,</hi> what <hi>Merchants</hi> family is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
ſince the Covenant, then before? We ſpeak and
contend much for a <hi>Church-reformation;</hi> but how can there
be a <hi>Church-reformation,</hi> unleſſe there be firſt a <hi>Family-refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?</hi>
What though the <hi>Church-worſhip</hi> be pure, yet if the
<hi>worſhippers</hi> be impure, God will not accept of the <hi>worſhip?</hi>
And if families be not reformed, how will your worſhippers
be pure?</p>
            <p>4. We ſwear <hi>to endeavour to bring the Churches of God in
the three Kingdomes, to the neareſt conjunction and uniformity
in Religion, confeſſion of Faith, form of Church-government,
Directory for worſhip and catechizing, &amp;c.</hi> But are there not
ſome that write againſt an <hi>Vniformity</hi> in Religion, and call
it an <hi>Idoll?</hi> Are there not many that walk profeſſedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this clauſe of the <hi>Covenant?</hi> There are three texts of
Scripture that people keep the quite contrary way. The firſt
is, <hi>Mat. 6. 34. 31. 25. Take no thought what you ſhall eat, &amp;c.
take no thought for to morrw.</hi> And moſt people take thought
for nothing elſe. The ſecond text is, <hi>Matth. 6. 33. Seek ye firſt
the kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> And moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſeek this laſt of all. The third text is, <hi>John 6. 27. Labour
not for the meat that periſheth, but for the meat that endureth
for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> And moſt people labour not for the meat that
endureth for ever, but for the meat that periſheth. As theſe
three texts are kept, ſo do many people keep this part of the
Oath; for there were never more <hi>diviſions</hi> and <hi>differences</hi> in
the Church, never more <hi>difformity,</hi> and pleading againſt <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi>
then now there is.</p>
            <p>5. We ſwear <hi>to endeavour the extirpation of Popery, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113468:20"/>
Superſtition, Hereſie, Schiſme, &amp;c.</hi> And yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
there are ſome that have taken this Oath, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
earneſtly for a <hi>Toleration of all Religions:</hi> which (as I
conceive) is as contrary to this clauſe of the Covenant as
<hi>Heaven is to Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. <hi>We ſwear againſt a deteſtable indifferency and Neutrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in this cauſe which ſo much concerneth the glory of God, &amp;c.</hi>
And yet how many are there amongſt us that are like unto
<hi>Gallio,</hi> that care not what becomes of the <hi>cauſe of God,</hi> ſo they
may have peace and quiet? That will not be the <hi>backwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt</hi>
of all, and yet will be ſure not to be too <hi>forward,</hi> for
fear leſt if the times turn, they ſhould be noted amongſt the
chief of the <hi>faction?</hi> That are very indifferent which ſide
prevaile, ſo they may have their trading again? That ſay as
the <hi>Polititian, That they will be carefull not to come too near the
heels of Religion, leſt it ſhould daſh out his braines:</hi> And as the
King of <hi>Arragon</hi> told <hi>Beza, That he would wade no farther
into the ſea of Religion, then he could ſafely return back to ſhoar?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all theſe ſix particulars let us ſeriouſly ſearch and try
our hearts, whether we be not amongſt the number of thoſe
that make the times perilous.</p>
            <p>The third uſe is for <hi>Humiliation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> Let the conſideration of
our <hi>Covenant-breaking,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> be a <hi>heart-breaking</hi> conſideration to
every one of us this day. Let this be a mighty and powerfull
Argument to humble us upon this day of Humiliation.</p>
            <p>There are five conſiderations that are exceedingly <hi>ſoul-humbling,</hi>
if God bleſſe them unto us.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">Five ſoul-hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</note> The conſideration of the many <hi>Commandements</hi> of God
that we have often and often broken.</p>
            <p>2. The conſideration of the <hi>breaking</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for
our ſins, how he was rent and torn for our iniquities.</p>
            <p>3. The conſideration of the <hi>breaking of the bread,</hi> and the
<hi>pouring</hi> out of the <hi>wine</hi> in the Sacrament, which is a heart-breaking
motive and help.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>broken condition</hi> that the <hi>Kingdome of England,
Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that <hi>Germany</hi> is in at this time.</p>
            <p>5. The many <hi>Vowes and Covenants</hi> that we have broken;
our <hi>Sacrament-Covenants,</hi> our <hi>Faſting-Covenants,</hi> our <hi>Sick-bed-covenants.</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:113468:21"/>
And eſpecially the conſideration of our often
breaking of our <hi>Nationall-covenant</hi> which you come this day
to renue. This is a ſin in <hi>Folio,</hi> a ſin of a <hi>high nature:</hi> and if
ever God awaken conſcience in this life, a ſin that will lye
like a heavie <hi>Incuba</hi> upon it. A greater ſin then a ſin againſt
a <hi>Commandement,</hi> or againſt an <hi>Ordinance.</hi> A ſin not only of
<hi>diſobedience,</hi> but of <hi>perjury.</hi> A ſin of <hi>injuſtice,</hi> of <hi>ſpirituall
adultery.</hi> A ſin of <hi>Sacriledge.</hi> A ſin of great <hi>unkindneſſe.</hi> A
ſin that makes us not only <hi>diſobedient,</hi> but <hi>diſhoneſt.</hi> For we
account him a diſhoneſt man that keeps not his word. A ſin
that not only every good <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but every good <hi>Heathen</hi>
doth abhorre. A ſin, that not only brings <hi>damnation</hi> upon
us, but caſteth ſuch into horrible <hi>diſgrace and reproach upon
God,</hi> that it cannot ſtand with Gods honour not to be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of a <hi>Covenant-breaker. Tertullian</hi> ſaith, that when a
Chriſtian forſakes his covenant, and the <hi>colours</hi> of Chriſt, and
turnes to ſerve as the Devils ſouldier, he puts an <hi>unſpeakable
diſcredit</hi> upon God and Chriſt. For it is as much as if he
ſhould ſay; <hi>I like the ſervice of the Devill better then the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God.</hi> And it is juſt as if a ſouldier that hath waged
war under a <hi>Captaine,</hi> and afterwards forſaking him turnes
to another, and after that, leaves this other Captaine and
returns to his former Captain. This is to preferre the firſt
Captain before the ſecond. This makes God complaine, <hi>Jer.</hi>
2. 4. <hi>What Iniquity have your Fathers found in me that they are
gone far from me, &amp;c.</hi> And in the 11 verſe, <hi>Hath any Nation
changed their Gods, which are yet no Gods? but my people have
changed their glory for that which doth not profit. Baſil</hi> brings
in the Devil inſulting over Chriſt, and ſaying, <hi>I never crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nor redeemed theſe men, and yet they have obeyed me, and
contemned thee, ô Chriſt, even after they have covenanted to
be thine.</hi> And then he addes, <hi>Equidem ego iſtam futuram ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus
Chriſtum gloriationem hoſtis inſolentem gravius longè
eſſe ſtatuo quam Gehennae ſupplicia.</hi> That is, <hi>I eſteem this inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Devill over Jeſus Chriſt at the great day, to be
more grievous to a true Saint, then all the torments in hell.</hi> A
ſaying worthy to be written in <hi>letters of gold.</hi> Seeing then
that <hi>covenant-breaking</hi> is ſo great an abomination, the Lord
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113468:21"/>
give us hearts to be humbled for this great abomination this day.
And this will be a notable preparation to fit you to the renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of your <hi>Covenant.</hi> For we reade that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> firſt called his
people to <hi>faſt,</hi> before he drew them into a Covenant. According
to which pattern you are here met to pray, and faſt, and humble
your ſoules for your former <hi>covenant-breaking;</hi> and then to
binde your ſelves anew unto the <hi>Lord our God.</hi> As <hi>wax</hi> when it
is melted will receive the impreſſion of a ſeal, which it will not
do before: So will your hearts when <hi>melted</hi> into <hi>godly ſorrow</hi>
for your ſins, receive the <hi>ſeal</hi> of <hi>God</hi> abidingly upon them, which
they will not do when hardned in ſin.</p>
            <p>Is every man that ſins againſt the <hi>Covenant</hi> to be accounted
a <hi>Covenant-breaker,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Object.</note> and a <hi>perjured, ſacrilegious</hi> perſon?</p>
            <p>By no means.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> For as every <hi>failing</hi> of a <hi>Wife</hi> doth not break
the <hi>Covenant</hi> between her and her Husband; but ſhe is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a Wife till ſhe by committing adultery break the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
So every miſcariage againſt the <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this <hi>Nationall covenant,</hi> doth not denominate us in a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell-account
Covenant-breakers.</hi> But then God accounts us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his Goſpel to break covenant, when we do not only ſin,
but <hi>commit ſin</hi> againſt the <hi>Covenant,</hi> when we do not only ſin out
of <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> but out of <hi>wickedneſſe;</hi> when we do not only <hi>faile,</hi>
but <hi>fall</hi> into ſin: when we <hi>forſake</hi> &amp; <hi>renounce</hi> the <hi>Covenant,</hi> when
we deale <hi>treacherouſly in the Covenant,</hi> and enter into <hi>league</hi> and
<hi>covenant</hi> with thoſe ſins which we have ſworn againſt. When we
walk into <hi>Anti-covenant</hi> paths, and willingly do contrary to
what we ſwear; then are we perjured, &amp; unjuſt, and ſacrilegious,
and guilty of all theſe ſins formerly mentioned.</p>

the <hi>Covenant</hi> a <hi>daily argument</hi> againſt all ſin &amp; iniquity, and when
we are tempted to any ſin, let us ſay, <hi>I have ſworn to forſake my

but an <hi>Oath-breaker;</hi> I am <hi>perjur'd.</hi> I have

When any one tempts thee by promiſe of preferment

he required aid of him againſt the Romanes. <hi>When I was 9 years
old</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>my Father carried me to the Altar, and made me take
an Oath to be an irreconciliable foe to the Romanes. In purſuance
of this Oath, I have waged war againſt them thoſe. 36 years. To
keep this Oath I have left my Country, and am come to ſeek aid at
your hands, which if you deny, I will travell over all the world to
finde out ſome enemies to the Romane State. Odi, odioque ſum Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manis.</hi>
If an Oath did ſo mightily operate in <hi>Hannibal,</hi> let the
<hi>Oath</hi> you are to take this day, work as powerfully upon you;
And make your Oath an <hi>argument</hi> to oppoſe perſonall ſins, and
family ſins, and to oppoſe <hi>Hereſie, Schiſme,</hi> and <hi>all profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
and to endeavour to <hi>bring the Churches of God in the three
Kingdomes to the neereſt conjunction, and uniformity, &amp;c.</hi> And let
this Oath be <hi>armour of proof</hi> againſt all temptations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
And know this one thing, that if the Covenant be not a
daily argument and muniment againſt ſin, it will become upon
your breaking of it, <hi>quotidianum teſtimonium, &amp; aeternum oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium.</hi>
A <hi>daily witneſſe</hi> againſt you, as the book of the law was,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 26. and an <hi>everlaſting ſhame and reproach</hi> unto you and
yours.</p>
            <p>2. Let us have <hi>high thoughts of the Covenant.</hi> Actions, and
affections follow our apprehenſions. If thy <hi>judgement</hi> be <hi>belea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pred</hi>
with a corrupt opinion about the Covenant, thy affections
and actions will quickly be <hi>beleapred alſo.</hi> And therefore you
ought to endeavour according to your places, that nothing
be ſpoken, or written, that may tend to the <hi>prejudice of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>

Gods aſſiſtance,</hi> with <hi>ſelfe-abaſing, ſelfe-denying, ſelfe-humbling
hearts;</hi> you muſt take it <hi>joyfully</hi> and <hi>tremblingly;</hi> rejoycing in
God and in his ſtrength, and yet trembling for fear of your own
unworthineſſe and unſtedfaſtneſſe in the Covenant.</p>
            <p>4. You muſt take heed of the <hi>curſed ſin of ſelfe-love,</hi> which
is placed in the <hi>fore-front</hi> as the cauſe of all the Catalogue of

they are covetous, &amp;c. and therefore they are <hi>Covenant-breakers.</hi>
A <hi>ſelfe-ſeeker</hi> cannot be a <hi>Covenant-keeper;</hi> this is

of my Sermon to ſpeak on: but the time and your other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
will not permit. There is a <hi>naturall ſelfe-love,</hi> and a
<hi>divine ſelfe-love,</hi> and a <hi>ſinfull ſelfe-love.</hi> This <hi>ſinfull ſelf-love</hi>
is when we make our ſelves the laſt end of all our actions, when
we ſo <hi>love our ſelves,</hi> as to <hi>love no man but our ſelves,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Proverb, <hi>Every man for himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> When we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<hi>God</hi> and his <hi>glory,</hi> and the <hi>common good:</hi> but intend our
<hi>ſelves,</hi> and our own <hi>private gain</hi> and <hi>intereſt;</hi> when we ſerve
<hi>God</hi> upon <hi>politique deſignes;</hi> Of this ſinfull ſelf-love the Apoſtle
ſpeaks, <hi>Phil. 2. 21. For all ſeek their own, and not the things of
Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And if we had a window to look into the hearts
of moſt people, we ſhould finde their hearts made up all of this
Idolatrous <hi>ſelfe-love.</hi> Men deal with <hi>God</hi> as it is reported of
<hi>Cnidius</hi> a great <hi>Architectiſt,</hi> who building a ſumptuous Watch-Tower
for the <hi>King of Egypt</hi> (a Tower to diſcover the rocks
to Mariners) ſuch was his craft, that he cauſed his own name
to be <hi>engraven'd</hi> upon a <hi>ſtone</hi> in the wall, in <hi>great letters,</hi> and
over that ſtone he cauſed it to be plaiſtered with lime and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and upon the outſide wrote the name of the <hi>King of Egypt,</hi>
as pretending that he ſhould have all the honour. But here was
his cunning: he knew that in time the water would conſume (as
it did) the <hi>plaiſtering,</hi> and afterwards his own name and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſhould appear and abide. Juſt ſo doe moſt people deal with
<hi>God</hi> and with his religion, and with the publique. If we looke
without doors, we ſhall ſee nothing written but <hi>pro bono publico,
&amp;c.</hi> All their diſcourſe is for the better promoting of <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe:</hi>
but if we could look within, we ſhould ſee written, <hi>Pro
bono privato, &amp;c.</hi> All their deſignes are for to promote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
They <hi>monopolize</hi> and <hi>ingroſſe</hi> all to themſelves, as if made
for themſelves. Where this ſinfull ſelf-love <hi>dwels,</hi> there <hi>dwels</hi> no
<hi>love to God,</hi> no <hi>love to thy brother,</hi> no <hi>love to Church nor State.</hi>
This ſinfull ſelf-love is the <hi>Caterpillar</hi> that deſtroyeth Church
and Common-wealth. It is from this ſinfull ſelf-love that the
<hi>publique affairs</hi> drive on ſo heavily, and that <hi>Church-government</hi>
is not ſetled, and that our <hi>Covenant</hi> is ſo much neglected. Of
this ſin I cannot now ſpeak: but when <hi>God</hi> ſhall offer opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
I ſhall endeavour to uncaſe it before you. In the mean time,
the Lord give you grace to hate it as <hi>hell it ſelf.</hi>
