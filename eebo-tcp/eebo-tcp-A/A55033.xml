         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SECT. I. The Question rightly ≈øtated.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Que≈øtion which the Doctor hath propounded, as nece≈ø≈øary to be ≈øcanned is thus expre≈øt [<hi>Whether if any King will not di≈øcharge his Tru≈øt, but is bent or ≈øeduced to ≈øubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties, Subjects may take up Armes and Re≈øi≈øt?</hi>] He maintaines the negative, and his principall place of ≈øtrength is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Who≈øoever re≈øists ≈øhall receive to them≈øelves dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> This he interprets of re≈øi≈øting the higher power, mentioned <hi>ver.</hi> 1. by which he under≈øtands the King or Supreame; and the re≈øi≈øting, a re≈øi≈øting by Armes. But it ≈øeemes to me, however he make a ≈øhew of di≈øtinct handling his matter, that he either carele≈øly, or ≈øophi≈øtically confounds things, which ought to have been more di≈øtinctly expre≈øt by one that truly de≈øired to have re≈øolved con≈øciences in ≈øo weighty a cau≈øe, as forbearing to defend Religion, Laws and Liberties, when they are all in danger of ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion. To which purpo≈øe, I ≈øhall make bold to propound divers con≈øiderations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a better clearing of the true ≈øtate of the que≈øtion; and the ≈øtrength of his proofes for it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It cannot be imagined that a King, who is bent, or ≈øeduced to ≈øubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties, meanes to doe this by a meere per≈øonall ≈øtrength; (For which no <hi>Samp≈øon</hi>-like ≈øtrength would ≈øuffice) but by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of others, whether men in office, and tru≈øted with the civill Sword under him, if he can draw them into his de≈øigne, or by the ≈øouldiery ordinary or extraordinary; and that not in one part of the Kingdome, but in ≈øeverall parts, as fa≈øt as he can get in≈øtruments for his turn.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here then will come divers que≈øtions belonging to the ca≈øe. 1. Whether the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øting by Armes, the illegall attempts of an under Officer of Ju≈øtice; ≈øuppo≈øe a Major or Sheriffe, though armed with Commi≈ø≈øion under the Kings hand or ≈øeale, be a re≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the higher power and damnable. 2. Whether the re≈øi≈øting a Captaine of the Souldiery, comming to act any illegall commands with his bands of armed men, though he al≈øo have a like Commi≈ø≈øion from the King; be a re≈øi≈øting of the King, and ≈øo forbidden? Both the≈øe where the King is not pre≈øent, but in another part of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It will be further que≈øtioned (in ca≈øe he ≈øhould grant re≈øi≈øtance lawfull thus farr) whether it be lawfull to re≈øi≈øt the officers or ≈øouldiers of the King, he being be≈øides them, and animating them with his commands to doe violence? I will ≈øuppo≈øe for the pre≈øent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:39617:4"/>
the Kings per≈øon is and ≈øhall be ≈øafe, notwith≈øtanding the re≈øi≈øtance, or that els the re≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance mu≈øt be forborne. I onely aske, whether his followers commanded by him, ≈øtanding by to doe murthers and rapes may be re≈øi≈øted with armes or not.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If he will ≈øay that in all the≈øe ca≈øes re≈øi≈øtance may be made; ≈øo the Kings Per≈øon may be ≈øafe. 1. The King may thanke him for the care of his Per≈øon, but his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority is as much impugned by this, as by many that plead for the defence now actually under-taken. 2. The Cavaliers and Followers of the King will thanke him never a whit; For they may all be knocked on the head or ≈øtarved, and yet the Kings Per≈øon be ≈øafe. And they would ≈øoon de≈øert the cau≈øe, if this were beleeved, or would be rooted-out, if this were generally practi≈øed; and that is all the Defendants de≈øire, who honour the Kings Per≈øon and authority, as much as the Doctor or any of his fellows, not to ≈øay more; how ever they re≈øi≈øt his Cavaliers.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If he will deny re≈øi≈øtance where the King is pre≈øent, becau≈øe there his commands are certainly knowne to be his, which may be doubted of in remote Countries. Then, 1. So ≈øhould it have been expre≈øt for cleare under≈øtanding, and not coucht in uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 2. Then all the≈øe Cavaliers are ju≈øtly re≈øi≈øted where the King is not pre≈øent, which againe if it were believed and practi≈øed would ≈øoone end the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe; For even in the next Pari≈øh to the King, they might be re≈øi≈øted, though not where he appeares and ≈øpeakes. 3. What if it be doubted whether the King be not forced by threatnings and feare of his life to command ≈øo and ≈øo. Kings have been pri≈øoners, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ≈øo, and by wi≈øe and good Subjects, Ca≈øtles and Townes have bin kept by force of Armes again≈øt ≈øuch as they bad to a≈ø≈øault it, if not yeelded. Our Law ≈øuppo≈øes, <hi>The King can doe no wrong,</hi> yet ≈øuppo≈øes wrong may be done in his name by his followers; If he then command a notoriou≈øly wicked thing: The Law will ≈øuppo≈øe him forced or the like; And then re≈øi≈øtance ≈øhall be as well lawfull, as if he were ab≈øent. Or even nece≈ø≈øary to re≈øcue him out of ≈øuch wicked hands. 4. What if it be doubted, whether a King be bewitched by ≈øorceries? There have bin ≈øuch things of old, and the Devills power doth not ≈øeeme to be le≈ø≈øned now? 5. What if it be doubted, whether the King be di≈øtracted? A thing that hath befallen Kings as well as meane men? Are ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects bound from re≈øi≈øting the commands of a bewitched or di≈øtracted Per≈øon to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of Religion, Lawes, and liberties? ≈øtill pre≈øerving his per≈øon ≈øafe. 6. Suppo≈øe it be certaine he is not forced, nor bewitched, nor di≈øtracted: Yet doing as bad as any forced, bewitched or di≈øtracted per≈øon can po≈ø≈øibly doe, by commanding ≈øuch tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Acts, what rea≈øon can be imagined, why ≈øuch a command ≈øhould tie ≈øubjects hands from re≈øi≈øting his followers, offering to act his tyranny, more then if he were forced, bewitched or di≈øtracted? Is the liberty of his body and mind from tho≈øe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, an en≈ølaving of his people to his lawle≈ø≈øe lu≈øts of crueltie and mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe?</p>
            <p n="6">6. If he ≈øay further, that even his officers or ≈øouldiers, if they have his Seale or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant may not be re≈øi≈øted in the remote≈øt Country. Then be≈øides the former inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, the≈øe are to be added. 1. Any that come among ignorant common people may abu≈øe them at their plea≈øure, if they will but pretend the Kings Seale or Warrant. It hath bin counterfeited for Briefes: How ordinary would it be, if it might not be re≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted? How would malicious men murther with it? Robbers ≈øpoyle with it, and who could remedy it? 2. By this meanes any that had a de≈øigne to depo≈øe the King and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurpe the Kingdome, might by a counterfeit Seale and Warrant, kill all the Kings faithfulle≈øt Subjects, and ≈øtrengthen ≈øo him≈øelfe and his party, as the King ≈øhould after have no power to ≈øave him≈øelfe. Lawes ob≈øerved will ≈øecure ≈øufficiently from this. And
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39617:4"/>
liberty to re≈øi≈øt illegall violences will appeare to be nece≈ø≈øary to the Kings ≈øafety, as well as the Subjects. Kings have ≈øeldome or never bin murthered or depo≈øed, where Lawes have bin pre≈øerved in their vigour: But often where illegall violences have had place. Let this al≈øo not be forgotten.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Well but thus the ca≈øe I ≈øuppo≈øe is under≈øtood (if not by the Doctor, yet) by the generall of tho≈øe that take the Kings part again≈øt the Parliament, that neither the King in Per≈øon, nor any of his officers or ≈øouldiers, that have commi≈ø≈øion from him may be re≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted, becau≈øe that were to re≈øi≈øt the King, which ≈øay they all, the Apo≈øtle forbids and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. But here again I blame the Doctors negligent handling of that place up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divers con≈øiderations further.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Without doubt the fir≈øt ver≈øe is to be regarded, as being the foundation of the ≈øecond, as appeares by the word [<hi>Therefore</hi>] Yet that he hath greatly neglected. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for feare the ≈øcanning of it would doe him an ill turne, as I ≈øhall by and by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ≈øhew, by comparing the ≈øubjection commanded with the re≈øi≈øtance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the fir≈øt <hi>ver≈øe</hi> he doth very ill to reade alwayes (except once by chance, as I thinke) <hi>higher power</hi> for <hi>higher powers,</hi> and ≈øo never to tell us whether the other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (who are higher in relation to the common-people, though inferiour in relation to the ≈øupreme) S. <hi>Peters</hi> governours may be re≈øi≈øted or not? even with Arms. Perhaps this fraudulently al≈øo.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the ≈øecond <hi>ver≈øe,</hi> he is very carele≈ø≈øe to tell us, whether re≈øi≈øtance (which is three times in <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> but there are two Greeke words, the fir≈øt being different from the ≈øecond and third) ≈øignifie all kind of oppo≈øition, though without Armes, to the higher and ≈øupreme power at lea≈øt, but then much more with Arms? Or whether it only ≈øignifie re≈øi≈øting with Armes, and no other there forbidden, and made damnable. Yet this a needfull Que≈øtion, for a con≈øcience to be re≈øolved in, and more ordinarily then about re≈øi≈øting. And ≈øo would well have become the Doctors learning and pretended care of Con≈øcience, and even regard of Authority to have di≈øcour≈øed upon. But ≈øince he hath not vouch≈øafed to doe any of the≈øe, I ≈øhall take the paines to doe it for him, and for the con≈øcientious Readers, as well as I can.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The fir≈øt <hi>ver≈øe</hi> begins, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Let every ≈øoule be ≈øubject to the higher Powers.</hi> Here are two que≈øtions. 1. What is meant by being <hi>≈øubject.</hi> 2. What by <hi>higher Powers.</hi> By being ≈øubject is meant yeelding obedience, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther active or at lea≈øt pa≈ø≈øive, that is doing or forbearing acccording to command, or ≈øubmitting to ≈øuffering when one do's otherwi≈øe. It cannot be denied but both the≈øe are parts of ≈øubjection, and that ≈øo much is commanded by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> at lea≈øt in ≈øome ca≈øes. But the ≈øecond Que≈øtion, What is ment by <hi>higher Powers,</hi> will cleare in what ca≈øes either of the≈øe is required? By the higher powers then is meant all civill legall Authority, which in St. <hi>Peters</hi> phra≈øe is of the <hi>King as Supreame,</hi> or governour (for the≈øe are higher then the people, though lower then the King) but it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved that the word is in the ab≈øtract powers, which notes the authority, wherwith the per≈øon in authority is legally inve≈øted, and not the per≈øon in the concrete, lea≈øt that might be under≈øtood of his per≈øonall commands without or beyond, or even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt his Authority. Which conceit the Apo≈øtle doth greatly prevent by u≈øing the word <hi>Power,</hi> which he doth al≈øo all the while he treats of this matter, except only that once he names Rulers, <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is to be ob≈øerved that the things about which the authority, and ≈øo the ≈øubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39617:5"/>
in this place is conver≈øant are civill matters, belonging to the ≈øecond Table between man and man. Not that I deny Magi≈øtrates to have Authority to command things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the fir≈øt Table, and that ≈øubjection is due to them in ≈øuch commands concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Religion, ≈øo that it be according to the will of God. But I ≈øay, that this is to be fetcht from other Texts rather then this. My rea≈øon is, becau≈øe the <hi>Roman</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrates, of whom properly the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeakes, were ≈øo farre now from commanding things for Religion, that they commanded things again≈øt Religion, and the fir≈øt Table<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and therfore certainly the active ≈øubjection at lea≈øt here required is limited to civill matters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And now that ≈øo much as I have ≈øaid is required, active Obedience to legall, civill Authority to all Magi≈øtrates in their legall commands in civill matters; or at lea≈øt pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive yeelding to the penalty of the Laws, in ca≈øe of not obeying actively; and neither further then to legall commands of legall Authority, appeares by the Apo≈øtles rea≈øon in this 1. <hi>ver≈øe. For there is no power but of God</hi>; which he redoubles in a ≈øecond phra≈øe, <hi>The powers that be are ordained of God, or under God</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>. Every ≈øoule mu≈øt be under their order, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, becau≈øe they all are ordered by God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, his deputies and vicegerents in their order and degree, higher and highe≈øt. This is true of all powers, and therefore to all mu≈øt ≈øubjection be performed. And to none hath God ordered or ordained any Authority but legall. Which as none will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (no not the Doctor him≈øelfe) of other Governours be≈øides the ≈øupreme: So can none with rea≈øon affirme, that any hath more authority then the Laws, whether ≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or generall, written or unwritten, have allotted them. Which Lawes God ratifies (being not again≈øt his) and ≈øo the Authority according to them. And this our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor al≈øo confe≈ø≈øes (in ≈øence) in m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>re places then one of his Booke, for active Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that no more is due, but according to the Lawes of God, and the e≈øtabli≈øht laws of the Land. Only he argues for pa≈ø≈øive obedience beyond this, every where. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he argues again≈øt re≈øi≈øtance even of Tyranny. But in a word to refute this from the Apo≈øtles rea≈øon in the fir≈øt ver≈øe. If I be bound to be ≈øubject to tyranny, (or to ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer violence of a tyrant) by vertue of the commandement here. Then tyranny is the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, or Magi≈øtrates have power ordained of God to u≈øe tyrannous violence (for thus the Apo≈øtle argues for ≈øubjection from Gods ordaining the power) But this is fal≈øe. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ≈øo is that, that I ≈øhould be bound to ≈øuffer tyrannous vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>And now if this be the true and whole meaning of the precept in the fir≈øt ver≈øe, It will not be hard to cleare the meaning of the prohibition and threatning in the ≈øecond ver≈øe, which runnes thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Who≈øoever therefore re≈øi≈øts</hi> (or carries him≈øelfe di≈øorderly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the power, or oppo≈øes) <hi>the power, re≈øi≈øts</hi> or ≈øets him≈øelfe <hi>again≈øt the Ordinance</hi> (or order appointed) of <hi>God, and they that re≈øist</hi> (or ≈øo ≈øet them≈øelves again≈øt man and God both) <hi>≈øhall receive to them≈øelves Damnation.</hi> Now here we are to re≈øolve two Que≈øtions. 1. What re≈øi≈øtance is? 2. Who (or what) may not be re≈øi≈øted? 1. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance is contrary to ≈øubjection, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> is to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, and this al≈øo the word [<hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>] notes. For it ≈øhews that the ≈øin of Re≈øi≈øtance is a tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion of the duty of ≈øubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. It is then two-fold, either in not obeying commands, or in not ≈øuffering penalties. He that is wilfully, and ob≈øtinately di≈øobedient to ≈øome commands, is (by the Apo≈øtles ≈øcope, and by the con≈øent of all interpretours that handle it fully) a Re≈øi≈øter, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, though he never offer to take up Armes, but yeelds to ≈øuffer any penalty. A man that refu≈øes to an≈øwer at the Law, he ≈øhall be outlawed; he that refu≈øes to yeeld po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39617:5"/>
≈øhall have a Writ of Rebellion out again≈øt him; he that refu≈øes to put him≈øelfe upon a legall tryall at his arraignement, ≈øhall be pre≈ø≈øed to death, as a mo≈øt ob≈øtinate re≈øi≈øter of authority, and ≈øo in many other ca≈øes. Or ≈øecondly, Re≈øi≈øting is in not ≈øuffering penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, re≈øi≈øting by force, and even by Armes. This is one kind of re≈øi≈øting, and the wor≈øt kind again≈øt a lawfull power: but what it is, our ≈øecond Que≈øtion is to determine; which againe breakes it ≈øelfe into two. What is the power that may not be re≈øi≈øted? and who? In both, the former ver≈øe may, and mu≈øt guide us, as the word power repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the conjunction, <hi>therefore,</hi> and the mention of Gods Ordinance the third time a≈ø≈øures us. 1. Then what is the power that may not be re≈øi≈øted? The legall authority of the Magi≈øtrate, or the Magi≈øtrate legally commanding according to his authority. For as the ≈øubjection reaches to this, and no further. So the ≈øinfull re≈øi≈øtance extends to this, and is by it limited: becau≈øe Gods Ordinance hath confirmed all this, and no more. Only upon the change of the phr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By what authority then of the Text or context will he ≈øtretch the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to refu≈øing to ≈øuffer tyrannous violence? Or how does any re≈øi≈øt unlawfully (though by Armes) when unlawfull violence is offered him? which God no where gave autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to u≈øe to him, nor ever commanded him to yeeld unto? In a word, till Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance can be prov'd allowing tyranny (which can never be) or undeniably ordaining a man to ≈øuffer it, which is no where in his word (I meane the extremity of tyranny de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving of life, or ≈øo) though often it is ≈øo in his providence, when he affords no meanes of re≈øi≈øtance: This Text of the Apo≈øtle will no way condemne the re≈øi≈øting by Armes tyrannous and illegall outragious violences. Be≈øides all that, the context following refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes this ≈øence of the Doctor, as I have already ≈øhewed.</p>
            <p>But let me not forget my ≈øecond Que≈øtion, or branch about re≈øi≈øtance. Who may not be re≈øi≈øted?

               </gap>right, as before; and ≈øo the Governour or Magi≈øtrate may be no more re≈øi≈øted, then a Monarch. And the King is re≈øi≈øted in re≈øi≈øting the meane≈øt Officer.

I would have him ≈øhew me a ground of this di≈øtinction upon a Text of Scripture, (which ≈øpeaking before of all powers, names, the power indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely) a ground I ≈øay out of Scripture, which him≈øelfe requires in the beginning of his ≈øecond Section, or religious rea≈øon, or el≈øe what con≈øcience ought to regard what he ≈øaith? If both Governours and Supreme be to be acknowledged Gods Ordinance, and both to be ≈øubjected to for that cau≈øe, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> here, for the Lords ≈øake (as S. <hi>Peter, Ephe≈ø.</hi> 2.12.) then either both may be re≈øi≈øted by Arms if tyrannous; or neither? Let him now take his choice, and ≈øay what he will, If he ≈øaith only the Inferiour may be, then he loo≈øes this Text, which matches them both equally. If he ≈øay neither may be; Then be≈øides all that hath been ≈øaid on the Text and context, I only adde this: That then every meane≈øt Officer (if wicked) may ruine the whole neighbourhood, becau≈øe he may not be re≈øi≈øted by Armes, who yet will bring Armes to act his villanies. And ≈øo the ble≈ø≈øed Ordinance of God in Magi≈øtracy ≈øhall turne to the greate≈øt cur≈øe to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind (the be≈øt and mo≈øt con≈øcientious of them) that can be imagined, in regard of outward ≈øufferings, and generall confu≈øion. It remaines therefore that as the Apo≈øtle in the following ver≈øes, bani≈øhes tyranny out of the context, de≈øcribing every where a righteous Magi≈øtrate, and not a tyrant: So tyranny is to be bani≈øht out of the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this Text, which allowes him that is a tyrant, no ≈øecurity, that he ≈øhall be endured, and not re≈øi≈øted even with Armes. Though it doth (and that mo≈øt ju≈øtly and nece≈ø≈øarily) ≈øecure a ju≈øt ruling Prince or Magi≈øtrate from all re≈øi≈øtance, even when he puni≈øhes mo≈øt ≈øeverely according to Law and ju≈øtice, upon the heavie≈øt guilt of being found re≈øi≈øters again≈øt God (that re≈øi≈øt ≈øuch a rule) and the heavie≈øt penalty of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

            <head>SECT. II. Having clearely ≈øtated the Que≈øtion, I proceed with the Doctor to his ≈øecond Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, To examine how he maintaines his Negative, That a Magi≈øtrate may in no ca≈øe be re≈øisted; or as he expre≈ø≈øeth him≈øelfe, That Con≈øcience cannot find cleare ground to re≈øt upon for making re≈øi≈øtance.</head>

            <p>Though (which I wonder at in a Scholler of his acutene≈ø≈øe) without ever offering to Analy≈øe the Ver≈øe, or tho≈øe before and after; which would have afforded ≈øtrength and clearene≈ø≈øe to his cau≈øe, if there be any to be found for it there.</p>
            <p>Therefore my fir≈øt worke mu≈øt be to doe that, namely to expound Analytically (but as briefly as may be) ≈øo much of the Chapter as concernes ≈øubjection to Magi≈øtrates; and then Con≈øcience ≈øhall judge, whether he hath urged it rightly to the Apo≈øtles ≈øcope.</p>
            <p>The ≈øcope of the Apo≈øtle (I make bold to ≈øay) is properly and meerely in this place to urge Chri≈øtians to be obedient to the Civill Lawes of the Roman Empire and ≈øo of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39617:6"/>
other States, between man and man, and to the Magi≈øtrates that had authority and ruled according to tho≈øe Lawes of what degree ≈øoever their authority was.</p>
            <p>To this end, 1. He delivers the precept generally in the former part of the 1. Ver≈øe, in which are three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The duty, <hi>Subjection,</hi> which is either Active obedience, or Pa≈ø≈øive ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion in ca≈øe of not obeying.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Subject, <hi>Every ≈øoule,</hi> All Chri≈øtians of what Ranke, Sex, Age, Condition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Object, in the Ab≈øtract, which notes the Legall authority, the <hi>higher powers,</hi> in the plurall number, which our Doctor is plea≈øed to take no notice at all of, but only and every where reads it, the <hi>higher power,</hi> as if it only pointed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and ≈øo now to our King.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He produces a rea≈øon for the precept, from Gods authorizing Magi≈øtrates and their Lawes, and this is delivered in a double expre≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of Negation, that any Magi≈øtrate can be Named which is not of Gods authorizing, <hi>There is no power but of God,</hi> which undeniably confirmes my expo≈øition of the Plurall number, <hi>powers,</hi> to note all ≈øorts and degrees of Magi≈øtrates, as doth al≈øo, that he repeates it.</p>

               </gap>, (as the Dr. notes) which as it ≈øpeakes of all ≈øorts of Powers, ≈øo it adds both a further Amplification and urging Rea≈øon, and a tacite limitation of the ≈øubjection. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon is, they are Gods vicegerents, and Deputies; by him, ordered to governe under him, and therefore to be ≈øubmitted unto by vertue of his Soveraigne authority, who is ab≈øolutely and undeniably the highe≈øt power, and Lord over all.</p>
            <p>The Limitation is, that it mu≈øt be only in tho≈øe things wherein tho≈øe powers oppo≈øe not him, under whom they are and from whom they have their authority, and it is certaine he gives them none to oppo≈øe him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. Thirdly, He urges the precept, by an Applicatory inference, from the Rea≈øon premi≈øed, denoting the ≈øinne of denying ≈øubjection; <hi>Who≈øoever therefore re≈øi≈øts the power re≈øi≈øts the Ordinance of God.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Wherein note, the Apo≈øtle hath altered his fir≈øt word; and in≈øtead of a Negative, which one might have expected, puts now in an Affirmitive (<hi>Not who≈øoever is not ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but who≈øoever re≈øi≈øts</hi>) wherein he ≈øeemes to favour (at lea≈øt in ≈øome ca≈øes) the Expo≈øition noted before of ≈øubjection, and the di≈øtinction of Active and Pa≈ø≈øive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to humane Lawes; and ≈øo will not alwayes charge di≈øobedience upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience or ≈øoule of a Chri≈øtian, for the omi≈ø≈øion, or doing contrary to a humane Law; But only in ca≈øe of re≈øi≈øtance, (that he will neither doe nor ≈øuffer) for then he is guilty of re≈øi≈øtance of the Ordinance of the authority of God, by and under which the≈øe Lawes were made and are urged.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He urges it againe by a threatning of Gods di≈øplea≈øure again≈øt ≈øuch, infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the ≈øinne of their re≈øi≈øtance. <hi>And they that re≈øi≈øt ≈øhall receive to them≈øelves dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>

            <p>He prevents the Objection (that this authority was a wrong to our liberty) which he denies, ≈øo long as our liberty is only u≈øed to doe well, and practice good works.</p>
            <p>And on the other ≈øide, there was an advantage to tho≈øe that did well; becau≈øe evill works were terrified by Rulers.</p>
            <p>Where al≈øo note, that he hath changed the Ab≈øtract, <hi>Powers,</hi> into the Concret, <hi>Rulers,</hi> to imply, that ≈øubjection is due and re≈øi≈øtance forbidden, no farther to Rulers (or no longer for the <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Sixtly, He urges it by a ≈øecond Application of the benefit, and ≈øecuring from feare of danger if men will obey.‚Äî <hi>Wilt not thou then be afraid of the power? Doe well and thou ≈øhalt have prai≈øe,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>Where againe he repeats the word <hi>Power</hi> (as preventing an Objection, That Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers might abu≈øe their power.) Noting, that he ≈øtill meanes of the power rightly u≈øed, according to the nature of it; whence will come prai≈øe to them that doe well, according to the Lawes.</p>

            <p>Eightly, By a third Application of threatning again≈øt di≈øobedience, either Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or e≈øpecially Po≈øitive, which is re≈øi≈øting. <hi>He beares not the Sword in vaine,</hi> &amp;c.] Where is intimated, that he may puni≈øh even capitally ≈øome di≈øobediences and re≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance. And againe the fift time Gods authorizing him is a≈ø≈øerted and applied, to this power of puni≈øhment. That he executes Gods wrath temporally; God is angry with di≈øobedience, and requires his Vicegerents to puni≈øh them, even by the Sword, if the offences merit it according to the Lawes, and ≈øo with other puni≈øhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 4, 5. Ninethly, By a reinforcement of the Precept, under the terme of Nece≈ø≈øity of Con≈øcience, which is but an Explication of the not re≈øi≈øting the Ordinance of God. Where al≈øo the Apo≈øtle prevents an Objection, as if he only had before advi≈øed them to obey or not re≈øi≈øt, to ≈øave them≈øelves from the Magi≈øtrates wrath; For it is Gods wrath al≈øo upon the Con≈øcience, and ≈øo the Con≈øcience is bound, though you could find a way to e≈øcape temporall wrath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>V.</hi> 6. Tenthly, It is urged by a Parallel of re≈øpect u≈øually paid to Magi≈øtrates, <hi>Tributes,</hi> the due whereof is al≈øo urged, becau≈øe Magi≈øtrates devote them≈øelves to the publick good, and ≈øo mu≈øt be maintained upon the publick ≈øtock, and if maintained, then much more obeyed and ≈øubjection yeilded to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 7.11. Finally by an univer≈øall requiring, to yeeld to all their dues, where he a≈ø≈øerts, that he requires no other ≈øubjection, and ≈øo forbids no other re≈øi≈øtance, then what the Law requires as due, or forbids as undue: becau≈øe obedience Active or Pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive was due by the Laws.</p>
            <p>This is in ≈øumme the Apo≈øtles ≈øcope and Argumentation.</p>
            <p>And now let us more particularly con≈øider whither the clau≈øe, threatning re≈øi≈øtance with damnation (or ought el≈øe in the whole context) doe fight again≈øt ≈øuch re≈øi≈øtance
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39617:7"/>
as the Doctor oppugnes? or rather of the two may ≈øeeme to fight again≈øt him, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtifie ≈øuch re≈øi≈øtance if not otherwi≈øe vitiated.</p>
            <p>To which purpo≈øe let us proceed by the≈øe Con≈øiderations.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That what≈øoever re≈øi≈øtance is here forbidden and threatned, relates to infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Magi≈øtrates as farre as their authority reaches according to laws, as well as ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Magi≈øtrates.</p>
            <p>I may no more re≈øi≈øt a Con≈øtable commanding me, or arre≈øting me, or di≈øtraining my goods according to Law, then I may doe the King commanding me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet the Doctor takes no notice of this at all. But as if it were, not only the <hi>higher power,</hi> in the ≈øingular number, but the Highe≈øt in the Superlative degree; He re≈øtraines all to the King, which is a dangerous fallacy, not only in the pre≈øent Que≈øtion, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt all government.</p>
            <p>To which I adde, to refu≈øe to be ≈øubject to the <hi>Parliament</hi> according to Lawes, and to re≈øi≈øt is much more (by this Scripture) undeniably a re≈øi≈øting the ordinance of God, and brings damnation.</p>
            <p>And what then will he ≈øay to tho≈øe that have done ≈øo too, and again≈øt the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and tho≈øe ≈øent by their authority unque≈øtionable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, That Prohibition of Re≈øi≈øtance cannot be meant here, which is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the Apo≈øtles rea≈øons following, which per≈øwade to Subjection and not Re≈øi≈øtance. Or that A≈ø≈øertion, or Interpretation, is not according to the Apo≈øtles ≈øcope, which is formally oppo≈øite to his Arguments afterward.</p>
            <p>But ≈øuch is the Doctors Interpretation and A≈ø≈øertion, <hi>Ergo,</hi> His A≈ø≈øertion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is, that Subjects may not re≈øi≈øt a Prince, who is bent to ≈øubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties.</p>
            <p>The Apo≈øtles Rea≈øons again≈øt Re≈øi≈øters are.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For Rulers are not a terrour to good workes, but to evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now is this a rea≈øon why I may not re≈øi≈øt ≈øuch a Tyrant?</p>
            <p>Who can be more a terrour to good workes, and not to evill then he that is bent to ≈øubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties? <hi>Ergo</hi> of ≈øuch a Re≈øi≈øtance of a tyrant the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle ≈øpeakes not. But of Re≈øi≈øtance of that Ruler, who go's altogether according to Lawes and Liberties, which is ju≈øtly puni≈øhable with Damnation without Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaying.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ≈øecond Rea≈øon or enforcement of the Apo≈øtles argument again≈øt Re≈øi≈øtance is, <hi>Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power. Doe that which is good and thou ≈øhalt have prai≈øe of the ≈øame.</hi> Now doth this argue a Tyrant is not to be re≈øi≈øted? Is there no cau≈øe of feare of him (while a man do's that which is good) that is bent to ≈øubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties? Or ≈øhall a man have prai≈øe in doing good, of ≈øuch a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
            <p>Therefore is not a Tyrant that power which may not be re≈øi≈øted. But he that ≈øtands to the Lawes, and Rules according to them, Damnation is ju≈øt again≈øt tho≈øe that re≈øi≈øt him without que≈øtion.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

Is he the Mini≈øter of God to thee for good? Or the Mini≈øter of his owne lu≈øts rather, for evill? Re≈øi≈øtance of ≈øuch an one then, is not the Re≈øi≈øtance the Apo≈øtle forbids, but of one who is the con≈øervatour of Religion, for he, and he only is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter of God to thee for good, and worthy is he of Damnation that re≈øi≈øts ≈øuch an one.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:39617:8"/>4. The Apo≈øtle adds, <hi>If thou doe that which is evill feare, for he beareth not the Sword in vaine: For he is the Mini≈øter of God, a Revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is this man a Tyrant, bent to ≈øubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties, or mo≈øt dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly oppo≈øite to Tyranny.</p>
            <p>A Tyrant ≈øecures tho≈øe that do evil (≈øo they will joyn with him and ≈øerve him in his Tyranny) from feare. And he beares the Sword, not only in vaine, in reference to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good end intended by Gods ordinance, but altogether contrary to it; and is ≈øo farr from being the Mini≈øter of God, that he is (as before) a Mini≈øter of his owne lu≈øts, to ≈øhelter tho≈øe that doe evill, and to pur≈øue with all wrath, and revenge him that doth good, and will not be a ≈ølave to his lawles de≈øignes and de≈øires. Still then of ≈øuch a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant S. <hi>Paul</hi> argues, not that he may not be re≈øi≈øted: but him that he de≈øcribes, which is a ju≈øt Governour, and ≈øo upon no terms to be re≈øi≈øted.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Upon all this the Apo≈øtle re≈øumes: <hi>Wherefore you must of nece≈ø≈øity be ≈øubject, not only for wrath, but al≈øo for Con≈øcience ≈øake.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>A man then for feare of wrath, not being able to make good his Re≈øi≈øtance, may yeeld ≈øuch pa≈ø≈øive ≈øubjection, but ≈øure con≈øcience (at lea≈øt not in this place) urges him not to it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Yet the Apo≈øtle goes-on: <hi>For this cau≈øe al≈øo pay you Tribute, for they are Gods Mini≈øters continually attending on this very thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what cau≈øe? Becau≈øe they may attempt to ≈øubvert Religion, Laws and Liberties?

Al≈øo upon what thing are they thus Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters to attend continually? Is it to ≈øubvert Lawes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or to pre≈øerve them?

            <p n="7">7. Finally, he concludes this matter with ≈øaying, <hi>Render to all their due.</hi> By what Law of God or man may a Tyrant ≈øubvert Religion, Laws and Liberties, or even be let alone in ≈øo doing.</p>
            <p>I am ≈øure the Apo≈øtle hath not expre≈øt any ≈øuch thing hitherto.

            <p>Having ≈øet the under≈øtanding of the maine Text right, I come now to tho≈øe examples that are alleadged to proove, That it is lawfull to re≈øi≈øt in ≈øome ca≈øes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The example of the peoples re≈øi≈øting <hi>Sauls</hi> illegall and tyrannicall attempt to have put <hi>Jonathan</hi> to death without cau≈øe.</p>
            <p>If this were lawfull in them in a particular mans ca≈øe (again≈øt whom al≈øo there was ≈øome ≈øeemig cau≈øe) How much more to re≈øi≈øt one that is bent to ≈øubvert Religion, Laws and Liberties, and ≈øo to take away the life of many at his own plea≈øure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:39617:8"/>To this is an≈øwered, not, that it was unlawfull in the people to make this re≈øi≈øtance (which yet if he deny not, he plainly yeelds his cau≈øe in his fir≈øt Propo≈øition, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. forbids not all Re≈øi≈øtance) but only that the people drew not into Armes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, but being there at <hi>Sauls</hi> command did by a loving violence and importunity hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the execution of a particular and pa≈ø≈øionate unlawfull command.</p>
            <p>To this I reply.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it were lawfull now; what hinders but they might have come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to prevent ≈øuch a mi≈øchiefe as <hi>Jonathans</hi> unju≈øt Death? Sure <hi>Saul</hi> called them not together to re≈øi≈øt him≈øelfe in any thing. Neither did his calling them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fight again≈øt the <hi>Phili≈øtines</hi> authorize them to fight again≈øt him, if it were not lawfull of it ≈øelfe.</p>
            <p>Our King call'd the Parliament together, yet he allowes not them to re≈øi≈øt upon that pretence, though they are undeniably, not the great Councell only, but the great Court of Judicature in the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>This peece then of his An≈øwer is nothing but words and pretence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for his loving violence and importunity wherewith he would blanch their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance.</p>
            <p>Grant they ≈øhewed a love to <hi>Saul,</hi> becau≈øe <hi>Jonathan</hi> was <hi>Sauls</hi> ≈øonne. But had <hi>Saul</hi> counted him his Enemy, (as he did <hi>David</hi> afterward) It would have ≈øounded har≈øh violence, and out-ragious enough, and it was plainly a great deale be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a loving violence. For <hi>Saul</hi> ≈øwore his death, and they ≈øwore his life, that not a <hi>haire of him ≈øhould,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This was Re≈øi≈øtance then with an Oath, as it were, to make <hi>Saul</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øworne.</p>
            <p>After this Example then our people may ≈øweare an <hi>A≈ø≈øociation,</hi> that not one of the Parliament ≈øhall be put to death (unle≈ø≈øe prooved guilty according to Law) notwith≈øtanding any Proclamation of them to be Traitors, or condemning them to death illegally.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And thirdly, as it cannot be thought, but if <hi>Saul</hi> had further attempted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, or any of his followers to a≈ø≈øault <hi>Jonathan,</hi> the people would have actively re≈øi≈øted him and them even with armes in <hi>Jonathans</hi> defence.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond Example is <hi>Davids</hi> re≈øi≈øting of <hi>Saul, ≈øc.</hi> by gathering a band of 600. men, and offering to have kept <hi>Keilah</hi> again≈øt <hi>Saul,</hi> but that God told him the <hi>Keilites</hi> would have betrayed him.</p>
            <p>That he ≈øin'd not in it appeares.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By his owne pleading his innocence even to God in his Prayers and P≈øalmes, as farr as concern'd the bu≈øines between him and <hi>Saul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Him≈øelf after this pleades it to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24 &amp; 26. and cals God to witnes that he had not tran≈øgre≈øt at all again≈øt him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God him≈øelfe di≈øcharged <hi>David</hi> from all notorious ≈øinne, excepting the matter of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>rijah,</hi> 1 Kin. 1.5.</p>
            <p>Now had not his Re≈øi≈øtance been lawfull, it had been mo≈øt notorious Rebellion and Trea≈øon.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, even our Doctor condemns it not, and therfore, all re≈øi≈øtance is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, much le≈ø≈øe damnable, as he often thunders.</p>
            <p>But this Example ≈øticks with him, and therfore he makes a four-fold an≈øwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Davids</hi> guard that he had about him was only to ≈øecure his per≈øon again≈øt the cut-throats of <hi>Saul,</hi> if ≈øent to take away his life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:39617:9"/>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> But this could not have bin done without killing divers of them, if they had a≈ø≈øaulted him, which had then bin no murther, but a ju≈øt defence and execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice. So farr him≈øelf grants lawfull.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But he ≈øayes it was a meer defence without any violence offer'd to <hi>Saul.</hi> Therfore he ≈øtill gave place as <hi>Saul</hi> pur≈øued, and did no act of ho≈øtility to him, or any of his Army, when they were in his power, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> He was not ≈øtrong enough to encounter <hi>Saul</hi> in the field, who had divers thou≈øands (3000 mentioned 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Con≈øcience forbids him to kill <hi>Saul</hi>: ≈øo I grant it doth any Subject, though having the King at any ≈øuch advantage. But that he hurt none of his followers, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. was again an act of wi≈ødome, and we need not goe to con≈øcience for a rea≈øon of it. He had only one man with him, <hi>Abi≈øhai,</hi> and had he offered to kill any of the Army, how ≈øoone might this in all likelihood have wakened the re≈øt, and ≈øo he had endangered his own life to little purpo≈øe. For he could not in probability have killed many, and what had that done to his cau≈øe and defence afterward.</p>
            <p>Yet al≈øo, I hold not that in cold blood, one or many that are upon the defen≈øive, may lawfully kill ≈øleeping enemies, or ≈øuch waking farther then appears, at lea≈øt in ≈øome ≈øort nece≈ø≈øary, or much advantagious to the defence, and prejudiciall to the oppo≈øites. But if killing, as many as <hi>David</hi> could have kill'd that night, him≈øelfe and <hi>Abi≈øhai</hi> would have given hopes of ending <hi>Sauls</hi> pur≈øuit of him, and have made peace; I doubt not, but he would and might have done it, as well as keep <hi>Keilah</hi> again≈øt him.</p>
            <p>But this intent of <hi>Davids</hi> is denied; For,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Doctor ≈øaith, It is only an uncertaine ≈øuppo≈øition, not fit to ground con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this great point of re≈øi≈øtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl:</hi> The Text declares it as certainly as may be, unle≈ø≈øe it had ≈øaid ≈øo in undeniable termes.</p>
            <p>For, 1. <hi>David</hi> contents not him≈øelfe to aske God whether <hi>Saul</hi> would come down, but what the <hi>Keilites</hi> would doe.</p>
            <p>To what end that, but that he meant to ≈øtay, if they would ≈øtand to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When God an≈øwers him only about <hi>Sauls</hi> comming, he askes the ≈øecond time, which ≈øhewes clearly his mind ran upon ≈øtaying there.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When God told him they would betray him, the Text then ≈øaith, <hi>he and his men went whether they could goe,</hi> which ≈øhewes they were now di≈øappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their purpo≈øes and hopes of ≈øtaying there, and mu≈øt now ≈øhift for them≈øelves where they could.</p>
            <p>When none of this will elude this example of <hi>Davids</hi> re≈øi≈øtance, the Dr. adds a fourth An≈øwer which will ≈øtrike it dead.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To this and all other demeanours of <hi>David</hi> in his ≈øtanding out again≈øt <hi>Saul.</hi> We ≈øay his example was extraordinary; for he was <hi>de≈øigned</hi> and <hi>annointed</hi> by the <hi>Lord</hi> to ≈øucceed <hi>Saul</hi>: therfore he might u≈øe an extraordinary way for ≈øafe-guarding his per≈øon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl:</hi> But in the≈øe few words there ≈øeeme to be many errours and inconvenient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions.</p>
            <p>Doth he not<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> imitate tho≈øe that to illude <hi>Davids</hi> rea≈øon, why he dur≈øt not kill <hi>Saul,</hi> Say <hi>Saul</hi> was extraordinarily <hi>annointed</hi> and <hi>de≈øigned King</hi> by God, and ≈øo upon him violent hands might not be laid, but this holds not for other Kings elective or ≈øucce≈ø≈øive by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws.</p>
            <p>I do not for my part thinke their ≈øhift ≈øufficient, but beleeve it utterly unlawfull, even
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39617:9"/>
becau≈øe this is a≈ø≈øerted by <hi>David</hi> (in reference to the office of <hi>Saul,</hi> as I believe) being written for our learning, to teach us how to carry our ≈øelvs towards all ≈øoveraign Princes.</p>
            <p>But I ≈øay if he wil elude <hi>Davids</hi> act of re≈øi≈øtance, he encourages them including his forbearance. Let him con≈øider it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is not what he ≈øpeaks of a ≈øucce≈ø≈øour dangerous to his own Po≈øition? for if <hi>Davids</hi> right of ≈øucce≈ø≈øion authorized him at all to re≈øi≈øt, may not a ≈øucce≈ø≈øor plead the like autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if in danger, which yet he will not grant, unles he mean to overthrow his own a≈ø≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It ≈øeemes to me a ≈øtrange way of an≈øwering Scripture examples (unles upon ≈øtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger nece≈ø≈øity then any thing the Doctor hath alleadged, as will appeare by the ≈øcanning of all his Arguments and Texts again≈øt re≈øi≈øtance) that ≈øuch a thing was extraordinary, when no ≈øuch thing can be gathered out of the Text.</p>
            <p>I know many men have this faculty of interpreting, who yet will not ≈øuffer it again≈øt their owne a≈ø≈øertions; but with me (except in undoubted failings or duties) The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rule holds good, <hi>Praxi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> ≈øanctorum e≈øt interpres Praeceptorum. David</hi> did thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt <hi>Sauls</hi> violence, therfore this is not contrary to<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but an Interpretation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due by the 5 t. Commandement.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is ≈øo farr from being good which the Doctor ≈øaith, that contrarily <hi>Davids</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ought rather to have ≈øtrengthned his faith; not to have u≈øed a way of defence; which in another had been (by the Doctors ≈øaying) rebellious and damnable.</p>
            <p>What a di≈øparagement is this to Faith, and even to Gods Honour, that his annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ≈øhall be ≈øafeguarded for ≈øo long together only by a way, which in all others is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable? <hi>Credat Judaeus non ego. Davids</hi> Faith then and Gods Honour in his pre≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proves the meanes both lawfull and ordinary.</p>
            <p>And if ≈øo, then much more is it lawfull for many per≈øons, and mo≈øt of all for a <hi>State-Repre≈øentative</hi> in this manner to defend them≈øelves and re≈øi≈øt.</p>
            <p>A third Example alleadged by the Doctor, is the <hi>Priests</hi> re≈øi≈øting the Kings attempt upon their office and Gods wor≈øhip, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. And after thru≈øting him out of the <hi>Temple,</hi> when God had ≈ømitten him with <hi>Lepro≈øie</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>I for my part put no great weight on the former. But their thru≈øting him out of the Temple is ≈øomewhat towards a hinderance even by force, of a Prince if he per≈øi≈øt to violate Gods undoubted ordinances, as it had been to have ≈øtaid in the Temple being le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous, added to the ≈øinne of his going in at all, and pre≈øumption to offer Incen≈øe. But ≈øuch a ca≈øe is hardly ≈øuppo≈øable among us.</p>
            <p>Only I adde, that I wonder the Doctor offers to ≈øay; God by ≈ømiting him with Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pro≈øie, di≈øcharged him of his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>The Story implyes no ≈øuch thing, but only that he dwelt in a ≈øeverall hou≈øe, and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> his ≈øonne judged the people of the Land. The Law allowed not any to come neare to ≈øuch or touch them, and what they touched, without being uncleane, therfore he could not ≈øit in publike Judicature, but his ≈øonne did it for him, yet for all that he remained King till his death, and probably did give out divers Orders, which might be done by means of tho≈øe that mu≈øt needs mini≈øter to him.</p>
            <p>But if the Doctor ≈øay right, may not an untoward Inference be made, that if a King ≈øhould attempt to violate Gods ordinance and wor≈øhip in any thing, and God ≈øhould vi≈øibly ≈øtrike him with ≈øome loath≈øome Judgement, this ≈øhould di≈øcharge him of his Kingdome, which is more then ever the Parliament ≈øaid, or ≈øo much as thought, as they call God to witne≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>A fourth Example is <hi>Eli≈øha's</hi> ≈øhutting the doore again≈øt the Kings Me≈ø≈øenger that

               <hi>Reply.</hi> But as little as it ≈øpeakes it forces him to ≈øpeake that, which if he will ≈øtand to, I doe not much doubt, but I ≈øhall make any unpartiall man (perhaps even the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor him≈øelfe) to ≈øay his cau≈øe is lo≈øt in reference to his fir≈øt Propo≈øition.</p>

               <q>Let us thence take occa≈øion to ≈øay, that per≈øonall defence is lawfull again≈øt the ≈øudden and illegall attempts of ≈øuch, even of the King him≈øelfe, thus farre to ward his blows, to hold his hands, and the like.</q>

            </p>
            <p>But heare him further,</p>
            <p>"Not to endanger his Per≈øon this, nor return blows; this is not lawfull he ≈øaith.</p>

            <p>As for the <hi>Parliaments</hi> power to conclude of the Kings intentions without the Spirit (Prophetick) of <hi>Eli≈øha</hi> (I wonder we had not here al≈øo, that <hi>Eli≈øha</hi> defended him≈øelf by an extraordinary way, being an extraordinary per≈øon, as well as <hi>David</hi> before) that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the third Propo≈øition, handled in his third Section, thither I refer it.

            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This were credible, if we were a≈ø≈øured what is meant by a legall tryall, and that it did ≈øignifie, not a tryall by ≈øuch Judges and Juries, as are apparantly partiall: or if we could forget that the ≈øix Members accu≈øed of High-Trea≈øon in <hi>January</hi> la≈øt, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them≈øelves to be tryed, and the <hi>Parliament</hi> offered to try them in <hi>Parliament,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Priviledges, being Members of their Hou≈øes, and from thence forth the Accu≈øation was laid a ≈øleepe (till of late) notwith≈øtanding the reiterated importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of both Hou≈øes of <hi>Parliament,</hi> who al≈øo in one of their <hi>Declarations</hi> or <hi>Petitions</hi> to the King, urged a Statutes, how ≈øuch accu≈øations ought to be managed and conclude to this effect, that by Law and Ju≈øtice this ought not to be denyed.</p>
            <p>And thus I have vindicated the Examples of Scripture by the Doctor alleadged for us, and from thence, and from his owne words partly, the Que≈øtion in hand between us, as farre as concernes the fir≈øt Propo≈øition. I am now to proceed to his owne allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons again≈øt us: In which he is ≈øo confident, as he promi≈øes, [<hi>That Scripture excludes this and all other exceptions, giving no allowance to re≈øi≈øtance, in regard of per≈øons or cau≈øes, or other pretences</hi> (how true this is, let what hath been ≈øaid already be judge) <hi>and this not only by Examples, but by Precepts, Conclu≈øions, Re≈øolutions, which are more ≈øafe.</hi> The≈øe we are now to examine.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, his Allegation of the 250 Princes, gathering the people again≈øt <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>; Him≈øelf ≈øatisfies, that there was no cau≈øe for it, <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did not de≈øerve it. [I add, they had done nothing, but what appeared to be the formall will of God, who≈øe cloud and pillar was by day and night over their heads, and who≈øe many miracles had continually ratified the authority of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Mo≈øes</hi> his very face by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued miracle was ≈øufficient to have dazeled them, if he had pul'd off his vaile.] But to this he an≈øwers, The <hi>Princes</hi> ≈øuppo≈øed they did de≈øerve it, and that is now enough it ≈øeemes, to make people, not only ≈øay to their Princes, <hi>Yee take too much upon you,</hi> but therefore to ri≈øe in Armes al≈øo.

            <p>Secondly, he urges, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.11.

            <p>To this divers An≈øwers may and mu≈øt be given. <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 1. Though this be further urged by ≈øome to authorize Kings to take their Subjects goods at their plea≈øure, yet
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:39617:12"/>
le≈ø≈øe the Kings of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> never tooke it ≈øo; For <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel</hi> were not ≈øo unskillfull in the right of Kings, that they would have had <hi>Naboth</hi> put to death by <hi>fal≈øe witne≈ø≈øes</hi> for bla≈øphemy, that ≈øo his <hi>vineyard</hi> might come to the King by confi≈øcation; if by a plaine Law of God at the founding of the Monarchy, he might have taken the vineyard at his will, as the Text 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.13. mentions his taking of vineyards even to give to his ≈øervants, and much more for his own u≈øe. But <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel</hi> both, though they wanted neither wit nor ≈øtomack to advance that <hi>Prerogative,</hi> were it ≈øeemes novices in both to our Moderne Advocates for Monarchy; or rather it is certain <hi>Samuell</hi> tells them what their King would do, and not what he ≈øhould do by right. His words are Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies not Laws.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither are the latter words of their crying to God, and his not hearing them, in forme of a Law and Prohibition (or at the mo≈øt but a Prohibition of attempting or thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to have the government altered againe from Kings to Judges) but a prediction by way of puni≈øhment, what ≈øhould befall them for their ≈øinfully impetucus affecting and asking a King, that they ≈øhould feele him oppre≈ø≈øing them, and that God would never remove the burden, as long as that King (whom they ≈øhould fir≈øt have) ≈øhould live, Nor yet alter the government againe from Kings to Judges, though they ≈øhould be never ≈øo weary of the one or other; and pray never ≈øo much to him for either or both. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the event verifies this interpretation, in both re≈øpects. For <hi>Saul</hi> proved tyrant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; and particularly in taking their ≈øons from them, as it is threatned, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.11, 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ≈øo recorded <hi>Cap.</hi> 14.51. But ≈øpecially his tyranny was mo≈øt prodigious in the Ma≈ø≈øacre of the Prie≈øts fore-mentioned: And ≈øo did many of his ≈øucce≈ø≈øours; after they had a King once, they never were under any other government altogether. For though they had no Kings of their owne from the <hi>Babyloni≈øh Captivity,</hi> till the <hi>Maccabees</hi> time, yet were they under ≈øtrange Kings (which was wor≈øe) the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Per≈øians</hi> (of which after their returne from captivity, ≈øee their heavy complaint, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.) and after them the <hi>Grecians</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and then a while the <hi>Maccabees</hi> race po≈ø≈øe≈øt the Kingdome till the <hi>Romans</hi> ≈øubdued them, and ≈øet up <hi>Harod</hi> and his race under the Emperour, who was indeed their King from thence forth (the high Prie≈øt cals <hi>Cae≈øar</hi> their <hi>King, Joh.</hi> 19.15. and ≈øo doth the <hi>Prophet.

            <p n="3">3. This Prediction then of ≈øuch puni≈øhment to them by their Kings oppre≈ø≈øing of them, cannot be a Law or puni≈øhment intended to other Nations being under a King, who have not provoked God in ≈øeeking a King as <hi>I≈ørael</hi> had<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> God threatned and impo≈øed on the <hi>Jews</hi> and other <hi>Nations</hi> in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> time their putting their necke under his yoake,<note place="margin">Ier. 27.3. &amp;c.</note> though he was not their hereditary Prince, but an invading enemy.

And <hi>Num.</hi> 10. hath not the lea≈øt ≈øhadow to the contrary. Al≈øo without the Trumpet may not the Church a≈ø≈øemble?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, For <hi>Davids</hi> carriage towards <hi>Saul</hi> and his Army, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. it is partly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered before. But he urges, That though it be ≈øaid, they intend not hurt to the Kings Per≈øon, yet might they not as well have hurt his per≈øon in the day of battell, as any of them that were ≈øwept away from about him by the fury of the Ordnance, which put no difference 'twixt King and common Souldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Indeed this is the harde≈øt ca≈øe can be put <hi>again≈øt defence by Arms.</hi> But ≈øuppo≈øing (as hath bin partly proved already, and will be more, the further we proceed) that again≈øt his me≈ø≈øengers and in≈øtruments, arms may be taken, &amp; battles fought to prevent the <hi>≈øubver≈øion of Religion, Laws and Liberties,</hi> upon which they are bent: I only ask 2 or 3 Que≈øtions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By what rule of con≈øcience or God, is a State bound to ≈øacrifice Religion, Laws and Liberties (the con≈øervation of which is the end of all governments, and ≈øo of all Princes Authorities) rather then endure that the Princes life ≈øhould come into any po≈ø≈øibilities of hazard, by defending them again≈øt tho≈øe, that in his name are bent to ≈øubvert them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If he will needs thru≈øt him≈øelf upon the hazard, when he needs not, who≈øe fault is that? Is it theirs that de≈øire not to have him hurt in the lea≈øt, and re≈øolve not to hurt him
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:39617:13"/>
wittingly or willingly, but meerly to defend them≈øelves upon nece≈ø≈øity; and offend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are his ≈øeducers, or in≈øtruments, or both? And to this purpo≈øe, let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that I have proved, that <hi>David</hi> would have kept <hi>Keilah</hi> again≈øt <hi>Saul,</hi> and then if <hi>Saul</hi> would have bin ob≈øtinate to a≈ø≈øault it in his own per≈øon; how could <hi>David</hi> have helped it, if an arrow or a ≈øtone from the wall had hit him and killed him? And then withall, whether there be not ≈øomewhat this way, in that of <hi>David; Either the Lord ≈øhall ≈ømite him, or his day ≈øhall come that he mu≈øt die, or he ≈øhall goe into the battle and peri≈øh.</hi> If he might fight with <hi>Sauls</hi> Army, as in <hi>Keilah</hi> he would, and <hi>Saul</hi> would goe downe into the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, his bloud would have bin upon his own head. As if a King di≈øgui≈øed ≈øhould offer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny private violence, a watchman that would not (or even might not) hurt him being knowne, were without blame, if he knock't him down, or even killed him, as he might in like ca≈øe a di≈øorderly private per≈øon. Now in battell, to many or mo≈øt (and e≈øpecially to the Gunners that give fire to great Ordnance) he is altogether di≈øgui≈øed, and ≈øo they are blamele≈ø≈øe, in reference to his per≈øonall hurt. The fault is wholly his owne and tho≈øe wicked Councellors that have thru≈øt him upon the fury of the battell.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For al≈øo, why ≈øhould not all that truly wi≈øh well to the King, of all other times keep him out of the battell, when it is again≈øt Rebels? I am ≈øure <hi>Davids</hi> men would not let him hazard him≈øelf, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. (though he offred it) and ≈øaid he was worth 10000 of them. They then that put him upon ≈øuch de≈øperate dangers, again≈øt ≈øuppo≈øed Rebels ≈øhew they love their owne rapine (for which they fight, and to ≈øubvert Religion, Laws and Liberties) above his per≈øon and life. And then let God be Judge who ≈øtretcheth out the hand again≈øt him unlawfully? They, or others?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He ob≈øerves two things more concerning the point of re≈øi≈øtance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all the ≈øeeming in≈øtances for it, are out of the old Te≈øtament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. Why ≈øhould he in≈øinuate this to be in≈øufficient? Is not the old Te≈øtament Gods word, and a direction for our lives, as well as the new? Was not, <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother</hi> (under which him≈øelfe compri≈øes obedience to Princes) a law of the old Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And if it were lawfull (as the in≈øtances have bin ju≈øtified again≈øt all that he hath ≈øaid) to re≈øi≈øt then; how comes it to be unlawfull now? Did Chri≈øt come to make Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants ≈øecure from re≈øi≈øtance, who were not before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would intreat him, if he be at lea≈øure to rejoyne to this reply, to tell us the intent of Chri≈øt in the new Te≈øtament; bidding his Di≈øciples, rather ≈øell their garments, then want a Sword. I am per≈øwaded for my part, that he thereby directs them to a ju≈øt and nece≈ø≈øary defence, again≈øt any out-ragious attempts of violence illegall. Though he afterwards blames <hi>Peter</hi> for u≈øing the Sword without warrant. The new Te≈øtament then hath ≈øomewhat al≈øo toward Re≈øi≈øtance.</p>
            <p>But 2. He ≈øaith, It is a marvellous thing, That among ≈øo many Prophets reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Kings of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> for their Idolatry, cruelty and oppre≈ø≈øion, none ≈øhould call upon the Elders of the people, for this duty of re≈øi≈øtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> To this marvell, there may be a ready ≈øatisfaction, if we remember, That even in the reigne of the be≈øt Kings, not only the peoples hearts were u≈øually unprepared, and in their greate≈øt ≈øeemings hypocriticall and treacherous, as appeares by the Story and the Prophets. But al≈øo the Princes, Elders and Nobles were exceedingly corrupt. In <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> his time, as ≈øoone as <hi>Jehojada</hi> was dead, the Princes came and corrupted the King; and in the beginning of <hi>E≈øay's</hi> Prophe≈øie in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>zziah's</hi> time (who was among the better Kings) he calls them <hi>Princes of Sodom,</hi> and ≈øo even in <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> time, how doth <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> complaine of them. (<hi>Ch,</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.) and <hi>Jeremy</hi> in <hi>Jo≈øiahs</hi> time after the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion begun. Now if they were ≈øo bad in good times, who can marvell, if they were
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:39617:13"/>
≈øtarke nought, where the King was rought, and helpers forward of his Idolatries, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties and oppre≈ø≈øions. And why ≈øhould it then be expected, that the Prophets ≈øhould call upon them to re≈øi≈øt, the King being on their ≈øide, and they on his.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, At la≈øt the Doctor comes to his maine ≈øtrength of all, namely, <hi>Roman.</hi> 13.2.</p>
            <p>In the improvement of which Text to his purpo≈øe, he layes downe four Po≈øitions, and then makes a five-fold Objection, and ≈øhapes An≈øwers to them; all which mu≈øt come under examination.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ≈øayes [<hi>I may ≈øuppo≈øe that the King is ≈øupreame, as St</hi>. Peter <hi>calls him, or the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Power, as St</hi>. Paul <hi>here, though it be by ≈øome now put to the Que≈øtion, as one ab≈øurdity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly begets another to defend it.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> But by his leave hee runnes away too fa≈øt with his ≈øuppo≈øition in a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> here, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. ≈øpeakes only of re≈øi≈øting the ≈øupreame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the King, or Emperour or Monarch, whereas the word in this ≈øecond ver≈øe is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, the power <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, which extends to all in authority in either ranke or degree, as well as the ≈øupreame, as was noted before. If he (or any for him) ≈øay that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>v.</hi> 2. mu≈øt ≈øignifie no more then the higher power, <hi>v.</hi> 1. which he interprets only of the ≈øupreame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> Here againe I mu≈øt tell him, he abu≈øes his Readers (carele≈øly at lea≈øt, I will not ≈øay wittingly, let his con≈øcience looke to that) for he alwayes reades higher power in the ≈øingular, whereas it is <hi>Powers</hi> in the plurall, and the next words, <hi>There is no Power but of God, the Powers that be are ordained of God,</hi> ≈øhews the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeakes of all ≈øorts and rankes of Powers. Therefore he mu≈øt take in the other, <hi>Powers,</hi> as well as the ≈øupreame in both ver≈øes, and that will be nothing for his benefit, as will appeare by this briefe rea≈øon. If the Powers that are under the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame may not be re≈øi≈øted by this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. Then either the re≈øi≈øtance forbidden extends not to re≈øi≈øting (though with Armes) out-ragious and tyrannicall a≈ø≈øaults of illegall violence offered by tho≈øe officers, as ≈øuppo≈øe a Major, Ju≈øtice, or even a Con≈øtable, or el≈øe even one of tho≈øe officers, even a petty Con≈øtable is as ab≈øolutely over tho≈øe that are under his office as any Monarch, and they ≈ølaves to his lu≈øts, as well as to an Emperours, becau≈øe the one ought not to tyrannize (by the Doctors Confe≈ø≈øion ¬ß 1.) no more then the other, and the one ought not to be re≈øi≈øted no more then the other by this argument and Text.</p>
            <p>Now which part of di≈øtinction will the Doctor chu≈øe, if the former, he de≈øerts his cau≈øe plainly. If the latter, then be≈øides the apparant ab≈øurdity of it; I urge, that all men will grant, That a Con≈øtable and ≈øuch like officers (betweene the people and the ≈øupreame) are lyable to be them≈øelves puni≈øhed by Lawes, if they offer any out-ragious and illegall violence, which cannot po≈ø≈øibly be, unle≈ø≈øe they may be re≈øi≈øted even with Armes in ca≈øe any arme them≈øelves to practi≈øe violence, Al≈øo el≈øe a few of them, as the Major or Aldermen of a Towne, joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, might goe through all the City and robbe, and kill as many as they would by force of Armes, and no man might offer to re≈øi≈øt them by taking Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt them. It remaines therefore that all Magi≈øtrates (except the ≈øupreame to begin with) may be re≈øi≈øted even with Armes, if offering violence and tyranny; And yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids to re≈øi≈øt the Powers without di≈øtinction of ≈øupreame or other. Therefore S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>anes not to forbid re≈øi≈øting Tyranny with Armes: But re≈øi≈øting legall and lawfull commands, even other wayes, as well as with Armes,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:39617:14"/>
though this be the wor≈øt kind of re≈øi≈øtance, where obedience is due.</p>
            <p>But ≈øecondly, It mu≈øt not be granted him (for all his bigg words of Ab≈øurdity, imputed to tho≈øe that deny it) <hi>That the King of</hi> England <hi>is in all con≈øiderations the ≈øupreame</hi> (or <hi>the highe≈øt Power</hi> (if S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Pauls</hi> words were in the ≈øuperlative.) This belongs to Politicks, and the Doctors Divinity will not reach it, him≈øelfe cannot deny it, That the King is not ≈øupreame in the legi≈ølative power. Though hee have a negative voyce in Lawes, ≈øo have either of the Hou≈øes di≈øtinct. Hee can then neither make new Lawes alone, nor abrogate old ones: Nor violate (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inju≈øtice) the goods, much le≈ø≈øe the lives or cha≈øtities of any of his meane≈øt Subjects, and lea≈øt of all authorize any of his followers by his warrant or pre≈øence to doe ≈øo. His Supremacy then is bounded by Lawes, and is given him (be it more or le≈ø≈øe) <hi>ad ≈øalutem non ad de≈øtructionem.</hi> Which yet were not, if no Tyranny of his might be re≈øi≈øted. But of that more anon.</p>
            <p>But the Doctor will prove the King ≈øupreame 3 wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1.
<q>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peters</hi> di≈øtinction comprehends all that are in authority. The King as ≈øupreame, and tho≈øe that are ≈øent by him: In which latter ranke are the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of <hi>Parliament,</hi> being ≈øent by him, or ≈øent for by him, and by his Writ ≈øitting there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. Why did the Doctor leave out the word <hi>Governours?</hi> Is he afraid to grant the Hou≈øes of <hi>Parliament</hi> any power of Government?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What if ≈øent by him, referrs not to the King, but to the Lord, for who≈øe ≈øake, all both King and Governours are to be obeyed, and by whom both are ≈øent? (but of this al≈øo more anon.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. But grant him his way, I aske how it ≈øhall appeare, that the name of King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends as farre every where as S. <hi>Peters</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. The <hi>Spartans</hi> had two Kings, and yet neither of them ≈øo ≈øupreame, but under the controll of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> There are al≈øo <hi>Monarches</hi> as ≈øupreame as any that have the Title of King. The <hi>Great Duke of Florence,</hi> The <hi>Great Duke of Mu≈øcovy,</hi> and others.

               </gap>. In a word, he only is <hi>≈øupreame,</hi> whom the Law cals ≈øupreame, and no further then the Law makes him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ≈øaith al≈øo, by the Oath of Supremacy it is acknowledged, That there is no power above him without or within this Realm, and that he is in all cau≈øes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all per≈øons ≈øupreame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> But ≈øome Lawyers will tell him, That the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> is either only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt forraigne powers (and namely the Pope) having to doe here; or again≈øt all particular per≈øons having authority above the King within the Realme. But that with all Law-books intimate a ≈øuperiority, <hi>in curia Comitum Baronum, &amp;c.</hi> which is the two Hou≈øes of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ≈øecondly, That he is ≈øupreame not to judge all per≈øons and cau≈øes at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, but as a≈ø≈øi≈øted according to Lawes with his Coun≈øell and Judges, and ≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his great Councell, and chiefe Judicature (during their ≈øitting) the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of Parliament. His Supremacy then, ≈øtill appeares limited by, and according to Law.</p>
            <p n="3">3 But hee adds, This is al≈øo acknowledgedged by the Petition of the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes addre≈ø≈øed unto his Maje≈øty, wherein they ≈øtile them≈øelves, his <hi>Loyall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> True and right; but ≈øtill this is to be under≈øtood, to be Subject according

to Lawes, and for the good of King and Kingdome, neither of which is promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or pre≈øerved by a re≈øtraint of a defen≈øive Re≈øi≈øtance of tyranny, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtraint, the Doctor ≈øo contends for. Adde here, what mu≈øt el≈øewhere be further urged, That the King him≈øelfe in his an≈øwer to the 19 Propo≈øitions, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that the two Hou≈øes have legall power, more then ≈øufficient to prevent or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtraine Tyranny. Which I would faine have any man ≈øhew me, how it can bee done, but by taking up Armes, and then I will yeeld him the cau≈øe, That all Armes taken up are unlawfull. But till then the King hath granted the cau≈øe, legall and ju≈øt again≈øt the Doctors fir≈øt maine Propo≈øition, and all his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>His next ground is, That in the Text of the Apo≈øtle, all per≈øons under the higher Power are expre≈ø≈øely forbidden to re≈øi≈øt, for <hi>Who≈øoever,</hi> in the ≈øecond <hi>ver≈øe,</hi> mu≈øt be as large, as <hi>every ≈øoule</hi> in the fir≈øt ver≈øe, and the re≈øi≈øtance forbidden here concrnes all upon whom the ≈øubjection is injoyned there, or el≈øe we could not make the≈øe univer≈øals good again≈øt the Papi≈øts, exempting the Pope and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy from ≈øubjection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. He ≈øtill runnes on in his errour to limit the higher power to the ≈øupreame.</p>
            <p>But ≈øecondly, I grant him that all other powers under the ≈øupreame are forbidden to re≈øi≈øt in the Apo≈øtles ≈øence. A Con≈øtable, Ju≈øtice, Major, Sheriffe, Judge of A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øize, nor the very Hou≈øes of <hi>Parliament</hi> may not re≈øi≈øt the authority of the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding according to Lawes. But yet it remaines to be prooved, that they may not re≈øi≈øt his violence, when he is bent to ≈øubvert Lawes and Liberties, and Religion and all: Or the violence of his followers, even though doing it by his warrant or in his pre≈øence. Al≈øo, becau≈øe he doth ≈øo much in≈øi≈øt upon the phra≈øe of higher power, let me put him a ca≈øe. A wicked Robber that hath committed twenty mo≈øt bloudy mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers one after another, in cold bloud is led away after legall condemnation by the Sheriffe to be put to death: Suppo≈øe a King would come with armed ≈øouldiers, and offer to take him violently and by force out of the hand of Ju≈øtice. Who re≈øi≈øts damnably now that power which is the Ordinance of God, and to whom the Sword is committed? The Sheriffe and his men that re≈øi≈øt the violence, or the Kings followers (or even him≈øelfe) that re≈øi≈øt the due Execution of Ju≈øtice? Let him ≈øtudy on it and give an An≈øwer at his lei≈øure.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

Thus for the per≈øons that ≈øhould re≈øi≈øt, all are forbidden. Now con≈øider the cau≈øe.</p>

               <hi>Rep.</hi> 2. If you reply that ≈øuppo≈øing it not forbidden to Heathens; No more was it to Chri≈øtians, before S. <hi>Paul</hi> (and S. <hi>Peter</hi>) wrote. And if ≈øo, then belike (as was formerly toucht) the Apo≈øtles laid a yoake upon the necks of Chri≈øtians, wor≈øe then all the <hi>Jewi≈øh</hi> ceremonies, which the Gentiles were ever freed from: For whereas before the <hi>Romans</hi> might re≈øi≈øt their tyrannous Emperours, now by becoming Chri≈øtians their hands mu≈øt be tyed to have all their throats cut, (even though the whole Senate were Chri≈øtians) at one <hi>Neroes</hi> plea≈øure. He that wi≈øht that all <hi>Rome</hi> had but one neck that he might ≈øtrike it off at a blow, had done wi≈øely to have endeavoured to have made them all Chri≈øtians, and then he and his Guard with him, or his Army might by this Doctrine have ≈øtruck off all their heads, or runne them all through one after another as fa≈øt as they could deale blowes, and ≈øo he ≈øhould have his will in their de≈øtruction, though there mu≈øt have beene a little more paines taken about it. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chri≈øt who came to purcha≈øe liberty to his people never meant to en≈ølave them to tyrants above all others of Man-kind.

            <p>Thirdly, I will not therefore trouble my ≈øelfe to compare the Authority of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Senate with our Parliament, much le≈ø≈øe argue for that power which they had lo≈øt about a 100 Yeares before S. <hi>Paul</hi> writ; It ≈øuffices he hath not di≈øproved at all their pre≈øent power of re≈øi≈øting tyranny, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, and that by the ≈øame argument I have di≈øproved, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids Chri≈øtians to take any ≈øuch power to them≈øelves.</p>

            <p>REPL It is granted by him that the ≈øtate of the Que≈øt. is, when a Prince is bent to ≈øubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties. I would then faine know what order or good will then be in force, when the≈øe are ≈øubverted? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Tyrant that attempts to ≈øubvert the≈øe, intends not to di≈ø≈øolve that Order, for which his power and him≈øelfe were ≈øet up of God?

            <p>Secondly, whereby it will appeare al≈øo how void his confidence is, that by his former words he hath made void the di≈øtinction betweene the power and the abu≈øe of the power him≈øelfe hath granted (and cannot in con≈øcience deny) that though the Prince is to be actively obeyed when he commands lawfull things; yet not when hee commands again≈øt the Lawes of GOD, or even the e≈øtabli≈øht Lawes of the Land: hee then di≈øtingui≈øhes acutely hee thinks, betweene the power and the abu≈øe of the power.

            <p>Another Objection he makes again≈øt hm≈øelfe, is, That ≈øome ≈øay the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours then were ab≈øolute Monarks and therfore not to be re≈øi≈øted; he an≈øwers.

But how did they make them≈øelves of Subjects ≈øuch ab≈øolute Monarks, was it not by force and change of Government? And was not the right of the Senate and people good again≈øt them with as much, or more rea≈øon, then the right of the people of this Land is again≈øt the ≈øucces≈øion of this Crowne, de≈øcending by three Conque≈øts?</p>
            <p>REPL. 1. This Objection is needle≈ø≈øe, and ≈øo ≈øhall be none of mine. Al≈øo it is a nicety to averre, and very hard to prove that the Emperours were (or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes are) ab≈øolute Monarks, under whom there is a government by written Lawes, as among the Romans were the 12. Tables, and many other Lawes. But I adde, that no Prince can be an ab≈øolute Monarch to have power over mens lives at his plea≈øure (or over the cha≈øtity of any at all) He can have no power but according to the Ordinance of God. Now it is certaine God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ordaines any ≈øuch Arbitrary, or iniurious power. Therfore no Monarch hath any ≈øuch <hi>de jure.</hi> As for that, any hath <hi>de facto,</hi> as he ≈øpeakes of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ruling ab≈øolutely or arbitrarily. If they did ≈øo (as they oft did) for evill, I have formerly ≈øhewed, and he hath not refelled it, that they might have been re≈øi≈øted 2. What he ≈øpeakes of their becomeing Monarchs touches not our ca≈øe at all. For however he in≈øinuates, Who ever hath ≈øoberly written for defence and re≈øi≈øtance again≈øt Tyrranny doth not plead any right in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Land again≈øt the ≈øucces≈øion of this Crown: But though the King and his rightfull ≈øuccces≈øions ought ≈øtill to hold the Crown; This forbids not a nece≈ø≈øary defence again≈øt their unju≈øt violences when ever they ≈øhall u≈øe them. 3. Yet withall I add, that though ≈øo long as there was any in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man State who had not by Oath or the like expre≈øt their con≈øent to the u≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:39617:16"/>
of the Roman Emperours, they were free to have thru≈øt them out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, or rather bound to have done it, and re≈øtore the Senate to their lo≈øt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: yet when any have with the generality yeelded to the change of an <hi>Ari≈øtocracy</hi> (wherein no man hath per≈øonall right of ≈øucces≈øion) into a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi>; they<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and ≈øpecially the po≈øterity of tho≈øe that have ≈øo yeelded, are from thenceforth for ever bound to that government, according to ju≈øt and equall Lawes already in being or to be made hereafter, even by the Monarke alone, if they have tru≈øted him with it alone; But never can they lo≈øe their right (no, not by their owne con≈øent) of ju≈øt defence of Cha≈øtities, or of their lives, untill they forfeit them by their misbehaviour again≈øt ≈øome ju≈øt Lawes or other. 4. As therefore the Doctor di≈øclaimes the pleading for an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power) (≈øuch as Conquerours u≈øe) in this crowne, ≈øo if he can plead no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter again≈øt re≈øi≈øting our Kings then he hath in the ca≈øe of the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours he will merit but ≈ømall reward for his paines.

            <p>Secondly, I have proved that the prohibition of re≈øi≈øting Tyranny by armes, did not concerne the Heathen Romanes (and therefore not the Chri≈øtians neither.)</p>
            <p>Thirdly, what ever liberties were lo≈øt, and new Lawes enforced, yet ≈øo long and ≈øo farre as the Emperours ruled by the Lawes, the people and Senate were in no ≈øuch ≈ølavery, that they needed re≈øi≈øt to ≈øave the State.

            <p n="2">2. Wherein I am confirmed, by the con≈øideration of the three great <hi>Patriarkes, Abraham, I≈øaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> who while they lived in <hi>Canaan,</hi> were not within any government, but onely <hi>Dome≈øticall,</hi> and neither did rule, nor were ruled by the Inhabitants of <hi>Canaan,</hi> nor joyned with them in a Common gouernment. Though <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family was very numerous for a Family, yet it would be hard to call him a <hi>Monarch,</hi> much le≈ø≈øe <hi>I≈øaac</hi>; and <hi>Iacob</hi> le≈ø≈øe, who when he went downe into Aegypt, doth not ≈øeeme to have had any Servants, but onely Sonnes, and his and their Wives and Children.</p>

≈øetled government, (beyond parentall;) any of diver≈øe Families in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, came to be in the World.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the World was more emptie as in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, a godly man, as he, having a Competent Family, might ≈øub≈øi≈øt without others, joyning in a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with him; and he could not doe them any remarkable good, or gayne glory to GOD by it, they being Pagans. So that it is not (I ≈øay) ab≈øolutely true, that men are bound univer≈øally, as by an Ordinance from GOD, to ≈øet up, live under govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Drs. ≈øen≈øe. Marriage is GODS In≈øtitution and Ordinance, and more originally then the Government politicall, and nece≈ø≈øary for encrea≈øe, yet are not all of mankinde bound to marry, but for their owne good and comfort, and ≈øo of others, and advancing Gods Glory in both.

So is there more Nece≈ø≈øitie of being within Government to ≈øecure ones ≈øelfe and others from wrong, and doe one ≈øelfe and others good and glorifie GOD in all. And ≈øo farre I grant it Gods ordinance to all.</p>
            <p>But one thing more I mu≈øt remember him, and the readers of. Namely that this Power, will not be proved ab≈øolutely to extend, to the making of any Humane Lawes, but onely to ≈øee to the Ob≈øervation of the Lawes of Nature, and of God by His word and ≈øpeciall Revelation both of the fir≈øt, and ≈øecond Table; and to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power of coercion, then what the Light of Nature will Argue Nece≈ø≈øarie, for the Ob≈øervation of tho≈øe Lawes of Nature. And that all further power, belongs to the third particular, which he calls the qualification of the Power, &amp; depends upon mans Con≈øent (≈øo it be not again≈øt Gods Law and Word,) which I call the extent of the Power. Which if it be true, it ≈øhall be ≈øeene anon, what Con≈øequence may bee drawne from it to the di≈øadvantage of the Doctours purpo≈øe.</p>
            <p>And now let us view the Doctors proofs, that Power it ≈øelfe is an Ordinance of God, binding all Mankind, to ≈øet up and live under government. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>The Powers are of God, and the Ordinance of God, v.</hi> 2.</p>

            <p n="2">2. He urges ver. 4 <hi>He is the Mini≈øter of God,</hi> this yet proves not a nece≈ø≈øitie in all of ≈øetting up Government. But onely when it is ≈øet up to acknowledge the Governour <hi>Gods Vice-gerent.</hi> So (as before) the Husband is GODS Vicegerent: Yet a Woman not ab≈øolutely bound to be under a Husband. The truth is, <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> is from GOD originally in the≈øe re≈øpects, no further. Fir≈øt he hath laid a generall charge upon Mankinde, to advance his Glory, their owne and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good (whom thus are bound to love as them≈øelves) by all meanes not by him forbidden. Secondly, in the parentall Authours, (or proparentall, if the Parents dye in their Childrens Infancy) he hath ≈øhewed them how much Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may conduce to this. Thirdly he declares by in≈øtinct in Nature, that as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentall
<pb facs="tcp:39617:19"/>
Authority is deputed by him, ≈øo that he affords a deputation to other Governments when once ≈øet up. Fourthly, ≈øhewing all men (now a dayes and long ≈øince) in fully inhabited places of the world, not only a profit, but even a neces≈øity of being within Government (at lea≈øt for his glory, in the Civill good of ≈øocieties) Upon the≈øe grounds we may ≈øay he ordaines and commands all to be within one Government or other; but not ab≈øolutely, nor without relation to this end.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, he alleadges. <hi>By me Kings reigne,</hi> and <hi>I have ≈øaid ye are Gods,</hi> and <hi>the word of God came to them,</hi> Joh. 10. That word, ≈øaith he, is the i≈ø≈øuing out of the Commis≈øion for the ≈øetting up a Government over and among the People.</p>
            <p>REPL. But none of all this will amount to his Conclu≈øion; 1. Kings reigne by God, that is they are his Deputies. Men could not give them any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over them≈øelves unle≈ø≈øe God owned it and by his in≈øtinct had prompted them to it. Secondly, he ≈øaith, <hi>Yee are Gods</hi>; but this an owning the de≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Per≈øon, as well as the Power. This place either proves more then the Doctor urges it for, or le≈ø≈øe. Thirdly, as for his <hi>Dixi,</hi> the Doctor mi≈øtakes mo≈øt of all For it relates plainly to his owning the Per≈øons, (whom yet he tels. <hi>They ≈øhall are like Men:</hi> but the Power dies not) and is rather a gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a particular Patent or Commis≈øion to the Per≈øon cho≈øen or ≈øucceeding, then a Commis≈øion (or Originall Writ) to ≈øet up a Government.</p>
            <p>His Rea≈øon is no more Univer≈øally True, then his Texts pertinent. God (he ≈øaith) Governs all Creatures, Rea≈øonable, as well as Unrea≈øonable; the lower world by the Heaven, and the Rea≈øonable Creatures Men, by others too ≈øet up in his ≈øtead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> But what if the Edge of this Rea≈øon be Turned again≈øt him≈øelfe? For by whom according to the Dr. are Kings and Monarks Govern'd? In an <hi>Ari≈øtocracy,</hi> each of the Governors is Governed by all the re≈øt of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and ≈øo in a Democracy, but in a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> one Governs all, and hee him≈øelf is Governed by none. Either then al mankind are not bound to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Government (and then all his Texts and this Rea≈øon are alleadged in vain) or el≈øe Kings and Monarks are al≈øo under ≈øome Government, at lea≈øt of the Repre≈øentative Body of thei people (according to what was before alledged from our Lawyers, <hi>Rex non habet Superiorem praeter Legem &amp; Curiam Comitum &amp; Baro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>um,</hi> &amp;c.) Let him take his choice. Nor can hee evade this with ≈øaying the Text Speaks of Monarks, and they are called GODS, and ≈øo none above them But 1. I appeale to all Interpreters, whether the <hi>P≈øalmi≈øt</hi> intend it not (and ≈øo Chri≈øt after him) of all ≈øorts of Judges, and ≈øo <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt not Cur≈øe the GODS, nor speake evill of the Ruler of the People.</hi> Yet this S. <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledges extended even to the High Prie≈øt the Eccle≈øia≈øticall Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. 2. Is not the Text at lea≈øt meant, of all the Governours in a <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi> and in <hi>Ari≈øtocracy,</hi> that they are call'd GODS, yet each hath the re≈øt above him 3. However ≈øtill his Rea≈øon is voyde, for all Rea≈øonable Creatures are not governed by others in GODS ≈øtead; for by his ≈øaying, Monarks are not; and yet they oft times need to be governed ≈øo far as not to be ≈øuffered to undo all by their Governing or el≈øe this Que≈øtion had never bin in the world, which our hearts bleed to be forced to di≈øpute, concerning the power of re≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting Monarks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:39617:19"/>If now the Dr. will ≈øay that we afford GOD a poore part in ≈øetting up of power for the governing of Men, he had need ≈øeek better proofe or el≈øe he will hardly per≈øwade any more to a con≈øiderate Reader. But perhaps hee will ≈øay I have yeelded him enough, (and more then others have done) that will be ≈øeene by the u≈øe he can make of his a≈ø≈øertion. But in the meane time, I have 2 or 3 Con≈øiderations to propound, from his Texts and Rea≈øon, and my own grants and a≈ø≈øertions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Each one of his Texts ≈øpeaks of more then the Supreame Powers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.9. Plainly <hi>Plurall,</hi> more then once, and takes in all Ranks, as hath been proved. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> names <hi>Governours</hi> to be ≈øubmitted to for the LORDS ≈øake, a≈øwell as the Supreame and I ≈øhould thinke, <hi>Sent by him,</hi> is by the <hi>LORD</hi> rather then by the Supreme, as I ≈øhall ≈øhew by the Rea≈øon by and by; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath ≈øaid <hi>the powers that he</hi> (even the Governors) <hi>are ordained of GOD.</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. after the words, <hi>By me Kings Raigne,</hi> follows, <hi>And Princes Decree ju≈øtice, By me Princes Rule, and Nobles even all the Iudges of the Earth.</hi> This is plaine, a≈øwell for other Governors as Supreme, being the Ordinance of God. And as for <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 82. and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. I have ≈øpoken before. I wonder then that the Dr. in a Treati≈øe of Con≈øcience, and having that word ≈øo often in his Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe makes no con≈øcience of confining the≈øe places (as in effect he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually) meerely to Supreme power; It was for his turne indeed, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare more anon But that will hardly ≈øatisfie a Con≈øcience, let him think on it.</p>
            <p>But I mu≈øt not forget his rea≈øon now ≈øerving me once more again≈øt him. God governes all men by others in his ≈øtead; now that is done by ≈øubordinate Governours, as well as ≈øupreame (and ≈øo the inferiour and unrea≈øonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by divers ≈øubordinations) and the ≈øubordinate doe ≈øometimes, even ten more then then the ≈øupreame, let him be never ≈øo good; if they be bad. the government and order will be di≈øturbed and perverted, in a large Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becau≈øe his eye and hand can not be but in one place at once, and all may be and will be naught, if tho≈øe under Governours be naught, whiles he his ab≈øent.</p>
            <p>But if they be good, they keepe things for the generall tolerably well, how bad ≈øoever he is. For his badne≈ø≈øe then, (as his goodne≈ø≈øe before) will not reach to all places, and ≈øcarcely (though badne≈ø≈øe in a corrupted world will reach further then goodne≈ø≈øe) much further then where hee is pre≈øent. Kingdomes then are governed under God, by other Powers as well as by the preame<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and they no le≈ø≈øe ≈øent by him then the ≈øupreame; I ≈øhall make an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or two from this afterward.</p>
            <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> meane time I add my ≈øecond con≈øideration. That in all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Texts the ≈øpirit of God with the mention of Governours authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and ordained by him, inculcates their duty to him, and their obligation to Ju≈øtice, &amp;c. and that not onely when hee ≈øpeakes to them, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 82. and of them at large, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. But even when he ≈øpeakes to inferiours to be ≈øubject to them, and e≈øpecially when he forbids <hi>re≈øi≈øtance, Rom.</hi> 13. And for this cau≈øe they are all to be prayd for, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 2. <hi>That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godline≈ø≈øe and hone≈øty.</hi> Which words, if they may not be taken, as intending why God hath ≈øet any in Authority; yet the thing is undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly true, hee never by way of ordinance gave any Authority for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther End.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:39617:20"/>Tho≈øe Governours then whether ≈øupreame or other, that under pretence of their Authority from Gods Ordinance, di≈øturb the quiet and peaceable life<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> which the inferiours ≈øhould lead in all godline≈ø≈øe and hone≈øty (as to bee ≈øure they doe, that are bent or ≈øeduced to ≈øubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties) are farre from being Gods Ordinance in ≈øo doing; and therfore however their power it ≈øelfe, a ≈øufficiency of Authority for command and coercion in gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the People, be from God; yet their Tyranny is not at all from him<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> by way of Ordinance or Approbation, and ≈øo they that re≈øi≈øt it even with Armes; Re≈øi≈øt not the Ordinance of God, but re≈øi≈øt the violation of his Ordinance, and ≈øo doe nothing unlawfull, though it be a re≈øi≈øting of the ≈øupreame per≈øon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let it be remembred that St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the place fore-mentioned, ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Governours, ≈øuppo≈øe if meant as the Doctor would<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>

Nor any where el≈øe in Scripture, I dare be bold to ≈øay it, doth the Spirit of God bid be ≈øubject to Princes or politick Governours, though tyrannous, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters of Religion, and Ju≈øtice. I meane not when it ≈øpeaks of them as ≈øuch.</p>
            <p>And till then though they have power from God, which is not to be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; yet their Tyranny being not from him, but again≈øt him, may, and the Doctor hath not been able (nor will never be) to prove to the contrary.</p>

            <p>IN this Section the Doctor undertakes to treat of the <hi>Forfeiture</hi> of the Power<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and ≈øo of the <hi>Re-a≈ø≈øuming</hi> of it by the <hi>Parliament</hi> or <hi>People,</hi> for the Kings not di≈øcharging his tru≈øt. And denies this Forfeiture, and this power of Rea≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that Power. But this (he ≈øaith) they that plead for it offer to prove by two or three things laid together. Fir≈øt, that the power is derived from the People by way of Election. Secondly, that there is a Covenant betweene the King and the People. Thirdly, that it is nece≈ø≈øary for a State have a meanes within it ≈øelfe to pre≈øerve it ≈øelfe. Again≈øt all tho≈øe the Dr. argues and I follow him. Onely remembring him that by <hi>Forfeiture</hi> is not under≈øtood <hi>Forfeiture of all Kingly Authority</hi>; nor by <hi>Rea≈ø≈øuming</hi> (as I ≈øaid before) <hi>a taking of the whole power from him to them≈øelves,</hi> but onely for the particular Ca≈øe in hazard, and for the pre≈øent neces≈øity.</p>
            <p>And now to begin with what he fir≈øt mentions the Derivation of power; I mu≈øt tell him that he forges what he before complained of in others; that they confounded the power it ≈øelfe with the per≈øon and the Qualification<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> I am ≈øure he doth ≈øo here, if ever man did. Hee before granted the Per≈øon and Qualification from men and then they approved of God; and more then that, no man pleads to be derived nor more to be forfeited, plead not for ≈øo much, nor he <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:39617:20"/>Yet here now at fir≈øt, to oppo≈øe the Forfeiture (but of this particular which is only in que≈øtion now before us) he denies the power to be from the People, and appeales to what he hath cleared, which is onely (by his owne ≈øaying<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but not altogether as hath beene ≈øhewed) that the Power it ≈øelfe is from God. But for all that, if no more can be ≈øaid again≈øt the per≈øons forfeiting his reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Power, and ≈øpecially in the Qualifications of it, even for ever, it may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be forfeited and ≈øo re-a≈ø≈øumed all of it: which is more then I ≈øay.</p>
            <p>Secondly, but he will prove, that though the People have this Power ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely (which him≈øelfe hath more then once granted, of the De≈øignation of the Per≈øon and Qualification) yet could they not have right to take it away.</p>
            <p>REPL. The King will have no cau≈øe to thank him for his undertaking, as well becau≈øe he doth it not with any great ≈øtrength; as al≈øo becau≈øe hee hath hereby provoked men to di≈øpute even this Ca≈øe; which no way needed, ≈øince the <hi>Parliament</hi> never pretended to this Right in generall, but rather di≈øclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it.</p>

            <p>REPL. True; but ≈øome things are, and that both, if conditions be not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved, and even at our owne plea≈øure.</p>
            <p>A King makes ≈øome Officers for <hi>terme of life</hi>; others, <hi>quamdin ≈øe bene ge≈ø≈øerint</hi>; others, <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

To the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond their offices are ≈øure without power of recalling till they are legally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of mi≈øbehaviour. To the third, as long as they live, their Authority is firme, and no power of recalling it wholly. Yet even ≈øuch may bee hindred from ≈øome Admini≈øtrations, by Accu≈øations by and apparency of Crimes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it unfit for them to be tru≈øted in the particular.</p>
            <p>We imagine not the People to have power to recall that Regall Authority at their plea≈øure: we argue not that they have power to recall it wholly, upon any Ca≈øe of <hi>Mal-admini≈øtration.</hi> All that we plead for is power to admini≈øter a part of it upon nece≈øsity, which he will not admini≈øter for good, but rather for evill. And there are not many things that were altogether ours, and in our di≈øpo≈øing before we part with them<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but are ≈øtill ≈øo farre ours, as to u≈øe them againe in our nece≈øsity for that turne at lea≈øt, though there are ≈øome.</p>
            <p>Secondly But he will prove this to be one of tho≈øe that are not after in our power to recall [e≈øpecially, ≈øaith he, ≈øuch; in which there redounds to God an intere≈øt by the Donation, as in things devoted, though after they come to be abu≈øed.]</p>
            <p>REPL. 1. Grant this true, in referrence to the Power of recalling them wholly, (which yet is not univer≈øally true as will appeare ≈øtraight) yet may there be power enough to admini≈øter ≈øo much as is of nece≈øsity.</p>
            <p>A Wife is tyed to her Husband by the Covenant of God. (≈øo called <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.) by the Ordinance of God, more ancient, and no le≈ø≈øe ≈øtrong then that of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Government. She cannot recall wholly her Husbands Authority over her, though ≈øhee was once altogether at her di≈øpo≈øing<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> to choo≈øe or another or none to be her head. All the goods of the Family are his in Law, and not here but by his leave and order: Yet for her neces≈øity, ≈øhe may by the Law of God and con≈øcience admini≈øter ≈øo much of the goods as is fit, and ≈øecure her Per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>≈øon
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:39617:21"/>
from his violence by ab≈øence (though that ordinarily be again≈øt the Law of Marriage, and the end of it,) or any other meanes of ncce≈ø≈øary defence.</p>
            <p>But ≈øecondly, it is not altogether true, that there is no power or recalling any thing devoted to God. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> took off the gold from the Doores of the Temple and the Pillars which he had overlaid, and all the ≈øilver in the hou≈øe of the Lord, to pay the King of <hi>A≈ø≈øyria</hi> his demanded Ran≈øome, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 18.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>If the Doctor will not owne this Act of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>; I am ≈øure he will that of <hi>David,</hi> taking the hallowed Bread, which was not for any, by Gods Law to eate, but onely the Prie≈øts. This was devoted to God, (and not ≈øo much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øed) and by him as≈øigned to a ≈øpeciall u≈øe: yet from that diverted, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully without que≈øtion.</p>
            <p>And now I appeale to all Con≈øciences, Whether the neces≈øity of ≈øaving a Kingdome from the ≈øubver≈øion of Religion, Lawes and Liberties, be not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>Davids</hi> neces≈øitie was? And if [<hi>I will have mercy and not ≈øacrifice</hi>] did ju≈øtifie <hi>Davids</hi> act, will it not theirs, who in a neces≈øity u≈øe or admini≈øter the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> or Armes, which ordinarily is only to be admiei≈øtred by the King? Neither will <hi>Abimelech</hi> the Prie≈øts con≈øenting to <hi>David</hi> alter the Ca≈øe: for it was devoted to God, and but in neces≈øity he might not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented, nor <hi>David</hi> accepted. Neces≈øity then recalled that particular Bread, through devoted. So neces≈øity may recall this parcell of power in que≈øtion.</p>
            <p>Thus the Doctors ground failes him for our Ca≈øe; yet 3. ≈øee what he adds, <q>[≈øo although it were as they would have it that they give the power, and God approves (him≈øelfe oft hath ≈øaid, and cannot deny, but they give the Per≈øon his power and if they take it from his per≈øon, yet they may leave it to his Heire but wee argue not for ≈øo much) yet becau≈øe the Lords hand and his oyle al≈øo is upon the Per≈øon elected to the Crowne, and then he is the Lords Annointed, and the Mini≈øter of God, tho≈øe hands of the People which were u≈øed in lifting him up to the Crowne, may not againe be lift up again≈øt him, either to take the Crowne from his head, or the Sword out of his hand; this true inform'd Con≈øcience will not dare to doe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>REPL. 1. Is not Gods hand upon a Judge? Is not hee the Mini≈øter of God? Is not a King bound to God and to his People to appoint Judges, who may le≈ø≈øe be ≈øpared in their Power, then the Monarch him≈øelfe (for what is his Power when an Infant? Is not the Kingdome then admini≈øtred Ari≈øtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally? But there mu≈øt alwayes be Judges and inferiour officers in a large Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, or all government is lo≈øt.)</p>
            <p>Will the Doctor ≈øay that the hands that have lift up the Judge or Officer to his ≈øeat (that is the Kings hands) may not bee lift up again≈øt him to pull him downe and pull off his Robes, or take the Sword out of his hand? The inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt that God hath in him, ≈øhall it pre≈øerve him in his Office, in ca≈øe e≈øpecially of <hi>Mal-Admini≈øtration</hi>? But ≈øhall it (or hath it done) even ≈øo long as no offence is proved again≈øt him? The <hi>Parliament</hi> hath indeed de≈øired it for Judges and great Officers; but hath it been granted? Or what meanes the putting out of ≈øo many old Ju≈øtices of Peace lately, without any Crime alleadged again≈øt them at all; of which more Countreys then one have at the As≈øi≈øes complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a great grievance?</p>
            <p>What will the Doctor ≈øay to this? Yet they were Gods Mini≈øters and had
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:39617:21"/>
the Sword committed to them. If hee ≈øay the King was their Superiour, and ≈øo might take their Authoritie away, but the people is not Superiour to the King.</p>
            <p>REPLY. This ≈øatisfies not, becau≈øe notwith≈øtanding, here is a Per≈øon, in whom GOD hath an intere≈øt, and who is his Mini≈øter, deprived of his Authoritie: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he abu≈øes it, but meerely at plea≈øure. The Drs. Rea≈øon then hath no ≈øtrength in it thus faare, or this done to inferiour Magi≈øtrates is not lawfull.</p>

So ≈øtill con≈øent gave what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever a Prince could or can challenge. I ≈øay then once more unle≈ø≈øe in the fir≈øt foundation of a State, Kingdome or Empire (and this Kingdome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly) the People did make their King ≈øo ab≈øolute, as to give away all power of re≈øi≈øtance from them≈øelves in any ca≈øe; (which the Doctor I beleeve will never be able to prove of this, or any other Civill State) though they made no expre≈ø≈øe conditions or Covenant, much le≈ø≈øe any mention of re≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a power of re≈øi≈øtance; yet the Law of Nature allowed them ≈øtill ≈øome Liberties; (what they were we ≈øhall have occa≈øion to ≈øcan in the next Section:) and among≈øt them this for one, to re≈øi≈øt any violence again≈øt them≈øelves, in any thing that the Law of Nature did undoubtedly make them ≈øtill Ma≈øters of, and was not ≈øubjected to their Princes power.</p>

            </p>
            <p>REPL. This is the mo≈øt plau≈øible Plea he hath or any can bring, ≈øpecially the latter part of it, about the calling and di≈ø≈øolving the Parliament at the Kings will and plea≈øure. But to this al≈øo as well as all the re≈øt ≈øufficient ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I doubt not may be given before indifferent judgements and unpartiall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:39617:24"/>
Con≈øciences, in the manner following. Fir≈øt, as the King never dies; ≈øo he never growes, he never hath more authority (unle≈ø≈øe by a new grant from the people) then his fir≈øt Predece≈ø≈øor had; unle≈ø≈øe it can be proved, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then gave away their liberty of defence from outragious violence, which all are naturally inve≈øted with; it is free for them now as well as it was the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day or houre after they cho≈øe or con≈øented to their fir≈øt King as was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed before.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as he is King before Oath or Coronation. So he gives away none of his Rights in his Oath, nor doe the People when they crowne him. But he there profe≈ø≈øes him≈øelfe bound by his Kingly Office to rule ≈øo and ≈øo, for the common good, and they yeeld no more to him, then they did to his fir≈øt Predece≈ø≈øor, as before.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as he is not admitted upon any ≈øuch capitulation in expre≈ø≈øe terms, as mention this power of re≈øi≈øtance in the people, or repre≈øentative body, in ca≈øe of Tyranny. So nor doe the people at his admittance expre≈ø≈øe a yeelding to him ≈øuch ab≈øolute power, as they may not, or will not in any ca≈øe re≈øi≈øt, I ≈øay againe and againe, it can never be rationally conceived the people have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away ≈øuch a naturall liberty, ≈øuch a nece≈ø≈øary power for their common ≈øafety: Unle≈ø≈øe it can be proved that they have done ≈øo. The proofe then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Barre of indifferency of judgement, and unpartiall con≈øcience will lie on the Doctors part not ours.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, But he ≈øaith, the repre≈øentative Body cannot meet but by the will of the Prince, and is di≈ø≈øoluble at his plea≈øure.</p>
            <p>REPL. 2. It hath been ≈øo <hi>de facto multo,</hi> but whether it bee altogether ≈øo <hi>de jure,</hi> may ju≈øtly be que≈øtioned upon the≈øe grounds. Fir≈øt, for their meeting, when the Prince is an Infant, or if a pri≈øoner in enemies hands, and ≈øo cannot give out a legall Warrant for their meeting; or if di≈øtracted, hath not the State power to meet in <hi>Parliament</hi> for their common ≈øafety, and the Princes too? They have met in the infancy or minority of Kings, and made Lawes, as in <hi>Edw.</hi> the 6. time, and not by the meere power of the <hi>Protectour,</hi> for the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity after put him out (his head was cut off afterward by a Law made while he was Protectour.) It was then, (and could be nothing el≈øe but) the inherent power of State, to meet ≈øo, in ca≈øes of neces≈øity. Yet I beleeve there is no writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law for this; but the generall <hi>Maxim</hi> of <hi>Salus Populi ≈øuprema lex.</hi> And this will extend to the ca≈øe of Tyranny, as fully as any of the former, if not more. Withall, did not the Lords in <hi>Richard</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">nds.</hi> time, call a <hi>Parliament</hi> without the King, wherein they had their grievances redre≈ø≈øed; and this afterward was confirmed in the fir≈øt of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, then for their di≈ø≈øolving; It hath indeed beene very much practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed by our two la≈øt Kings.</p>
            <p>But our Hi≈øtories (≈øo farre as I remember) <hi>quare</hi> whether <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. did not di≈ø≈øolve ≈øome <hi>Parliaments</hi> in di≈øcontent? mention not any ≈øuch thing as a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> di≈ø≈øolved in di≈øplea≈øure, or again≈øt the de≈øire of the Hou≈øes. But as they meet very frequently, oft-times every yeare, ≈øomtimes oftner; (≈øo that in the ≈øpace of a hundred yeares there are counted above a 100. <hi>Parliaments</hi>) So they ≈øate till they had ended the Princes and their owne bu≈øine≈ø≈øes, which went much together; and ≈øo it never came to a matter of examination or di≈øcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the delay of calling them to meet, or the too timely di≈ø≈øolution of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:39617:24"/>
Parliaments were not wont to bee ≈øo odious or dreadfull to Princes as within the≈øe forty yeares they have been. By who≈øe default they have been ≈øo ≈øince, let the encrochments upon <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the Subjects liberties direct any to judge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But further, for both the≈øe. Fir≈øt, the <hi>Parliament</hi> averres that there are Lawes that there ≈øhould be a Parliament every yeare, and ≈øo they have abated of their Right, rather then gained upon the King by the Act of the <hi>Trienniall Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And for the di≈ø≈øolution I have heard ≈øome wi≈øemen affirme, that by Law it cannot be di≈ø≈øolved, while there are any Petitions of grievances, or ≈øuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of importance, depending and unfini≈øhed. Whereunto may be added mo≈øt ju≈øtly, that in ordinary times Countrey Gentlemen and Noblemen, and in a manner the whole body of the Parliament, would be as ≈øick of a long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and continuall attendance as the King could wi≈øh, and would petition (rather then be tyed ≈øo by the legge) for a di≈ø≈øolution, or at lea≈øt a Prorogation. And it's well enough knowne, that even this Parliament after the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation</hi> pa≈øt, were as weary of ≈øitting, as need to be de≈øired, till the <hi>Rebellion</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ≈øeconded by the growing evills at home, put new ≈øpirits into them, and forced them to that diligence of attendance and unwearied labours (≈øo many as have taken the common good to heart) as no Age or Story can pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel here, or in any other Kingdome or Nation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, beyond all this I appeale againe to the <hi>Kings An≈øwer</hi> to the 19. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions</hi> formerly mention'd; and aske whether if the King have ab≈øolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to forbeare calling them, at his will; and to di≈ø≈øolve them at his plea≈øure; it be not a meere nothing that hee ≈øaith the <hi>Hou≈øe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> have power to impeach his owne Followers and Favorites, who have broken the Lawes, even by ≈øurreptitiou≈øly gotten commands from the King: and that the Lords have power to judge and puni≈øh, and are an excellent skreene between the King and the people, to as≈øi≈øt each again≈øt any incroachings of the other, and by ju≈øt Iudgements to pre≈øerve the Law, which ought to be the rule of every one of the three: and that the Power legally placed in both Hou≈øes is more then ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prevent and re≈øtraine the power of Tyranny.</p>
            <p>What ≈øerves all this for, when his Favourites will keepe him from calling a Parliament, perhaps all his dayes, unle≈ø≈øe unlook'd for nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>≈øity force him to it? We haoe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Againe, what ≈øerves the calling them, when the ≈øame Favourites being que≈øtioned, ≈øhall coun≈øell a di≈ø≈øolution? We have knowne that too, even three times in this Kings Reigne, and no other di≈ø≈øolution but on the≈øe grounds. And the la≈øt was within three weekes becau≈øe they would not in all ha≈øt (and contrary to all former Pre≈øidents and Priviledges) give mony again≈øt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and embroyle the two Kingdomes in a perpetuall Warre, not having had one grievance redre≈ø≈øed. And in the ca≈øe of a Prince, bent or ≈øeduced to ≈øubvert Religion Lawes and Liberties (which is the Doctors Ca≈øe propounded.) It is undoubted, he will if he can di≈ø≈øolve them, as ≈øoone as they offer but to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh any of his Favourites<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and ≈øo to cro≈ø≈øe the de≈øigne (unle≈ø≈øe he dare not, of which anon) becau≈øe therefore I believe the King in that An≈øwer, hath not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:39617:25"/>
a≈øcribed more then right to the <hi>Parliament.</hi> It will follow, that in right (≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ≈øuch ca≈øe) they ought not to be di≈ø≈øolved. And that if by force they ≈øhould be, (or ≈øhould not have been called at all) the People have right to meet together, when and where they can, in a Parliamentary manner or otherwi≈øe: to ≈øuch end as to defend them≈øelves and one another from tyranny and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned ≈øubver≈øion of Religion, Lawes and Liberties, as hath beene often ≈øaid.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, but for the pre≈øent condition of our Kingdome and Parliament, I mu≈øt profe≈ø≈øe, that as I admire the providence of God, in the Act pa≈ø≈øed for the continuation of this Parliament; ≈øo I doe for the forementioned expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions of the King in that an≈øwer. Which laid together, may to any under≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding men, wholly decide this fir≈øt Que≈øtion betweene the Doctor and us in point of Legality in our Kingdome (if there were nothing el≈øe ≈øaid or to be ≈øaid) that ≈øuppo≈øing ≈øuch a de≈øigne to ≈øubvert Religion, Lawes and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This Parliament hath (if no other had or could have, being di≈ø≈øoluble at plea≈øure) compleat power and Authority to doe all they doe, that ≈øo they may prevent and re≈øtraine the de≈øigned tyranny.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Yet I have one thing more to alleadge, ≈øuppo≈øing the power of calling and di≈ø≈øolving wholly in the King ordinarily; yet there may be ≈øuch power in them ≈øo long as they doe ≈øit to command Armes to bee rais'd for the ≈øuppres≈øing of any Delinquents, maintaining them≈øelves with Armes, even under the colour of the Kings Authority, which I thus make good. (If there be any ≈øuch kind of Power in the very Judges in their Courts at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> for the whole Kingdome; and in their ≈øeverall Circuits for the Shires they ≈øit in; although them≈øelves are made Judges at the Kings will meerly, and put out ordinarily at his plea≈øure, and they can neither keepe As≈øizes at any time, nor keep any Terme any where, but when and ≈øo long as the King plea≈øes to give Commis≈øion: if (I ≈øay) there be ≈øuch a power in the Judges, and even in one of them; then much more in the whole Parliament, which is unque≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably and undoubtedly the highe≈øt Judicature in the Kingdome, and hath mo≈øt power during their ≈øitting. Now that ≈øuch a kinde of power is in the Judges, I appeale to experience, in the ca≈øe following</p>
            <p>A private man hath a ≈øuite with the King about Land or Hou≈øe and the like. The King hath po≈ø≈øes≈øion and ≈øome Officer or Tenant of his holds it for the King.

but whether that would hinder Law or not?) The Parliament then may in the ca≈øe of neces≈øity rai≈øe Armes again≈øt the Kings per≈øonall Command, for the generall ≈øafety, and keeping po≈ø≈øes≈øion (which is more nece≈ø≈øary then the hope of regaining) of the Hou≈øes, Lands, Goods, Liberties, Lives, Religion and all.</p>
            <p>And this by the Kings legall Authority, and the re≈øi≈øters of this are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells in the Lawes account, and not the In≈øtruments ≈øo imployed Legally, though with Armes by the Parliament.</p>
            <p>If the Doctor now (or any for him) will retort upon me, as he thinks, what I ≈øaid before, that if this be granted, a King intending Tyranny, will not call a Parliament; or if he have called it, he will ≈øtraight di≈ø≈øolve it, as ≈øoone as they attempt any thing again≈øt his mind.</p>
            <p>REPL. I reply, he will doe ≈øo indeed<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> if hee can per≈øwade the people, by the Doctors Divinity or Law, to endure him and his followers to take away their Goods, and doe what el≈øe he li≈øt; and they for want of a Parliament called or ≈øitting, dare not defend them≈øelves at all. But if hee find, that they believe no ≈øuch Doctrine; but without di≈øpute of Law or Con≈øciences re≈øolve ru≈øtically not to be robbed of their goods at plea≈øure, or u≈øed like meere ≈ølaves; but that they will defend them≈øelves and ≈øomwhat they begin to doe, and beat away or kill ≈øome that come to take their goods away in ≈øuch ill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Therefore I conclude, that the Parliament (as I ≈øaid before) may have this power and upon advantage of the Kings neces≈øities, and Peoples not enduring oppres≈øion, be able to exerci≈øe it, even though they meet not but at the Kings will, and are di≈ø≈øoluble at his plea≈øure.</p>

            <p>REPLY. This Rea≈øon we acknowledge ours, and con≈øidering what a State is, a Body compo≈øed of many thou≈øands, who by them≈øelves (or their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øtors) ≈øet up a King over them, for their ≈øafety and good, this Rea≈øon is as much Rea≈øon, as any thing can be betweene Man and Man: Nor ≈øhall the Dr. bee ever able to ≈øpeake Rea≈øon in Oppo≈øition to it; him≈øelfe grants ≈øtraight way, that <hi>≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Populi</hi> in a good Sence, is <hi>≈øuprema Lex.</hi> And when a People, neither ≈øeekes nor de≈øires any thing of hurt to their Prince, but onely ≈øafety to them≈øelves, It is good in no ≈øence, if not in this; to allow (I ≈øay more command) a State that hath any con≈øiderable ≈øtrength to doe it, to defend it ≈øelfe, and ≈øo procure its owne ≈øafety, even by re≈øi≈øting if need be, by force of Armes.

            <p>REPLY. This is but a ≈øecond calumny, of which his Treati≈øe is full every where, neither profit nor Imagination is admitted or urged in this ca≈øe, but nece≈ø≈øity appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or judged imminent by Rules of prudence, which commands endeavour of prevention of extreme evills (≈øuch as the ruine of a States ≈øafety) even by care and Power before hand, as well as when it lies ga≈øping under the pre≈ø≈øure. Coun≈øell in prevention is indeed better then help out of trouble: For by that le≈ø≈øe trouble is ≈øuffered, and le≈ø≈øe offence acted in the defence.</p>
            <p>But the≈øe are but the Drs flouri≈øhes, for he will now ≈øtabbe this rea≈øon to the heart with diver≈øe contrary Rea≈øons, again≈øt all the plea of Nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øafety. The fir≈øt is that, this among others is one of the many Weapons ≈øharpned for Re≈øi≈øtance at the Phili≈øtims Forge, the Romi≈øh Schooles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Fir≈øt him≈øelfe will not allow this to be reproach to him, or his fellowes in any of their po≈øitions, nor thinke it ≈øufficient to make an Argument be rejected, becau≈øe the Romoni≈øts have either u≈øed it or abu≈øed it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:39617:26"/>Secondly, but he is deceived in paralelling the Ca≈øes. They pleade for the Popes Power of curbing or depo≈øing Kings in ca≈øe of Here≈øie, becau≈øe el≈øe the Church hath not meanes for the maintenance o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Catholicke Faith, and its owne ≈øafety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> The Argument is not good, his Church is not a Civill State, but the good of it is mainly ≈øpirituall, and to be pre≈øerved by ≈øuch ≈øpirituall meanes, as GOD hath appointed, who both in≈øtituted and con≈øtituted it him≈øelfe, and left not to it, the ordering of its owne ≈øafety or good. But our ca≈øe is of a Civill State, who≈øe good is Civill and naturall, and is to be pre≈øerved by civill and naturall meanes, and ≈øo by Armes in ca≈øe of danger, even from its owne Prince, bent or ≈øeduced to ruine it. The Dr. him≈øelfe ≈øtraightwayes grants, the State hath meanes of pre≈øervation ≈øuch as the Law hath pre≈øcribed. If he can ≈øhew us any true meanes, in the ca≈øe ≈øtated by him, but this power of re≈øi≈øtance, I yield him the cau≈øe. If not he doth but abu≈øe his Readers Con≈øcienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, to blind them with words, which are of no validity. But I have ≈øhewed him before, and mu≈øt againe remember him, that in our <hi>Parliament</hi> State (by the Kings owne acknowledgement) hath ≈øuch Power by Law to puni≈øh even the Kings followers and Favourites, as is more then ≈øufficient to prevent, or re≈øtraine Tyranny. We aske no more for our ≈øafety. But when they will re≈øi≈øt the <hi>Parliament</hi> by Armes, It hath no way to puni≈øh them, or defend the State but by Armes Which therefore it may lawfully take up.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Dr. addes <q>(If every ≈øtate hath ≈øuch Meanes to provide for its ≈øafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, what meanes of ≈øafety had the Chri≈øtian Religion in, and after the Apo≈øtles Times? Or the People then en≈ølaved, what meanes had they for their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apologie ≈øaith, the Chri≈øtians had number and Force ≈øufficient to with≈øtand, but they had no Warrant. And the Apo≈øtle forbids them, and all other under the higher Power to re≈øi≈øt.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This example of the Chri≈øtians not re≈øi≈øting is counted a Capitall Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ≈øhall ≈øee what ≈øtrength it hath. Fir≈øt it is brought in this place, for the Chri≈øtians were neither a civill State, (of which the pre≈øent Rea≈øon proceeds) nor neere to the greater number in the The State. They had the Lawes (which is in ≈øome Sence the State) again≈øt them, and ≈øo they ever had beene, and the greater<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> part of the body of the E≈øtate by farre, were oppo≈øite, even in <hi>Tertullians</hi> Time. Though therefore the Church being properly onely a ≈øpirituall State, have not of nece≈ø≈øity, civill meanes to provide for the outward ≈øafety of Chri≈øtians: yet a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill State, (whether of Heathens or Chri≈øtians) may have and hath, which is by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Armes, in ca≈øe of nece≈ø≈øity as before. But the Dr. ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle forbids them and all, under the Higher power to re≈øi≈øt.</p>

               <hi>Reply.</hi> I ≈øuppo≈øe what I have formerly ≈øaid on this place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. may and will ≈øatisfie mo≈øt Readers for that place. But the Drs. importunity forces me to repeate part of it here, and apply it to the ca≈øe of Chri≈øtians, even then, and much more now: And ≈øo I make bold to tell the Dr. that he doth mo≈øt mi≈øerably wre≈øt the Apo≈øtles words in this ca≈øe of all others, which to demon≈øtrate (I ≈øay to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrate) I appeale to the context after and before, and let all Chri≈øtians, and Con≈øciences, or even rea≈øonable Men, Iudge whether the Drs.

<q>[Who≈øoever ≈øhall take up Armes to re≈øi≈øt <hi>Nero,</hi> per≈øecuting the Chri≈øtian Religion, re≈øi≈øts the Ordinance of GOD; Rebells again≈øt GOD in re≈øi≈øting the higher Power ordained by GOD, and if hee kill any man in ≈øuch re≈øi≈øtance, he commits murther, &amp; incurres damnation for ≈øo doing.]</q> This is the Drs.

            <p>Thirdly, adde further what the Apo≈øtle doth, v. 4. [For hee is the Mini≈øter of GOD to thee for gooD,] Is this true of per≈øecuting <hi>Nero,</hi> in the ca≈øe of his per≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? Whereby the Apo≈øtle proves he will pray≈øe thee, doing that which is good?

            <p>Fourthly, goe on one ≈øtep further with the Apo≈øtle, which will yet make it more plaine if more can be; [But if you doe that which is evill then feare, for he beares not the Sword in vaine, for hee is the Mini≈øter of GOD, a Revenger to ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or is Chri≈øtianitie the evill they were to feare, as that which he u≈øed the Sword again≈øt, and that with great wrath and revenge? There is then nothing like the Drs Interpretation, In all the≈øe Arguments of the Apo≈øtle: but the cleane contrary, be≈øides what followes, v. 5, 6, 7. Of which ≈øee the expo≈øition before.</p>
            <p>But ≈øome will ≈øay, was it then lawfull for the Chri≈øtians, then to have re≈øi≈øted the per≈øecuting Emperours? <hi>Tertullian</hi> and the Fathers thought otherwi≈øe.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, fir≈øt, whether it were or no, (of which by and by) mo≈øt certaine, it was not forbidden in this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2, 3, 4. Yet this is the Capitall place. If any other can be found forbidding it, which the Dr. offers not to urge, further then what we have examined already, that is nothing to this Text. For no Logick or Rhetorick can extract that ≈øence from hence; who ever they be, that have ≈øo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted it heretofore.</p>
            <p>Secondly, but becau≈øe of the great Outcry made of the Chri≈øtians not re≈øi≈øting then, I will once more looke upon the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. and compare it al≈øo with that before ≈øo: v. 1. and ≈øee whether by a right view, it will not plainly pronounce Chri≈øtians even then, free from pa≈ø≈øive ≈øubjection in ca≈øe of per≈øecution (≈øuppo≈øing they had Force to re≈øi≈øt, by their hands not tyed by <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinance from re≈øi≈øt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>REPLY.

But I meane, he hath no Authority to bid what GOD forbids, or to forbid what GOD bids; or puni≈øh them that obey GOD rather than him. GOD never gave this Power, nor can men give it.

And who≈øoever challenges ≈øuch Power, is (in that) not GODS Deputy, but an V≈øurper, whether King or Cae≈øar, Roman or Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki≈øh Emperour or any other.

there is no greater good on earth (in civill re≈øpects) then the ≈øafety of a ≈øtate. Therefore all meanes not forbidden from Heaven are rea≈øonable, and to bee expected and u≈øed, though not expres≈øly provided for (that is mentioned) in the Fundamentalls of this Government, which the Doctor would require.

            <p>REPL. They have ≈øo; in making particular Lawes. But the Que≈øt. now is of exerci≈øing the generall and maine fundamentall Law of all States, to ≈øave the whole from ruine and ≈øubver≈øion.

            <p>The Rea≈øons that the Dr. hath brought againh Re≈øi≈øtance, are ≈øo far from being the Apo≈øtles In≈øinuations, that they are wholly un≈øufficient to di≈øcredit it with Rea≈øonable and unpartiall Men, to whom (next under GOD) we Appeale.

But after he was once gone Northward (and the Qu. beyond Sea<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>) what did hee ever doe or ≈øay, but in oppo≈øition to them? and while his Declarations renounced all thoughts of Warre, notes were ≈øent over into <hi>Holland</hi> for Armes, and a beginning of an Army rai≈øed at Yorke, under the name of a Guard. When fir≈øt the Hou≈øes having petitioned the Removing the Magazine at <hi>Hull</hi> to <hi>London.</hi> (Upon a counter-Petition of a very few Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of York≈øhire, pretending the name of the whole County that it might be kept cleare ≈øtill) the King goes in≈øtantly to <hi>Hull,</hi> and demands entrance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending as he declares to the Parliament after<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that he meant ≈øo to doe) to take po≈ø≈øes≈øion of the Towne and Magazine, and di≈øpo≈øe of it: and being denyed, proclaimes Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> Traitor, without any proce≈ø≈øe of Law, or ≈øending fir≈øt to the Hou≈øe to know if they would owne it; and after demands ju≈øtice ≈øo peremptorily, as to deny before hand all other bu≈øine≈ø≈øes, but that of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (and how well that was done, we mu≈øt remember anon) and then was the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my rai≈øed under Colour of a Guard the York≈øhire men, not comming in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily enough to make it appeare a great Army.) And all this before ever it was declared by the Hou≈øes that the King ≈øeduced by wicked Councell, intended to make war again≈øt his Parliament, and ≈øo before ever they ≈øet out the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions for Money, Plate Hor≈øes, and therefore certainly before any one man was li≈øted.

            <p>As touching the cau≈øe of the≈øe Armes, the Doctor would per≈øwade us, that it is for ≈øomthing which the King hath right to Deny.

            <p>REPL. But now ≈øufficient verball promi≈øes, with ≈øuch actions done (as were noted even now) are to ≈øecure Religion or the State, Con≈øcience mu≈øt judge, and it may a little the better, when we come to con≈øider them againe in the proper place for them (for here they outrunne their ≈øea≈øon like Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives) in the next Section. Secondly, he ≈øaith it mu≈øt then be for denying the <hi>Militia,</hi> the di≈øpo≈øing offices of State, and ≈øuch like; al≈øo the government of the Church, and the revenue of it; and for not denying his power of denying in Parliament.</p>
            <p>REPL. 1. For the <hi>Militia,</hi> I referre to what hath beene ≈øaid, how ju≈øt rea≈øon the Parliament had to petition the ≈øecuring it, and after to ≈øettle it (as in ca≈øe of neces≈øity) by Ordinance. Of which their Declarations have given more full account. 2. For di≈øpo≈øing Offices of State, it was never de≈øired, till the difference was very farre advanced, and <hi>Hull</hi> attempted; and Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> proclaimed Traitour, and the Army rai≈øed at Yorke, called a Guard. And ≈øo onely de≈øired as a Security after ≈øuch a breach; and no way a cau≈øe of the breach; Thirdly, For the Kings power of denying, it was never in que≈øtion betweene him and them, till the <hi>Militia</hi> was ab≈øolutely and peremptorily denyed. And in all their Declarations they never take it away; but contrarily in the defence of that <hi>May,</hi> 26. they grant, that though the King be bound by Oath and care of his people, not to deny any Bill for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ≈øafety and good (for in ordinary matters they yeeld he may deny) Yet if he doe deny, it is no Law without him. Onely in ca≈øe of the common ≈øafety, they ≈øay the two Hou≈øes may doe what is nece≈ø≈øary, and it binds the Subjects for that neces≈øity, though he doe deny. The denyall then of the <hi>Militia</hi> only, in the ca≈øe of neces≈øity (with other things noted before) forced them to doe what they did toward Armes; and not any difference about a power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall in generall. 4. For the government and Revenue of the Church. I beleeve indeed it was a part of the cau≈øe of taking Armes; but not on the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> part: the major part of whom in either Hou≈øe, never (till very lately) declared, nor ≈øhewed any purpo≈øe of taking either away quite, but only refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming (which the Doctor ≈øaith his Maje≈øty is alway ready to agree,) as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare even by the great agitations for ≈øo long in the Hou≈øe of Commons of

And whereas the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ≈øaith the King is bound by Oath to maintaine the Government and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, as by Law they are e≈øtabli≈øh't.</p>
            <p>REPL. 1. He di≈øcovers a ≈øecret to us which we under≈øtood not before. All men ≈øtood amazed at the late Oath to this effect for the government; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Arguments again≈øt it not a few con≈øiderable men of the Mini≈øtry and Gentry before the Parliament lookt at it as an injury to the King, and oppo≈øite to our Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacie (and ≈øo the Parliament did in effect vote it) becau≈øe it urged men to ≈øweare never to con≈øent to alter the Government, which yet the King and State might pos≈øibly judge fit to be altered. But we never thought that the King was ≈øuppo≈øed bound by his Oath to it already; and much le≈ø≈øe that all Kings in ≈øucces≈øion would be bound (as now the Doctor teaches us) by their Oathes to maintaine it as it is by Law e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtabli≈øht. This it ≈øeems they pre≈øumed upon, and ≈øo thought to have made all ≈øure, by ≈øwearing all the Mini≈øtery and Univer≈øities, and Ma≈øters of Arts, and Schoolema≈øters, and Phy≈øitians<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> who would have had influence enough into the whole Kingdome within awhile. But God laught at this Project, turned it upon the Head of the Projectours and all the Party, as appeares this Day. And ≈øo I am per≈øwaded He will doe, all their Pre≈øent endeavours of Warre to recover them≈øelves. 2. But in good earne≈øt doth the Doctor (or any el≈øe) thinke the King bound by Oath to maintain Bi≈øhops ≈øtill in England (though he hath con≈øented to take them away in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to prevent War) even though he hazard the ruine of the Kingdome by a Civill Warre? and notwith≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any inconveniences repre≈øented to him by the complaints of his People, and the wi≈øedome of his <hi>Parliament,</hi> and his owne too? Or doth his Oath bind him to any more then to maintaine them ≈øo long as they are e≈øtabli≈øht by Law as he ≈øweares to maintaine all his other Subjects in their Rights; and yet an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> may alter many things in mens Rights. Are not all Rights of Church and State (which are not properly <hi>jure divino</hi>) compromit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Parliament</hi> the three E≈øtates, King, Lords, Commons, every time they meet? And may they not alter and change this or that, ≈øo farre as it is humane and e≈øtabli≈øht but by the Lawes of the Land? The Kings Oath then binds not him and his <hi>Parliament</hi> from taking away Bi≈øhops, if they judge
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:39617:36"/>
them (not <hi>jure divino</hi>) and their continuance to be prejudiciall to the State and Church; (and ≈øo of Revenues the ≈øame may be ≈øaid.) 3. And if the Dr. will not admit this An≈øwere, but ≈øtill contend, the King did ≈øweare to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them (at his Coronation) as they were then by Law e≈øtabli≈øhed. Is not the King beholding to him for charging him with Perjury (as in effect hee doth) ≈øince it is evident that by taking away the high Commis≈øion Court, and their power in their Courts of impo≈øing Oathes and Penalties, and after that their Votes in Parl. hee hath not maintain'd them as they were by Law e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øht, when he tooke the Oath.</p>
            <p>How the Doctor will an≈øwer this I know not: ≈øure I am, if any Mini≈øter having taken the Oath (never to con≈øent to alter the Government as it now ≈øtands e≈øtabli≈øht,) had offered to petition ≈øuch a taking away of their gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power; he ≈øhould quickly have beene accur≈øed as a perjured per≈øon, and accordingly ≈øo dealt with. It remaines then that the King onely ≈øwore to maintaine them according to Law; while they ≈øhould ≈øtand by Law, and not to bind him≈øelfe from any Law-making, though to take them away, in ca≈øe it ≈øhould appeare to be for the good of Church and State. And if this be not made good that their taking away will be ≈øo; let us all fight for them. But if it be, woe to tho≈øe men that hazard the King and two of his Kingdomes (<hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>) once more<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> (as before they would two yeares one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have hazarded <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>) to maintaine Epi≈øcopall greatne≈ø≈øe and Authority. 4. What degree of Reformation (or any thing like to the Primitive Bi≈øhops) did they ever offer to be reduced unto? which might have contented Parliament and People both, if ever propounded in earne≈øt, to have asked no more. Or what cure for any effectuall Reformation have any of them (or their Party) ever ≈øhewed ≈øince the Parliament met, to have rendred it any way hopefull that they would bee good in≈øtruments hereafter? 5. If therfore after all warnings, they will needs put the King ≈øtill on (as it appeares even by the Doctors words) to fight for their maintenance: Let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Mr. <hi>Brightmans</hi> Propheticall Interpretation of the ≈øpewing out of the Laodicean Angell. And though a vomiting ≈øomtimes makes a mans heart ≈øick, and ready to dye; yet where he hath ≈øtrength of Nature it comes up at la≈øt, and proves happy cure. Which in this ca≈øe (if it be Chri≈øts act<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> as it much ≈øeemes to be) will not faile to bee fulfilled to our comfort at la≈øt, how weake ≈øoever it bring us fir≈øt. I conclude this then, that as Phy≈øick is upon the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> ≈øo much more the endeavour to ca≈øt up the humour which unprovoked or but a little ≈øtirred, endangers the Bodies health by Inflamations &amp; the like.

            <p>Now for the managing of the re≈øi≈øtance, the Doctor offers to examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it hath beene ≈øo void of Ho≈øtility as that defen≈øive way, they pretend to, ≈øhould bee. Let us examine it with him. Here he contends 1. that the Defendant ≈øhould be of an≈øwerable demeanour to <hi>David</hi> defending him≈øelfe again≈øt <hi>Saul.</hi> REP. But he may be plea≈øed to con≈øider, that as all that handle the difference betweene an offen≈øive War and a defen≈øive, do rationally main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that he that is outragiou≈øly injuried (as <hi>David</hi> in his Emba≈ø≈øadors, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>

keeps him≈øelfe within the bounds of a defence, though he actually offend him that does, or that would a≈ø≈øault him, and even though he begin fir≈øt. So <hi>David</hi> did in the former ca≈øe, invading the Ammonites Country, and yet he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly defen≈øive. So a man on the high way, if a Robber ≈øhould a≈ø≈øault him; if he could prevent his blow and ≈øtrike fir≈øt, it were but in his owne defence: but much more to ≈øtrike againe and kill (if he cannot otherwi≈øe defend him≈øelfe) which yet is the highe≈øt degree of offence betweene party and party. <hi>Ob.</hi> But <hi>David</hi> ≈øtill withdrew and having taken the Kings ≈øpeare and cru≈øe, he re≈øtored them without demand. <hi>Rep.</hi> True, but I have formerly given the rea≈øon why he ever withdrew, Pag. I need not repeat it. And as for the cru≈øe and ≈øpeare, he tooke them not away for feare of being hurt by them (as now Ammunitions and other provi≈øions) but as the Dr. well ≈øayes, to ≈øhew <hi>Abners</hi> neglect and his own integrity; and therfore when they had done him that ≈øervice, he re≈øtored them without demand. But the <hi>Parl.</hi> cannot fly from place to place like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>; they mu≈øt keep at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> or di≈ø≈øolve them≈øelves; and they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to re≈øtore that which they took to prevent their own and the Kingdomes being mi≈øchefed by it; ≈øo that ≈øecurity might have been obtained for time to come; witne≈ø≈øe the Petition ≈øent by the E. of <hi>Holland</hi> and others to <hi>Beverley,</hi> while <hi>Hull</hi> was be≈øieged. In a word there hath been nothing done in this kind, of all that the Dr. reckons up, which meer neces≈øity hath not forced; and mo≈øt of tho≈øe things mu≈øt have beene done by <hi>David,</hi> if he had kept <hi>Keilah</hi> again≈øt <hi>Saul</hi> as he de≈øired and meant to have done. 2, And whereas the Dr. further ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges [that the Kings loyall and peaceable Subjects are a≈ø≈øaulted, de≈øpoiled of their Armes, goods, e≈øtates, their per≈øons impri≈øoned, becau≈øe they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their allegiance as≈øi≈øt him in this extremity; or would not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their con≈øcience, joyne with them again≈øt him] <hi>Rep.</hi> This concerns two ≈øorts of per≈øons; and for both<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> though ≈øomwhat differently, the ≈øatisfaction to this allegation depends upon the ju≈øtice of the defence it ≈øelfe.

The <hi>Dr.</hi> mi≈øtakes, it is not ≈øimply a Jealou≈øie of the King, but rather of the Kings Councellors and Followers, who find ≈øo much favour with him (as they and others did before the Parliament again≈øt the <hi>Scots</hi> and us both, and <hi>Ireland</hi> too, witne≈ø≈øe all their heavy complaints again≈øt the Great Favourite <hi>Strafford</hi>) that they are able to put him from time to time, upon the≈øe Actions which his goodne≈ø≈øe of it ≈øelfe, rightly informed and councelled, would abhorre; and hath ≈øo often declared again≈øt, and yet Actions againe have di≈øcredited tho≈øe declarations, as the Memory of tho≈øe that have been awake cannot forget, both Referring to Religion and Liberties and the Parliament Remon≈øtrances do amply ≈øet out, be≈øids other Books.

Where the danger is of much importance, both for Greatne≈ø≈øe of Mi≈øchiefe and Inevitablene≈ø≈øe according to Man, if not timely prevented; Charity to our≈øelves (and others) will not onely allow, but commend, and even command to ≈øu≈øpect and accordingly prevent, ≈øuch dangers by ≈øu≈øpecting Per≈øons and Actions which in le≈ø≈øer matters they would and might and ≈øhould venture to tru≈øt. Fire neere ≈øtraw or Gunpowder, is to be ≈øu≈øpected more then neere hard wood. Hedge-breakers and breakers of Hou≈øes are not equally to be ≈øu≈øpected. Religion<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Laws and Liberties are precious things and may be ≈øooner lo≈øt then recovered.

            <p n="3">3. In ≈øpeciall, for the ≈øufferance of ≈øo many Sects to vent their doctrins with ≈øuch liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to commit un≈øufferable out-rages upon the wor≈øhip of <hi>God.</hi> 1; Hath not the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> declared again≈øt <hi>Brownists, Anabapti≈øts</hi> in the fir≈øt Remon≈øtrance. 2. Have not ≈øome Sectaries bin puni≈øhed? as he that made the new Creed, was he not impri≈øoned? 3. How many ≈øcandalous and innovating Mini≈øters have bin complained of, and yet few of them que≈øtioned and tho≈øe not fully cen≈øured (≈øcarce one by both Hou≈øes) the Doctor will not lay to their charge the ≈øuffering of ≈øuch: which yet he may with more rea≈øon, as being offendors of longer continuance and more danger. 4. The truth is, partly the multitude of offendors at fir≈øt complained of, and partly for neare a yeare and an halfe of late, their owne extreame danger by the Malignant parties getting ≈øtrength, ≈øince the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh rebellion</hi> broke out, and ≈øo multitude of bu≈øine≈ø≈øes over-whelming them, have hindred that Ju≈øtice, which el≈øe tho≈øe Sects and out-rages (the Doctor mentions) would have found, and may yet in due time, if legally proved. 5. And if he will ≈øay. ≈øome ≈øpeciall men favoured them in the very Hou≈øes, he cannot ≈øay more then may be made good of others favouring <hi>Super≈øtitions, Arminiani≈øme, Sociani≈øme,</hi> and even Popery it ≈øelfe, Yet this were mo≈øt unju≈øtly charged upon the Body of either Hou≈øe, and much le≈ø≈øe on both. And when it ≈øhall plea≈øe <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>the Con≈øultation of Divines</hi> ≈øhall meet (for which they have more then once pa≈ø≈øed the Bill for his Maje≈øty to confirm) it will I doubt not appeare to all the world, that they never ment to ≈øuffer any ≈øuch opinions or practi≈øes, as are truly di≈øhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the true <hi>Reformed Prote≈øtant Religion</hi>: as even in the mean time, the <hi>Orthodoxi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi> and <hi>Moderation</hi> of the <hi>Members</hi> of that <hi>A≈ø≈øembly</hi> (generally) known to all that know the per≈øons, may be a ≈øufficient pledge; among them all, there being very few, that are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any pretence of exception for Sects; and perhaps none at all, for countenancing any ≈øuch out-rage, as the Doctor cryes out upon. 6. In fine, the wor≈øt of the <hi>Parliament</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:39617:42"/>
(charged upon them with any ≈øhadow) in matter of Religion is but omi≈ø≈øions or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, which are but Moats to the beames which the Doctor overlooks in their Adver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of old and ≈øtill. Who have made ≈øtables of Churches, but they? Who have burned and troden under foot Bibles, but their <hi>Parti≈øans</hi> of <hi>Ireland?</hi> Not to in≈øi≈øt on their horrid bla≈øphemies (which if <hi>Gods</hi> word be true, as they will one day find it) makes our Land groane and mourne under them. If a con≈øcience comes to weigh the≈øe in the ballance with the Parliament; let it, if it dare, be charitable to the Cavaliers and their Army, ≈øo as to believe, Religion is like to be defended by them, when the Parliament intends to ruine it. I will ≈øay no more to the Doctor but this one thing, that a ≈øober con≈øcience that peru≈øes his whole Treati≈øe, will wonder what kind of con≈øcience his is, that Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torizes ≈øo for charity on the one ≈øide, and wholly neglects it on the other; telling us more then once, that though we lay downe our lives for our Religion, it is nothing, if we have not the charity he cals, While him≈øelfe with all confidence, charges the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> with many grievous faults again≈øt Religion, Allegiance, Lawes and Liberties, and Liberties, and di≈øcredits all their Prote≈øtations and Declarations to the contrary, as if he thought, that as his great Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. ≈øpeaks only in his conceit of Monarchs; ≈øo 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 13. related al≈øo to them only. No re≈øi≈øting that higher power, but all charity to him, what ever he doe or ≈øay. But as for the <hi>Parliament,</hi> their power is of no regard, They may be re≈øi≈øted at plea≈øure, and their words and actions de≈øerving no charity, or challenging none. Con≈øciences will judge (and may without breach of charity) how charitable or true the≈øe interpretations and imputations be. And ≈øo I have done with him.</p>
            <p>If any other now aske me, why it is not as fitting ea≈øie to put off all imputations from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and lay it upon a Faction there (as the Declarations in the Kings Name u≈øe to doe) as it is for the <hi>Parliament</hi> to put off all from the King to his Councellours and Followers. I an≈øwer in a word, the Law commands the one, and Rea≈øon gives a faire ground for it. The King is but one; and ≈øo if tho≈øe about him, fill his head with ≈øtrange Doctrines in Religion, and Maximes or interpretations of law, and with ≈øtrange relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in matters of Fact, and an≈øwerable ≈øugge≈øtions, unles he were a Prophet or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, he can hardly avoid fal≈øe opinions and errours in government. Him≈øelfe tels us in the fore-cited an≈øwer to the 19 Propo≈øitions, of ≈øurreptiou≈øly-gotten commands from a King, by followers and favourites again≈øt the Law, which he is bound to protect when he knowes it. Therfore according to our Law, <hi>The King may be mi≈ø-informed, but hee cannot be mi≈øtaken, and the King can doe no wrong, becau≈øe it ≈øuppo≈øes hee doth nothing but by Advi≈øe of his Councellours in matters of State, and Judges in matters of law.</hi> Therfore he grants the Commons may impeach ≈øuch Favourites and Followers of his, and then the Lords are to judge and puni≈øh them. Would this have bin ≈øuffered, or would it yet, the <hi>Parliament</hi> and he would ≈øoon accord. But they get him to let them lay all upon him, which them≈øelves ≈øay and doe; and this hazards our undoing. We would not charge or di≈øtru≈øt the King: We dare not, mu≈øt not (unle≈ø≈øe we meane to be ruined) tru≈øt or di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his Councellours. But we hope and pray that <hi>God</hi> will ble≈ø≈øe him ≈øo at la≈øt, as that tho≈øe being <hi>taken away from before him</hi> (or rather being yeelded up by him) <hi>as dro≈ø≈øe from the ≈øilver, his Throne ≈øhall be e≈øtabli≈øhed in righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe,</hi> Maje≈øty and Honour. Meane time we proclaime, they injury him, and us, and the law, that interpret what is ≈øaid or done again≈øt the multitude of his Followers and Army, or any of them, though ≈øheltred by his Name and Pre≈øence, as done again≈øt him. On the contrary ≈øide, the <hi>Parliament</hi> is a numerous Body, where each one Votes ≈øingle, and it mu≈øt be a <hi>Maior</hi> part that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries any thing; and there is no other ≈øence of a <hi>Parliament</hi> in Law and Rea≈øon, then the <hi>maior</hi> part at lea≈øt: Therfore the Votes, and Orders, and Declarations that come (as all

I conclude then, a King may be charitably believe to meane well, as he prote≈øts, only to be mi≈ø-informed and abu≈øed by wicked Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. But the <hi>Parliament</hi> cannot be (is not) well thought of by charity it ≈øelf in it's high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt perfection, if the <hi>maior</hi> part vote and act evill things. The <hi>Parliament</hi> is then the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor before <hi>God</hi> and man.</p>
            <p>For conclu≈øion of all. Let me adde 5 or 6 Qualifications or Cautions upon the whole matter. 1. All Governours, Supreme ≈øpecially, have ≈øomewhat of Prerogative, beyond written or expre≈ø≈øe Lawes. But this to be u≈øed for the Subjects good not hurt. 2. A Chri≈øtian, though able and innocent, is not to re≈øi≈øt all injuries, done to him in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtate or per≈øon, no not by private per≈øons, much le≈ø≈øe if done by the command of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, ≈øpecially of the Supreme. Chri≈øtian meeknes requires the one, and Chri≈øtian ≈øubjection the other. 3. An open and publike re≈øi≈øtance by armes, is the la≈øt Refuge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven, of an oppre≈ø≈øed, and endangered Nation. Many injuries are to be let pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> while appearing but per≈øonall, not politicall, or de≈øigned as pre≈øidents. Jealou≈øies are not to be ≈øuddenly taken up, nor too deeply taken in: And all po≈ø≈øible meanes of redre≈ø≈øe and ≈øatisfaction is to be endeavoured before this cour≈øe be taken. 4. If Lawes doe inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they mu≈øt not be re≈øi≈øted, unles they command undeniably again≈øt <hi>God,</hi> and not only ≈øo, but threaten extreame extremity. 5. What≈øoever injury happens to be done to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent per≈øons, is to be recompenced as ≈øpeedily and fully as may be. 6. A Peace is to be imbraced, de≈øired, pur≈øued with all faithfullne≈ø≈øe; ≈øo it may be but rationally ≈øafe<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and not betray to the mi≈øery, which war was undertaken to prevent or remedy. 7. The Nation (and Parliament) that is put to this nece≈ø≈øity of a warr mu≈øt acknowledge <hi>God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which the Lord of Ho≈øts and God of Peace, may doe for us (as He will for all His.) I ≈øhut up all with that Prayer and Prophe≈øie, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 125.4, 5. <hi>Do good O Lord to tho≈øe that be good: and to them that are upright in their hearts. As for ≈øuch as turne a≈øide to their crooked wayes, the</hi> Lord <hi>≈øhall leade them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace ≈øhall be upon</hi> I≈ørael. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
