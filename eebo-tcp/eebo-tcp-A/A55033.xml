         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SECT. I. The Question rightly ſtated.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Queſtion which the Doctor hath propounded, as neceſſary to be ſcanned is thus expreſt [<hi>Whether if any King will not diſcharge his Truſt, but is bent or ſeduced to ſubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties, Subjects may take up Armes and Reſiſt?</hi>] He maintaines the negative, and his principall place of ſtrength is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Whoſoever reſists ſhall receive to themſelves dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> This he interprets of reſiſting the higher power, mentioned <hi>ver.</hi> 1. by which he underſtands the King or Supreame; and the reſiſting, a reſiſting by Armes. But it ſeemes to me, however he make a ſhew of diſtinct handling his matter, that he either careleſly, or ſophiſtically confounds things, which ought to have been more diſtinctly expreſt by one that truly deſired to have reſolved conſciences in ſo weighty a cauſe, as forbearing to defend Religion, Laws and Liberties, when they are all in danger of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. To which purpoſe, I ſhall make bold to propound divers conſiderations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a better clearing of the true ſtate of the queſtion; and the ſtrength of his proofes for it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It cannot be imagined that a King, who is bent, or ſeduced to ſubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties, meanes to doe this by a meere perſonall ſtrength; (For which no <hi>Sampſon</hi>-like ſtrength would ſuffice) but by the aſſiſtance of others, whether men in office, and truſted with the civill Sword under him, if he can draw them into his deſigne, or by the ſouldiery ordinary or extraordinary; and that not in one part of the Kingdome, but in ſeverall parts, as faſt as he can get inſtruments for his turn.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here then will come divers queſtions belonging to the caſe. 1. Whether the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting by Armes, the illegall attempts of an under Officer of Juſtice; ſuppoſe a Major or Sheriffe, though armed with Commiſſion under the Kings hand or ſeale, be a reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the higher power and damnable. 2. Whether the reſiſting a Captaine of the Souldiery, comming to act any illegall commands with his bands of armed men, though he alſo have a like Commiſſion from the King; be a reſiſting of the King, and ſo forbidden? Both theſe where the King is not preſent, but in another part of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It will be further queſtioned (in caſe he ſhould grant reſiſtance lawfull thus farr) whether it be lawfull to reſiſt the officers or ſouldiers of the King, he being beſides them, and animating them with his commands to doe violence? I will ſuppoſe for the preſent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:39617:4"/>
the Kings perſon is and ſhall be ſafe, notwithſtanding the reſiſtance, or that els the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance muſt be forborne. I onely aske, whether his followers commanded by him, ſtanding by to doe murthers and rapes may be reſiſted with armes or not.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If he will ſay that in all theſe caſes reſiſtance may be made; ſo the Kings Perſon may be ſafe. 1. The King may thanke him for the care of his Perſon, but his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority is as much impugned by this, as by many that plead for the defence now actually under-taken. 2. The Cavaliers and Followers of the King will thanke him never a whit; For they may all be knocked on the head or ſtarved, and yet the Kings Perſon be ſafe. And they would ſoon deſert the cauſe, if this were beleeved, or would be rooted-out, if this were generally practiſed; and that is all the Defendants deſire, who honour the Kings Perſon and authority, as much as the Doctor or any of his fellows, not to ſay more; how ever they reſiſt his Cavaliers.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If he will deny reſiſtance where the King is preſent, becauſe there his commands are certainly knowne to be his, which may be doubted of in remote Countries. Then, 1. So ſhould it have been expreſt for cleare underſtanding, and not coucht in uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 2. Then all theſe Cavaliers are juſtly reſiſted where the King is not preſent, which againe if it were believed and practiſed would ſoone end the buſineſſe; For even in the next Pariſh to the King, they might be reſiſted, though not where he appeares and ſpeakes. 3. What if it be doubted whether the King be not forced by threatnings and feare of his life to command ſo and ſo. Kings have been priſoners, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſo, and by wiſe and good Subjects, Caſtles and Townes have bin kept by force of Armes againſt ſuch as they bad to aſſault it, if not yeelded. Our Law ſuppoſes, <hi>The King can doe no wrong,</hi> yet ſuppoſes wrong may be done in his name by his followers; If he then command a notoriouſly wicked thing: The Law will ſuppoſe him forced or the like; And then reſiſtance ſhall be as well lawfull, as if he were abſent. Or even neceſſary to reſcue him out of ſuch wicked hands. 4. What if it be doubted, whether a King be bewitched by ſorceries? There have bin ſuch things of old, and the Devills power doth not ſeeme to be leſſned now? 5. What if it be doubted, whether the King be diſtracted? A thing that hath befallen Kings as well as meane men? Are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects bound from reſiſting the commands of a bewitched or diſtracted Perſon to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of Religion, Lawes, and liberties? ſtill preſerving his perſon ſafe. 6. Suppoſe it be certaine he is not forced, nor bewitched, nor diſtracted: Yet doing as bad as any forced, bewitched or diſtracted perſon can poſſibly doe, by commanding ſuch tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Acts, what reaſon can be imagined, why ſuch a command ſhould tie ſubjects hands from reſiſting his followers, offering to act his tyranny, more then if he were forced, bewitched or diſtracted? Is the liberty of his body and mind from thoſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, an enſlaving of his people to his lawleſſe luſts of crueltie and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe?</p>
            <p n="6">6. If he ſay further, that even his officers or ſouldiers, if they have his Seale or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant may not be reſiſted in the remoteſt Country. Then beſides the former inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, theſe are to be added. 1. Any that come among ignorant common people may abuſe them at their pleaſure, if they will but pretend the Kings Seale or Warrant. It hath bin counterfeited for Briefes: How ordinary would it be, if it might not be reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted? How would malicious men murther with it? Robbers ſpoyle with it, and who could remedy it? 2. By this meanes any that had a deſigne to depoſe the King and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe the Kingdome, might by a counterfeit Seale and Warrant, kill all the Kings faithfulleſt Subjects, and ſtrengthen ſo himſelfe and his party, as the King ſhould after have no power to ſave himſelfe. Lawes obſerved will ſecure ſufficiently from this. And
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39617:4"/>
liberty to reſiſt illegall violences will appeare to be neceſſary to the Kings ſafety, as well as the Subjects. Kings have ſeldome or never bin murthered or depoſed, where Lawes have bin preſerved in their vigour: But often where illegall violences have had place. Let this alſo not be forgotten.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Well but thus the caſe I ſuppoſe is underſtood (if not by the Doctor, yet) by the generall of thoſe that take the Kings part againſt the Parliament, that neither the King in Perſon, nor any of his officers or ſouldiers, that have commiſſion from him may be reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, becauſe that were to reſiſt the King, which ſay they all, the Apoſtle forbids and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. But here again I blame the Doctors negligent handling of that place up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divers conſiderations further.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Without doubt the firſt verſe is to be regarded, as being the foundation of the ſecond, as appeares by the word [<hi>Therefore</hi>] Yet that he hath greatly neglected. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for feare the ſcanning of it would doe him an ill turne, as I ſhall by and by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſhew, by comparing the ſubjection commanded with the reſiſtance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the firſt <hi>verſe</hi> he doth very ill to reade alwayes (except once by chance, as I thinke) <hi>higher power</hi> for <hi>higher powers,</hi> and ſo never to tell us whether the other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (who are higher in relation to the common-people, though inferiour in relation to the ſupreme) S. <hi>Peters</hi> governours may be reſiſted or not? even with Arms. Perhaps this fraudulently alſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the ſecond <hi>verſe,</hi> he is very careleſſe to tell us, whether reſiſtance (which is three times in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but there are two Greeke words, the firſt being different from the ſecond and third) ſignifie all kind of oppoſition, though without Armes, to the higher and ſupreme power at leaſt, but then much more with Arms? Or whether it only ſignifie reſiſting with Armes, and no other there forbidden, and made damnable. Yet this a needfull Queſtion, for a conſcience to be reſolved in, and more ordinarily then about reſiſting. And ſo would well have become the Doctors learning and pretended care of Conſcience, and even regard of Authority to have diſcourſed upon. But ſince he hath not vouchſafed to doe any of theſe, I ſhall take the paines to doe it for him, and for the conſcientious Readers, as well as I can.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt <hi>verſe</hi> begins, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Let every ſoule be ſubject to the higher Powers.</hi> Here are two queſtions. 1. What is meant by being <hi>ſubject.</hi> 2. What by <hi>higher Powers.</hi> By being ſubject is meant yeelding obedience, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther active or at leaſt paſſive, that is doing or forbearing acccording to command, or ſubmitting to ſuffering when one do's otherwiſe. It cannot be denied but both theſe are parts of ſubjection, and that ſo much is commanded by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> at leaſt in ſome caſes. But the ſecond Queſtion, What is ment by <hi>higher Powers,</hi> will cleare in what caſes either of theſe is required? By the higher powers then is meant all civill legall Authority, which in St. <hi>Peters</hi> phraſe is of the <hi>King as Supreame,</hi> or governour (for theſe are higher then the people, though lower then the King) but it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the word is in the abſtract powers, which notes the authority, wherwith the perſon in authority is legally inveſted, and not the perſon in the concrete, leaſt that might be underſtood of his perſonall commands without or beyond, or even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Authority. Which conceit the Apoſtle doth greatly prevent by uſing the word <hi>Power,</hi> which he doth alſo all the while he treats of this matter, except only that once he names Rulers, <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is to be obſerved that the things about which the authority, and ſo the ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39617:5"/>
in this place is converſant are civill matters, belonging to the ſecond Table between man and man. Not that I deny Magiſtrates to have Authority to command things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the firſt Table, and that ſubjection is due to them in ſuch commands concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Religion, ſo that it be according to the will of God. But I ſay, that this is to be fetcht from other Texts rather then this. My reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, of whom properly the Apoſtle ſpeakes, were ſo farre now from commanding things for Religion, that they commanded things againſt Religion, and the firſt Table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therfore certainly the active ſubjection at leaſt here required is limited to civill matters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And now that ſo much as I have ſaid is required, active Obedience to legall, civill Authority to all Magiſtrates in their legall commands in civill matters; or at leaſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive yeelding to the penalty of the Laws, in caſe of not obeying actively; and neither further then to legall commands of legall Authority, appeares by the Apoſtles reaſon in this 1. <hi>verſe. For there is no power but of God</hi>; which he redoubles in a ſecond phraſe, <hi>The powers that be are ordained of God, or under God</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Every ſoule muſt be under their order, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, becauſe they all are ordered by God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, his deputies and vicegerents in their order and degree, higher and higheſt. This is true of all powers, and therefore to all muſt ſubjection be performed. And to none hath God ordered or ordained any Authority but legall. Which as none will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (no not the Doctor himſelfe) of other Governours beſides the ſupreme: So can none with reaſon affirme, that any hath more authority then the Laws, whether ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or generall, written or unwritten, have allotted them. Which Lawes God ratifies (being not againſt his) and ſo the Authority according to them. And this our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor alſo confeſſes (in ſence) in m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re places then one of his Booke, for active Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that no more is due, but according to the Lawes of God, and the eſtabliſht laws of the Land. Only he argues for paſſive obedience beyond this, every where. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he argues againſt reſiſtance even of Tyranny. But in a word to refute this from the Apoſtles reaſon in the firſt verſe. If I be bound to be ſubject to tyranny, (or to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer violence of a tyrant) by vertue of the commandement here. Then tyranny is the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, or Magiſtrates have power ordained of God to uſe tyrannous violence (for thus the Apoſtle argues for ſubjection from Gods ordaining the power) But this is falſe. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo is that, that I ſhould be bound to ſuffer tyrannous vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>And now if this be the true and whole meaning of the precept in the firſt verſe, It will not be hard to cleare the meaning of the prohibition and threatning in the ſecond verſe, which runnes thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Whoſoever therefore reſiſts</hi> (or carries himſelfe diſorderly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the power, or oppoſes) <hi>the power, reſiſts</hi> or ſets himſelfe <hi>againſt the Ordinance</hi> (or order appointed) of <hi>God, and they that reſist</hi> (or ſo ſet themſelves againſt man and God both) <hi>ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation.</hi> Now here we are to reſolve two Queſtions. 1. What reſiſtance is? 2. Who (or what) may not be reſiſted? 1. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance is contrary to ſubjection, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and this alſo the word [<hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>] notes. For it ſhews that the ſin of Reſiſtance is a tranſgreſſion of the duty of ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. It is then two-fold, either in not obeying commands, or in not ſuffering penalties. He that is wilfully, and obſtinately diſobedient to ſome commands, is (by the Apoſtles ſcope, and by the conſent of all interpretours that handle it fully) a Reſiſter, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, though he never offer to take up Armes, but yeelds to ſuffer any penalty. A man that refuſes to anſwer at the Law, he ſhall be outlawed; he that refuſes to yeeld poſſeſſion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39617:5"/>
ſhall have a Writ of Rebellion out againſt him; he that refuſes to put himſelfe upon a legall tryall at his arraignement, ſhall be preſſed to death, as a moſt obſtinate reſiſter of authority, and ſo in many other caſes. Or ſecondly, Reſiſting is in not ſuffering penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, reſiſting by force, and even by Armes. This is one kind of reſiſting, and the worſt kind againſt a lawfull power: but what it is, our ſecond Queſtion is to determine; which againe breakes it ſelfe into two. What is the power that may not be reſiſted? and who? In both, the former verſe may, and muſt guide us, as the word power repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the conjunction, <hi>therefore,</hi> and the mention of Gods Ordinance the third time aſſures us. 1. Then what is the power that may not be reſiſted? The legall authority of the Magiſtrate, or the Magiſtrate legally commanding according to his authority. For as the ſubjection reaches to this, and no further. So the ſinfull reſiſtance extends to this, and is by it limited: becauſe Gods Ordinance hath confirmed all this, and no more. Only upon the change of the phr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe, and not ſaying he that is not ſubject, but he that reſiſts, the Spirit of God ſeemes to favour in ſome caſes a ſimple not obeying, and will not charge that with reſiſting Gods Ordinance; Namely in ſuch Laws as being of an inferiour nature, may be generally good to be made and kept. Yet to ſome perſons in ſome caſes ſo extremely inconvenient as the penalty according to man is much rather to be ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſen, then the practiſe of that Law in that caſe. Now in ſuch a caſe (as our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines generally uſe to ſay, that obedience may be forborne to many civill Laws, <hi>Extra caſum ſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndali</hi>) the Holy Ghoſt ſeemes to favour (I ſay) the not obeying, and only charges guilt upon a not ſubmitting to the penalty which is undeniable reſiſting: But I ſay againe, that by all the foregoing context, and the reaſon from Gods Ordinance in the ſecond <hi>verſe:</hi> The prohibition of blaming of reſiſtance, go's no further, then, of legall commands of legall authority. The Doctor will not (doth not) ſay that the moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory, or obſtinate refuſing to obey actively tyrannous and illegall commands is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. By what authority then of the Text or context will he ſtretch the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to refuſing to ſuffer tyrannous violence? Or how does any reſiſt unlawfully (though by Armes) when unlawfull violence is offered him? which God no where gave autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to uſe to him, nor ever commanded him to yeeld unto? In a word, till Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance can be prov'd allowing tyranny (which can never be) or undeniably ordaining a man to ſuffer it, which is no where in his word (I meane the extremity of tyranny de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving of life, or ſo) though often it is ſo in his providence, when he affords no meanes of reſiſtance: This Text of the Apoſtle will no way condemne the reſiſting by Armes tyrannous and illegall outragious violences. Beſides all that, the context following refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes this ſence of the Doctor, as I have already ſhewed.</p>
            <p>But let me not forget my ſecond Queſtion, or branch about reſiſtance. Who may not be reſiſted? The Text ſaith, <hi>The power,</hi> any Magiſtrate acting with lawfull authority legally. The D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. would reſtraine it to the ſupreame, becauſe he thinks it was hard to aſſert all Governours irreſiſtable though tyrannous. But I ſay, interpreting reſiſtance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>right, as before; and ſo the Governour or Magiſtrate may be no more reſiſted, then a Monarch. And the King is reſiſted in reſiſting the meaneſt Officer. Even high Treaſon may be committed in taking up Armes with ſome circumſtances againſt a Magiſtrate, who is not Supreme. The Laws cannot be obeyed, but by obeying other Governours in the Kings abſence (who cannot be every where) and ſo obſtinate diſobedience, which is reſiſtance; may be, when only a petty Officer, or Magiſtrate is preſent; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands according to Law. Contrarily in the Doctors interpretation, reſiſtance is not forbidden, neither with reference to the leſſer Magiſtrate, nor to the Supreame as hath beene ſhewed. And if it were forbidden to reſiſt with Armes a tyrannous King; of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39617:6"/>
neceſſity (as hath been ſhewed) this would extend to forbid reſiſtance of any that he imployes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n his tyranny. Or elſe all the diſpate about it would ſoone be at an end, as was alſo noted. But if the Doctor ſay that he includes under the Supreame all that A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t his Will, and only denies that ſubordinate Magiſtrates are within the ſecurity of this prohibition of reſiſtance by Armes, if they be tyrannous without any command from the Supreame. I would have him ſhew me a ground of this diſtinction upon a Text of Scripture, (which ſpeaking before of all powers, names, the power indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely) a ground I ſay out of Scripture, which himſelfe requires in the beginning of his ſecond Section, or religious reaſon, or elſe what conſcience ought to regard what he ſaith? If both Governours and Supreme be to be acknowledged Gods Ordinance, and both to be ſubjected to for that cauſe, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> here, for the Lords ſake (as S. <hi>Peter, Epheſ.</hi> 2.12.) then either both may be reſiſted by Arms if tyrannous; or neither? Let him now take his choice, and ſay what he will, If he ſaith only the Inferiour may be, then he looſes this Text, which matches them both equally. If he ſay neither may be; Then beſides all that hath been ſaid on the Text and context, I only adde this: That then every meaneſt Officer (if wicked) may ruine the whole neighbourhood, becauſe he may not be reſiſted by Armes, who yet will bring Armes to act his villanies. And ſo the bleſſed Ordinance of God in Magiſtracy ſhall turne to the greateſt curſe to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind (the beſt and moſt conſcientious of them) that can be imagined, in regard of outward ſufferings, and generall confuſion. It remaines therefore that as the Apoſtle in the following verſes, baniſhes tyranny out of the context, deſcribing every where a righteous Magiſtrate, and not a tyrant: So tyranny is to be baniſht out of the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this Text, which allowes him that is a tyrant, no ſecurity, that he ſhall be endured, and not reſiſted even with Armes. Though it doth (and that moſt juſtly and neceſſarily) ſecure a juſt ruling Prince or Magiſtrate from all reſiſtance, even when he puniſhes moſt ſeverely according to Law and juſtice, upon the heavieſt guilt of being found reſiſters againſt God (that reſiſt ſuch a rule) and the heavieſt penalty of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

            <head>SECT. II. Having clearely ſtated the Queſtion, I proceed with the Doctor to his ſecond Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, To examine how he maintaines his Negative, That a Magiſtrate may in no caſe be reſisted; or as he expreſſeth himſelfe, That Conſcience cannot find cleare ground to reſt upon for making reſiſtance.</head>
            <p>HIs principall place of ſtrength whereon he truſts, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Whoſoever reſiſts ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.</hi> To which he doth every where referre.</p>
            <p>Though (which I wonder at in a Scholler of his acuteneſſe) without ever offering to Analyſe the Verſe, or thoſe before and after; which would have afforded ſtrength and cleareneſſe to his cauſe, if there be any to be found for it there.</p>
            <p>Therefore my firſt worke muſt be to doe that, namely to expound Analytically (but as briefly as may be) ſo much of the Chapter as concernes ſubjection to Magiſtrates; and then Conſcience ſhall judge, whether he hath urged it rightly to the Apoſtles ſcope.</p>
            <p>The ſcope of the Apoſtle (I make bold to ſay) is properly and meerely in this place to urge Chriſtians to be obedient to the Civill Lawes of the Roman Empire and ſo of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39617:6"/>
other States, between man and man, and to the Magiſtrates that had authority and ruled according to thoſe Lawes of what degree ſoever their authority was.</p>
            <p>To this end, 1. He delivers the precept generally in the former part of the 1. Verſe, in which are three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The duty, <hi>Subjection,</hi> which is either Active obedience, or Paſſive ſubmiſſion in caſe of not obeying.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Subject, <hi>Every ſoule,</hi> All Chriſtians of what Ranke, Sex, Age, Condition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Object, in the Abſtract, which notes the Legall authority, the <hi>higher powers,</hi> in the plurall number, which our Doctor is pleaſed to take no notice at all of, but only and every where reads it, the <hi>higher power,</hi> as if it only pointed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and ſo now to our King.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He produces a reaſon for the precept, from Gods authorizing Magiſtrates and their Lawes, and this is delivered in a double expreſſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of Negation, that any Magiſtrate can be Named which is not of Gods authorizing, <hi>There is no power but of God,</hi> which undeniably confirmes my expoſition of the Plurall number, <hi>powers,</hi> to note all ſorts and degrees of Magiſtrates, as doth alſo, that he repeates it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By way of Affirmation, <hi>the powers that be are ordained of God,</hi> or <hi>under God</hi>; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (as the Dr. notes) which as it ſpeakes of all ſorts of Powers, ſo it adds both a further Amplification and urging Reaſon, and a tacite limitation of the ſubjection. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, they are Gods vicegerents, and Deputies; by him, ordered to governe under him, and therefore to be ſubmitted unto by vertue of his Soveraigne authority, who is abſolutely and undeniably the higheſt power, and Lord over all.</p>
            <p>The Limitation is, that it muſt be only in thoſe things wherein thoſe powers oppoſe not him, under whom they are and from whom they have their authority, and it is certaine he gives them none to oppoſe him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. Thirdly, He urges the precept, by an Applicatory inference, from the Reaſon premiſed, denoting the ſinne of denying ſubjection; <hi>Whoſoever therefore reſiſts the power reſiſts the Ordinance of God.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Wherein note, the Apoſtle hath altered his firſt word; and inſtead of a Negative, which one might have expected, puts now in an Affirmitive (<hi>Not whoſoever is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but whoſoever reſiſts</hi>) wherein he ſeemes to favour (at leaſt in ſome caſes) the Expoſition noted before of ſubjection, and the diſtinction of Active and Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to humane Lawes; and ſo will not alwayes charge diſobedience upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience or ſoule of a Chriſtian, for the omiſſion, or doing contrary to a humane Law; But only in caſe of reſiſtance, (that he will neither doe nor ſuffer) for then he is guilty of reſiſtance of the Ordinance of the authority of God, by and under which theſe Lawes were made and are urged.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He urges it againe by a threatning of Gods diſpleaſure againſt ſuch, infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the ſinne of their reſiſtance. <hi>And they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word is <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But if the reſiſtance be obſtinate, and a wilfull perſiſting in it, I doubt not, but the full ſenſe of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Damnation,</hi> belongs to ſuch reſiſting, and reſiſters of Lawes even hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane (which are not oppoſite to Gods) and reſiſters of Magiſtrates urging obedience according to thoſe Lawes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. Fiftly, By the preſent and continued benefit of ſuch authority and Magiſtracy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:39617:7"/>
and Lawes. Which is delivered againe both negatively and affirmitively. <hi>For Rulers are not a terrour to good works but to evill.</hi>] wherin he both prevents an Objection, and aſſerts an advantage.</p>
            <p>He prevents the Objection (that this authority was a wrong to our liberty) which he denies, ſo long as our liberty is only uſed to doe well, and practice good works.</p>
            <p>And on the other ſide, there was an advantage to thoſe that did well; becauſe evill works were terrified by Rulers.</p>
            <p>Where alſo note, that he hath changed the Abſtract, <hi>Powers,</hi> into the Concret, <hi>Rulers,</hi> to imply, that ſubjection is due and reſiſtance forbidden, no farther to Rulers (or no longer for the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, then they exerciſe their lawfull power, and are not a terrour to good works but to evill; For their power makes them not (nor allowes them) to be a terrour to good works.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, He urges it by a ſecond Application of the benefit, and ſecuring from feare of danger if men will obey.— <hi>Wilt not thou then be afraid of the power? Doe well and thou ſhalt have praiſe,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>Where againe he repeats the word <hi>Power</hi> (as preventing an Objection, That Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers might abuſe their power.) Noting, that he ſtill meanes of the power rightly uſed, according to the nature of it; whence will come praiſe to them that doe well, according to the Lawes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. Seventhly, By a Confirmation of the Application: From Gods end in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing Lawes and Magiſtrates, <hi>He is the Miniſter of God to thee for good.</hi>]</p>
            <p>It is for thy benefit, that God hath deputed Magiſtrates; where his authority is the fourth time mentioned, and thou art both againſt God and thy own good, if thou yeild not obedience Active, or at leaſt Paſſive.</p>
            <p>Eightly, By a third Application of threatning againſt diſobedience, either Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or eſpecially Poſitive, which is reſiſting. <hi>He beares not the Sword in vaine,</hi> &amp;c.] Where is intimated, that he may puniſh even capitally ſome diſobediences and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And againe the fift time Gods authorizing him is aſſerted and applied, to this power of puniſhment. That he executes Gods wrath temporally; God is angry with diſobedience, and requires his Vicegerents to puniſh them, even by the Sword, if the offences merit it according to the Lawes, and ſo with other puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 4, 5. Ninethly, By a reinforcement of the Precept, under the terme of Neceſſity of Conſcience, which is but an Explication of the not reſiſting the Ordinance of God. Where alſo the Apoſtle prevents an Objection, as if he only had before adviſed them to obey or not reſiſt, to ſave themſelves from the Magiſtrates wrath; For it is Gods wrath alſo upon the Conſcience, and ſo the Conſcience is bound, though you could find a way to eſcape temporall wrath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>V.</hi> 6. Tenthly, It is urged by a Parallel of reſpect uſually paid to Magiſtrates, <hi>Tributes,</hi> the due whereof is alſo urged, becauſe Magiſtrates devote themſelves to the publick good, and ſo muſt be maintained upon the publick ſtock, and if maintained, then much more obeyed and ſubjection yeilded to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver.</hi> 7.11. Finally by an univerſall requiring, to yeeld to all their dues, where he aſſerts, that he requires no other ſubjection, and ſo forbids no other reſiſtance, then what the Law requires as due, or forbids as undue: becauſe obedience Active or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive was due by the Laws.</p>
            <p>This is in ſumme the Apoſtles ſcope and Argumentation.</p>
            <p>And now let us more particularly conſider whither the clauſe, threatning reſiſtance with damnation (or ought elſe in the whole context) doe fight againſt ſuch reſiſtance
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39617:7"/>
as the Doctor oppugnes? or rather of the two may ſeeme to fight againſt him, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie ſuch reſiſtance if not otherwiſe vitiated.</p>
            <p>To which purpoſe let us proceed by theſe Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That whatſoever reſiſtance is here forbidden and threatned, relates to infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Magiſtrates as farre as their authority reaches according to laws, as well as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>I may no more reſiſt a Conſtable commanding me, or arreſting me, or diſtraining my goods according to Law, then I may doe the King commanding me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet the Doctor takes no notice of this at all. But as if it were, not only the <hi>higher power,</hi> in the ſingular number, but the Higheſt in the Superlative degree; He reſtraines all to the King, which is a dangerous fallacy, not only in the preſent Queſtion, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all government.</p>
            <p>To which I adde, to refuſe to be ſubject to the <hi>Parliament</hi> according to Lawes, and to reſiſt is much more (by this Scripture) undeniably a reſiſting the ordinance of God, and brings damnation.</p>
            <p>And what then will he ſay to thoſe that have done ſo too, and againſt the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and thoſe ſent by their authority unqueſtionable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, That Prohibition of Reſiſtance cannot be meant here, which is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the Apoſtles reaſons following, which perſwade to Subjection and not Reſiſtance. Or that Aſſertion, or Interpretation, is not according to the Apoſtles ſcope, which is formally oppoſite to his Arguments afterward.</p>
            <p>But ſuch is the Doctors Interpretation and Aſſertion, <hi>Ergo,</hi> His Aſſertion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is, that Subjects may not reſiſt a Prince, who is bent to ſubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles Reaſons againſt Reſiſters are.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For Rulers are not a terrour to good workes, but to evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now is this a reaſon why I may not reſiſt ſuch a Tyrant?</p>
            <p>Who can be more a terrour to good workes, and not to evill then he that is bent to ſubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties? <hi>Ergo</hi> of ſuch a Reſiſtance of a tyrant the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeakes not. But of Reſiſtance of that Ruler, who go's altogether according to Lawes and Liberties, which is juſtly puniſhable with Damnation without Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond Reaſon or enforcement of the Apoſtles argument againſt Reſiſtance is, <hi>Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power. Doe that which is good and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame.</hi> Now doth this argue a Tyrant is not to be reſiſted? Is there no cauſe of feare of him (while a man do's that which is good) that is bent to ſubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties? Or ſhall a man have praiſe in doing good, of ſuch a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
            <p>Therefore is not a Tyrant that power which may not be reſiſted. But he that ſtands to the Lawes, and Rules according to them, Damnation is juſt againſt thoſe that reſiſt him without queſtion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, The Apoſtle proceeds, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>For he is the Miniſter of God to thee for good</hi> (and ſo not to be reſiſted without reſiſting the Ordinance of God, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring damnation) But is this true of a Tyrant bent to ſubvert Religion, Laws, and Liberties? Is he the Miniſter of God to thee for good? Or the Miniſter of his owne luſts rather, for evill? Reſiſtance of ſuch an one then, is not the Reſiſtance the Apoſtle forbids, but of one who is the conſervatour of Religion, for he, and he only is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God to thee for good, and worthy is he of Damnation that reſiſts ſuch an one.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:39617:8"/>4. The Apoſtle adds, <hi>If thou doe that which is evill feare, for he beareth not the Sword in vaine: For he is the Miniſter of God, a Revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is this man a Tyrant, bent to ſubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties, or moſt dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly oppoſite to Tyranny.</p>
            <p>A Tyrant ſecures thoſe that do evil (ſo they will joyn with him and ſerve him in his Tyranny) from feare. And he beares the Sword, not only in vaine, in reference to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good end intended by Gods ordinance, but altogether contrary to it; and is ſo farr from being the Miniſter of God, that he is (as before) a Miniſter of his owne luſts, to ſhelter thoſe that doe evill, and to purſue with all wrath, and revenge him that doth good, and will not be a ſlave to his lawles deſignes and deſires. Still then of ſuch a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant S. <hi>Paul</hi> argues, not that he may not be reſiſted: but him that he deſcribes, which is a juſt Governour, and ſo upon no terms to be reſiſted.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Upon all this the Apoſtle reſumes: <hi>Wherefore you must of neceſſity be ſubject, not only for wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What rules of conſcience (before laid, inferr'd now by the word, <hi>wherefore</hi>) urge ſuch an Aſinine or ſtupid ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ject, as to be ſubject even paſſively, and not to reſiſt one that is bent to ſubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties, when all that went before ſpeake expreſly of another power and Rulers of another temper?</p>
            <p>A man then for feare of wrath, not being able to make good his Reſiſtance, may yeeld ſuch paſſive ſubjection, but ſure conſcience (at leaſt not in this place) urges him not to it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Yet the Apoſtle goes-on: <hi>For this cauſe alſo pay you Tribute, for they are Gods Miniſters continually attending on this very thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what cauſe? Becauſe they may attempt to ſubvert Religion, Laws and Liberties? Doe we pay Tribute for this cauſe, that they plunder and change Lawes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or that they may defend them? Alſo upon what thing are they thus Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to attend continually? Is it to ſubvert Lawes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or to preſerve them? The Apoſtle then ſpeakes not of a Tyrant, but a juſt ruling Prince, and pitty but he ſhould be damn'd that reſiſts him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Finally, he concludes this matter with ſaying, <hi>Render to all their due.</hi> By what Law of God or man may a Tyrant ſubvert Religion, Laws and Liberties, or even be let alone in ſo doing.</p>
            <p>I am ſure the Apoſtle hath not expreſt any ſuch thing hitherto. It is <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> but the Doctours miſtake, though I confeſſe it hath beene many wiſe and good mens before him, that the Apoſtle forbids reſiſting ſuch a Tyrant, which as I ſaid above, all his Reaſons go rather quite contrary unto, as deſcribing the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Ruler that is to be ſubjected to, and not reſiſted, altogether croſſe to Tyranny, and his Interpretation and Aſſertion is altogether croſſe to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
            <p>Having ſet the underſtanding of the maine Text right, I come now to thoſe examples that are alleadged to proove, That it is lawfull to reſiſt in ſome caſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The example of the peoples reſiſting <hi>Sauls</hi> illegall and tyrannicall attempt to have put <hi>Jonathan</hi> to death without cauſe.</p>
            <p>If this were lawfull in them in a particular mans caſe (againſt whom alſo there was ſome ſeemig cauſe) How much more to reſiſt one that is bent to ſubvert Religion, Laws and Liberties, and ſo to take away the life of many at his own pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:39617:8"/>To this is anſwered, not, that it was unlawfull in the people to make this reſiſtance (which yet if he deny not, he plainly yeelds his cauſe in his firſt Propoſition, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. forbids not all Reſiſtance) but only that the people drew not into Armes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but being there at <hi>Sauls</hi> command did by a loving violence and importunity hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the execution of a particular and paſſionate unlawfull command.</p>
            <p>To this I reply.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it were lawfull now; what hinders but they might have come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to prevent ſuch a miſchiefe as <hi>Jonathans</hi> unjuſt Death? Sure <hi>Saul</hi> called them not together to reſiſt himſelfe in any thing. Neither did his calling them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fight againſt the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> authorize them to fight againſt him, if it were not lawfull of it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Our King call'd the Parliament together, yet he allowes not them to reſiſt upon that pretence, though they are undeniably, not the great Councell only, but the great Court of Judicature in the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>This peece then of his Anſwer is nothing but words and pretence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for his loving violence and importunity wherewith he would blanch their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Grant they ſhewed a love to <hi>Saul,</hi> becauſe <hi>Jonathan</hi> was <hi>Sauls</hi> ſonne. But had <hi>Saul</hi> counted him his Enemy, (as he did <hi>David</hi> afterward) It would have ſounded harſh violence, and out-ragious enough, and it was plainly a great deale be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a loving violence. For <hi>Saul</hi> ſwore his death, and they ſwore his life, that not a <hi>haire of him ſhould,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This was Reſiſtance then with an Oath, as it were, to make <hi>Saul</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworne.</p>
            <p>After this Example then our people may ſweare an <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> that not one of the Parliament ſhall be put to death (unleſſe prooved guilty according to Law) notwithſtanding any Proclamation of them to be Traitors, or condemning them to death illegally.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And thirdly, as it cannot be thought, but if <hi>Saul</hi> had further attempted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or any of his followers to aſſault <hi>Jonathan,</hi> the people would have actively reſiſted him and them even with armes in <hi>Jonathans</hi> defence.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Example is <hi>Davids</hi> reſiſting of <hi>Saul, ſc.</hi> by gathering a band of 600. men, and offering to have kept <hi>Keilah</hi> againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> but that God told him the <hi>Keilites</hi> would have betrayed him.</p>
            <p>That he ſin'd not in it appeares.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By his owne pleading his innocence even to God in his Prayers and Pſalmes, as farr as concern'd the buſines between him and <hi>Saul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Himſelf after this pleades it to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24 &amp; 26. and cals God to witnes that he had not tranſgreſt at all againſt him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God himſelfe diſcharged <hi>David</hi> from all notorious ſinne, excepting the matter of <hi>

            <p>Now had not his Reſiſtance been lawfull, it had been moſt notorious Rebellion and Treaſon.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, even our Doctor condemns it not, and therfore, all reſiſtance is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, much leſſe damnable, as he often thunders.</p>
            <p>But this Example ſticks with him, and therfore he makes a four-fold anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Davids</hi> guard that he had about him was only to ſecure his perſon againſt the cut-throats of <hi>Saul,</hi> if ſent to take away his life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:39617:9"/>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> But this could not have bin done without killing divers of them, if they had aſſaulted him, which had then bin no murther, but a juſt defence and execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. So farr himſelf grants lawfull.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But he ſayes it was a meer defence without any violence offer'd to <hi>Saul.</hi> Therfore he ſtill gave place as <hi>Saul</hi> purſued, and did no act of hoſtility to him, or any of his Army, when they were in his power, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> He was not ſtrong enough to encounter <hi>Saul</hi> in the field, who had divers thouſands (3000 mentioned 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>1.) againſt his 600. Wiſdom bids him fly as long as he could, rather then fight.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſcience forbids him to kill <hi>Saul</hi>: ſo I grant it doth any Subject, though having the King at any ſuch advantage. But that he hurt none of his followers, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. was again an act of wiſdome, and we need not goe to conſcience for a reaſon of it. He had only one man with him, <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> and had he offered to kill any of the Army, how ſoone might this in all likelihood have wakened the reſt, and ſo he had endangered his own life to little purpoſe. For he could not in probability have killed many, and what had that done to his cauſe and defence afterward.</p>
            <p>Yet alſo, I hold not that in cold blood, one or many that are upon the defenſive, may lawfully kill ſleeping enemies, or ſuch waking farther then appears, at leaſt in ſome ſort neceſſary, or much advantagious to the defence, and prejudiciall to the oppoſites. But if killing, as many as <hi>David</hi> could have kill'd that night, himſelfe and <hi>Abiſhai</hi> would have given hopes of ending <hi>Sauls</hi> purſuit of him, and have made peace; I doubt not, but he would and might have done it, as well as keep <hi>Keilah</hi> againſt him.</p>
            <p>But this intent of <hi>Davids</hi> is denied; For,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Doctor ſaith, It is only an uncertaine ſuppoſition, not fit to ground conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this great point of reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl:</hi> The Text declares it as certainly as may be, unleſſe it had ſaid ſo in undeniable termes.</p>
            <p>For, 1. <hi>David</hi> contents not himſelfe to aske God whether <hi>Saul</hi> would come down, but what the <hi>Keilites</hi> would doe.</p>
            <p>To what end that, but that he meant to ſtay, if they would ſtand to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When God anſwers him only about <hi>Sauls</hi> comming, he askes the ſecond time, which ſhewes clearly his mind ran upon ſtaying there.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When God told him they would betray him, the Text then ſaith, <hi>he and his men went whether they could goe,</hi> which ſhewes they were now diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their purpoſes and hopes of ſtaying there, and muſt now ſhift for themſelves where they could.</p>
            <p>When none of this will elude this example of <hi>Davids</hi> reſiſtance, the Dr. adds a fourth Anſwer which will ſtrike it dead.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To this and all other demeanours of <hi>David</hi> in his ſtanding out againſt <hi>Saul.</hi> We ſay his example was extraordinary; for he was <hi>deſigned</hi> and <hi>annointed</hi> by the <hi>Lord</hi> to ſucceed <hi>Saul</hi>: therfore he might uſe an extraordinary way for ſafe-guarding his perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl:</hi> But in theſe few words there ſeeme to be many errours and inconvenient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
            <p>Doth he not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> imitate thoſe that to illude <hi>Davids</hi> reaſon, why he durſt not kill <hi>Saul,</hi> Say <hi>Saul</hi> was extraordinarily <hi>annointed</hi> and <hi>deſigned King</hi> by God, and ſo upon him violent hands might not be laid, but this holds not for other Kings elective or ſucceſſive by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws.</p>
            <p>I do not for my part thinke their ſhift ſufficient, but beleeve it utterly unlawfull, even
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39617:9"/>
becauſe this is aſſerted by <hi>David</hi> (in reference to the office of <hi>Saul,</hi> as I believe) being written for our learning, to teach us how to carry our ſelvs towards all ſoveraign Princes.</p>
            <p>But I ſay if he wil elude <hi>Davids</hi> act of reſiſtance, he encourages them including his forbearance. Let him conſider it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is not what he ſpeaks of a ſucceſſour dangerous to his own Poſition? for if <hi>Davids</hi> right of ſucceſſion authorized him at all to reſiſt, may not a ſucceſſor plead the like autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if in danger, which yet he will not grant, unles he mean to overthrow his own aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It ſeemes to me a ſtrange way of anſwering Scripture examples (unles upon ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger neceſſity then any thing the Doctor hath alleadged, as will appeare by the ſcanning of all his Arguments and Texts againſt reſiſtance) that ſuch a thing was extraordinary, when no ſuch thing can be gathered out of the Text.</p>
            <p>I know many men have this faculty of interpreting, who yet will not ſuffer it againſt their owne aſſertions; but with me (except in undoubted failings or duties) The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rule holds good, <hi>Praxi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſanctorum eſt interpres Praeceptorum. David</hi> did thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Sauls</hi> violence, therfore this is not contrary to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but an Interpretation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due by the 5 t. Commandement.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is ſo farr from being good which the Doctor ſaith, that contrarily <hi>Davids</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ought rather to have ſtrengthned his faith; not to have uſed a way of defence; which in another had been (by the Doctors ſaying) rebellious and damnable.</p>
            <p>What a diſparagement is this to Faith, and even to Gods Honour, that his annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſhall be ſafeguarded for ſo long together only by a way, which in all others is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable? <hi>Credat Judaeus non ego. Davids</hi> Faith then and Gods Honour in his preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proves the meanes both lawfull and ordinary.</p>
            <p>And if ſo, then much more is it lawfull for many perſons, and moſt of all for a <hi>State-Repreſentative</hi> in this manner to defend themſelves and reſiſt.</p>
            <p>A third Example alleadged by the Doctor, is the <hi>Priests</hi> reſiſting the Kings attempt upon their office and Gods worſhip, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. And after thruſting him out of the <hi>Temple,</hi> when God had ſmitten him with <hi>Leproſie</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>I for my part put no great weight on the former. But their thruſting him out of the Temple is ſomewhat towards a hinderance even by force, of a Prince if he perſiſt to violate Gods undoubted ordinances, as it had been to have ſtaid in the Temple being le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous, added to the ſinne of his going in at all, and preſumption to offer Incenſe. But ſuch a caſe is hardly ſuppoſable among us.</p>
            <p>Only I adde, that I wonder the Doctor offers to ſay; God by ſmiting him with Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, diſcharged him of his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>The Story implyes no ſuch thing, but only that he dwelt in a ſeverall houſe, and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> his ſonne judged the people of the Land. The Law allowed not any to come neare to ſuch or touch them, and what they touched, without being uncleane, therfore he could not ſit in publike Judicature, but his ſonne did it for him, yet for all that he remained King till his death, and probably did give out divers Orders, which might be done by means of thoſe that muſt needs miniſter to him.</p>
            <p>But if the Doctor ſay right, may not an untoward Inference be made, that if a King ſhould attempt to violate Gods ordinance and worſhip in any thing, and God ſhould viſibly ſtrike him with ſome loathſome Judgement, this ſhould diſcharge him of his Kingdome, which is more then ever the Parliament ſaid, or ſo much as thought, as they call God to witneſſe.</p>
            <p>A fourth Example is <hi>Eliſha's</hi> ſhutting the doore againſt the Kings Meſſenger that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39617:10"/>
came to take away his head. This example the Doctor ſaith ſpeakes little.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> But as little as it ſpeakes it forces him to ſpeake that, which if he will ſtand to, I doe not much doubt, but I ſhall make any unpartiall man (perhaps even the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor himſelfe) to ſay his cauſe is loſt in reference to his firſt Propoſition.</p>
            <p>Heare his own words,</p>
            <p>
               <q>Let us thence take occaſion to ſay, that perſonall defence is lawfull againſt the ſudden and illegall attempts of ſuch, even of the King himſelfe, thus farre to ward his blows, to hold his hands, and the like.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Then is not all reſiſtance unlawfull and damnable, if againſt ſuddain, he may much more againſt deliberate intended illegall violence.</p>
            <p>And his diſtinction of perſonall defence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will not ſatisfie conſcience by his owne words in the beginning of this Section. If <hi>Ro.</hi> 13.2. be to be interpreted his way, becauſe every diſtinction and limit of any place in Scripture muſt have it's ground in Scripture. What ground hath this in Scripture in his way, either here or elſwhere, ſpecially when he will not allow the Parliament to beleeve any intention to take away any of their heads, notwithſtanding all words and preparations againſt them without the ſpirit of <hi>Eliſha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But heare him further,</p>
            <p>"Not to endanger his Perſon this, nor return blows; this is not lawfull he ſaith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> I am not willing to oppoſe him in theſe Aſſertions, though the caſe may be ſo hard, as a man muſt looſe his life, if he will meerly defend himſelfe, and in no ſort offend.</p>
            <p>But ſpecially a woman muſt looſe her chaſtity (in which caſe, and principally the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) let the Doctor anſwer what is to be done, and whether no blows may be returned.</p>
            <p>But that the Princes perſon may not be willingly aſſaulted, the ſpeech of <hi>David</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted is that which concludes me, and not at all the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>argument. He ſaith the whole common-wealth is concern'd in his perſon, and that a particular nature will yeeld to the univerſall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> But he argues fallaciouſly, the whole is concern'd ſomewhat in the Princes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but not ſo as that it periſhes, if he die or be kil'd. Which is often, and no harme, no viſible chang, but that he is miſſing. Wheras the yeelding of a particular nature to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, is to keep that from diſſolution &amp; periſhing, as the Naturaliſts ſay, &amp; no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>But that which follows is yet better. Thus he objects for us againſt himſelf [if this be drawn from perſonall Defence to the publike reſiſtance now uſed, as they uſually make the Argument thus: If the body naturall, then the body politicke may defend it ſelfe: If a private perſon, much more the whole State may, and they do but ſhut up the way againſt the King, that comes to deſtroy his Parliament, and take away their heads] then he anſwers two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the naturall body defends it ſelf againſt an outward force; but ſtrives not by a ſchiſme or contention within it ſelf. So may the body politick againſt an outward pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but not (as now) by one part of it ſet againſt the head, and another part of the ſame body, for that tends to the diſſolution of the Whole.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep:</hi> But by his leave he abuſes the ſimilitude between a naturall and a politick body; and perverts the ſtate both of the Queſtion and the example in hand, and withall runs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to more abſurdities then one in his own way, as I ſhall now ſhew him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The naturall body can do nothing but by the guidance of the head, that is of the ſoul reſiding in the head, and imploying the ſences and faculties placed in the head to that purpoſe. But a body politicke, is a company of reaſonable men, whoſe actions may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39617:10"/>
be divided from their politick head, and yet be rationall and regular, and when the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular politicke head is diſtracted, or while an Infant, it can and doth order it ſelf within him, and ſo it doth and muſt doe, when the politick head is bent to ſubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties, becauſe the ſubverſion of theſe, (and not the oppoſition or reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe that would ſubvert them) would be the diſſolution of the whole. But ſo would not be the very death of the politicke head, (though, as I ſaid before, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to attempt it) Whereas the death of the naturall head, is certainly the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole naturall body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the naturall body may defend it ſelfe againſt outward force, ſo againſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of any diſeaſe, or paine in any member of the body, even reſient in the very head, and ſo the hand may pull out a tooth, even for the painfullneſſe of it, though ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the head, and perhaps one eye for ſome diſeaſe, thereby to ſave the other; and lance and cut the fleſh, and even cut-off a limme, legg and arme, to ſtopp a Gangrene; yet is this no making of a ſchiſme, or unnaturall contention within it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He hath granted it to ſingle perſons; but denies it to the whole body, or a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi>: Then belike if ſix or twenty or a hundred ſingle perſons be aſſaulted illegally, by a like number of ſingle perſons (ſuppoſe in their ſeverall houſes in the ſame Towne) they may ſhut the doores and defend themſelves, and even any of them hold the very Kings hand and ward his blowes. But if they happen to be all in a body together in the market place, and be aſſaulted by ſuch a number, or a quarter ſo many, they muſt not offer to reſiſt, but let them cut all their throates, becauſe forſooth in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy politicke, one part muſt not be ſet againſt the head, and another part of the Whole.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He grants the body politicke may defend it ſelf againſt an outward force, but not (as now) one part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi>: Then belike if the King imploy <hi>Danes</hi> or <hi>Iriſh</hi> againſt the <hi>Parliament</hi> and Kingdome, they may reſiſt them (and is not the caſe ſo now, at leaſt in part) but not if he imploy only <hi>Engliſh-Cavaleers.</hi> Surely the mighty wits of the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who was condemned mainly for counſelling to bring in nine thouſand <hi>Iriſh</hi> to reduce this Kingdome, wanted our Doctor to have adviſed him to forbeare that deſigne, and only Arme <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and then the peoples hands and conſciences ſhould have been tyed from reſiſting by the Doctors and his fellow-Chaplaines Divinity, and muſt have yeelded Religion, Lawes and Liberties, and neckes too, for feare of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the whole politick body, by defence.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When the ſtate of the Queſtion by himſelfe ſet, is, when a Prince is bent to ſubvert Religion, Lawes, and Liberties. What diſſolution of the Whole can bee feared by defence and reſiſtance againſt ſuch intentions, worſe then that or ſo bad? While therefore he talkes of ſuch defence, tending to the diſſolution of the Whole, he perverts the Queſtion, or elſe forgets, that the ſubverting of Religion, Laws, and Liberties, cannot be accounted leſſe then a diſſolution of the whole politicke body.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I ſay therefore by an Argument <hi>à f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. He hath yet another Anſwer for us in theſe words, [Perſonall Defence may be without all offence, doth not ſtrike at the order and power that is over us, as generall reſiſtance by Armes doth, which cannot be without many unjuſt violences, and doth immediately ſtrike at that order which is the life of the Common-wealth. And this makes a large difference 'twixt <hi>Eliſha's</hi> ſhutting the doore againſt this Meſſenger, and their ſhutting-up the way againſt the King by armed men.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl</hi>: 1. If ſome perſonall defence may be without all offence, yet not all. And he at leaſt ſeems to have yeelded all perſonall defence lawfull, ſo the Kings perſon may not be violated.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whoſe fault it is originally, that generall reſiſtance by Armes, cannot be without offence? Are the Plunderers not in fault; but the defenders muſt be counted guilty? And whoſe hand is it that ſtrikes immediately at the order, which is the life (as he ſaith) of the Common-wealth? The defendants of Religion, Laws, and Liberties? Or theirs who intend and attempt to ſubvert them all?</p>
            <p n="3">3. How doth perſonall Defence, if offenſive to the Meſſengers aſſaulting, ſtrike leſſe at the power over us, then generall or common defence doth? Or rather neither doth, ſince the power over us (as intended and ordained both by <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man</hi>) is for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and defending, not ſubverting Religion, Laws and Liberties; and ſo defends the true power, ſtrikes not at it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If generall Defence cannot be without many unjuſt violences, no more is any warre at all, in a forraigne Country (<hi>de facto.</hi>) But as the impoſſibility to reſtrain theſe wholly, do's not make all warrs unlawfull, ſo much leſſe doth it a neceſſary defence, in caſe of ſuch danger to Religion, Laws and Liberties.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whoſe fault is it, that theſe unjuſt violences cannot be avoided, the Aſſaylants or the defendants? Let <hi>God</hi> (and conſcience) be Judge. To Him we feare not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale; and while the conſcientious Defendants labour as much as morally they can to prevent and rectifie all ſuch unjuſt violences, whether the danger of ſome acting them, who muſt be imployed in the defence; altogether forbids the generall defence, to the utter ſubverſion of Religion, Laws and Liberties.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And this indeed makes a large difference betwen <hi>Eliſha's</hi> caſe and ours. He defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but one againſt a ſudden paſſionate command. He pleades againſt malicious delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate intents for defence of many, the generall, of all faithfull Prophets, Magiſtrates, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and all, with Laws and Liberties for all poſterity. Let Heaven and Earth judge, who is the wrong-doer, and whether the defendants may not as Innocents call for juſtice, as well as <hi>David</hi> againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. &amp; 26. (<hi>vide locum.</hi>)</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Parliaments</hi> power to conclude of the Kings intentions without the Spirit (Prophetick) of <hi>Eliſha</hi> (I wonder we had not here alſo, that <hi>Eliſha</hi> defended himſelf by an extraordinary way, being an extraordinary perſon, as well as <hi>David</hi> before) that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the third Propoſition, handled in his third Section, thither I refer it. Only ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſince the printing of the Doctors book ſome bloud hath bin ſhed by the Kings Counſell of war at <hi>Reading</hi> in a pretended legality: So at <hi>Oxford</hi> ſome others have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been condemned with pretence of Law, and what ſhall become of them, who knows
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39617:11"/>
whether they will put them to death, <hi>in terrorem</hi> to others? Or reſerve them for feare ſome of their party ſhould be ſerved with the ſame ſawce?</p>
            <p>Finally, whereas he ſaith, the King deſires not any puniſhment ſhould be inflicted on any that oppoſe him, then what a legall tryall ſhall adjudge them to, which no good Subject ought to decline.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This were credible, if we were aſſured what is meant by a legall tryall, and that it did ſignifie, not a tryall by ſuch Judges and Juries, as are apparantly partiall: or if we could forget that the ſix Members accuſed of High-Treaſon in <hi>January</hi> laſt, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves to be tryed, and the <hi>Parliament</hi> offered to try them in <hi>Parliament,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Priviledges, being Members of their Houſes, and from thence forth the Accuſation was laid a ſleepe (till of late) notwithſtanding the reiterated importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of both Houſes of <hi>Parliament,</hi> who alſo in one of their <hi>Declarations</hi> or <hi>Petitions</hi> to the King, urged a Statutes, how ſuch accuſations ought to be managed and conclude to this effect, that by Law and Juſtice this ought not to be denyed.</p>
            <p>And thus I have vindicated the Examples of Scripture by the Doctor alleadged for us, and from thence, and from his owne words partly, the Queſtion in hand between us, as farre as concernes the firſt Propoſition. I am now to proceed to his owne allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt us: In which he is ſo confident, as he promiſes, [<hi>That Scripture excludes this and all other exceptions, giving no allowance to reſiſtance, in regard of perſons or cauſes, or other pretences</hi> (how true this is, let what hath been ſaid already be judge) <hi>and this not only by Examples, but by Precepts, Concluſions, Reſolutions, which are more ſafe.</hi> Theſe we are now to examine.</p>
            <p>Firſt, his Allegation of the 250 Princes, gathering the people againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>; Himſelf ſatisfies, that there was no cauſe for it, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did not deſerve it. [I add, they had done nothing, but what appeared to be the formall will of God, whoſe cloud and pillar was by day and night over their heads, and whoſe many miracles had continually ratified the authority of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Moſes</hi> his very face by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued miracle was ſufficient to have dazeled them, if he had pul'd off his vaile.] But to this he anſwers, The <hi>Princes</hi> ſuppoſed they did deſerve it, and that is now enough it ſeemes, to make people, not only ſay to their Princes, <hi>Yee take too much upon you,</hi> but therefore to riſe in Armes alſo. Which I hope will appeare to be without cauſe too in the end of this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. I have ſhewed there was not the leaſt ground for them to ſuppoſe ill of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> but all contrary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe a falſe ſuppoſall allowes not a man to doe ſuch or ſuch a thing, ſhall this forbid that action, where the ſuppoſall is true and certaine? By this all warre ſhould be unlawfull, for upon a falſe ſuppoſall it is. Alſo all Juſtice ſhould be injuſtice and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull: for upon a falſe ſuppoſall it is ſo. We never ſaid nor thought, That uncertain ſuppoſals ſuffice to arme againſt a Prince; but at leaſt ſuch as rules of reaſon and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence allow in all caſes of importance. And whether there be now any ſuch; As he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs, ſo doe I to the end of the Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he urges, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.11. Namely, that God by <hi>Samuell</hi> tels <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that if they would needs have a King, he ſhould take away their goods, and make their children ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and then they ſhould cry to God, becauſe of their King, but he would not heare them, which implyes they ſhould be left without all remedy againſt his oppreſſion, but only crying to the Lord.</p>
            <p>To this divers Anſwers may and muſt be given. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Though this be further urged by ſome to authorize Kings to take their Subjects goods at their pleaſure, yet
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:39617:12"/>
leſſe the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> never tooke it ſo; For <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel</hi> were not ſo unskillfull in the right of Kings, that they would have had <hi>Naboth</hi> put to death by <hi>falſe witneſſes</hi> for blaſphemy, that ſo his <hi>vineyard</hi> might come to the King by confiſcation; if by a plaine Law of God at the founding of the Monarchy, he might have taken the vineyard at his will, as the Text 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.13. mentions his taking of vineyards even to give to his ſervants, and much more for his own uſe. But <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel</hi> both, though they wanted neither wit nor ſtomack to advance that <hi>Prerogative,</hi> were it ſeemes novices in both to our Moderne Advocates for Monarchy; or rather it is certain <hi>Samuell</hi> tells them what their King would do, and not what he ſhould do by right. His words are Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies not Laws.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither are the latter words of their crying to God, and his not hearing them, in forme of a Law and Prohibition (or at the moſt but a Prohibition of attempting or thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to have the government altered againe from Kings to Judges) but a prediction by way of puniſhment, what ſhould befall them for their ſinfully impetucus affecting and asking a King, that they ſhould feele him oppreſſing them, and that God would never remove the burden, as long as that King (whom they ſhould firſt have) ſhould live, Nor yet alter the government againe from Kings to Judges, though they ſhould be never ſo weary of the one or other; and pray never ſo much to him for either or both. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the event verifies this interpretation, in both reſpects. For <hi>Saul</hi> proved tyrant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; and particularly in taking their ſons from them, as it is threatned, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.11, 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo recorded <hi>Cap.</hi> 14.51. But ſpecially his tyranny was moſt prodigious in the Maſſacre of the Prieſts fore-mentioned: And ſo did many of his ſucceſſours; after they had a King once, they never were under any other government altogether. For though they had no Kings of their owne from the <hi>Babyloniſh Captivity,</hi> till the <hi>Maccabees</hi> time, yet were they under ſtrange Kings (which was worſe) the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> (of which after their returne from captivity, ſee their heavy complaint, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.) and after them the <hi>Grecians</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and then a while the <hi>Maccabees</hi> race poſſeſt the Kingdome till the <hi>Romans</hi> ſubdued them, and ſet up <hi>Harod</hi> and his race under the Emperour, who was indeed their King from thence forth (the high Prieſt cals <hi>Caeſar</hi> their <hi>King, Joh.</hi> 19.15. and ſo doth the <hi>Prophet. Zach.</hi> 11.6.) till <hi>Vespaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> deſtroyed their Common-wealth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Prediction then of ſuch puniſhment to them by their Kings oppreſſing of them, cannot be a Law or puniſhment intended to other Nations being under a King, who have not provoked God in ſeeking a King as <hi>Iſrael</hi> had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God threatned and impoſed on the <hi>Jews</hi> and other <hi>Nations</hi> in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> time their putting their necke under his yoake,<note place="margin">Ier. 27.3. &amp;c.</note> though he was not their hereditary Prince, but an invading enemy. From whence no man will gather (I hope) that any Nation are bound to yeeld to a forraigne Enemy invading them. Alſo God threatned that the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhould be carried captives into other Countries, and there they ſhould ſerve other gods, wood and ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where he would not ſhew them any favour; I am ſure no man will argue from hence, that this is a law for other captives to ſubmit to (or was any excuſe to them, much leſſe a law) but a meere puniſhment to them,<note place="margin">Ier. 16.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o other, leaſt in them alſo ſin be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſin, which is the foreſt puniſhment of all.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This place then being ſuch a prediction of puniſhment doth not prove ſo much, as that to them it was unlawfull to defend their very goods againſt their Kings tyranny, but that (at the moſt) it ſhould be vaine to them; becauſe if God would not heare their cry, their defence would be to little purpoſe, and what they might ſave at one time would begotten from them at another, when their King ſhould liſt to attempt it.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:39617:12"/>5. After all, this Text (let the utmoſt be made of it that can be) reaches not to the firſt and maine Propoſition of defending life. Or the ſecond of chaſtity: but ſtill the defence of thoſe remaine lawfull and warrantable, though alſo ſo doth the defence of goods (as may appeare by what hath bin ſaid) whereas the King is not an abſolute Monarch. The abſoluteneſſe whereof is indeed (as hath bin fore-noted) in power over goods, but not at all over the chaſtity of any, nor ſo much as over their lives, further then they offend known Laws.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He ſays, we have not only example, but reſolution and concluſion out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, That the people might not be gathered together, either for civill Aſſemblies, or for warr, but by his command that had the power of the Trumpet, that is the ſupreame, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, <hi>Num.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> The Text puts in no ſuch reſtraint, no reſtraint at all, but only that the Trumpet ſhould blow for ſuch and ſuch occaſions, and where it did blow, they ſhould aſſemble. I grant, while the ſupreame (and thoſe under him) do their duties, there may be no Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, but by their Authority, Laws and commands; but when they neglect it, and will not diſcharge their truſt; much more when they abuſe it, to deſtroy thoſe, by and for whom they are truſted; This Text hath neither word nor intimation, forbidding the people to aſſemble, even for warr. Himſelfe granted not long ſince, That the body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke might defend it ſelfe againſt an outward force. Suppoſe a Fleet of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or <hi>Danes</hi> or <hi>Iriſh,</hi> invaded our Coaſt: The Prince and all his Officers, are ignorant or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectfull, or even conſenting. Shall the people not aſſemble for defence, becauſe the Prince blows not the Trumpet? Or a band of high-way-robbers ſet upon a village, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and Officers are ſecretly confederate with them: May not the village without their officers, and the neighbour villages alſo run together, as to quench a common fire? We uſe to ſay, <hi>Neceſſity hath no Law,</hi> or <hi>knows no Law.</hi> The meaning is good, That ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary laws for ſetled times, give way to preſent preſſing neceſſities, not only before men, but God too, who in ſaying, <hi>I will have mercy and not Sacrifice</hi>; directs to prefer neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of mercy and ſafety, before all ordinary Formalities, either of Religion, or of civill Juſtice. How els might a private man kill one that aſſaults him? And if one may defend himſelf, I ſay again (as before) much more many; and to that end Aſſemble even for war, and make Trumpets of their own, when they that have the ordinary Trumpets, will not uſe them at all, or againſt the common good. And <hi>Num.</hi> 10. hath not the leaſt ſhadow to the contrary. Alſo without the Trumpet may not the Church aſſemble?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, For <hi>Davids</hi> carriage towards <hi>Saul</hi> and his Army, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. it is partly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered before. But he urges, That though it be ſaid, they intend not hurt to the Kings Perſon, yet might they not as well have hurt his perſon in the day of battell, as any of them that were ſwept away from about him by the fury of the Ordnance, which put no difference 'twixt King and common Souldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Indeed this is the hardeſt caſe can be put <hi>againſt defence by Arms.</hi> But ſuppoſing (as hath bin partly proved already, and will be more, the further we proceed) that againſt his meſſengers and inſtruments, arms may be taken, &amp; battles fought to prevent the <hi>ſubverſion of Religion, Laws and Liberties,</hi> upon which they are bent: I only ask 2 or 3 Queſtions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By what rule of conſcience or God, is a State bound to ſacrifice Religion, Laws and Liberties (the conſervation of which is the end of all governments, and ſo of all Princes Authorities) rather then endure that the Princes life ſhould come into any poſſibilities of hazard, by defending them againſt thoſe, that in his name are bent to ſubvert them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If he will needs thruſt himſelf upon the hazard, when he needs not, whoſe fault is that? Is it theirs that deſire not to have him hurt in the leaſt, and reſolve not to hurt him
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:39617:13"/>
wittingly or willingly, but meerly to defend themſelves upon neceſſity; and offend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are his ſeducers, or inſtruments, or both? And to this purpoſe, let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that I have proved, that <hi>David</hi> would have kept <hi>Keilah</hi> againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> and then if <hi>Saul</hi> would have bin obſtinate to aſſault it in his own perſon; how could <hi>David</hi> have helped it, if an arrow or a ſtone from the wall had hit him and killed him? And then withall, whether there be not ſomewhat this way, in that of <hi>David; Either the Lord ſhall ſmite him, or his day ſhall come that he muſt die, or he ſhall goe into the battle and periſh.</hi> If he might fight with <hi>Sauls</hi> Army, as in <hi>Keilah</hi> he would, and <hi>Saul</hi> would goe downe into the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, his bloud would have bin upon his own head. As if a King diſguiſed ſhould offer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny private violence, a watchman that would not (or even might not) hurt him being knowne, were without blame, if he knock't him down, or even killed him, as he might in like caſe a diſorderly private perſon. Now in battell, to many or moſt (and eſpecially to the Gunners that give fire to great Ordnance) he is altogether diſguiſed, and ſo they are blameleſſe, in reference to his perſonall hurt. The fault is wholly his owne and thoſe wicked Councellors that have thruſt him upon the fury of the battell.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For alſo, why ſhould not all that truly wiſh well to the King, of all other times keep him out of the battell, when it is againſt Rebels? I am ſure <hi>Davids</hi> men would not let him hazard himſelf, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. (though he offred it) and ſaid he was worth 10000 of them. They then that put him upon ſuch deſperate dangers, againſt ſuppoſed Rebels ſhew they love their owne rapine (for which they fight, and to ſubvert Religion, Laws and Liberties) above his perſon and life. And then let God be Judge who ſtretcheth out the hand againſt him unlawfully? They, or others?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He obſerves two things more concerning the point of reſiſtance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all the ſeeming inſtances for it, are out of the old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. Why ſhould he inſinuate this to be inſufficient? Is not the old Teſtament Gods word, and a direction for our lives, as well as the new? Was not, <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother</hi> (under which himſelfe compriſes obedience to Princes) a law of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And if it were lawfull (as the inſtances have bin juſtified againſt all that he hath ſaid) to reſiſt then; how comes it to be unlawfull now? Did Chriſt come to make Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants ſecure from reſiſtance, who were not before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would intreat him, if he be at leaſure to rejoyne to this reply, to tell us the intent of Chriſt in the new Teſtament; bidding his Diſciples, rather ſell their garments, then want a Sword. I am perſwaded for my part, that he thereby directs them to a juſt and neceſſary defence, againſt any out-ragious attempts of violence illegall. Though he afterwards blames <hi>Peter</hi> for uſing the Sword without warrant. The new Teſtament then hath ſomewhat alſo toward Reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>But 2. He ſaith, It is a marvellous thing, That among ſo many Prophets reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> for their Idolatry, cruelty and oppreſſion, none ſhould call upon the Elders of the people, for this duty of reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> To this marvell, there may be a ready ſatisfaction, if we remember, That even in the reigne of the beſt Kings, not only the peoples hearts were uſually unprepared, and in their greateſt ſeemings hypocriticall and treacherous, as appeares by the Story and the Prophets. But alſo the Princes, Elders and Nobles were exceedingly corrupt. In <hi>Joaſh</hi> his time, as ſoone as <hi>Jehojada</hi> was dead, the Princes came and corrupted the King; and in the beginning of <hi>Eſay's</hi> Propheſie in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah's</hi> time (who was among the better Kings) he calls them <hi>Princes of Sodom,</hi> and ſo even in <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> time, how doth <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> complaine of them. (<hi>Ch,</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.) and <hi>Jeremy</hi> in <hi>Joſiahs</hi> time after the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion begun. Now if they were ſo bad in good times, who can marvell, if they were
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:39617:13"/>
ſtarke nought, where the King was rought, and helpers forward of his Idolatries, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties and oppreſſions. And why ſhould it then be expected, that the Prophets ſhould call upon them to reſiſt, the King being on their ſide, and they on his.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, At laſt the Doctor comes to his maine ſtrength of all, namely, <hi>Roman.</hi> 13.2.</p>
            <p>In the improvement of which Text to his purpoſe, he layes downe four Poſitions, and then makes a five-fold Objection, and ſhapes Anſwers to them; all which muſt come under examination.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſayes [<hi>I may ſuppoſe that the King is ſupreame, as St</hi>. Peter <hi>calls him, or the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Power, as St</hi>. Paul <hi>here, though it be by ſome now put to the Queſtion, as one abſurdity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly begets another to defend it.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> But by his leave hee runnes away too faſt with his ſuppoſition in a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> here, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. ſpeakes only of reſiſting the ſupreame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the King, or Emperour or Monarch, whereas the word in this ſecond verſe is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, the power <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which extends to all in authority in either ranke or degree, as well as the ſupreame, as was noted before. If he (or any for him) ſay that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>v.</hi> 2. muſt ſignifie no more then the higher power, <hi>v.</hi> 1. which he interprets only of the ſupreame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> Here againe I muſt tell him, he abuſes his Readers (careleſly at leaſt, I will not ſay wittingly, let his conſcience looke to that) for he alwayes reades higher power in the ſingular, whereas it is <hi>Powers</hi> in the plurall, and the next words, <hi>There is no Power but of God, the Powers that be are ordained of God,</hi> ſhews the Apoſtle ſpeakes of all ſorts and rankes of Powers. Therefore he muſt take in the other, <hi>Powers,</hi> as well as the ſupreame in both verſes, and that will be nothing for his benefit, as will appeare by this briefe reaſon. If the Powers that are under the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame may not be reſiſted by this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. Then either the reſiſtance forbidden extends not to reſiſting (though with Armes) out-ragious and tyrannicall aſſaults of illegall violence offered by thoſe officers, as ſuppoſe a Major, Juſtice, or even a Conſtable, or elſe even one of thoſe officers, even a petty Conſtable is as abſolutely over thoſe that are under his office as any Monarch, and they ſlaves to his luſts, as well as to an Emperours, becauſe the one ought not to tyrannize (by the Doctors Confeſſion § 1.) no more then the other, and the one ought not to be reſiſted no more then the other by this argument and Text.</p>
            <p>Now which part of diſtinction will the Doctor chuſe, if the former, he deſerts his cauſe plainly. If the latter, then beſides the apparant abſurdity of it; I urge, that all men will grant, That a Conſtable and ſuch like officers (betweene the people and the ſupreame) are lyable to be themſelves puniſhed by Lawes, if they offer any out-ragious and illegall violence, which cannot poſſibly be, unleſſe they may be reſiſted even with Armes in caſe any arme themſelves to practiſe violence, Alſo elſe a few of them, as the Major or Aldermen of a Towne, joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, might goe through all the City and robbe, and kill as many as they would by force of Armes, and no man might offer to reſiſt them by taking Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. It remaines therefore that all Magiſtrates (except the ſupreame to begin with) may be reſiſted even with Armes, if offering violence and tyranny; And yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids to reſiſt the Powers without diſtinction of ſupreame or other. Therefore S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anes not to forbid reſiſting Tyranny with Armes: But reſiſting legall and lawfull commands, even other wayes, as well as with Armes,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:39617:14"/>
though this be the worſt kind of reſiſtance, where obedience is due.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, It muſt not be granted him (for all his bigg words of Abſurdity, imputed to thoſe that deny it) <hi>That the King of</hi> England <hi>is in all conſiderations the ſupreame</hi> (or <hi>the higheſt Power</hi> (if S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Pauls</hi> words were in the ſuperlative.) This belongs to Politicks, and the Doctors Divinity will not reach it, himſelfe cannot deny it, That the King is not ſupreame in the legiſlative power. Though hee have a negative voyce in Lawes, ſo have either of the Houſes diſtinct. Hee can then neither make new Lawes alone, nor abrogate old ones: Nor violate (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuſtice) the goods, much leſſe the lives or chaſtities of any of his meaneſt Subjects, and leaſt of all authorize any of his followers by his warrant or preſence to doe ſo. His Supremacy then is bounded by Lawes, and is given him (be it more or leſſe) <hi>ad ſalutem non ad deſtructionem.</hi> Which yet were not, if no Tyranny of his might be reſiſted. But of that more anon.</p>
            <p>But the Doctor will prove the King ſupreame 3 wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1.
<q>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peters</hi> diſtinction comprehends all that are in authority. The King as ſupreame, and thoſe that are ſent by him: In which latter ranke are the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Parliament,</hi> being ſent by him, or ſent for by him, and by his Writ ſitting there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. Why did the Doctor leave out the word <hi>Governours?</hi> Is he afraid to grant the Houſes of <hi>Parliament</hi> any power of Government?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What if ſent by him, referrs not to the King, but to the Lord, for whoſe ſake, all both King and Governours are to be obeyed, and by whom both are ſent? (but of this alſo more anon.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. But grant him his way, I aske how it ſhall appeare, that the name of King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends as farre every where as S. <hi>Peters</hi>

to Lawes, and for the good of King and Kingdome, neither of which is promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or preſerved by a reſtraint of a defenſive Reſiſtance of tyranny, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, the Doctor ſo contends for. Adde here, what muſt elſewhere be further urged, That the King himſelfe in his anſwer to the 19 Propoſitions, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that the two Houſes have legall power, more then ſufficient to prevent or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine Tyranny. Which I would faine have any man ſhew me, how it can bee done, but by taking up Armes, and then I will yeeld him the cauſe, That all Armes taken up are unlawfull. But till then the King hath granted the cauſe, legall and juſt againſt the Doctors firſt maine Propoſition, and all his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>His next ground is, That in the Text of the Apoſtle, all perſons under the higher Power are expreſſely forbidden to reſiſt, for <hi>Whoſoever,</hi> in the ſecond <hi>verſe,</hi> muſt be as large, as <hi>every ſoule</hi> in the firſt verſe, and the reſiſtance forbidden here concrnes all upon whom the ſubjection is injoyned there, or elſe we could not make theſe univerſals good againſt the Papiſts, exempting the Pope and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy from ſubjection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. He ſtill runnes on in his errour to limit the higher power to the ſupreame.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, I grant him that all other powers under the ſupreame are forbidden to reſiſt in the Apoſtles ſence. A Conſtable, Juſtice, Major, Sheriffe, Judge of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize, nor the very Houſes of <hi>Parliament</hi> may not reſiſt the authority of the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding according to Lawes. But yet it remaines to be prooved, that they may not reſiſt his violence, when he is bent to ſubvert Lawes and Liberties, and Religion and all: Or the violence of his followers, even though doing it by his warrant or in his preſence. Alſo, becauſe he doth ſo much inſiſt upon the phraſe of higher power, let me put him a caſe. A wicked Robber that hath committed twenty moſt bloudy mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers one after another, in cold bloud is led away after legall condemnation by the Sheriffe to be put to death: Suppoſe a King would come with armed ſouldiers, and offer to take him violently and by force out of the hand of Juſtice. Who reſiſts damnably now that power which is the Ordinance of God, and to whom the Sword is committed? The Sheriffe and his men that reſiſt the violence, or the Kings followers (or even himſelfe) that reſiſt the due Execution of Juſtice? Let him ſtudy on it and give an Anſwer at his leiſure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He proceeds, In thoſe dayes there was a ſtanding and continuall great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, which not long before had the ſupreme power in the <hi>Roman</hi> State, and might chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge more by the fundamentals of that State, then our great Councell (I thinke) will or can. But now the Emperour being <hi>ſupreame,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> cals him, or the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er power,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> here, there is no power of reſiſtance left to any that are under him by the Apoſtle. Thus for the perſons that ſhould reſiſt, all are forbidden. Now conſider the cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. Doubtleſſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote not to the <hi>Roman Senate,</hi> nor Saint <hi>Peter</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And if the Doctor will proove it unlawfull for them to reſiſt, he muſt proove it from the Law of nature, or at leaſt from ſome ancient Law of the old Teſtament, given to the Anceſtours of the <hi>Roman Senate.</hi> Or elſe ſhew how this could concerne them, who never heard any thing of it. For any thing then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ſaith, it was lawfull for the <hi>Roman Senate</hi> and the Heathen Subjects to reſiſt, though not for <hi>Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If he or any for him ſhall ſay that it ſuffices for his cauſe that it was forbidden to Chriſtians and accordingly is now.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:39617:15"/>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> 2. If you reply that ſuppoſing it not forbidden to Heathens; No more was it to Chriſtians, before S. <hi>Paul</hi> (and S. <hi>Peter</hi>) wrote. And if ſo, then belike (as was formerly toucht) the Apoſtles laid a yoake upon the necks of Chriſtians, worſe then all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ceremonies, which the Gentiles were ever freed from: For whereas before the <hi>Romans</hi> might reſiſt their tyrannous Emperours, now by becoming Chriſtians their hands muſt be tyed to have all their throats cut, (even though the whole Senate were Chriſtians) at one <hi>Neroes</hi> pleaſure. He that wiſht that all <hi>Rome</hi> had but one neck that he might ſtrike it off at a blow, had done wiſely to have endeavoured to have made them all Chriſtians, and then he and his Guard with him, or his Army might by this Doctrine have ſtruck off all their heads, or runne them all through one after another as faſt as they could deale blowes, and ſo he ſhould have his will in their deſtruction, though there muſt have beene a little more paines taken about it. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt who came to purchaſe liberty to his people never meant to enſlave them to tyrants above all others of Man-kind. The Doctor muſt goe prove reſiſtance unlawfull from ſome other grounds of natures law or the ancient lawes of Scripture, or elſe this Text of S. <hi>Paul</hi> will appeare to have another interpretation, even that which hath beene given before in the explication of the Text, and inference from it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I will not therefore trouble my ſelfe to compare the Authority of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Senate with our Parliament, much leſſe argue for that power which they had loſt about a 100 Yeares before S. <hi>Paul</hi> writ; It ſuffices he hath not diſproved at all their preſent power of reſiſting tyranny, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, and that by the ſame argument I have diſproved, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids Chriſtians to take any ſuch power to themſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But he adds [was there ever more cauſe of reſiſtance then in thoſe dayes? Were not the Kings then not only conceived to be enclined ſo and ſo, but even actually were enemies to Religion, had overthrown Laws and liberties?] <hi>Rep.</hi> If it had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore demonſtratively proved that reſiſting the power (or higher power) did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifie, taking Armes againſt the Supreame, when he plays the tyrant: This fourth ſtep were a juſt illuſtration, and confirmation of it. But now he only beggs the Queſtion (whether deceitfully or being himſelfe deceived by his own ſtrength of fancy againſt reſiſtance) and builds without a foundation. For will it prove that S. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids reſiſting by Armes a tyrant; Becauſe <hi>Nero</hi> was then a tyrant. Unleſſe there were nothing elſe that could be cold reſiſting the higher power, but reſiſting by Armes? He that ſhould have wilfully and obſtinately refuſed the juſt Laws of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, had reſiſted the higher powers in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning (as the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, and all interpreters ſhew) What is this then to inferre a prohibition of reſiſting tyranny by Armes? It inferres indeed, or includes principally reſiſtance of lawfull commands by Armes. But how comes tyranny in? becauſe forſooth <hi>Nero</hi> was a tyrant. <hi>Rep.</hi> But his authority according to the Laws of which alone the Apoſtle ſpeakes was not tyrannous. The Argument therefore is wholy inconſequent, and fallacious from legall commands to tyrannous violence. And that the Apoſtles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text proves abundantly, notwithſtanding his pretended anſwers of Objections. But heare him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Therefore, If any ſhould from the Apoſtles reaſons that he gives againſt reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the 3, 4, and 5, verſes, <hi>For Rulers are not a terrour to good works, but to evill, and he is the Miniſter of God to thee for good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:39617:15"/>REPLY. That Rulers ſo long as they are not a terror to the good, but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter for our good are not to be reſiſted. The conſideration of thoſe times leaves no place for ſuch exception, becauſe the powers then which the Apoſtle forbids to reſiſt, were nothing ſo, but ſubverters of that which was good, juſt &amp;c.</p>
            <p>REPLY. This ſtill labours of the fallacie, that Rulers and Powers ſignifie the perſonall commands of the ſupreame; onely once here ere he is aware he names powers in the plurall, which the Apoſtle forbids to reſiſt. But I ſay as often, It onely ſignifies the legall commands of Authority, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſupreame or ſubordinate. Secondly, though <hi>Nero</hi> was a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> yet were not all his Magiſtrates and Officers ſo; nor hee himſelfe in all matters (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not at all when S. <hi>Paul</hi> writ this he had his <hi>Quinquiennius,</hi> and it may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly fall within the <hi>Quare</hi>) unto thoſe which were legall, which were the greater part that concern'd Chriſtians, It was forbidden to make reſiſtance, and the Dr. hath ſaid no word to prove yet, that the prohibition extends further.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hee makes a Second Objection that ſome ſay, that prohibition was tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poray and fit for thoſe times. To which he makes 2 Anſwers. 1. That this is a new exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ption never heard of I thinke but theſe times.</p>
            <p>REPLY. I have not in my Reading obſerv'd any to make ſuch an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and doe readily yeeld to him that ſo to put of the Apoſtles prohibition is a ſenceleſſe, and preſumptuous ſhift. But I muſt encounter his ſecond An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Which is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>That the Reaſons of the Prohibition (in his ſenſe of reſiſting Tyranny by armes) are perpetuall, <hi>verſe</hi> 3.4 5.6.</p>
            <p>REPLY. I have formerly ſhewed the contrary, and that all the reaſons fight againſt his ſence. But he will prove it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>From that order that good, for which the powers are ordained of God, which will be of force as long as there is Government, and will be alwayes, reaſons againſt reſiſtance, becauſe reſiſtance (though it be made againſt abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed powers (as then they were) doth tend to the diſſolution of that Order, for which the power it ſelfe is ſet up by God; by which alſo the other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of theirs is made void when as they reply they think acutely, That they reſiſt not the power, but the abuſe of the power.</q>
            </p>
            <p>REPL It is granted by him that the ſtate of the Queſt. is, when a Prince is bent to ſubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties. I would then faine know what order or good will then be in force, when theſe are ſubverted? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Tyrant that attempts to ſubvert theſe, intends not to diſſolve that Order, for which his power and himſelfe were ſet up of God? And how then the Apoſtles reaſons can posſibly reach to forbid reſiſtance to ſuch attempts or practiſes; I will inſtance in foure Commandements of the ſecond Table which the Roman Lawes in thoſe times were conſervators of as much as any Nations in the world (except Gods people of Iſrael) the 5, 6, 7, 8. Com Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Nero</hi> gathers together a Company of diſſolute young men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with this guard or band enters into ſeverall houſes, encourages thoſe children that were willing to be ſo wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to abuſe Father and mother: from thence they goe to the Market-place, and kill any they meet, and have quarrell with; then they catch mens Wives and raviſh them before their Husbands faces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and after that rob the rich mens houſes at their pleaſure: I demand now, what greater (or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:39617:16"/>
equall) diſſolution of that Order, for which the power is ſet up of God can be imagined? Or how the not reſiſting ſuch a Tyrant can with common ſenſe be inferred from thoſe ſentences, <hi>Rulers are not a terror to good workes, but to evill, and he is the miniſter of God to thee for good?</hi> What is this, but to call good evill, and evill good? Which the woe againſt which our Doctor would ſcarre men from reſiſting tyrranny in his title Page: reſiſtance of ſuch an one then is ſo farre from diſſolving of order, as there is no meanes under heaven to keep or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from being diſſolved in ſuch caſe, but reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereby it will appeare alſo how void his confidence is, that by his former words he hath made void the diſtinction betweene the power and the abuſe of the power himſelfe hath granted (and cannot in conſcience deny) that though the Prince is to be actively obeyed when he commands lawfull things; yet not when hee commands againſt the Lawes of GOD, or even the eſtabliſht Lawes of the Land: hee then diſtinguiſhes acutely hee thinks, betweene the power and the abuſe of the power. Why is it not as lawfull for us in the ſecond verſe ſo to diſtinguiſh upon <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as well as for him in the firſt verſe upon <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? Or if it be not, he muſt give us a better reaſon then he hath yet. And till then I againe make bold to tell him that all the Apoſtles Argument, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5, 6, 7. juſtifies our diſtinction, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his interpretation.</p>
            <p>Another Objection he makes againſt hmſelfe, is, That ſome ſay the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours then were abſolute Monarks and therfore not to be reſiſted; he anſwers. They did indeed rule abſolutely and arbitrarily, which ſhould have according to the principles of thoſe dayes beene a ſtronger motive to reſiſt. But how did they make themſelves of Subjects ſuch abſolute Monarks, was it not by force and change of Government? And was not the right of the Senate and people good againſt them with as much, or more reaſon, then the right of the people of this Land is againſt the ſuccesſion of this Crowne, deſcending by three Conqueſts?</p>
            <p>REPL. 1. This Objection is needleſſe, and ſo ſhall be none of mine. Alſo it is a nicety to averre, and very hard to prove that the Emperours were (or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes are) abſolute Monarks, under whom there is a government by written Lawes, as among the Romans were the 12. Tables, and many other Lawes. But I adde, that no Prince can be an abſolute Monarch to have power over mens lives at his pleaſure (or over the chaſtity of any at all) He can have no power but according to the Ordinance of God. Now it is certaine God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ordaines any ſuch Arbitrary, or iniurious power. Therfore no Monarch hath any ſuch <hi>de jure.</hi> As for that, any hath <hi>de facto,</hi> as he ſpeakes of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ruling abſolutely or arbitrarily. If they did ſo (as they oft did) for evill, I have formerly ſhewed, and he hath not refelled it, that they might have been reſiſted 2. What he ſpeakes of their becomeing Monarchs touches not our caſe at all. For however he inſinuates, Who ever hath ſoberly written for defence and reſiſtance againſt Tyrranny doth not plead any right in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Land againſt the ſuccesſion of this Crown: But though the King and his rightfull ſucccesſions ought ſtill to hold the Crown; This forbids not a neceſſary defence againſt their unjuſt violences when ever they ſhall uſe them. 3. Yet withall I add, that though ſo long as there was any in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man State who had not by Oath or the like expreſt their conſent to the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:39617:16"/>
of the Roman Emperours, they were free to have thruſt them out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, or rather bound to have done it, and reſtore the Senate to their loſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: yet when any have with the generality yeelded to the change of an <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> (wherein no man hath perſonall right of ſuccesſion) into a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi>; they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſpecially the poſterity of thoſe that have ſo yeelded, are from thenceforth for ever bound to that government, according to juſt and equall Lawes already in being or to be made hereafter, even by the Monarke alone, if they have truſted him with it alone; But never can they loſe their right (no, not by their owne conſent) of juſt defence of Chaſtities, or of their lives, untill they forfeit them by their misbehaviour againſt ſome juſt Lawes or other. 4. As therefore the Doctor diſclaimes the pleading for an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power) (ſuch as Conquerours uſe) in this crowne, ſo if he can plead no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt reſiſting our Kings then he hath in the caſe of the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours he will merit but ſmall reward for his paines. But for that, <hi>viderit ipſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. I come to his laſt objection, That Chriſtian Religion was then enacted againſt by Law; but the Religion contended, is eſtabliſht by Law. Hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Is the Religion eſtabliſht denyed to any that now fight for it? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>REPL. This with the reſt belongs to matter of fact in the third Propoſition, and ſeventh Propoſition. Thither, I referre it that I may not ſay over need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly the ſame things, or ſay but a little here or that which hee will needs make neceſſary to ſay a great deale more then I deſire.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the prohibition (ſaith hee) not only concernes Chriſtians, but all the people under thoſe Emperors; and not only Religion was perſecuted, but liberties alſo loſt the people and Senate were enſlaved by edicts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Lawes, then inforced upon them and they (according to the principles of theſe dayes) might reſiſt notwithſtanding the Apoſtles prohibition, and the Laws then forced upon them, or elſe the State, as they uſually ſay had not means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for its ſafety. Thus one fancy of theirs thwarts another becauſe both are groundleſſe</p>

               </gap>her the Chriſtian Religion being condemned by law then, did deny them reſiſtance in its ſelfe, I ſhall perhaps give him account in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. Meane time he cannot deny but the difference is very great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a Right to defend that which the Law defends, and that which the Law puniſhes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I have proved that the prohibition of reſiſting Tyranny by armes, did not concerne the Heathen Romanes (and therefore not the Chriſtians neither.)</p>
            <p>Thirdly, what ever liberties were loſt, and new Lawes enforced, yet ſo long and ſo farre as the Emperours ruled by the Lawes, the people and Senate were in no ſuch ſlavery, that they needed reſiſt to ſave the State. But when they uſed lawleſſe violences according to their luſts, neither the Lawes nor the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle prohibited a defenſive reſiſtance. So that although Chriſtians might not defend their Religion againſt Law, yet he hath brought nothing to ſhew, they may not defend it, when the Law hath eſtabliſht it.</p>
            <p>But of the meanes of ſafety in ſtate, he will ſpeake more anon, and ſo will I. And now I ſhall oppoſe his concluſion wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I Have been ſo large in refuting his ſtrength from Scripture, that I need not ſpend a like proportion upon the reſt; and ſo ſhall I forbear ſuch a Syllabicall REPLY, as I have made to his former SECTION. I ſhall here only touch Materiall Paſſages, the rather, becouſe of other paines upon the following SECTIONS. Our Dr. examines the Fundamentalls of this Government as hee ſaith, though hee after urge that the Fundamentalls talked of are aſſerted common to all Governments, which is true of that which this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. When the World was more emptie as in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, a godly man, as he, having a Competent Family, might ſubſiſt without others, joyning in a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with him; and he could not doe them any remarkable good, or gayne glory to GOD by it, they being Pagans. So that it is not (I ſay) abſolutely true, that men are bound univerſally, as by an Ordinance from GOD, to ſet up, live under govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Drs. ſenſe. Marriage is GODS Inſtitution and Ordinance, and more originally then the Government politicall, and neceſſary for encreaſe, yet are not all of mankinde bound to marry, but for their owne good and comfort, and ſo of others, and advancing Gods Glory in both. So it is with <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Government.</hi> Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, though new when the world is peopled; As there is leſſe Neceſſity of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, then when the World was thinner, (though ſtill a Neceſſity to many, even to moſt.) So is there more Neceſſitie of being within Government to ſecure ones ſelfe and others from wrong, and doe one ſelfe and others good and glorifie GOD in all. And ſo farre I grant it Gods ordinance to all.</p>
            <p>But one thing more I muſt remember him, and the readers of. Namely that this Power, will not be proved abſolutely to extend, to the making of any Humane Lawes, but onely to ſee to the Obſervation of the Lawes of Nature, and of God by His word and ſpeciall Revelation both of the firſt, and ſecond Table; and to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power of coercion, then what the Light of Nature will Argue Neceſſarie, for the Obſervation of thoſe Lawes of Nature. And that all further power, belongs to the third particular, which he calls the qualification of the Power, &amp; depends upon mans Conſent (ſo it be not againſt Gods Law and Word,) which I call the extent of the Power. Which if it be true, it ſhall be ſeene anon, what Conſequence may bee drawne from it to the diſadvantage of the Doctours purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And now let us view the Doctors proofs, that Power it ſelfe is an Ordinance of God, binding all Mankind, to ſet up and live under government. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>The Powers are of God, and the Ordinance of God, v.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>REPL. The Doctor ſeemes to have an excellent faculty, to take ſo much only of a Text, as ſeemes to ſerve his turne, and leave out the reſt, which at leaſt might ſeeme to be againſt him: the words <hi>v.</hi> 1. are, <hi>There is no Powers but of</hi> GOD, <hi>The powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi> This may be true, when Powers <hi>are,</hi> and not that there <hi>muſt</hi> be powers every where, as in the ſimilitude before, there is no Marriage but of GOD, the Marriages that be are ordained of GOD. As for Saint <hi>Peters Ordinance of Man,</hi> or it is in the Originall, <hi>Humane Creation,</hi> which is more Emphaticall, granting as the Dr. doth, that the qualification, and Perſon is from Mans Creation, I will not urge more from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Text againſt him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He urges ver. 4 <hi>He is the Miniſter of God,</hi> this yet proves not a neceſſitie in all of ſetting up Government. But onely when it is ſet up to acknowledge the Governour <hi>Gods Vice-gerent.</hi> So (as before) the Husband is GODS Vicegerent: Yet a Woman not abſolutely bound to be under a Husband. The truth is, <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> is from GOD originally in theſe reſpects, no further. Firſt he hath laid a generall charge upon Mankinde, to advance his Glory, their owne and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good (whom thus are bound to love as themſelves) by all meanes not by him forbidden. Secondly, in the parentall Authours, (or proparentall, if the Parents dye in their Childrens Infancy) he hath ſhewed them how much Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may conduce to this. Thirdly he declares by inſtinct in Nature, that as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentall
<pb facs="tcp:39617:19"/>
Authority is deputed by him, ſo that he affords a deputation to other Governments when once ſet up. Fourthly, ſhewing all men (now a dayes and long ſince) in fully inhabited places of the world, not only a profit, but even a necesſity of being within Government (at leaſt for his glory, in the Civill good of ſocieties) Upon theſe grounds we may ſay he ordaines and commands all to be within one Government or other; but not abſolutely, nor without relation to this end.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, he alleadges. <hi>By me Kings reigne,</hi> and <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods,</hi> and <hi>the word of God came to them,</hi> Joh. 10. That word, ſaith he, is the iſſuing out of the Commisſion for the ſetting up a Government over and among the People.</p>
            <p>REPL. But none of all this will amount to his Concluſion; 1. Kings reigne by God, that is they are his Deputies. Men could not give them any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over themſelves unleſſe God owned it and by his inſtinct had prompted them to it. Secondly, he ſaith, <hi>Yee are Gods</hi>; but this an owning the deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Perſon, as well as the Power. This place either proves more then the Doctor urges it for, or leſſe. Thirdly, as for his <hi>Dixi,</hi> the Doctor miſtakes moſt of all For it relates plainly to his owning the Perſons, (whom yet he tels. <hi>They ſhall are like Men:</hi> but the Power dies not) and is rather a gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a particular Patent or Commisſion to the Perſon choſen or ſucceeding, then a Commisſion (or Originall Writ) to ſet up a Government.</p>
            <p>His Reaſon is no more Univerſally True, then his Texts pertinent. God (he ſaith) Governs all Creatures, Reaſonable, as well as Unreaſonable; the lower world by the Heaven, and the Reaſonable Creatures Men, by others too ſet up in his ſtead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> But what if the Edge of this Reaſon be Turned againſt himſelfe? For by whom according to the Dr. are Kings and Monarks Govern'd? In an <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> each of the Governors is Governed by all the reſt of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and ſo in a Democracy, but in a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> one Governs all, and hee himſelf is Governed by none. Either then al mankind are not bound to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Government (and then all his Texts and this Reaſon are alleadged in vain) or elſe Kings and Monarks are alſo under ſome Government, at leaſt of the Repreſentative Body of thei people (according to what was before alledged from our Lawyers, <hi>Rex non habet Superiorem praeter Legem &amp; Curiam Comitum &amp; Baro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>um,</hi> &amp;c.) Let him take his choice. Nor can hee evade this with ſaying the Text Speaks of Monarks, and they are called GODS, and ſo none above them But 1. I appeale to all Interpreters, whether the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> intend it not (and ſo Chriſt after him) of all ſorts of Judges, and ſo <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28. <hi>Thou ſhalt not Curſe the GODS, nor speake evill of the Ruler of the People.</hi> Yet this S. <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledges extended even to the High Prieſt the Eccleſiaſticall Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. 2. Is not the Text at leaſt meant, of all the Governours in a <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi> and in <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> that they are call'd GODS, yet each hath the reſt above him 3. However ſtill his Reaſon is voyde, for all Reaſonable Creatures are not governed by others in GODS ſtead; for by his ſaying, Monarks are not; and yet they oft times need to be governed ſo far as not to be ſuffered to undo all by their Governing or elſe this Queſtion had never bin in the world, which our hearts bleed to be forced to diſpute, concerning the power of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Monarks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:39617:19"/>If now the Dr. will ſay that we afford GOD a poore part in ſetting up of power for the governing of Men, he had need ſeek better proofe or elſe he will hardly perſwade any more to a conſiderate Reader. But perhaps hee will ſay I have yeelded him enough, (and more then others have done) that will be ſeene by the uſe he can make of his aſſertion. But in the meane time, I have 2 or 3 Conſiderations to propound, from his Texts and Reaſon, and my own grants and aſſertions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Each one of his Texts ſpeaks of more then the Supreame Powers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.9. Plainly <hi>Plurall,</hi> more then once, and takes in all Ranks, as hath been proved. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> names <hi>Governours</hi> to be ſubmitted to for the LORDS ſake, aſwell as the Supreame and I ſhould thinke, <hi>Sent by him,</hi> is by the <hi>LORD</hi> rather then by the Supreme, as I ſhall ſhew by the Reaſon by and by; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid <hi>the powers that he</hi> (even the Governors) <hi>are ordained of GOD.</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. after the words, <hi>By me Kings Raigne,</hi> follows, <hi>And Princes Decree juſtice, By me Princes Rule, and Nobles even all the Iudges of the Earth.</hi> This is plaine, aſwell for other Governors as Supreme, being the Ordinance of God. And as for <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. I have ſpoken before. I wonder then that the Dr. in a Treatiſe of Conſcience, and having that word ſo often in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe makes no conſcience of confining theſe places (as in effect he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually) meerely to Supreme power; It was for his turne indeed, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare more anon But that will hardly ſatisfie a Conſcience, let him think on it.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not forget his reaſon now ſerving me once more againſt him. God governes all men by others in his ſtead; now that is done by ſubordinate Governours, as well as ſupreame (and ſo the inferiour and unreaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by divers ſubordinations) and the ſubordinate doe ſometimes, even ten more then then the ſupreame, let him be never ſo good; if they be bad. the government and order will be diſturbed and perverted, in a large Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe his eye and hand can not be but in one place at once, and all may be and will be naught, if thoſe under Governours be naught, whiles he his abſent.</p>
            <p>But if they be good, they keepe things for the generall tolerably well, how bad ſoever he is. For his badneſſe then, (as his goodneſſe before) will not reach to all places, and ſcarcely (though badneſſe in a corrupted world will reach further then goodneſſe) much further then where hee is preſent. Kingdomes then are governed under God, by other Powers as well as by the preame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they no leſſe ſent by him then the ſupreame; I ſhall make an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or two from this afterward.</p>
            <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meane time I add my ſecond conſideration. That in all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Texts the ſpirit of God with the mention of Governours authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and ordained by him, inculcates their duty to him, and their obligation to Juſtice, &amp;c. and that not onely when hee ſpeakes to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. and of them at large, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. But even when he ſpeakes to inferiours to be ſubject to them, and eſpecially when he forbids <hi>reſiſtance, Rom.</hi> 13. And for this cauſe they are all to be prayd for, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 2. <hi>That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſſe and honeſty.</hi> Which words, if they may not be taken, as intending why God hath ſet any in Authority; yet the thing is undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly true, hee never by way of ordinance gave any Authority for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther End.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:39617:20"/>Thoſe Governours then whether ſupreame or other, that under pretence of their Authority from Gods Ordinance, diſturb the quiet and peaceable life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the inferiours ſhould lead in all godlineſſe and honeſty (as to bee ſure they doe, that are bent or ſeduced to ſubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties) are farre from being Gods Ordinance in ſo doing; and therfore however their power it ſelfe, a ſufficiency of Authority for command and coercion in gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the People, be from God; yet their Tyranny is not at all from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by way of Ordinance or Approbation, and ſo they that reſiſt it even with Armes; Reſiſt not the Ordinance of God, but reſiſt the violation of his Ordinance, and ſo doe nothing unlawfull, though it be a reſiſting of the ſupreame perſon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let it be remembred that St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the place fore-mentioned, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Governours, ſuppoſe if meant as the Doctor would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>ſent by the ſupreame,</hi> adds (<hi>for the puniſhment of evill doers, and for the praiſe of them that doe well.</hi>) If then the ſupream ſend Governours to erect or practiſe a Tyranny (to ſubvert Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Lawes and Liberties (whether under the name of <hi>Iuſtices</hi> of <hi>Oye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner, Sheriffes, Commiſſioners of Array,</hi> or the like) which is to the Puniſhment rather of thoſe that doe well, and the praiſe of Evill doers; St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith not a word, to bid be ſubject to them, either actively, or ſo much as pasſively. Nor any where elſe in Scripture, I dare be bold to ſay it, doth the Spirit of God bid be ſubject to Princes or politick Governours, though tyrannous, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters of Religion, and Juſtice. I meane not when it ſpeaks of them as ſuch.</p>
            <p>And till then though they have power from God, which is not to be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; yet their Tyranny being not from him, but againſt him, may, and the Doctor hath not been able (nor will never be) to prove to the contrary.</p>

            <head>SECT. IV.</head>
            <p>IN this Section the Doctor undertakes to treat of the <hi>Forfeiture</hi> of the Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo of the <hi>Re-aſſuming</hi> of it by the <hi>Parliament</hi> or <hi>People,</hi> for the Kings not diſcharging his truſt. And denies this Forfeiture, and this power of Reaſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that Power. But this (he ſaith) they that plead for it offer to prove by two or three things laid together. Firſt, that the power is derived from the People by way of Election. Secondly, that there is a Covenant betweene the King and the People. Thirdly, that it is neceſſary for a State have a meanes within it ſelfe to preſerve it ſelfe. Againſt all thoſe the Dr. argues and I follow him. Onely remembring him that by <hi>Forfeiture</hi> is not underſtood <hi>Forfeiture of all Kingly Authority</hi>; nor by <hi>Reaſſuming</hi> (as I ſaid before) <hi>a taking of the whole power from him to themſelves,</hi> but onely for the particular Caſe in hazard, and for the preſent necesſity.</p>
            <p>And now to begin with what he firſt mentions the Derivation of power; I muſt tell him that he forges what he before complained of in others; that they confounded the power it ſelfe with the perſon and the Qualification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am ſure he doth ſo here, if ever man did. Hee before granted the Perſon and Qualification from men and then they approved of God; and more then that, no man pleads to be derived nor more to be forfeited, plead not for ſo much, nor he <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>liament</hi> neither. But only the Qualification for he particular Caſe of danger, and till that danger may be ſuffici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntly ſecured.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:39617:20"/>Yet here now at firſt, to oppoſe the Forfeiture (but of this particular which is only in queſtion now before us) he denies the power to be from the People, and appeales to what he hath cleared, which is onely (by his owne ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not altogether as hath beene ſhewed) that the Power it ſelfe is from God. But for all that, if no more can be ſaid againſt the perſons forfeiting his reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Power, and ſpecially in the Qualifications of it, even for ever, it may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be forfeited and ſo re-aſſumed all of it: which is more then I ſay.</p>
            <p>Secondly, but he will prove, that though the People have this Power abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely (which himſelfe hath more then once granted, of the Deſignation of the Perſon and Qualification) yet could they not have right to take it away.</p>
            <p>REPL. The King will have no cauſe to thank him for his undertaking, as well becauſe he doth it not with any great ſtrength; as alſo becauſe hee hath hereby provoked men to diſpute even this Caſe; which no way needed, ſince the <hi>Parliament</hi> never pretended to this Right in generall, but rather diſclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [Many things which are altogether in our diſpoſing before we part with them, are not afterward in our power to recall.]</p>
            <p>REPL. True; but ſome things are, and that both, if conditions be not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and even at our owne pleaſure.</p>
            <p>A King makes ſome Officers for <hi>terme of life</hi>; others, <hi>quamdin ſe bene geſſerint</hi>; others, <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ante bene placite.</hi> To the latter hee may ſend a Writ of Eaſe at his pleaſure; and every day its in his power to recall their Authority. To the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond their offices are ſure without power of recalling till they are legally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of miſbehaviour. To the third, as long as they live, their Authority is firme, and no power of recalling it wholly. Yet even ſuch may bee hindred from ſome Adminiſtrations, by Accuſations by and apparency of Crimes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it unfit for them to be truſted in the particular.</p>
            <p>We imagine not the People to have power to recall that Regall Authority at their pleaſure: we argue not that they have power to recall it wholly, upon any Caſe of <hi>Mal-adminiſtration.</hi> All that we plead for is power to adminiſter a part of it upon neceſsity, which he will not adminiſter for good, but rather for evill. And there are not many things that were altogether ours, and in our diſpoſing before we part with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but are ſtill ſo farre ours, as to uſe them againe in our neceſsity for that turne at leaſt, though there are ſome.</p>
            <p>Secondly But he will prove this to be one of thoſe that are not after in our power to recall [eſpecially, ſaith he, ſuch; in which there redounds to God an intereſt by the Donation, as in things devoted, though after they come to be abuſed.]</p>
            <p>REPL. 1. Grant this true, in referrence to the Power of recalling them wholly, (which yet is not univerſally true as will appeare ſtraight) yet may there be power enough to adminiſter ſo much as is of neceſsity.</p>
            <p>A Wife is tyed to her Husband by the Covenant of God. (ſo called <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.) by the Ordinance of God, more ancient, and no leſſe ſtrong then that of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Government. She cannot recall wholly her Husbands Authority over her, though ſhee was once altogether at her diſpoſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to chooſe or another or none to be her head. All the goods of the Family are his in Law, and not here but by his leave and order: Yet for her necesſity, ſhe may by the Law of God and conſcience adminiſter ſo much of the goods as is fit, and ſecure her Per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:39617:21"/>
from his violence by abſence (though that ordinarily be againſt the Law of Marriage, and the end of it,) or any other meanes of ncceſſary defence.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, it is not altogether true, that there is no power or recalling any thing devoted to God. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> took off the gold from the Doores of the Temple and the Pillars which he had overlaid, and all the ſilver in the houſe of the Lord, to pay the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> his demanded Ranſome, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 18.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>If the Doctor will not owne this Act of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>; I am ſure he will that of <hi>David,</hi> taking the hallowed Bread, which was not for any, by Gods Law to eate, but onely the Prieſts. This was devoted to God, (and not ſo much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed) and by him asſigned to a ſpeciall uſe: yet from that diverted, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully without queſtion.</p>
            <p>And now I appeale to all Conſciences, Whether the necesſity of ſaving a Kingdome from the ſubverſion of Religion, Lawes and Liberties, be not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>Davids</hi> necesſitie was? And if [<hi>I will have mercy and not ſacrifice</hi>] did juſtifie <hi>Davids</hi> act, will it not theirs, who in a necesſity uſe or adminiſter the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> or Armes, which ordinarily is only to be admieiſtred by the King? Neither will <hi>Abimelech</hi> the Prieſts conſenting to <hi>David</hi> alter the Caſe: for it was devoted to God, and but in necesſity he might not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, nor <hi>David</hi> accepted. Necesſity then recalled that particular Bread, through devoted. So necesſity may recall this parcell of power in queſtion.</p>
            <p>Thus the Doctors ground failes him for our Caſe; yet 3. ſee what he adds, <q>[ſo although it were as they would have it that they give the power, and God approves (himſelfe oft hath ſaid, and cannot deny, but they give the Perſon his power and if they take it from his perſon, yet they may leave it to his Heire but wee argue not for ſo much) yet becauſe the Lords hand and his oyle alſo is upon the Perſon elected to the Crowne, and then he is the Lords Annointed, and the Miniſter of God, thoſe hands of the People which were uſed in lifting him up to the Crowne, may not againe be lift up againſt him, either to take the Crowne from his head, or the Sword out of his hand; this true inform'd Conſcience will not dare to doe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>REPL. 1. Is not Gods hand upon a Judge? Is not hee the Miniſter of God? Is not a King bound to God and to his People to appoint Judges, who may leſſe be ſpared in their Power, then the Monarch himſelfe (for what is his Power when an Infant? Is not the Kingdome then adminiſtred Ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally? But there muſt alwayes be Judges and inferiour officers in a large Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, or all government is loſt.)</p>
            <p>Will the Doctor ſay that the hands that have lift up the Judge or Officer to his ſeat (that is the Kings hands) may not bee lift up againſt him to pull him downe and pull off his Robes, or take the Sword out of his hand? The inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt that God hath in him, ſhall it preſerve him in his Office, in caſe eſpecially of <hi>Mal-Adminiſtration</hi>? But ſhall it (or hath it done) even ſo long as no offence is proved againſt him? The <hi>Parliament</hi> hath indeed deſired it for Judges and great Officers; but hath it been granted? Or what meanes the putting out of ſo many old Juſtices of Peace lately, without any Crime alleadged againſt them at all; of which more Countreys then one have at the Asſiſes complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a great grievance?</p>
            <p>What will the Doctor ſay to this? Yet they were Gods Miniſters and had
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:39617:21"/>
the Sword committed to them. If hee ſay the King was their Superiour, and ſo might take their Authoritie away, but the people is not Superiour to the King.</p>
            <p>REPLY. This ſatisfies not, becauſe notwithſtanding, here is a Perſon, in whom GOD hath an intereſt, and who is his Miniſter, deprived of his Authoritie: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he abuſes it, but meerely at pleaſure. The Drs. Reaſon then hath no ſtrength in it thus faare, or this done to inferiour Magiſtrates is not lawfull.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, what ſtrength is in his Argument, lies in the Kings being GODS anointed, and therefore the Crowne may not be taken from his Head by Men, this I have granted him before, and am ſo farre from recalling or diſputing againſt, that I will adde this word of confirmation to it. Suppoſing wee ſpeake of ſuch a Prince or Monarch, (call him King or Emperour, or Duke, or what you will) that is not depoſeable by the expreſſe Lawes of that Common-Wealth, as the <hi>Duke of Brabant was,</hi> and the <hi>Duke of Venice</hi> is, (for ſuch as thoſe Dukes were not properly ſupreame, nor GODS immediate Vicegerents, as <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and the like) I ſay then, that though in caſe of Mal-Adminiſtration, an inferiour Magiſtrate may be Lawfull and moſt juſtly, and neceſſarily depoſed by the Kings Authoritie; I will not ſay the like ſo long as they carry themſelves well, and are not meerely Annuall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, who alſo are glad uſually when their yeare is out, becauſe their Office is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and charge) yet a Supreame may not by the people, becauſe hee is GODS im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Vicegerent, and ſo ſpecially owned by Him, and have none upon Earth, unto whom GOD by any expreſſion in his Word, hath given Authoritie over them, to take their Crownes from their Heads. I ſay againe, as a Wife cannot take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way her Husbands Authority, becauſe ſhe is in no ſence above him. So unleſſe the Law of that State, name a Superiour to him that is in Tittle, the Prince to take his Crowne from him, in ſuch a caſe he cannot be depoſed by the Law of GOD, which appoints no perſons to do ſuch a thing, to illuſtrate which, Let me adde that in thoſe times, when GOD allowed by the Judiciall Law, a Man to put away his Wife, It did not allow a Woman to put away, or forſake her Husband, though I know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Saviours Time <hi>Ioſephus</hi> relates of Women having gotten that, among the Iewes, at leaſt ſome of them, as hee inſtances in <hi>Salome</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> who put away her Husband. But GOD allowed it not. And ſo that may bee lawfull for a Prince who is Superiour to doe to an Inferiour Magiſtrate, which is not lawfull for the people to doe to the Prince who is Supreme, no not in a like caſe of Mal-Adminiſtration. I could inſtance in ſundry other Prerogatives, in GODS Word to Superiours, which hold not (no not in like caſes) to Inferiours, but it needs not with the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as hath been oft ſaid.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But whereas the Dr. addes [<hi>Nor to take the Sword out of his hand</hi>] This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent divers wayes.

Secondly, the people tooke it out of <hi>Sauls</hi> hand when he would have put <hi>Ionathan</hi> illegally to death. Thirdly. If hee would kill himſelfe, it may be taken out of his hand. 4. Since out of all queſtion GOD never put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands, to kill the Innocent, nor much leſſe to ſubvert Religion Lawes, and Liberties, he being GODS anointed and GODS Miniſter for good, &amp;c. hinders not the taking the Sword ſo long out of his hand, till it hath beene ſufficiently imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to puniſh thoſe Malefactors and delinquents which he ſhould, but will not ſtrike with it, or rather will defend and imploy, S.

the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath done (ſuppoſing the neceſſity, of which hereafter,) is not to take the Sword out of his hand himſelfe grants (as was noted before in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the 19. <hi>Propoſitions</hi>) that the two <hi>Houſes</hi> have a legall power to puniſh, even ſuch as doe violence being his followers or Favourites, though countenanced with ſome ſurr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>REPLY.

            <p>The Dr. hath ſomewhat more to ſay againſt the Peoples power, applicable to our Kingdome. Let us heare it alſo.
<q>[How ſhall Conſcience be ſatisfied, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Peoples power, derived from their Election, when our Kings are ſuch by Inheritance, and claime not by Election, and the Crowne hath been oft ſetled by Conqueſt.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>REPLY. Neither is Conqueſt any thing of it ſelfe to power, or Lawfull Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, of which onely we argue; but only as it obtaines conſent by agreement, which is all one in Sence, and Effect with <hi>Election.</hi> Only <hi>Election</hi> ſounds more Freedome of will, Conqueſt Imports a Force occaſioning that will. But it is evident in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

that he that is free (as all men are by Nature, (as was ſaid before) except their bond to Parents) becomes not ſubject, <hi>de jure,</hi> till his Conſent, Agreement, or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction makes him ſo, and to no more then his Conſent reaches, explicitely or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely: and ſo for many men, they can no other way be ſubject to one, to a Prince or Monarch, but by their Agreement, whether for feare of his Force, or hopes of his vertue, he is not their King or Lord, till he be made ſo by their Conſent, I meane at firſt, and Originally.

               </gap> power, then an occaſion or Motive to conſent; conſent Choiſe Agreement are all in all. Secondly, as for <hi>Inheritance,</hi> it is nothing but a ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of conſent. Indeed poſteritie are bound to the conſent of their Parents for the Perſon, Family, qualification, but to no more. In all other Caſes and reſpects they are as free, as their Parents at firſt were. A Prince then onely inherites, what was given the firſt of the Nation, or others ſince by conſent of the people; and by writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law or cuſtome, he muſt claime any power he will exerciſe; or elſe he cannot plead any right title to it. And his qualification of power admits of encreaſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, as he and the People agree and conſent. His power is altogether derived by Election and conſent, firſt and laſt whence I will inferre no more, but as before, that therefore in caſe of neceſſity, the people may uſe ſo much of it as may ſuffice to ſave themſelves from Ruine; and that may be inferred from it, by what went before. As for his Repetition of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. and the <hi>Roman Emperours</hi> being Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs abſolute, I need ſay nothing to now, I have ſaid enough before.</p>
            <p>After this he comes to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Oath,</hi> which the Prince takes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what he promiſed, which he denies to make the Kings Admitttance to the <hi rend="margQuotes">Kingdome altogether conditionall, as is the meerely Elective Kingdomes of <hi>Polonia, Swethland</hi> &amp;c. and that it is nothing to allow reſiſtance, unleſſe in the Covenant could be ſhewed, that in caſe he will not diſcharge the truſt, it ſhall be Lawfull for the States to reſiſt,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>REPLY. The <hi>Oath</hi> is onely urged, to ſhew that the Kings Conſcience is bound more firmely then what he is ſworne to, and as a Teſtification of the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, in more Elective Kingdomes, the conditions of the Covenant are more largely perhaps and more ſolemnely explicite then in ſucceſſive, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

is altogether conditionall: not that the people may refuſe him at their will, without new Conditions, but that he may not refuſe the former Covenant, and Conditions by offering to take more power then thoſe gave him (or his Anceſtors which is all one) And if he doe, the people are not bound to obey thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands (the Dr, confeſſes before) and I adde as before, they may reſiſt his illegal Violences.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For now the caſe is all one, as if the choyce or agreement, Covenant, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We are a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Free-men, and whereas we might have agreed on an <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> We agreed on a King on ſuch and ſuch Covenants or Conditions, without mention that wee will reſiſt if he break them. But ſimply promiſe Obedience on thoſe Conditions, and he on thoſe accepts the Crowne. But next day breakes all, and ſhewes hee is bent to ſubvert all Religion, Lawes, and Liberties. How now in Reaſon (for of Scripture we ſpake enough before) can it be ſuppoſed, that ſuch a choyce or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath turned us into ſuch Slaves, as we muſt onely ſuffer, and not at all reſiſt, (or rather is not all reaſon plaine, that I have given away no more of my naturall freedome (which is to reſiſt all violence and wrong) then I meant and expreſt to give away. I ſay then, that unleſſe a Nation have covenanted not to reſiſt in ſuch and ſuch caſes, they have power to reſiſt, becauſe it is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall right each hath againſt all (except Parents) ſo farre is it from my being bound not to reſiſt, unleſſe I have expresſly covenanted that I may. Though withall I doe not ſay, that I may covenant at all to reſiſt in no caſe, as I ſhall have occaſion to ſhew anon.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in the meane time, if the Doctor grant that in caſe the agreement be, that if the Prince diſcharge not his truſt, the ſtates may take Armes and reſiſt, as in effect he ſeemes to doe, when he ſaith, <hi>That were ſomething,</hi> (for if he doe no ſuch agreement;) Then is not all Reſiſtance damnable, nor <hi>Rom</hi> 13.2. Rightly interpreted by him. For this and more the <hi>Brabancons</hi> had in their Agreement with their <hi>Duke,</hi> even to chooſe another, as the Doctor himſelfe tells us afterward. So ever now and then he muſt contradict his maine Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition by the force of truth.</p>
            <p>But he ſaith after, that<q> [The ſlender Plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Election, is thought to have a Covenant in it, but uſually the higher wee riſe in all Empires the freer Kings were, and ſtill downward the People gained on them.]</q>
And by this he would imply that ſpecially in ſuccesſive Kingdomes (as this) what ever may be ſaid of merely elective States, there can be no forfeiture of power by breach of Covenant made in after Ages by ſucceeding Princes.</p>
            <p>REPLY. In the firſt times, there was a great ſimplicity in all covenants, in ſale of Lands, and letting of Lands, and the like; yet no man ever ſold, or gave away, or lent more then hee meant; though the force and fraud of ill men, forced after Ages to more expreſs Covenants. In like ſort <hi>Ex malis moribus bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Leges,</hi> (as well between Prince and people, as between common men) the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Princes forced People to require them to ſundry neceſſary expreſſe Lawes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet theſe Lawes now for Phraſe or expresſion, will not in reaſon, be thought more then was intended in the firſt ſimple Covenant, how briefe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it were; for certainly free people, and in their right wits, never meant to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave themſelves to the wills and luſts of thoſe they choſe their Princes. But to be ſubject to them for their generall good; which when they found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:39617:23"/>
to be violated, or in danger to be ſo for want of expreſſe Lawes (ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of the Generall Law of Nature, the generall good of the ſociety) they were forced by necesſity to require them to make ſuch Lawes, for their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſafety, and particularly alſo to prevent inferiour officers from tyranny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the ſuperiour: and ſo to prevent all necesſity of Armes within themſelves. And ſome good Princes for their peoples comfort have even been forward of themſelves to make ſuch Lawes, which yet without our making, they were bound for the moſt part to have done accordingly for the welfare of their Dominions. The People then have gained nothing for the great part of Lawes for their Liberties, but ability to claime them as undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more then before; nor have Princes loſt any thing almoſt, but a power of impoverſhing &amp; ruining their Subjects ſo much as before they ſeemed to have for the ſatisfying of their owne Prodigalities and Luſts. Still then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines that the People had a right to all fitting Liberties, even after they ſubmitted to a King: unleſſe they expresſly gave them away; as unto ſome C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So ſtill conſent gave what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a Prince could or can challenge. I ſay then once more unleſſe in the firſt foundation of a State, Kingdome or Empire (and this Kingdome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly) the People did make their King ſo abſolute, as to give away all power of reſiſtance from themſelves in any caſe; (which the Doctor I beleeve will never be able to prove of this, or any other Civill State) though they made no expreſſe conditions or Covenant, much leſſe any mention of reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a power of reſiſtance; yet the Law of Nature allowed them ſtill ſome Liberties; (what they were we ſhall have occaſion to ſcan in the next Section:) and amongſt them this for one, to reſiſt any violence againſt themſelves, in any thing that the Law of Nature did undoubtedly make them ſtill Maſters of, and was not ſubjected to their Princes power.</p>
            <p>But the Doctor concludes his reaſoning againſt ſuch power of reſiſtance to be in our <hi>Parliament</hi> with that which indeed hath leaſt ſhew of ſtrength of any thing he hath ſaid yet.</p>
            <p>Thus he writes, <q>[where the King as it is ſaid, never dies, where he is King before Oath or Coronation, where hee is not admitted upon any ſuch Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation as gives any power to the People, or the repreſentative Body as is pretended to; nay, where the Body cannot meet but by the will of the Prince, and is diſſoluble at his pleaſure, that therein ſuch a State, ſuch a Pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r ſhould be pretended to, and uſed againſt the Prince, as at this day, and that according to the Fundamentals of ſuch a State, can never appeare reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any indifferent judgement, much leſſe ſatisfie Conſcience in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance that is now made by ſuch a pretended Power.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>REPL. This is the moſt plauſible Plea he hath or any can bring, ſpecially the latter part of it, about the calling and diſſolving the Parliament at the Kings will and pleaſure. But to this alſo as well as all the reſt ſufficient ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I doubt not may be given before indifferent judgements and unpartiall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:39617:24"/>
Conſciences, in the manner following. Firſt, as the King never dies; ſo he never growes, he never hath more authority (unleſſe by a new grant from the people) then his firſt Predeceſſor had; unleſſe it can be proved, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then gave away their liberty of defence from outragious violence, which all are naturally inveſted with; it is free for them now as well as it was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day or houre after they choſe or conſented to their firſt King as was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed before.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as he is King before Oath or Coronation. So he gives away none of his Rights in his Oath, nor doe the People when they crowne him. But he there profeſſes himſelfe bound by his Kingly Office to rule ſo and ſo, for the common good, and they yeeld no more to him, then they did to his firſt Predeceſſor, as before.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as he is not admitted upon any ſuch capitulation in expreſſe terms, as mention this power of reſiſtance in the people, or repreſentative body, in caſe of Tyranny. So nor doe the people at his admittance expreſſe a yeelding to him ſuch abſolute power, as they may not, or will not in any caſe reſiſt, I ſay againe and againe, it can never be rationally conceived the people have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away ſuch a naturall liberty, ſuch a neceſſary power for their common ſafety: Unleſſe it can be proved that they have done ſo. The proofe then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Barre of indifferency of judgement, and unpartiall conſcience will lie on the Doctors part not ours.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, But he ſaith, the repreſentative Body cannot meet but by the will of the Prince, and is diſſoluble at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>REPL. 2. It hath been ſo <hi>de facto multo,</hi> but whether it bee altogether ſo <hi>de jure,</hi> may juſtly be queſtioned upon theſe grounds. Firſt, for their meeting, when the Prince is an Infant, or if a priſoner in enemies hands, and ſo cannot give out a legall Warrant for their meeting; or if diſtracted, hath not the State power to meet in <hi>Parliament</hi> for their common ſafety, and the Princes too? They have met in the infancy or minority of Kings, and made Lawes, as in <hi>Edw.</hi> the 6. time, and not by the meere power of the <hi>Protectour,</hi> for the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity after put him out (his head was cut off afterward by a Law made while he was Protectour.) It was then, (and could be nothing elſe but) the inherent power of State, to meet ſo, in caſes of necesſity. Yet I beleeve there is no writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law for this; but the generall <hi>Maxim</hi> of <hi>Salus Populi ſuprema lex.</hi> And this will extend to the caſe of Tyranny, as fully as any of the former, if not more. Withall, did not the Lords in <hi>Richard</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">nds.</hi> time, call a <hi>Parliament</hi> without the King, wherein they had their grievances redreſſed; and this afterward was confirmed in the firſt of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, then for their diſſolving; It hath indeed beene very much practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by our two laſt Kings.</p>
            <p>But our Hiſtories (ſo farre as I remember) <hi>quare</hi> whether <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. did not diſſolve ſome <hi>Parliaments</hi> in diſcontent? mention not any ſuch thing as a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> diſſolved in diſpleaſure, or againſt the deſire of the Houſes. But as they meet very frequently, oft-times every yeare, ſomtimes oftner; (ſo that in the ſpace of a hundred yeares there are counted above a 100. <hi>Parliaments</hi>) So they ſate till they had ended the Princes and their owne buſineſſes, which went much together; and ſo it never came to a matter of examination or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the delay of calling them to meet, or the too timely diſſolution of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:39617:24"/>
Parliaments were not wont to bee ſo odious or dreadfull to Princes as within theſe forty yeares they have been. By whoſe default they have been ſo ſince, let the encrochments upon <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the Subjects liberties direct any to judge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But further, for both theſe. Firſt, the <hi>Parliament</hi> averres that there are Lawes that there ſhould be a Parliament every yeare, and ſo they have abated of their Right, rather then gained upon the King by the Act of the <hi>Trienniall Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And for the diſſolution I have heard ſome wiſemen affirme, that by Law it cannot be diſſolved, while there are any Petitions of grievances, or ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of importance, depending and unfiniſhed. Whereunto may be added moſt juſtly, that in ordinary times Countrey Gentlemen and Noblemen, and in a manner the whole body of the Parliament, would be as ſick of a long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and continuall attendance as the King could wiſh, and would petition (rather then be tyed ſo by the legge) for a diſſolution, or at leaſt a Prorogation. And it's well enough knowne, that even this Parliament after the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation</hi> paſt, were as weary of ſitting, as need to be deſired, till the <hi>Rebellion</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſeconded by the growing evills at home, put new ſpirits into them, and forced them to that diligence of attendance and unwearied labours (ſo many as have taken the common good to heart) as no Age or Story can pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel here, or in any other Kingdome or Nation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, beyond all this I appeale againe to the <hi>Kings Anſwer</hi> to the 19. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi> formerly mention'd; and aske whether if the King have abſolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to forbeare calling them, at his will; and to diſſolve them at his pleaſure; it be not a meere nothing that hee ſaith the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> have power to impeach his owne Followers and Favorites, who have broken the Lawes, even by ſurreptitiouſly gotten commands from the King: and that the Lords have power to judge and puniſh, and are an excellent skreene between the King and the people, to asſiſt each againſt any incroachings of the other, and by juſt Iudgements to preſerve the Law, which ought to be the rule of every one of the three: and that the Power legally placed in both Houſes is more then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prevent and reſtraine the power of Tyranny.</p>
            <p>What ſerves all this for, when his Favourites will keepe him from calling a Parliament, perhaps all his dayes, unleſſe unlook'd for nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſity force him to it? We haoe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eene our ſelves about 13. yeares without one; and had there not beene conceived hopes that there would have beene Money given againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> it had not been then called as it was.</p>
            <p>Againe, what ſerves the calling them, when the ſame Favourites being queſtioned, ſhall counſell a diſſolution? We have knowne that too, even three times in this Kings Reigne, and no other diſſolution but on theſe grounds. And the laſt was within three weekes becauſe they would not in all haſt (and contrary to all former Preſidents and Priviledges) give mony againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and embroyle the two Kingdomes in a perpetuall Warre, not having had one grievance redreſſed. And in the caſe of a Prince, bent or ſeduced to ſubvert Religion Lawes and Liberties (which is the Doctors Caſe propounded.) It is undoubted, he will if he can diſſolve them, as ſoone as they offer but to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh any of his Favourites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo to croſſe the deſigne (unleſſe he dare not, of which anon) becauſe therefore I believe the King in that Anſwer, hath not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:39617:25"/>
aſcribed more then right to the <hi>Parliament.</hi> It will follow, that in right (ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſuch caſe) they ought not to be diſſolved. And that if by force they ſhould be, (or ſhould not have been called at all) the People have right to meet together, when and where they can, in a Parliamentary manner or otherwiſe: to ſuch end as to defend themſelves and one another from tyranny and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned ſubverſion of Religion, Lawes and Liberties, as hath beene often ſaid.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, but for the preſent condition of our Kingdome and Parliament, I muſt profeſſe, that as I admire the providence of God, in the Act paſſed for the continuation of this Parliament; ſo I doe for the forementioned expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the King in that anſwer. Which laid together, may to any underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding men, wholly decide this firſt Queſtion betweene the Doctor and us in point of Legality in our Kingdome (if there were nothing elſe ſaid or to be ſaid) that ſuppoſing ſuch a deſigne to ſubvert Religion, Lawes and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This Parliament hath (if no other had or could have, being diſſoluble at pleaſure) compleat power and Authority to doe all they doe, that ſo they may prevent and reſtraine the deſigned tyranny.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Yet I have one thing more to alleadge, ſuppoſing the power of calling and diſſolving wholly in the King ordinarily; yet there may be ſuch power in them ſo long as they doe ſit to command Armes to bee rais'd for the ſuppresſing of any Delinquents, maintaining themſelves with Armes, even under the colour of the Kings Authority, which I thus make good. (If there be any ſuch kind of Power in the very Judges in their Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> for the whole Kingdome; and in their ſeverall Circuits for the Shires they ſit in; although themſelves are made Judges at the Kings will meerly, and put out ordinarily at his pleaſure, and they can neither keepe Asſizes at any time, nor keep any Terme any where, but when and ſo long as the King pleaſes to give Commisſion: if (I ſay) there be ſuch a power in the Judges, and even in one of them; then much more in the whole Parliament, which is unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably and undoubtedly the higheſt Judicature in the Kingdome, and hath moſt power during their ſitting. Now that ſuch a kinde of power is in the Judges, I appeale to experience, in the caſe following</p>
            <p>A private man hath a ſuite with the King about Land or Houſe and the like. The King hath poſſesſion and ſome Officer or Tenant of his holds it for the King. The Judges having heard the Cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> give Sentence for the Subject, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge him to have the poſſesſion delivered him by the Kings Tenant or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer; he refuſes and armes himſelfe to keep poſſesſion ſtill Upon this, after due ſummons and proceſſe of law, a Writ of Rebelli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hority in his Lawes.</p>
            <p>Here now is raiſing Armes by the Kings legall Authority againſt the Kings Title and the Kings Officer notwithſtanding any pretended authority from the Kings perſonall command; and that Officer ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:39617:25"/>
but whether that would hinder Law or not?) The Parliament then may in the caſe of necesſity raiſe Armes againſt the Kings perſonall Command, for the generall ſafety, and keeping poſſesſion (which is more neceſſary then the hope of regaining) of the Houſes, Lands, Goods, Liberties, Lives, Religion and all.</p>
            <p>And this by the Kings legall Authority, and the reſiſters of this are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells in the Lawes account, and not the Inſtruments ſo imployed Legally, though with Armes by the Parliament.</p>
            <p>If the Doctor now (or any for him) will retort upon me, as he thinks, what I ſaid before, that if this be granted, a King intending Tyranny, will not call a Parliament; or if he have called it, he will ſtraight diſſolve it, as ſoone as they attempt any thing againſt his mind.</p>
            <p>REPL. I reply, he will doe ſo indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if hee can perſwade the people, by the Doctors Divinity or Law, to endure him and his followers to take away their Goods, and doe what elſe he liſt; and they for want of a Parliament called or ſitting, dare not defend themſelves at all. But if hee find, that they believe no ſuch Doctrine; but without diſpute of Law or Conſciences reſolve ruſtically not to be robbed of their goods at pleaſure, or uſed like meere ſlaves; but that they will defend themſelves and ſomwhat they begin to doe, and beat away or kill ſome that come to take their goods away in ſuch ill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gall manner; he may then be glad to call a Parliament to quiet the People, who perhaps alſo may begin to mutiny by troopes; and be willing to ſacrifice perhaps ſome of his Followers unto them (as <hi>

            </p>
            <p>Therefore I conclude, that the Parliament (as I ſaid before) may have this power and upon advantage of the Kings necesſities, and Peoples not enduring oppresſion, be able to exerciſe it, even though they meet not but at the Kings will, and are diſſoluble at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And ſo I have ſaid enough of this <hi>Section,</hi> except onely that I muſt note, that in the cloſe of it, he either thinks thoſe he hath to doe with (Parliament and all) groſſe fooles, or elſe he ſhewes himſelfe extreamly ſimple in reckoning up the remedies of Tyrranny (though he love not to uſe ſo harſh a word; but we muſt when hee hath ſtated the Caſe for us of a Prince bent or ſeduced to ſubvert Religion, Lawes and Liberties;) The <hi>denying of ſubſidies and ayd, &amp;c.</hi> If hee meane in Parliament, ſuch a Prince never meanes to call any.

            <p>REPLY. This Reaſon we acknowledge ours, and conſidering what a State is, a Body compoſed of many thouſands, who by themſelves (or their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors) ſet up a King over them, for their ſafety and good, this Reaſon is as much Reaſon, as any thing can be betweene Man and Man: Nor ſhall the Dr. bee ever able to ſpeake Reaſon in Oppoſition to it; himſelfe grants ſtraight way, that <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Populi</hi> in a good Sence, is <hi>ſuprema Lex.</hi> And when a People, neither ſeekes nor deſires any thing of hurt to their Prince, but onely ſafety to themſelves, It is good in no ſence, if not in this; to allow (I ſay more command) a State that hath any conſiderable ſtrength to doe it, to defend it ſelfe, and ſo procure its owne ſafety, even by reſiſting if need be, by force of Armes.

This is but a ſecond calumny, of which his Treatiſe is full every where, neither profit nor Imagination is admitted or urged in this caſe, but neceſſity appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or judged imminent by Rules of prudence, which commands endeavour of prevention of extreme evills (ſuch as the ruine of a States ſafety) even by care and Power before hand, as well as when it lies gaſping under the preſſure. Counſell in prevention is indeed better then help out of trouble: For by that leſſe trouble is ſuffered, and leſſe offence acted in the defence.</p>
            <p>But theſe are but the Drs flouriſhes, for he will now ſtabbe this reaſon to the heart with diverſe contrary Reaſons, againſt all the plea of Neceſſity of ſafety.

            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:39617:26"/>Secondly, but he is deceived in paralelling the Caſes. They pleade for the Popes Power of curbing or depoſing Kings in caſe of Hereſie, becauſe elſe the Church hath not meanes for the maintenance o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> The Argument is not good, his Church is not a Civill State, but the good of it is mainly ſpirituall, and to be preſerved by ſuch ſpirituall meanes, as GOD hath appointed, who both inſtituted and conſtituted it himſelfe, and left not to it, the ordering of its owne ſafety or good. But our caſe is of a Civill State, whoſe good is Civill and naturall, and is to be preſerved by civill and naturall meanes, and ſo by Armes in caſe of danger, even from its owne Prince, bent or ſeduced to ruine it. The Dr. himſelfe ſtraightwayes grants, the State hath meanes of preſervation ſuch as the Law hath preſcribed. If he can ſhew us any true meanes, in the caſe ſtated by him, but this power of reſiſtance, I yield him the cauſe. If not he doth but abuſe his Readers Conſcienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, to blind them with words, which are of no validity. But I have ſhewed him before, and muſt againe remember him, that in our <hi>Parliament</hi> State (by the Kings owne acknowledgement) hath ſuch Power by Law to puniſh even the Kings followers and Favourites, as is more then ſufficient to prevent, or reſtraine Tyranny. We aske no more for our ſafety. But when they will reſiſt the <hi>Parliament</hi> by Armes, It hath no way to puniſh them, or defend the State but by Armes Which therefore it may lawfully take up.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Dr. addes <q>(If every ſtate hath ſuch Meanes to provide for its ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, what meanes of ſafety had the Chriſtian Religion in, and after the Apoſtles Times? Or the People then enſlaved, what meanes had they for their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apologie ſaith, the Chriſtians had number and Force ſufficient to withſtand, but they had no Warrant.

               <hi>Reply.</hi> This example of the Chriſtians not reſiſting is counted a Capitall Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhall ſee what ſtrength it hath. Firſt it is brought in this place, for the Chriſtians were neither a civill State, (of which the preſent Reaſon proceeds) nor neere to the greater number in the The State. They had the Lawes (which is in ſome Sence the State) againſt them, and ſo they ever had beene, and the greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> part of the body of the Eſtate by farre, were oppoſite, even in <hi>Tertullians</hi> Time. Though therefore the Church being properly onely a ſpirituall State, have not of neceſſity, civill meanes to provide for the outward ſafety of Chriſtians: yet a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill State, (whether of Heathens or Chriſtians) may have and hath, which is by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Armes, in caſe of neceſſity as before. But the Dr. ſaith the Apoſtle forbids them and all, under the Higher power to reſiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> I ſuppoſe what I have formerly ſaid on this place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. may and will ſatisfie moſt Readers for that place. But the Drs. importunity forces me to repeate part of it here, and apply it to the caſe of Chriſtians, even then, and much more now: And ſo I make bold to tell the Dr. that he doth moſt miſerably wreſt the Apoſtles words in this caſe of all others, which to demonſtrate (I ſay to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate) I appeale to the context after and before, and let all Chriſtians, and Conſciences, or even reaſonable Men, Iudge whether the Drs. Interpretation be not moſt abſurd. Thus the Dr. interprets v. 2.
<q>[Whoſoever ſhall take up Armes to reſiſt <hi>Nero,</hi> perſecuting the Chriſtian Religion, reſiſts the Ordinance of GOD; Rebells againſt GOD in reſiſting the higher Power ordained by GOD, and if hee kill any man in ſuch reſiſtance, he commits murther, &amp; incurres damnation for ſo doing.]</q> This is the Drs.

Chriſtianity is a good worke, and <hi>Nero</hi> is a terrour to it (though by GODS Ordinance he ſhould not be) therefore he muſt not be reſiſted.

I have a fourth too take to formerly ſayde downe, which is that he ſpeakes of Civill Legall Authoritie in civill Lawes as then in the Romane State and ſuch like, and to Rulers according to them were not terrours to good Workes; as the Apoſtle ſaith.</p>
            <p>Secondly, but ſee the Apoſtles next words, wilt thou then not be affraid of the Power, doe that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame, that is thou needſt not reſiſt, but onely looke to doe well, and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o their Power, would praiſe them for; and they need not feare ſuch powers doing well.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, adde further what the Apoſtle doth, v. 4. [For hee is the Miniſter of GOD to thee for gooD,] Is this true of perſecuting <hi>Nero,</hi> in the caſe of his perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? Whereby the Apoſtle proves he will prayſe thee, doing that which is good? Surely in an over-ruling Worke of GODS Grace, the very Divell is GODS inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for GOOD, as to <hi>Iob,</hi> (and we may ſay M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>niſter too.) And <hi>Nero</hi> not a whit more in the Act of perſecuting. Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this farre from St. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning: For hee meanes a civill good, praiſing, and rewarding, and protecting. <hi>Nero</hi> did (St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew) quite contrary to this: He cannot then meane him as a Perſecuter; and ſo never intends here to forbid reſiſting his Perſecution.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, goe on one ſtep further with the Apoſtle, which will yet make it more plaine if more can be; [But if you doe that which is evill then feare, for he beares not the Sword in vaine, for hee is the Miniſter of GOD, a Revenger to ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cenſe into the Fire, by way of ſacrifice to their Idolls, they were freed. Now is it St. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, If you turne Idolater then
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:39617:27"/>
feare, for <hi>Nero</hi> beares not the Sword in vaine, for he is GODS Miniſter, a Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to execute Wrath upon them that commit Idolatrie? Or is Chriſtianitie the evill they were to feare, as that which he uſed the Sword againſt, and that with great wrath and revenge? There is then nothing like the Drs Interpretation, In all theſe Arguments of the Apoſtle: but the cleane contrary, beſides what followes, v. 5, 6, 7. Of which ſee the expoſition before.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, was it then lawfull for the Chriſtians, then to have reſiſted the perſecuting Emperours? <hi>Tertullian</hi> and the Fathers thought otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, firſt, whether it were or no, (of which by and by) moſt certaine, it was not forbidden in this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2, 3, 4. Yet this is the Capitall place. If any other can be found forbidding it, which the Dr. offers not to urge, further then what we have examined already, that is nothing to this Text. For no Logick or Rhetorick can extract that ſence from hence; who ever they be, that have ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted it heretofore.</p>
            <p>Secondly, but becauſe of the great Outcry made of the Chriſtians not reſiſting then, I will once more looke upon the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. and compare it alſo with that before ſo: v. 1. and ſee whether by a right view, it will not plainly pronounce Chriſtians even then, free from paſſive ſubjection in caſe of perſecution (ſuppoſing they had Force to reſiſt, by their hands not tyed by <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinance from reſiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſo farre as this, they are to be ſubjected unto by every ſoule, either actively or at leaſt paſſively, and not to be reſiſted, by wilfull froward diſobedience, and much leſſe by taking up Armes againſt ſuch Lawes, or them that exerciſe authoritie to them. But this is all the Authority GOD gives to any, and not to make Lawes againſt his, nor yet to puniſh thoſe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A King grants a Charter to a Major of a Towne to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne that Towne (with others, or alone, that is all one) according to his Lawes, and puniſh all Malefactors, and moreover to make ſome particular Lawes or Orders in the Towne, for the better keeping all in due Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to the Maior, and forbids to reſiſt him, as long as he rules by the Kings Lawes, or by ſuch as his Charter enables him to make, being not againſt the Kings; that therefore they may not reſiſt him, if he would maſſacre them, (or under colour of his new made Lawes) condemne them becauſe they will not be Traitors to their King, and ſubmit to an uſurper? will the Dr. ſay it? or any elſe? and is not this the very caſe if men will thinke of it, if a King ſhould make (or hath made) Lawes, that men ſhould worſhip the Sun, worſhip an Idoll, an Image?

The Lawes that are in themſelves Null: the Authoritie Null: ſo farre forth: no kind of Subjection then is due to them in this from this Text. Nor is any Ordinance of GOD at all reſiſted in reſiſting them. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it not a Duty [But the Chriſtians did not reſiſt, though <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſay they had number and Force ſufficient.]</p>
            <p>REPLY. Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> in his Anticavalieriſme hath very rationally ſhewed, firſt that in all probability <hi>Tertullian</hi> was miſtaken in his Computation, if he mean it throughout the Empire. They might have ſome conſiderable number and ſo force in one place or City, and not enough in generall. Secondly, that if they had ſo, yet generally it was not knowne to Chriſtians, and that is all one in ſuch a caſe, he that knowes not his ſtrength dares not reſiſt, no more then hee that hath no ſtrength. Thirdly, that if they knew their ſtrength, yet they did not know it lawfull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt generally. Some might know it, yet not preach it for feare; and if it were not generally beleeved, they would not reſiſt. Fourthly, that there were ſpeciall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why GOD might conceale this from them, this Liberty of reſiſtance. Of all this there are many conſiderable things in that treatiſe (<hi>Vide:</hi>) I will only adde this One, that if Reſiſtance ſeeme ſo unfitting now, it would have ſeemed much more then. The Chriſtian Religion came in upon the Roman Empire as a Novelty, and neither they not their Anceſtours for many Generations had any Principles (but the remote ones of the Law of Natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) to perſwade them to give it Entertainment. So that to have reſiſted by Armes, would have ſeemed a great obſtinacy and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But now the caſe is much otherwiſe in regard of Proteſtants perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by Popiſh Princes, ſpecially recalling Lawes of toleration, or changing Lawes eſtabliſhing the Religion.

            <p>I ſay then an Abſolute Arbitrary Power, or abſolute Monarchy (as ſome call it) is not at all the Ordinance of GOD; and ſo no lawfull Power ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from reſiſtance by <hi>Rom..</hi> 13.2.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:39617:29"/>
Word ſpeaks the Contrary every where. Secondly GOD not allowing, Men cannot give it, to a Conquerour, or any other. They can give but what GOD allowes, for they have no more their owne, in that ſence. Now no man can give any thing but what is his owne. Thirdly, particularly, no man is allowed by GOD, or can be made by Man, an abſolute Monarch, a meere Arbitrary Prince in point or Relig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on. I am farre from denying Authority about Circumſtantialls in Religion. But I meane, he hath no Authority to bid what GOD forbids, or to forbid what GOD bids; or puniſh them that obey GOD rather than him. GOD never gave this Power, nor can men give it. Fourthly no Monarch hath any Power from GOD, or can have from men, to violate the Chaſtity of any. A Law of <hi>Platoes Community,</hi> is null, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe againſt GODS expreſſe 7th. Commandement, and may and ought to be reſiſted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (yet now we are among civill matters.) Fiftly, no Monarch hath any Power from GOD, or can have from men, to take away the life of his Subjects, any one at his meere pleaſure, or without a Law broken, (whether Civill or Martiall.) and knowne to the Tranſgreſſour, or which he ought to have knowne, and might (which <hi>Ionathan</hi> could not, hee had no meanes to know of his Fathers Oath being then made, and in his abſence) <hi>Lycurgus</hi> his Law to deſtroy all Children that were deformed, or weakelings, and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Arbitrary Command to deſtroy all the Iſraelitiſh Males, were both alike ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous and null: and might have been reſiſted. In all theſe caſes there is, I ſay, no abſolute Monarchy, no meere arbitrary Power, Lawfull, none that is GODS Ordinance. And whoſoever challenges ſuch Power, is (in that) not GODS Deputy, but an Vſurper, whether King or Caeſar, Roman or Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Emperour or any other. Sixtly, but the only Caſes wherein a Monarch may be abſolute in Matter of Liberty of mens perſons, of Goods, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if any bee ſo (which I beleeve not of the Roman State, though much was done arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Emperours) I yield they may not reſiſt though they be ſorely pincht. They may thanke themſelves who bound their owne if therefore our <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in after Ages (or this by being forſaken by the People, ſeduced by the Dr.) ſhould ſo enſlave us, we muſt beare it and not reſiſt, becauſe it is our owne Act, who chooſe them and put all ſuch things into their hands, but in other things we ſhould not, could not be bound, as I ſaid before.</p>
            <p>The Doctor hath a third Reaſon [We cannot expect abſolute meanes of ſafety and ſecurity in a State but, ſuch as are reaſonable]</p>
            <p>REPL. If by abſolute meanes of ſafety and ſecurity hee meane ſuch as God cannot defeat; we grant what he ſaith, or ſuch as God hath forbidden. But if he take it of rationall means; he ſaith nothing at all that allotts any means which are not abſolutely ſufficient (according to humane proceedings) to procure ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed. A State is a moſt conſiderable body, and may challenge all posſible meanes which God hath not denyed them; and ſo even a private man may, being altogether innocent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> except where a greater good then his Particular life, calls him to venture it, or yeeld it up. But
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:39617:29"/>
there is no greater good on earth (in civill reſpects) then the ſafety of a ſtate. Therefore all meanes not forbidden from Heaven are reaſonable, and to bee expected and uſed, though not expresſly provided for (that is mentioned) in the Fundamentalls of this Government, which the Doctor would require. Then he falls a commending the excellent temper of the three Eſtates, King, Lords, Commons, having each a power of denying.</p>
            <p>REPL. They have ſo; in making particular Lawes. But the Queſt. now is of exerciſing the generall and maine fundamentall Law of all States, to ſave the whole from ruine and ſubverſion. Here though all three agreeing (and none denying) makes the ſafety more ſecure, and more comfortable and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable. Yet no reaſon, but in a Co-ordinate Power (as here it is plainly ſo; ſee the Fuller Anſwer to the Doctors Booke) any two or of three or even any one of them, rather then all ſhould faile and be diſſolved, ſhould have Power to endeavour the common ſafety which the others neglect or intend to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or betray.</p>
            <p>And I verily beleeve the Doctor himſelfe or any other of his partie (if hee forbeare not to ſay ſo much leaſt it ſhould be retorted on himſelfe) will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that the King and the Lords may ſave the Kingdome from ruine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or againſt the Houſe of Commons; and the King and the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, without or againſt the Lords: and which is yet more, the King alone without or againſt both Lords and Commons. For indeed, this is the very thing now pretended by the King for his taking Armes to ſave the Proteſtant Religion and the Lawes, and his owne Rights, &amp;c. which he ſaith, the Lords and Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>riots ought not onely not to joyne with them in their Armes, but to joyne with the King in his againſt them.</p>
            <p>And if it could be posſible that all the three Eſtates ſhould agree to ruine Religion and the State; even the Body of the People, ſhould (by vertue of the power which each State hath for its neceſſary ſafety) have Authority ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to defend themſelves, and reſiſt all outragious Attempts of miſchiefe (as hath been proved before) though then for want of many conveniences and perhaps of wiſedome to manage it, the defence and reſiſtance muſt needs be much more hazardous and dfficult.

            <p>The Doctors reproaches againſt the <hi>Parliament</hi> I paſſe. Only where he ſayes [Conſcience might demand for its ſatisfaction.

            <p>REPL. Satisfaction may well be given: Firſt, by ſaying it is evident the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of the Houſe of Commons, when they were moſt full were all that way, that 100. are now (though that be a ſlander for but a while ſince there were 300. there) The King a yeare agoe in <hi>

               </gap>eighth they now are. 2. If yet the Major part were of another judgement they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come and vote and end the buſineſſe. The Houſe hath often called the abſent, and puniſht ſome for it; certainly they knew then there were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough againſt them of their Members to over-vote them 3. They that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abſent, are offenders againſt the Law and the common good; and ſo are not to be truſted; or thought to have wiſedome, to ſee things right how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoever they may pretend to be. For alſo 40 being the legall number for the Houſe of Commons to vote any thing: It is againſt all Rules of Politick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that the abſence of others, (there being th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

One judge of Asſize, two Commisſioners or Arbitrators, and the like, ſuffice for any Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe: and though ſtill the greater number, the more honour and comfort; yet a legall number muſt and will ever ſuffice. 5 As for the Lords, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their abſence forced by reaſon of Tumults. Firſt, this by an Almanack, (as the Doctor ſpeaks elſewhere) may be confuted, the greateſt part of thoſe that came, and after withdrew; ſtayed a conſiderable time after the Tumults, till the King was gotten to Yorke, and begun to call them away. And if his calling them away, or their withdrawing themſelves ſhall have power to make the votes or judgement of a part that are yet reſident there (as the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. hath learned to call them) <hi>Null,</hi> or not to be regarded: then have the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſuch a number of Lords, and Commons, even out of the Parliament-Houſe, power to diſanull a Law (even the Law for the not diſſolving of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without an Act for it, which muſt paſſe all the 3. Eſtates, both Houſes and the King and in which each have their power of Denying.) And this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone (what ever might be pretended againſt other Parliaments) makes the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Votes of the two Houſes the full judgement and Authority of the whole repreſentative Body of the Kingdome, how few ſoever be preſent, or how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſo ever be abſent, and upon what pretence ſoever. 2. But withall, if I were Confeſſour or Chaplaine to any of thoſe Lords that have withdrawne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and upon pretetence of the Tumult, deny to returne: I would make bold
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:39617:30"/>
to aske them this Qu. in their eares (for their conſciences ſatisfactoin, as well as mine owne) which City and Countrey rung of them, and which produced ſuch and ſo many Petitions, for the ſetling of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and helping <hi>Ireland,</hi> and outing the Biſhops and Popiſh Lords out of the Houſe of Peeres; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their refuſing to concurre in the reliefe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in ſecuring the Kingdome, even in petitioning the King for the ſettling of the <hi>Militia</hi> (which yet the King after, acknowledged neceſſary to be ſetled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) were not the true and only cauſe of thoſe tumults that were? And if ſo, where was their judgement to ſee the means of ſafety, or their conſcience to provide for it? And then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their owne guilt did not more ſend or drive them away, then any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Tumults? Which tumults yet I approve not, nor ever did. But if God ſo puniſhed thoſe that would not diſcharge the truſt, it is eaſier to anſwer that queſtion, why ſo many remaining ſhould ſee more, that is better; then thrice ſo many (if ſo many) diſſenting and withdrawne.</p>
            <p>As for the Doctors preferring Monarchy before Ariſtocracy, hee ſhall not have me for his Adverſary; who thank God, I am borne and live (and hope to dye) under a Monarchy; though not abſolute, as the Doctors Poſition would make him (when he liſted) though the Doctor wiſely diſclaimes any ſuch intention. But for his reaſons, why a King ſhould ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e better then the Major part of both the Houſes,; becauſe he ſees even with their eyes, though diſſenting from them; and hath other Councel beſides, and that he hath many reaſons to perſwade him to conſent to their free and unanimous Votes: All this is moſt unreaſonable as the Queſtion is now ſtated, of a Prince bent to ſubvert Religion Laws, and Liberties, (for we are ſtill upon that generall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in this <hi>Section</hi>) for whatever they ſee, he will be ſure (as farre as he ſees his owne ſtrength) to conſent to nothing that ſhall hinder his deſigne. And therefore to plead his power of denying, or his wiſdome in this caſe, is to yeeld him all power to bee a Tyrant. Which after all, the Dr. will yet prove he hath ſo farre as he may not be reſiſted in it, by the inconveniences that will follow if he have it not. Heare his ſaying.

It is a Signe the Tyranny was deepely and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately reſolved, if it cannot be reſiſted by a meer defence, but that muſt tend to the overthrow of the life of the Common-wealth 4. The tyranny breaks the Order, ſtabs at the life of the Common-wealth; and yet the Dr. is ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous an advocate for it (however he deny it) that (he cryes whore firſt) he cries out of the danger to Order. 5. To tend to the overthrow of that Order which is the life of the Common-wealth, may be a fallacious phraſe. Doth it tend ſo neceſſarily, or in the intention of the Reſiſters? Or rather contrary? Or doth it ſo tend to overthrow it, as the Tyranny to (be reſiſted) doth? All remedies of violent and deſperate diſeaſes, doe in ſome Sort tend to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of the Life of the Body: Yet none ſaies the remedy is worſe then the diſeaſe, which that is knowne to bee mortall, the other may prevent death. 6. This opens no ſuch gap to the people to reſiſt and overthrow pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er duly adminiſtred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Doctors doth open a gappe to Tyranny.

               <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. I have ſatisfied this Objection for the maine of it already. 1. That it is lawfull for the people to reſiſt even the Tyranny of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together outrageous, (as in our Queſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on) not elſe. 2. That the principles of defence cannot be drawne to a neceſſary change of the Government. Of which I adde 2. Reaſons. One that the defence will ſuffice without it, if wiſely managed to ſecure the ſafety of the State and Religion; ſo: morally. For ſtill men, ſome or other, muſt be truſted; and thoſe that diſcredit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a while may merit a truſt againe afterward: Enough for their honour and comfort and not too much for the Common-wealth, and they need not be truſted (as before) till they do merit a truſt againe. And yet no oppoſition much leſſe change of government. 3. The next government (ſuppoſe each ſhire (as the Dr. talkes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Common-wealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all governed by a Folkmoot) is ſtill liable in all reaſon, to miſchiefes, as bad, or worſe then were in that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment rejected. And this they among the people that are not growne bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and bruitiſh (by ſuffering Tyranny and loſſe of Religion and Liberties, by the <hi>Drs</hi> principles) may be made ſo ſenſible of; that they will never offer to attempt ſuch a madneſſe. 3. Make a people Religious (as much as man can make them) and let them enjoy the comfort of doing that which is good as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of Rulers praiſing ſuch. And then the Rulers need not feare the multitude of them (though ſome will ever be wicked) that they will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell and change the Government. The People indeed by <hi>Abſaloms</hi> flattery Rebelled againſt <hi>David</hi> a righteous and juſt Ruler. But there was more then ordinary in that GOD threatened it to him for his adultery and murther. They did not ſo, to the great Reformers <hi>Aſa, Iehoſaphat, Hezekiah, Ioſiah</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially yet queſtionleſſe they 2. offended very many; for the Princes and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (as I noted before on a ſpeciall occaſion) were very bad even in their times. Some Papiſts as did rebell againſt King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. and ſome againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> But both ſoon and eaſily ſubdued.

            <p>So I may ſay to Rulers (Kings and Parliaments) doing well, Ruling accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:39617:32"/>
to GODS Ordinances they need not feare the power of Reſiſting Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in the peoples hands, which I ſay againe, [Though people have often uſed it, and prevailed againſt Tyrannous Governors, yet never did they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile againſt Juſt Rulers, to Depoſe them, or much leſſe alter the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Tyranny then (helped forward now by the Doctors Principles,) will be onely that that in a deſpaire will drive People to Cantoning and Folk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moots (if any thing will) and not at all our Poſition of a ſober neceſſary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons that the Dr. hath brought againh Reſiſtance, are ſo far from being the Apoſtles Inſinuations, that they are wholly unſufficient to diſcredit it with Reaſonable and unpartiall Men, to whom (next under GOD) we Appeale. His concluſion <hi>Ergo</hi> repeating that becauſe ſome muſt be truſted, therfore <hi>Ergo</hi> the K is ſtill (I muſt tell him) moſt unreaſonable, when his caſe ſuppoſes he will not diſcharge his truſt, but is bent to ſubvert Religion, Laws, and Liberties. (So perpeatually the Dr. doth or will, forget the State of the Qu.) The King ought ordinarily to be truſted, and a juſt King (a <hi>David</hi>) is worth 10000. nay 100000. of us his Subjects; but the will and Luſt of ſuch a Tyrant as the Qu. ſpeakes of, is not to be ſatisfied upon one (<hi>Ionathan</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi>) the meaneſt of thoſe thouſands; yet it muſt be, if he muſt ſtill be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when he is bent upon extreame Tyranny.</p>
            <p>What the Dr alleadges further of the Oathes of Allegeance and Supremacy and the late Proteſtation, prejudices not defenſive Reſiſtance, no more then Scripture and Reaſon hath done. The Oathes of Allegeance and Supremacy are onely to the Kings Legall power and Authority, which no man diſputes againſt. The Proteſtation is to defend as far as lawfully I may, according to the duty of my Allegiance, His Majeſties Royall Perſon, Honour and Eſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a defenſive Reſiſtance, intends no hurt, but defence and maintenance of him in all theſe reſpects; and ſo was never proteſted againſt. It is therfore vaine that he addes, [The Kings power cannot be prevalent for the good of his people unleſſe it be preſerved to him intire, unleſſe he hath a power of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and of chiefe Command of Armes.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> But we Argue not againſt a King intending the good of his people; but bent to ſubvert all Good, and this indeed hee cannot doe, unleſſe their hands be tyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by ſome ſuch Poſitions as the <hi>Dr.</hi> would make them believe, that they muſt not deny him his power of denyall of their ſafety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when hee himſelfe (or others under him) meanes to ſubvert all Religion, Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</p>
            <p>And now after all theſe diſcourſes, the <hi>Dr.</hi> ſpends above a Page (in the 1. Edition) to ſumme up his ſtrength, and boaſts of his Victory enough and enough. But how juſtly the Conſciences of his Readers and mine muſt and ſhall Judge now, and God above all. To whom I very willingly appeale as well as he, or any other; who for mine own part, have even in this diſcourſe, ſhewed I am no Idolizer of the Parliaments, nor carryed away with it (as hee charges) as the Papiſts with the name of the Church, nor yet do I thinke Religion may be defended any way. For it may not be with lying nor with doing any thing that God hath undoubtedly forbidden. But he hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſuch defenſive reſiſtance as I have Argued for, my Conſcience finds not, notwithſtanding the <hi>Drs.</hi> bigge words, continually miſapplying the indeed

terrible ſentences of the Apoſtle, againſt unlawfull Reſiſters of the Lawfull Power.</p>
            <p>And ſo I have done with the maine of the Drs. Booke, which concernes a Divine. The 2. laſt <hi>Sections,</hi> are matters of fact; wherein it is more eaſily to ſatisfie a mans owne Conſcience, then diſcourſe of it publiquely: becauſe it brings perſons much on the Stage: and ſome of it cannot but reflect on the King. Of whoſe honour I am ſo tender, that I would not willingly have an unworthy thought of him. Neither will I yeeld to the Dr. or any other living Man, in my zeale to His Royall Perſon Honour and Eſtate according to my proteſtation. Yet ſomwhat muſt be ſaid, and the Drs calling for it, will deſerve little thankes, nor yet his pleadings for all the actions done, if they be well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. To that therefore though unwillingly, I come.</p>

            <p>IN this <hi>Section</hi> he propounds the ſum of his ſecond and third generall, which are much matters of fact. Yet in this above the major part of Votes, hee again ſlides into matter of right and moſt illegally and unjuſtly argues againſt the major part of Votes as againſt a prevailing Faction. But if conſcience may refuſe (or ſuſpend) to conſent to ſuch Votes under that pretence, in vaine do all numerous Bodies meet; For this principle of his diſſolves, and blowes up not only all Parliaments, but all other meetings, Civill or Eccleſiaſticall. For how ſeldome are any matters of great importance, once controverted, &amp; concluded by an unanimous Vote of all as one man? And in remote places, who can be aſſured in conſcience it was ſo, though ſaid ſo? And what a new doctrine of Politie is this, to make every one, in a great Aſſembly to have a meere Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as this upon the matter doth.

Fourthly his Letter (after he was fled) to the Queen, and another to Sir <hi>Lewes Dives</hi> counſelling the King to retire to ſome ſtrong place, on which the Attempt on <hi>Hull,</hi> hath made an unhappy Comment, (and another ſince that ſurpriſed, written to the Queene, ſignifying what Counſell he gave the King in a Letter, about that time which hath been ever ſince followed.) Fiftly, the <hi>Militia</hi> denyed for Cities and Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (upon pretence of a Petition from the City of London, contrived by <hi>Binion,</hi> and ſome few others) which was of the greateſt conſequence for the Parliaments ſafety, and to keep out forraine Forces; and this when the Houſes thought the King had granted it; (the meane while the Queen goes for <hi>Holland,</hi> in a ſtrange ſeaſon of the yeare, and on a ſmall occaſion, (the Parliament having the yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, given Reaſons againſt her offering to goe beyond Sea, upon another pretence,) and how ſhe hath done ſince her going over, is too well knowne. Finally the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> in a diſguiſed habit and Name, and Captaine <hi>Legge,</hi> (two perſons that were named in the buſineſſe of bringing up the Northern Armes) came to <hi>Hull,</hi> and one of them, I remember now not which, but the Papers will tell,) ſhewed the Kings hand for to have had <hi>Hull,</hi> and the Magazine delivered up to him. And all this before the ſetling of the <hi>Militia</hi> by an Ordinance, or Sir <hi>Iohn Hothams</hi> taking in Forces to keep <hi>Hull</hi> ſafe.

            <p>It is true the King for a time had nothing but Proclamations and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to oppoſe them.

When firſt the Houſes having petitioned the Removing the Magazine at <hi>Hull</hi> to <hi>London.</hi> (Upon a counter-Petition of a very few Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of Yorkſhire, pretending the name of the whole County that it might be kept cleare ſtill) the King goes inſtantly to <hi>Hull,</hi> and demands entrance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending as he declares to the Parliament after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he meant ſo to doe) to take poſſesſion of the Towne and Magazine, and diſpoſe of it: and being denyed, proclaimes Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> Traitor, without any proceſſe of Law, or ſending firſt to the Houſe to know if they would owne it; and after demands juſtice ſo peremptorily, as to deny before hand all other buſineſſes, but that of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (and how well that was done, we muſt remember anon) and then was the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my raiſed under Colour of a Guard the Yorkſhire men, not comming in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily enough to make it appeare a great Army.) And all this before ever it was declared by the Houſes that the King ſeduced by wicked Councell, intended to make war againſt his Parliament, and ſo before ever they ſet out the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions for Money, Plate Horſes, and therefore certainly before any one man was liſted. In all which the event hath ſhewed, that they were rather in wiſdome too ſlow, then in conſcience too quick in their Preparations for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.

            <p>As touching the cauſe of theſe Armes, the Doctor would perſwade us, that it is for ſomthing which the King hath right to Deny. To evince which, he firſt affirmes, that it cannot be for Religion or Priviledges and ancient Rights and Liberties, for theſe the King doth not deny.</p>
            <p>REPL. But now ſufficient verball promiſes, with ſuch actions done (as were noted even now) are to ſecure Religion or the State, Conſcience muſt judge, and it may a little the better, when we come to conſider them againe in the proper place for them (for here they outrunne their ſeaſon like Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives) in the next Section. Secondly, he ſaith it muſt then be for denying the <hi>Militia,</hi> the diſpoſing offices of State, and ſuch like; alſo the government of the Church, and the revenue of it; and for not denying his power of denying in Parliament.</p>
            <p>REPL. 1. For the <hi>Militia,</hi> I referre to what hath beene ſaid, how juſt reaſon the Parliament had to petition the ſecuring it, and after to ſettle it (as in caſe of necesſity) by Ordinance. Of which their Declarations have given more full account. 2. For diſpoſing Offices of State, it was never deſired, till the difference was very farre advanced, and <hi>Hull</hi> attempted; and Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> proclaimed Traitour, and the Army raiſed at Yorke, called a Guard. And ſo onely deſired as a Security after ſuch a breach; and no way a cauſe of the breach; Thirdly, For the Kings power of denying, it was never in queſtion betweene him and them, till the <hi>Militia</hi> was abſolutely and peremptorily denyed. And in all their Declarations they never take it away; but contrarily in the defence of that <hi>May,</hi> 26. they grant, that though the King be bound by Oath and care of his people, not to deny any Bill for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſafety and good (for in ordinary matters they yeeld he may deny) Yet if he doe deny, it is no Law without him. Onely in caſe of the common ſafety, they ſay the two Houſes may doe what is neceſſary, and it binds the Subjects for that necesſity, though he doe deny. The denyall then of the <hi>Militia</hi> only, in the caſe of necesſity (with other things noted before) forced them to doe what they did toward Armes; and not any difference about a power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall in generall. 4. For the government and Revenue of the Church. I beleeve indeed it was a part of the cauſe of taking Armes; but not on the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> part: the major part of whom in either Houſe, never (till very lately) declared, nor ſhewed any purpoſe of taking either away quite, but only refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming (which the Doctor ſaith his Majeſty is alway ready to agree,) as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare even by the great agitations for ſo long in the Houſe of Commons of

the Bill againſt Epiſcopacy root and branch; and at laſt it was wholly laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; which ſhewes the major part never owned it as their delight. Elſe they would firſt have abſolutely concluded the deſtructive part; and then conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what to have in the roome. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And had the Commons paſt the Bill againſt them; yet did the Lords never ſhew any ſuch intendment, who were not eaſily wonne to take away their Votes, till their Proteſtation againſt both Houſes in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence helped to perſwade them to it. It can then no way appeare to Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that ever the Parliament had thoughts of Armes, to obtaine their taking away. But, I am verily perſwaded, by all I could ever heare from the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Party; that their feare of this made them (who had ſtill enough of the Kings eare and heart,) urge the King to many Actions, which have helped the Warre forward. Among the reſt, I cannot but note one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not a weeke paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the 12.

And whereas the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſaith the King is bound by Oath to maintaine the Government and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, as by Law they are eſtabliſh't.</p>
            <p>REPL. 1. He diſcovers a ſecret to us which we underſtood not before. All men ſtood amazed at the late Oath to this effect for the government; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Arguments againſt it not a few conſiderable men of the Miniſtry and Gentry before the Parliament lookt at it as an injury to the King, and oppoſite to our Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacie (and ſo the Parliament did in effect vote it) becauſe it urged men to ſweare never to conſent to alter the Government, which yet the King and State might posſibly judge fit to be altered. But we never thought that the King was ſuppoſed bound by his Oath to it already; and much leſſe that all Kings in ſuccesſion would be bound (as now the Doctor teaches us) by their Oathes to maintaine it as it is by Law e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſht. This it ſeems they preſumed upon, and ſo thought to have made all ſure, by ſwearing all the Miniſtery and Univerſities, and Maſters of Arts, and Schoolemaſters, and Phyſitians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who would have had influence enough into the whole Kingdome within awhile. But God laught at this Project, turned it upon the Head of the Projectours and all the Party, as appeares this Day. And ſo I am perſwaded He will doe, all their Preſent endeavours of Warre to recover themſelves. 2. But in good earneſt doth the Doctor (or any elſe) thinke the King bound by Oath to maintain Biſhops ſtill in England (though he hath conſented to take them away in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to prevent War) even though he hazard the ruine of the Kingdome by a Civill Warre? and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any inconveniences repreſented to him by the complaints of his People, and the wiſedome of his <hi>Parliament,</hi> and his owne too? Or doth his Oath bind him to any more then to maintaine them ſo long as they are eſtabliſht by Law as he ſweares to maintaine all his other Subjects in their Rights; and yet an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> may alter many things in mens Rights. Are not all Rights of Church and State (which are not properly <hi>jure divino</hi>) compromit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Parliament</hi> the three Eſtates, King, Lords, Commons, every time they meet? And may they not alter and change this or that, ſo farre as it is humane and eſtabliſht but by the Lawes of the Land? The Kings Oath then binds not him and his <hi>Parliament</hi> from taking away Biſhops, if they judge
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:39617:36"/>
them (not <hi>jure divino</hi>) and their continuance to be prejudiciall to the State and Church; (and ſo of Revenues the ſame may be ſaid.) 3. And if the Dr. will not admit this Anſwere, but ſtill contend, the King did ſweare to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them (at his Coronation) as they were then by Law eſtabliſhed. Is not the King beholding to him for charging him with Perjury (as in effect hee doth) ſince it is evident that by taking away the high Commisſion Court, and their power in their Courts of impoſing Oathes and Penalties, and after that their Votes in Parl. hee hath not maintain'd them as they were by Law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht, when he tooke the Oath.</p>
            <p>How the Doctor will anſwer this I know not: ſure I am, if any Miniſter having taken the Oath (never to conſent to alter the Government as it now ſtands eſtabliſht,) had offered to petition ſuch a taking away of their gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power; he ſhould quickly have beene accurſed as a perjured perſon, and accordingly ſo dealt with. It remaines then that the King onely ſwore to maintaine them according to Law; while they ſhould ſtand by Law, and not to bind himſelfe from any Law-making, though to take them away, in caſe it ſhould appeare to be for the good of Church and State. And if this be not made good that their taking away will be ſo; let us all fight for them. But if it be, woe to thoſe men that hazard the King and two of his Kingdomes (<hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>) once more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as before they would two yeares one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have hazarded <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>) to maintaine Epiſcopall greatneſſe and Authority. 4. What degree of Reformation (or any thing like to the Primitive Biſhops) did they ever offer to be reduced unto? which might have contented Parliament and People both, if ever propounded in earneſt, to have asked no more. Or what cure for any effectuall Reformation have any of them (or their Party) ever ſhewed ſince the Parliament met, to have rendred it any way hopefull that they would bee good inſtruments hereafter? 5. If therfore after all warnings, they will needs put the King ſtill on (as it appeares even by the Doctors words) to fight for their maintenance: Let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Mr. <hi>Brightmans</hi> Propheticall Interpretation of the ſpewing out of the Laodicean Angell. And though a vomiting ſomtimes makes a mans heart ſick, and ready to dye; yet where he hath ſtrength of Nature it comes up at laſt, and proves happy cure. Which in this caſe (if it be Chriſts act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it much ſeemes to be) will not faile to bee fulfilled to our comfort at laſt, how weake ſoever it bring us firſt. I conclude this then, that as Phyſick is upon the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo much more the endeavour to caſt up the humour which unprovoked or but a little ſtirred, endangers the Bodies health by Inflamations &amp; the like. So the late voting down the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was meerly defenſive; and the War, ſo much as it is to maintaine them, themſelves are and ever were upon the offenſive, and offenders, in and the Parliament not at all.</p>
            <p>Now for the managing of the reſiſtance, the Doctor offers to examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it hath beene ſo void of Hoſtility as that defenſive way, they pretend to, ſhould bee. Let us examine it with him. Here he contends 1. that the Defendant ſhould be of anſwerable demeanour to <hi>David</hi> defending himſelfe againſt <hi>Saul.</hi> REP. But he may be pleaſed to conſider, that as all that handle the difference betweene an offenſive War and a defenſive, do rationally main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that he that is outragiouſly injuried (as <hi>David</hi> in his Embaſſadors, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>0.) Or dangerouſly threatned, is but on the defenſive; though he be actually <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n Armes firſt, through diligence and ſome advantages perhaps: ſo a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:39617:36"/>
keeps himſelfe within the bounds of a defence, though he actually offend him that does, or that would aſſault him, and even though he begin firſt. So <hi>David</hi> did in the former caſe, invading the Ammonites Country, and yet he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly defenſive. So a man on the high way, if a Robber ſhould aſſault him; if he could prevent his blow and ſtrike firſt, it were but in his owne defence: but much more to ſtrike againe and kill (if he cannot otherwiſe defend himſelfe) which yet is the higheſt degree of offence betweene party and party. <hi>Ob.</hi> But <hi>David</hi> ſtill withdrew and having taken the Kings ſpeare and cruſe, he reſtored them without demand. <hi>Rep.</hi> True, but I have formerly given the reaſon why he ever withdrew, Pag. I need not repeat it. And as for the cruſe and ſpeare, he tooke them not away for feare of being hurt by them (as now Ammunitions and other proviſions) but as the Dr. well ſayes, to ſhew <hi>Abners</hi> neglect and his own integrity; and therfore when they had done him that ſervice, he reſtored them without demand. But the <hi>Parl.</hi> cannot fly from place to place like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>; they muſt keep at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> or diſſolve themſelves; and they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to reſtore that which they took to prevent their own and the Kingdomes being miſchefed by it; ſo that ſecurity might have been obtained for time to come; witneſſe the Petition ſent by the E. of <hi>Holland</hi> and others to <hi>Beverley,</hi> while <hi>Hull</hi> was beſieged. In a word there hath been nothing done in this kind, of all that the Dr. reckons up, which meer necesſity hath not forced; and moſt of thoſe things muſt have beene done by <hi>David,</hi> if he had kept <hi>Keilah</hi> againſt <hi>Saul</hi> as he deſired and meant to have done. 2, And whereas the Dr. further ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges [that the Kings loyall and peaceable Subjects are aſſaulted, deſpoiled of their Armes, goods, eſtates, their perſons impriſoned, becauſe they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their allegiance asſiſt him in this extremity; or would not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their conſcience, joyne with them againſt him] <hi>Rep.</hi> This concerns two ſorts of perſons; and for both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though ſomwhat differently, the ſatisfaction to this allegation depends upon the juſtice of the defence it ſelfe. For 1. if the Parl. do juſtly take up Arms, then without all doubt (however the Dr. talks of an implicit faith) they may ſeize upon the arms goods eſtates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perſons of thoſe that actually under what pretence ſoever) asſiſt againſt them. Though if their defence be not juſt, then all this is confeſſedly a multiplication of injuſtice: but if they may fight with the Army that oppoſes them, they may diſarm, &amp;c. thoſe that ſtrengthen the army with monys &amp;c. 2. as for thoſe that only wold not, contrary to their conſcience joyn with them againſt him, I have 2. things to ſay. 1. If any of theſe have in former times any way promoted illegall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and practiſes it is much to be doubted they can bring but ſlender proof of their forbearing to joyn with the Parl. out of conſcience. There is nothing more eaſie then to pretend conſcience in all controverted points. But hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not to be beleeved in his pretence, that hath been but even now (and much more if he be ſtill) a violatour of rules of conſcience in other reſpects. It is wel known how tender they have been of other mens conſciences in need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Ceremonies, in illegall Innovations, in prophane violations of the Lords Sabbath and the 4th.

            <p>WE are now come to the Tendreſt Peece of all the Reſt; and how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently ſo ever the <hi>Dr.</hi> charges the Parliament and all that cleave to them with Rendring the King odious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſaith it concernes them ſo to doe; yet it ſhall appeare by what I have to reply to him in this <hi>Section,</hi> how little delight I have to make the King Odious, and that the Parliament alſo hath and doth as much as lay in them to put off all Imputations from the King and charge them (as the Law doth) upon his Councellors, Judges, Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers and Favourites. Here 1. let me remember him; that whereas in other Kingdomes, ſome Favourites, when they have ſeen their Prince endangered have rather taken his actions upon themſelves, then caſt theirs on him, and been content to Sacrifice themſelves rather for his ſafety, then expoſe him to ſhield themſelves. It hath been the continuall practiſe of the plotters againſt our Religion, and Liberties to Entitle the King to all their Illegallities and Oppreſsions; There can ſcarce that Grievance be named (if we except the Ship-money which was devolved upon the Judges, and yet it is well knowne how they were tampered with in the Kings Name) which they have not Fraudulently gotten the King to own as his Act; and this is their conſtant practiſe to this day, who then hath laboured to make the King Odious? or whom did it concerne but they? that ſo far as the people would finde fault with any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſhould be forced in a ſort to finde fault with the King; and this alſo helped to Charme all Tongues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tie down all hands till they provoked the <hi>Scots</hi> beyond all degrees of ſufferance, to come in with an Army and demand ſecurity in and by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parl. aſwell as one in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Next whereas the Dr. upbraids the Parliament and People, [That it ſeemes they are men that would be loath to ſuffer for their Religion, they are ſo ready to fly to Armes to ſecure themſelves]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. It ill becomes a pretender to, and Diſputer for Conſcience to ſpeake this Language that hath lived to ſee how many ſufferings (though not reſiſting to blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtriving againſt ſinne) many even of the Parliament, but ſpecially of the Miniſtery and people have yeelded to within 16. or 18. yeares, and never thought of flying to Armes, but rather of flying out of their Native Country, as thouſands have done: Unleſſe the Dr. will undertake to juſtifie, all that was Impoſed upon mens Conſciences all this while; And if he will do ſo he ſhall ſave many Conſciences a labour to judge with what a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hee Writes. 2. Doth he thinke, that they could be ſo ſimple as not to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:39617:37"/>
foreſee that their very flying to Armes was and would be a great ſuffering, and might prove (if God ſhould defeat them) the meanes of extreame ſuffering. A people ſo taught, ſo enured to Paſsive obedience, and no way enured to Warre, could not be ſuppoſed willing or forward to engage themſelves, their purſes, or much leſſe their Perſons, againſt the Name of their King: and each day ſince the firſt Neceſsity hath continually ſounded this out, ſo that they had no reaſon to be forward to fly to Armes. 3. By what I ſaid on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Section,</hi> and added with the Petition by the E. of <hi>Holland</hi> (even now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) It appeares they did not fly to Armes but fly from it, as far as they could and durſt. 3. Wheras the Dr. often in this <hi>Section,</hi> in the beginning, middle and end inſiſts mainly, upon the breach of Charity, in ſuſpecting the King upon Remote feare, and meere Jealouſies, cauſeleſſe Jealouſies <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Repl.</hi> This may ſufficiently be ſatisfied both in the behalfe of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then of the People that adhere to them joyntly and ſingly. For the Parliament and people both joyntly; This may juſtly be ſaid, 1. The <hi>Dr.</hi> miſtakes, it is not ſimply a Jealouſie of the King, but rather of the Kings Councellors and Followers, who find ſo much favour with him (as they and others did before the Parliament againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> and us both, and <hi>Ireland</hi> too, witneſſe all their heavy complaints againſt the Great Favourite <hi>Strafford</hi>) that they are able to put him from time to time, upon theſe Actions which his goodneſſe of it ſelfe, rightly informed and councelled, would abhorre; and hath ſo often declared againſt, and yet Actions againe have diſcredited thoſe declarations, as the Memory of thoſe that have been awake cannot forget, both Referring to Religion and Liberties and the Parliament Remonſtrances do amply ſet out, beſids other Books. If therfore Security be once obtained againſt ſuch perſons; I am perſwaded the King will be no more ſuſpected; and in the meane time, it muſt be a ſtrange Charity that can chuſe but ſuſpect them. 2. Where the danger is of much importance, both for Greatneſſe of Miſchiefe and Inevitableneſſe according to Man, if not timely prevented; Charity to ourſelves (and others) will not onely allow, but commend, and even command to ſuſpect and accordingly prevent, ſuch dangers by ſuſpecting Perſons and Actions which in leſſer matters they would and might and ſhould venture to truſt. Fire neere ſtraw or Gunpowder, is to be ſuſpected more then neere hard wood. Hedge-breakers and breakers of Houſes are not equally to be ſuſpected. Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Laws and Liberties are precious things and may be ſooner loſt then recovered. And his Charity hath drunk of the water of <hi>Lethe,</hi> that forgets theſe were lately attempted and endangered. (The Kings own Declarations acknowledge Laws and Liberties have been broken.) And how ſince the E. of <hi>Straffo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ds</hi> death, all the old Projectors are become Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, is too hard a morſell for Charity to ſwallow, when it muſt hazard ſuch deare things to many of the ſame Perſons againe. Specially ſeeing ſtill, what they have done ſince the firſt ſitting of the Parliam. toward their old Projects, as hath been partly noted already and ſomewhat more muſt be ſaid by and by.</p>
            <p>Next for the Parliament alone. They are the great Councell of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome the publique Watch-men, the Higheſt Court of Judicature, it concerns them therfore to exerciſe their Charity, for the ſafety of thoſe that have tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted them. Charity towards Attempters againſt a City, is none of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of a Watchman, nor toward Attempters of dangerous Treaſons againſt a King and Kingdome, the Vertue of a Judge. Were they onely to looſe their
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:39617:38"/>
own Liberties or Lives, their Charity might venture much further, then now it may, when they muſt Anſwer for Religion, Laws, and Liberties (and ſo Lives and Conſciences) of a whole Kingdome, of 2 Kingdomes, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as formerly of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> if not rather then and ſtill, of all 3. in a degree. Who would not Curſe their Charity, deteſt their Folly, if by their Credulity, all this ſhould be betrayed and ruined. If Rhetorick needed in this cauſe, no Subject could deſerve it better, then to cry down ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious Charity, as this would prove, if they ſhould be deceived with credulity.</p>
            <p>And then for the People alone, have they not a charity to exerciſe toward the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as well as toward the <hi>Kings</hi> Followers; whom have they truſted to be publike Watchmen, the one or the other? Whom hath the law truſted to be the great Councell and chief Judges, the one or the other? Who hath pleaded for their Liberties the one or the other? 12. <hi>Subſidies</hi> were demanded (with intent thereby to engage us in a bloody War againſt <hi>Scotland</hi>) in the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> of <hi>Aprill,</hi> 1640. Onely for taking away of <hi>Ship-money.</hi> But this Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament hath proved it ſo illegall and other things more, that it was taken away without any coſt at all, by way of Exchange, and many other happy Lawes hath the <hi>

                  </gap>arliament</hi> paſſed, and obtained for us. But what one thing did the Kings former Counſellors move him to offer to his people, by way of preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for State or Religion, in a whole yeer together? To whom then muſt the People exerciſe their charity? Muſt they condemn their watchmen, as ſcaring them needleſſely with <hi>Old</hi> Enemies, diſcredit the law that ſaith. [No diſhonourable thing ought to be thought of ſuch a great Councell, ſuch a high Judicature.] And that when they, more then ever any <hi>Parliament</hi> before give account to all men, of all their Actions and the grounds of them? Well, ſhall that People deſerve a ruine, that believe <hi>Old Wolves,</hi> rather then their faithfull Dogs, then their Councell of Shepheards: That ſhall thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to be charitable, to thoſe that have attempted their ruine, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable to thoſe that under God have hitherto ſaved them. In a word, let thoſe that love Religion, and Laws, and Liberties compare the beſt actions on the one ſide, with the beſt on the other, and the worſt on the one ſide, with the worſt on the other: and then let charity judge (if it dare, or can) the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Fooles or Traytors, to GOD and the KING, and the STATE; and the Kings followers, the only wiſe men, that have diſcovered their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Treachery, and the only faithfull men to Religion, his Majeſty and Kingdome. Take in then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Declarations and Proteſtations; on the one ſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on the other, and remember is is not a ſingle charity, whether I ſhall ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the King; but firſt mixt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether I ſhall or may ſuſpect the Kings follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who can doe any thing with him ſo farre, as that they may doe contrary to what he ſaith and then a diſtinguiſhing charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether I ſhall ſuſpect them, who were once (moſt of them apparently) Delinquents, againſt Religion and the Laws, Or the Publike Watchmen, and the great Councell an Judicature of the Kingdom: who have done ſo much and with ſuch diligence to ſave and reſtore both and then let Conſcience exerciſe charity as it will anſwer to GOD, to it ſelfe to all <hi>it's Fellow</hi> Engliſh men and Chriſtians, and even to the whole World. Thus in generall, now we muſt examine ſome particulars.</p>
            <p>The Dr. names 4, grounds of feares and jealouſie, with which the people have been poſſeſſed. All which he firſt rejects with a gentle comparing of the <hi>Parliamont</hi> (who hath ſet them forth) to the Devill the Arch-accuſer. This is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:39617:38"/>
his charity. In ſtead of rataliating, I will onely ſay the Lord forgive thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>His firſt ground is [Reports of Forraign Power to be brought in. This, he ſaith, was given out before the ſetting up of the MILITIA, to keepe the People amuſed, the eaſier to draw them into ſuch a poſture of defence as was pretended; and they are all diſcovered by time to have been vaine.]</p>
            <p>REPL. 1. why will he perpetually forget that the King himſelf granted the <hi>Militia</hi> neceſſary to be ſetled. 2 It was not meerely Forraigne Forces to bee brought in; but Papiſts and Delinquents riſing at home, that was inſinuated a cauſe of the deſire to have the Kingdom put in a poſture of defence. 3. Who knows not of the billeting of many thouſands of Iriſh upon us even during the fitting of a former <hi>Parliament</hi>? The Project of <hi>Germane</hi> Horſe in the Dukes time is it quite forgotten? The Earle of <hi>Staffords</hi> Councell, not only to bring in his Iriſh Army conſiſting moſt of Papiſts, wherewith to reduce this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, was it not proved by the Oath of a Privy Counſellor preſent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by his own Notes taken at the time, and did not the reſt of the adviſe then given by that Politician, (that the King being now deſerted by his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might doe any act of power (Quaere the words in his charge) amount to Counſelling the bringing in of any forces from any place? And why muſt all intelligences after theſe prevented, bee counted vaine 4. For is all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vaine, becauſe the thing ſuſpected comes not to paſſe, when mean are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to prevent it? Is all preventing Phyſicke Vaine? Is all feare of Pyrates in a Sea voyage vaine, if none aſſault a well man'd and provided Ship? Was not ſuch a Navy being ſecured in ſafe hands, as would under God have made great Forraign Forces repent their comming againſt the Kingdomee; competent reaſon why thoſe that did mean to come (if they might have had no reſiſtance on the Sea) now thought it too hot a ſervice? 5. But beſides the Navy, they had no Landing place, <hi>Hull</hi> being contrary to the Court-expectation (and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as was Noted before) ſecured by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and ſo might well be the more diſcouraged. 6. Which is the more conſiderable, because no ſooner had they got a Port-Town, namely <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>; but though no Forraign For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces came, who could not be ſo ſoon ready; yet Forraign Ammunition came, not a little; and Forces of our Country-men, who ſerved in Forraign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and money too, from Forraigne Princes or People. And what more is comming, if our unhappineſſe continue till the Spring who can be ſecure!</p>
            <p>But for this if it prove ſo, the Dr. hath a defence ready. [All Chriſtian Kings (he ſaith) cannot but thinke themſelves concerned in the cauſe, and it will be as juſt for the King to uſe them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt ſubjects now in arms as it was unjuſt in the Barons to call in the <hi>French</hi> againſt their naturall King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>REPL. 1. The Dr. beſtirres himſelf to make the King ſtrong; (to maintain the Prelacy among other things as himſelf hath told us) before, in the former <hi>Section,</hi> he ſaid that they that aſsiſt him, doe it according to their Allegiance. So that he intends that all his Subjects are bound by their Allegiance to aſsiſt him and fight againſt the Parliament (even though their Conſciences judge them to intend the conſervation of Religion, Laws and liberties, and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to intend their ſubverſion.)

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:39617:39"/>
like too, what will the Dr. ſay, were all the Chriſtian Princes concerned to aſsiſt againſt the <hi>Rochellers?</hi> If, hee doe, the very ſouldiers and marriners that went into Ships, ſhall riſe up in judgment againſt him, who when they knew what they went for, utterly refuſed to fight againſt their Religion; and ſo the greateſt part of them were ſet a Shore againe, and the reſt went on their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and did the miſchief to help beat the <hi>Rochell</hi> Fleet, and give the King poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion of the Haven, ſo as he afterward with the help of the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> (ſo ſtill Princes are concerned againſt the Proteſtant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) made a Barricado ſo ſtrong as when a Fleet from hence after re-Voyage attempted to relieve <hi>Rochell</hi> by Sea, (being then actually beſieged by Land) it could not be done. 3. What will the Dr. ſay to that Voyage to <hi>Rey</hi> and that to releeve <hi>Rochell,</hi> when it proved too late? Why was not the King ſtill concerned to helpe the King of <hi>France</hi>? or was he? 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Will it be Juſt for the King to uſe Forraign Forces, when to the underſtanding of Common Readers hee hath utterly diſclaimed it in more then one Declaration? 5, What Counſell, would an Enemy to the King and Kingdome (that hath read Stories, and ours in ſpeciall as the Dr. ſeemes to have done) give, but the uſing of Forraign Forces? was not the Kingdome Conquered by this very meanes, by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> when King Vorteger was in debate with his Lords and People, call'd them in to aſsiſt him? Did not the Turkes ſo come into <hi>Europe</hi>? and oft the like hath hapened. 6. He counts it damnable, to reſiſt for defence meerly, much more then, as the Barons in K. <hi>Iohns</hi> time, to call in a Stranger to make him King: if then to call in other Kings to aſsiſt againſt the Parliament be as juſt as that was unjuſt, it is a high vertue though to the utter endangering of the whole <hi>Kingdom,</hi> whoſe Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ſurely it were pity the Dr. ſhould ever be, who hath no more judgment, or more Conſcience or charity toward the publique good, then to adviſe and commend ſuch a practiſe. 2. Next he propounds the Queens Religion, as a matter which is urged to cauſe feares and jelouſies. Of which he ſaith, <hi>It is no new cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>REPL. 1. It is true, to the great grief of all that truly love Religion, or wiſh well to her Majeſtie, but had others wiſh't it otherwiſe (as the Dr. ſpeakes for himſelfe) who have had acceſſe unto her, She had not bin told by a great man in the Church, (in the worſt ſeaſon that could be, when it is ſaid ſhee had ſome Pangs about Her Religion and asked of it) that Shee might well be ſaved in her Religion. Or if any give no credit to this paſſage, yet it is notorious enough that her illumination hath been ſo farre from the endeavours of thoſe who might have bin heard by the King and the Queen both, that Miniſters have bin check't for praying for Her converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. But no man hath ſaid, this alone is a ſufficient Cauſe, nor was the Chief cauſe at the firſt. It is well known tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. But the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. forgets that the time before the Parliament, the Papiſts and popiſh party had undeniably made an inrode upon our Doctrine, publike Worſhip, Laws and Liberties; and againſt them in ſpeciall was the <hi>Militia</hi> deſired to be ſetled by people and Parliament. And after all this, upon a difference about the <hi>Militia,</hi> to imploy them againſt the Parliament ſooner or later, is an example beyond example; and beyond the power of words to take off the exception. Suppoſe a Woman ſuſpected of incontinence: (And Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery is ſpirituall whoredome) ſhould take to her ſelfe the parties with whom ſhe were ſuſpected to be her ſervants the better to defend her honour, were this a way to cleare her ſelfe? Or a Captaine to take in Forces to defend himſelfe, having been challenged that they had a deſigne to ruine his Army or Caſtle? 2. What charity can ſtretch it ſelfe to beleeve, they intend to aſſiſt the King in maintaining the Proteſtant Religion, and the Laws againſt themſelves, which yet his Proteſtations proclaime? Surely ſome about him, muſt needs give them other aſſurance, or they would not be ſo mad, as to fight for their own ſuppreſſion, and their Adverſaries promotion. 3. But if they be ſo good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects (as the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A Tolleration at leaſt they muſt needs expect, if not indent for, or be promiſed. 4. Or, if they be ſtrong enough to overthrow the Parliament, will a diviſion content them? Will they not be able to command King and All hence-forward? (<hi>N. B.</hi>) If Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants charity can be ſo ſottiſh, by this Doctors deluſions, as to truſt to their faire dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Religion and Laws, when the Parliament is by their force ruined, they deſerve no other pitty then a bewitched or diſtracted Man, who is not afraid of Fire nor Water, but let Straw or Gun-powder lye neare the one, and pulls up floud-gates to give the other paſſage. 5. <hi>Davids</hi> followers 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.2. were far from Popiſh qualities. The Text deſcribes them thus, [Every one that was in diſtreſſe, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was diſcontented, bitter of ſoule:] Here is not a word of all this, that ſignifies them to be wicked. A faithfull Man may be in diſtreſſe ſeverall wayes; he may be in debt, through Gods hand upon him, not his miſpending; and not able to pay, but willing if he were able, and reſolved when he ſhould be able: and may be bitter of ſoule, through oppreſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that though in likelihood among ſo many there were ſome vicious; Yet here is nothing to affirme, that they came as vicious, but as afflicted. 6. Had any of them been Idolaters (as Papiſts are) had they been of confederacy with the profeſſed enemies of Gods true Religion and people, and ſo known, then <hi>David</hi> had been too blame to have entertained them; (and <hi>Saul</hi> would have been ſure to have laid it to his charge:) Neither could he ever have purged himſelfe ſo long as he had made them his Guard, that he meant to be faithfull to God and <hi>Iſrael</hi>: And ſpecially if <hi>Saul</hi> had before excepted againſt ſuch Men as treacherous. This is the Caſe now, The enmity of Papiſts, by their very Religion, againſt ours, our Parliament, and Proteſtant people, is known to all the world, that underſtands any thing. The Parliament hath often and often declared
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:39617:40"/>
their feare of them theſe two Yeares, and in reference to the ſetling of the Militia, that ſo their deſigne on the Kingdome might be defeated. The King proteſts, not to owne them nor their helpe. Yet things all along ſince the firſt diſcontents, are ſtill acted as they could wiſh, and did and doe applaud. And now after all this, to take them into the Armies, and imploy them againſt the Parliament, is as far from <hi>Davids</hi> fact in entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Troopes, as their deſignes againſt the Parliament are far from his againſt <hi>Saul</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. It is true indeed, that profeſſed Papiſts were not actually entertained at the firſt; It had been too groſſe for them to have appeared at the firſt, ſpecially in any number; and would have raiſed all the Kingdome againſt them. The Ice therefore muſt be broke by others firſt; and by Court-converts; Of whoſe Religion the Prieſt that had lately written on the ſubject, (on which D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Featly</hi> had animadverted,) hath given a faire warning, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſtartle any man almoſt. To which purpoſe, let me adde a word of a Booke I have ſeen, cal'd <hi>Jeſuitica Negotiatio,</hi> printed neare 20 Yeares ſince by Order of the States of <hi>Frizeland</hi>; which containes Inſtructions (ſurprized) of the Jeſuites, toward the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the united Provinces: Among which this was one, [That whoſoever they could convert to the Romiſh Religion, ſhould be ſtill allowed to profeſſe the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and keep any Office or place he was poſſeſt of; and give ſentence againſt any Papiſt, or Prieſt, or Jeſuit, according to his place, even ſentence of death, if he could not avoid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it: Onely with two cautions. 1. That he ſhould be as favourable as was poſſible. 2. That he ſhould give timely Intelligence of any ſevere ſentence.] Let now charity judge, what circumſpection almoſt can ſuffice againſt ſuch a generation of Men? Or what jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie can be too much of them that ſtill profeſſe this treacherous Religion? And yet all this notwithſtanding, at laſt to have even profeſſed Papiſts taken in againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Can this be without a deſigne in them that have counſelled the King to it? Was it not in a prudent fore-ſight, that they ſhould be cal'd and admitted to helpe, that the Papiſts have no where been plundered by the Kings Army, though others have, who held not with the Parliament? 8. As for <hi>Ziba, David</hi> knew not his treachery at the firſt, and his lyes had ſo blaſted honeſt-hearted <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> that it appeares, <hi>David</hi> did ſcarcely beleeve his apology for himſelfe: Otherwiſe (what ever may now be ſaid of his credulous charity to <hi>Ziba,</hi> to the prejudice of one that was not preſent to anſwer for himſelfe) it was none of <hi>Davids</hi> good deeds (to be imitated,) to recompence a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Sycophant (that had brought him a preſent, in a hard time indeed,) with ſo large, a ſhare in <hi>Mephiboſheths</hi> eſtate, When by the Law of God, he was to dye for his falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of Treaſon, as <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> had deſerved death had it been true. But now our Papiſts are knowne to be Enemies to the Parliament (as was ſaid before,) and ſome of their Party in the Country ſticke not to ſay, that the Parliaments Intentions of rigour againſt them, already ſhewed by the executing of ſo many Prieſts and Jeſuites, Men of tender conſciences; is one part of the Court-quarrell againſt them. They are more like <hi>Doeg</hi> then <hi>Ziba,</hi> who firſt accuſed the Prieſts, and then readily undertooke the execution of a moſt cruell ſentence, and executed it with all cruelty. But <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. Reades their doome. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 54.4.

               </gap>de was the cauſe, that they were admitted to helpe the King in his diſtreſſe. 9. But for the D<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them with the Title of good ſubjects, preferring them before the Parliament and ſo great a part of the Kingdome as viſibly adhere to them, is one of the higheſt reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:39617:40"/>
that ever was belcht out againſt them; enough for a Jeſuite or a Pope to have ſaid. But the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. (how ever he pretend modeſty oft-times, and reſpect to the Parliament,) ſtabbs them as deſperately, as any enemy could doe now and then: While he ſeemes alſo reſolved to juſtifie all that hath been done againſt them, elſe he would have been ſilent in this peece, and the next that followes about <hi>Ireland.</hi> 10. In the meane time, becauſe he upbraids, with a ſcandall that this reſiſtance brings on our Religion, which (ſaith he) would not be eaſily wiped of, were it to ſtand or fall by the doctrines of this gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy age. I muſt needs make bold to tell him, that he forgets himſelfe ſtrangely, and the Doctrines and practiſes of our Religion, when he can ſcarce name that Country, where there are any Proteſtants, that have not taken Armes to defend Laws and Liberties, and with them Religion, (even though not before allowed by Laws.) <hi>Sweden, Germany, France,</hi> The <hi>low Countries, Bohemiah, Scotland.</hi> And did not Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, aſſiſt them in <hi>France, Holland</hi> and <hi>Scotland?</hi> and K. <hi>James, Holland,</hi> and at leaſt owned the cauſe of the <hi>French,</hi> though he only ſent Ambaſſadours? and K. <hi>Charles</hi> did ſend to aide <hi>Rochel</hi> (as I noted before) and ownes the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſufficiently, who yet is Rebell Generall againſt the K. of <hi>Spain,</hi> if our Parliaments reſiſtance be Rebellion. Indeed, we in <hi>England</hi> are the laſt; and above all other Nations have been by the Court Doctors within this 40 Yeares, much prepared to ſuffer any thing rather then reſiſt, (Yet Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> in the Queens time, was ſuffered to averre that the States of a Kingdome might reſiſt, <hi>vide</hi>) But it now above all other times, greeves; that we offer to doe what all others have done before us (upon a great deale leſſe Authority; conſidering our Parliament continued by Act, and its power granted by the King, as I have noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, againſt all delinquents:) For if they could have ſubdued and ſwallowed us up, the other Proteſtants in other Countreyes would much more eaſily have been devoured.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The laſt Allegation, is concerning the buſineſſes of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Of which becauſe the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. ſaith the King hath written enough, he had done wiſely to have written nothing but that word. Though I have not yet been ſo happy (who would be glad to ſee it) to meet with any Anſwer to the laſt Peece of the Houſe of Commons, which reckons ſo many particulars of wrong done to that poore Kingdom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. (Therefore till I meete with that, I muſt needs tell the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. he ſaith not enough to cleare the buſineſſe, nor the Kings Councellours in that buſineſſe. For whereas his whole defence is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>in a word,) that the Kings neceſſity, made it lawfull to make uſe of any thing intended for their releefe, which he parallels by the Neceſſity that excuſed the <hi>Scots</hi> comming in hither. To this divers things may and muſt be replyed. 1. The <hi>Scots</hi> are no parallell for this carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Ireland.</hi> Their coming (what ever the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. affirmes) brought no ſuch great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Inhabitants there, if you except their profeſſed enemies, Papiſts and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, as the poore Souldiers and other Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland</hi> have ſuffered by the actions done concerning them. 2. The King and Parliament have juſtified by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their coming, as neceſſitated; Yet they were proclaimed Traitours againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and it was counted neceſſary to make War againſt them one yeare, and a ſecond, as now againſt the Parliament. The neceſſity then that is now pretended by the Kings party, wants a great deale of the juſtification that the <hi>Scots</hi> have had before all the world, ſpecially remembring all that was noted before, of the doings of the Kings fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, before ever the Parliament did any thing but Petition. 3. Which neceſſity by them pretended, if it appeare a neceſſity, by themſelves made, will it not make their actions concerning <hi>Ireland</hi> more horrid, and proclaime the deſigne to be more rooted. 4. But it muſt by no means be forgotten, what hath been pretended for <hi>Ireland,</hi> to which theſe actions are moſt contrary. 1. When the King rode Northward, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:39617:41"/>
more then once repreſented that it would greatly prejudice <hi>Ireland,</hi> The King proteſted ſtill it ſhould not; but he would be as ready to doe all things for <hi>Ireland,</hi> as if he had ſtayed at <hi>London.</hi> 2. When he had been at <hi>Hull,</hi> and demanded of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment juſtice upon S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>John Hotham,</hi> he declared, he would doe no buſineſſe till he had ſatisfaction in that, except only the buſineſſe of <hi>Ireland.</hi> 3. A few dayes after that, he would in all haſte goe over in Perſon to ſubdue the bloody Rebels, and venture his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Perſon to recover that poore Kingdome. Who now almoſt can beleeve his Eares or Eyes, that any thing ſhould be done to the prejudice of <hi>Ireland.</hi> 4. If the dates be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of ſome of thoſe things mentioned in that Anſwer of the Houſe of Commons, they will be found done, before the Parliament had done any thing more toward their own defence, then when that profeſſion was made after the Kings being at <hi>Hull,</hi> &amp; when the King would have ventured himſelfe to goe into <hi>Ireland.</hi> 5. It is ſtrange that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hing of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>John Hotham,</hi> and the ſuppreſſing the <hi>Militia,</hi> the recovery of <hi>Hull</hi> and the Magazene, which at laſt (after many other Declarations perſwading of no intention at all of a War againſt the Parliament) the King declares he would looſe his life, but he would obtaine, and this (I think, <hi>Quaere</hi>) before there was any one man liſted for the Parliaments defence; ſhould be thought a neceſſity allowing any retarding, much leſſe diſappointing the crying neceſſities of <hi>Ireland,</hi> after ſuch Proteſtations of care for it. 6. If the Parliament be not only, not ſo good ſubjects, as the now entertained Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, but unleſſe they be worſe then thoſe horrid Rebels, (of whom ſome of the Kings Declarations ſpeake with deſtation enough;) while the Parliament proteſts before God and the Kingdome, and the world; that they have no Thoughts nor Intentions but loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to the King, and faithfull to the Religion and Kingdome, and the Popiſh bloody Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, who one while avouch they have the Kings authority for what they have done, another while ſeeme to renounce him and to intend a new King; But alwayes profeſſe to intend the extirpation of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Nation, and Proteſtant Religion in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and then to come over into <hi>England</hi> to fight againſt the Parliament and Puritans and Proteſtants here: If I ſay the Parliament be not worſe then the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Traitours, it is a prodegy, that any neceſſity can be thought ſufficient to doe ſuch and ſo many acts as that Declaration of the Houſe of Commons mentions, or almoſt any one of them; to the woefull prejudice of that bleeding Kingdome, and great incouragement of the bloody Rebels. It would be too long to inſiſt on every particular, which if a man would Rhetorically (and but juſtly) amplifie, he might aſtoniſh all men, how the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations and thoſe actions could agree, and what neceſſity could be pretended for ſome of them, as entertaining <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, &amp;c. <hi>(vide)</hi> 7. Unto all which, adde but this as a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary, that the whole is a moſt unhappy verification of that which at the firſt breaking out of the Rebellion was related as ſpoken from the Rebels, that they had a conſiderable Party in <hi>England,</hi> in the very Parliament, and the Court; and that they doubted not but to find us ſo much work at home, as we ſhould have no leiſure to ſend ſuccours to the Proteſtants there (Nor can I forget, what I heard a few dayes before the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion brake out, that a Steward of a Popiſh great Lord, diſſwading a Church-warden from obeying the Order of the Houſe of Commons, about taking away Idolatrous Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bidds him not be too haſty, for before a Moneth were at an end, he ſhould ſee great alteration, and ſo it appeared, though bleſſed be God, not yet to the full of their hopes.)</p>
            <p>Lay now all theſe things together (which the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. hath inſtanced in, and forced this deſcant upon) with thoſe in the former Section, and then let all conſciences exerciſe their moſt unpartiall judgement, and moſt ample charity, and then ſuſpect in whom the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne

hath bin and is, which hath neceſſitated the other party to take Armes, to defend themſelves; and then let them ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> to an Application of two Stories of Scriptures, one of <hi>Jotham</hi> to the men of <hi>Shechem, If you have done faithfully,</hi> &amp;c. then rejoyce, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But the Doctor will have us conſider what the King hath done to exempt theſe ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of feares and jealouſies from the peoples minds. Which in ſumme are the paſſing of Bils this Parliament; and proteſtations for Religion, Priviledges of Parliament, Laws and Liberties. For the firſt of theſe, what are they worth, in ill times; and under ill Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (if once the <hi>Militia</hi> and the <hi>Navy</hi> be ſurrendred, and this Parliament diſſolved) what did <hi>magna Charta,</hi> the <hi>Petition of Right, Articles of Religion,</hi> ſerve to prevent all the ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galities and innovations upon Church and State before this <hi>Parliament</hi>; or what did all the Laws and Priviledges of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſerve them for? If ſuſpected Councellours and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers be ſtill about the King and favoured by him, where ſhall be a ſecurity to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way theſe feares. Alſo for the other, What have Proteſtations prevailed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent former danger. That unparallel'd danger to the Houſe of COMMONS, and the whole Kingdome, by his comming into the Houſe, with ſuch Followers wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the doors, ſo weaponed, ſo behaving themſelvs and ſpeaking then and ſince, was it not the very day after his Meſſage, denying them the Guard they deſired, and proteſting toward the cloſe [<hi>We do ingage unto you ſolemnly the word of a King, that the ſecurity of all and every one of you from violence, is and ſhall ever be as much Our care, as the preſervation of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s and Our Children.</hi>] And how did all men judge (that beleeved the Proteſtations ſet out at <hi>Yorke</hi> a while) that no war was intended againſt the Parliament, till ſome ſtrength gotten, as was noted before, under the name of a Guard out of <hi>Yorke</hi>-ſhiere, and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by Agents in ſeverall parts of the Kingdom, and hoped for from beyond Sea, altered the language and the face of things, till it came to the preſent extremities. Alſo whatever the Doctors Informations were at the time he was penning his clauſe of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding the Kings excellent moderation amidſt the preſſures and extremities of warr, ſhewing what reſpect he hath to the Property and Liberty of the Subject; whoſoever remembers what all (but wilfully ignorant, or altogether careleſſe) know of taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way armes from the Countries along to <hi>Cheſter</hi> and backe afterward, the plundering of <hi>Banbury</hi> (notwithſtanding the Kings promiſe to the contrary) and <hi>Abington, Reading</hi> (but moſt ſpecially <hi>Brainford</hi>) and <hi>Kingſton,</hi> though helping them in, and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of all favour, and then at <hi>Marlborow,</hi> and great cruelties to thoſe that were led away Priſoners, and this ſince the Kings Proclamation againſt plundring; and ſince that <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and many other Townes formerly, and of late in <hi>Bark ſhiere, Oxford ſhiere, Surrey, Buckingham ſhiere,</hi> will have little cauſe to believe the Doctors intelligences; or aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that all proteſtations that come in the Kings name may be truſted. And whereas he urges, that <hi>we may not raiſe an evill thought againſt the King, Eccl.</hi> 10.

That at leaſt they deſerve to be accurſed, that force men either to diſtruſt or to ſuffer ruine, becauſe they have power and will to breake that which we would truſt the King in, moſt gladly and deſiredly, if he had no ſuch men about him. I have no deſire nor will to proſecute particulars further: But the Doctor abuſes his Readers to caſt an oblique aſperſion, as if the Parliament had any thoughts of contending for a new frame of Religion, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no anſwer, ſo groſſe a ſlander it is.

Propoſitions were urged, as ſo neceſſary, as unles they were granted, the Kingdom muſt be imbroyled in a civill warr, and the reliefe of <hi>Ireland</hi> neglected.

            <p>The reſt of the <hi>Doctors</hi> book is but recapitulations Rhetoricall of what he hath ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (and an Anſwer to the inſtance of <hi>Libna's</hi> revolt, which I will be no juſtifier of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo little is ſaid of it in Scripture.) To which I have only theſe things to adde.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though <hi>Abſalom</hi> (which he mentioned before, and I ſlipt) did falſly calumniate <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> (what ever petty neglect might be in ſome officers) as appears by 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. &amp; 1 <hi>Ch.</hi> &amp; ſo being a comly perſon which takes much with the multitude, &amp; a ſtrange f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. If the <hi>Parliaments</hi> actions in all things about their defence cannot be excuſed or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified (ſpecially by thoſe that ſee not the whole of their actions, and much leſſe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of them) yet their conſciences, that ſee the juſtnes of the action for the main, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and grounds to believe their Proteſtations of their intentions in the defence, are not bound to be Neuters, much leſſe to aſſiſt the King againſt them, becauſe they are not or cannot be ſatisfied in this or that particular. For then ſcarce any warre might lawfully be joyned in.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In ſpeciall, for the ſufferance of ſo many Sects to vent their doctrins with ſuch liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to commit unſufferable out-rages upon the worſhip of <hi>God.</hi> 1; Hath not the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> declared againſt <hi>Brownists, Anabaptiſts</hi> in the firſt Remonſtrance. 2. Have not ſome Sectaries bin puniſhed? as he that made the new Creed, was he not impriſoned? 3. How many ſcandalous and innovating Miniſters have bin complained of, and yet few of them queſtioned and thoſe not fully cenſured (ſcarce one by both Houſes) the Doctor will not lay to their charge the ſuffering of ſuch: which yet he may with more reaſon, as being offendors of longer continuance and more danger. 4. The truth is, partly the multitude of offendors at firſt complained of, and partly for neare a yeare and an halfe of late, their owne extreame danger by the Malignant parties getting ſtrength, ſince the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh rebellion</hi> broke out, and ſo multitude of buſineſſes over-whelming them, have hindred that Juſtice, which elſe thoſe Sects and out-rages (the Doctor mentions) would have found, and may yet in due time, if legally proved. 5. And if he will ſay. ſome ſpeciall men favoured them in the very Houſes, he cannot ſay more then may be made good of others favouring <hi>Superſtitions, Arminianiſme, Socianiſme,</hi> and even Popery it ſelfe, Yet this were moſt unjuſtly charged upon the Body of either Houſe, and much leſſe on both. And when it ſhall pleaſe <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>the Conſultation of Divines</hi> ſhall meet (for which they have more then once paſſed the Bill for his Majeſty to confirm) it will I doubt not appeare to all the world, that they never ment to ſuffer any ſuch opinions or practiſes, as are truly diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the true <hi>Reformed Proteſtant Religion</hi>: as even in the mean time, the <hi>Orthodoxiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi> and <hi>Moderation</hi> of the <hi>Members</hi> of that <hi>Aſſembly</hi> (generally) known to all that know the perſons, may be a ſufficient pledge; among them all, there being very few, that are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any pretence of exception for Sects; and perhaps none at all, for countenancing any ſuch out-rage, as the Doctor cryes out upon. 6. In fine, the worſt of the <hi>Parliament</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:39617:42"/>
(charged upon them with any ſhadow) in matter of Religion is but omiſſions or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, which are but Moats to the beames which the Doctor overlooks in their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of old and ſtill. Who have made ſtables of Churches, but they? Who have burned and troden under foot Bibles, but their <hi>Partiſans</hi> of <hi>Ireland?</hi> Not to inſiſt on their horrid blaſphemies (which if <hi>Gods</hi> word be true, as they will one day find it) makes our Land groane and mourne under them. If a conſcience comes to weigh theſe in the ballance with the Parliament; let it, if it dare, be charitable to the Cavaliers and their Army, ſo as to believe, Religion is like to be defended by them, when the Parliament intends to ruine it. I will ſay no more to the Doctor but this one thing, that a ſober conſcience that peruſes his whole Treatiſe, will wonder what kind of conſcience his is, that Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torizes ſo for charity on the one ſide, and wholly neglects it on the other; telling us more then once, that though we lay downe our lives for our Religion, it is nothing, if we have not the charity he cals, While himſelfe with all confidence, charges the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> with many grievous faults againſt Religion, Allegiance, Lawes and Liberties, and Liberties, and diſcredits all their Proteſtations and Declarations to the contrary, as if he thought, that as his great Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. ſpeaks only in his conceit of Monarchs; ſo 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 13. related alſo to them only. No reſiſting that higher power, but all charity to him, what ever he doe or ſay. But as for the <hi>Parliament,</hi> their power is of no regard, They may be reſiſted at pleaſure, and their words and actions deſerving no charity, or challenging none. Conſciences will judge (and may without breach of charity) how charitable or true theſe interpretations and imputations be. And ſo I have done with him.</p>
            <p>If any other now aske me, why it is not as fitting eaſie to put off all imputations from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and lay it upon a Faction there (as the Declarations in the Kings Name uſe to doe) as it is for the <hi>Parliament</hi> to put off all from the King to his Councellours and Followers. I anſwer in a word, the Law commands the one, and Reaſon gives a faire ground for it. The King is but one; and ſo if thoſe about him, fill his head with ſtrange Doctrines in Religion, and Maximes or interpretations of law, and with ſtrange relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in matters of Fact, and anſwerable ſuggeſtions, unles he were a Prophet or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, he can hardly avoid falſe opinions and errours in government. Himſelfe tels us in the fore-cited anſwer to the 19 Propoſitions, of ſurreptiouſly-gotten commands from a King, by followers and favourites againſt the Law, which he is bound to protect when he knowes it. Therfore according to our Law, <hi>The King may be miſ-informed, but hee cannot be miſtaken, and the King can doe no wrong, becauſe it ſuppoſes hee doth nothing but by Adviſe of his Councellours in matters of State, and Judges in matters of law.</hi> Therfore he grants the Commons may impeach ſuch Favourites and Followers of his, and then the Lords are to judge and puniſh them. Would this have bin ſuffered, or would it yet, the <hi>Parliament</hi> and he would ſoon accord. But they get him to let them lay all upon him, which themſelves ſay and doe; and this hazards our undoing. We would not charge or diſtruſt the King: We dare not, muſt not (unleſſe we meane to be ruined) truſt or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his Councellours. But we hope and pray that <hi>God</hi> will bleſſe him ſo at laſt, as that thoſe being <hi>taken away from before him</hi> (or rather being yeelded up by him) <hi>as droſſe from the ſilver, his Throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe,</hi> Majeſty and Honour. Meane time we proclaime, they injury him, and us, and the law, that interpret what is ſaid or done againſt the multitude of his Followers and Army, or any of them, though ſheltred by his Name and Preſence, as done againſt him. On the contrary ſide, the <hi>Parliament</hi> is a numerous Body, where each one Votes ſingle, and it muſt be a <hi>Maior</hi> part that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries any thing; and there is no other ſence of a <hi>Parliament</hi> in Law and Reaſon, then the <hi>maior</hi> part at leaſt: Therfore the Votes, and Orders, and Declarations that come (as all
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:39617:43"/>
do) from the <hi>maior</hi> part, cannot be leſſe then the Votes of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> themſelves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> off, and the <hi>Parliament</hi> diſcharged. I conclude then, a King may be charitably believe to meane well, as he proteſts, only to be miſ-informed and abuſed by wicked Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.

            <p>For concluſion of all. Let me adde 5 or 6 Qualifications or Cautions upon the whole matter. 1. All Governours, Supreme ſpecially, have ſomewhat of Prerogative, beyond written or expreſſe Lawes. But this to be uſed for the Subjects good not hurt. 2. A Chriſtian, though able and innocent, is not to reſiſt all injuries, done to him in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate or perſon, no not by private perſons, much leſſe if done by the command of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, ſpecially of the Supreme. Chriſtian meeknes requires the one, and Chriſtian ſubjection the other. 3. An open and publike reſiſtance by armes, is the laſt Refuge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven, of an oppreſſed, and endangered Nation. Many injuries are to be let pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> while appearing but perſonall, not politicall, or deſigned as preſidents. Jealouſies are not to be ſuddenly taken up, nor too deeply taken in: And all poſſible meanes of redreſſe and ſatisfaction is to be endeavoured before this courſe be taken. 4. If Lawes doe inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they muſt not be reſiſted, unles they command undeniably againſt <hi>God,</hi> and not only ſo, but threaten extreame extremity. 5. Whatſoever injury happens to be done to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſons, is to be recompenced as ſpeedily and fully as may be. 6. A Peace is to be imbraced, deſired, purſued with all faithfullneſſe; ſo it may be but rationally ſafe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not betray to the miſery, which war was undertaken to prevent or remedy. 7. The Nation (and Parliament) that is put to this neceſſity of a warr muſt acknowledge <hi>God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> juſt and heavy diſpleaſure, which ſo threatens them, ſo endangers them; and therefore muſt before all, and in all, and with all, humble themſelves moſt unfainedly to God, and ſeeke to make their peace with him, and thus may hope He will bleſſe their Arms and deſires of peace, with ſufficient victory and a peacefull and happy Concluſion in due time. Which the Lord of Hoſts and God of Peace, may doe for us (as He will for all His.) I ſhut up all with that Prayer and Propheſie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.4, 5. <hi>Do good O Lord to thoſe that be good: and to them that are upright in their hearts. As for ſuch as turne aſide to their crooked wayes, the</hi> Lord <hi>ſhall leade them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace ſhall be upon</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
