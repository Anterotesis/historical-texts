         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and quartered about ſix miles from him, he drew out to
meet us, both Armies ingaged, wee after three houres
fight (very doubtfull) at laſt routed his Army, killed
and tooke about five thouſand, very many Officers, but
of what quality we yet know not; We tooke alſo two
hundred Carriages, all he had, and all his Guns, being
twelve in number, whereof two were Demy-cannons,
two Demy-Culverins, and I think the reſt were Sacres.
We purſued the enemy from three miles ſhort of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>
to nine beyond, even to the ſight of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi>
whether the King fled; Sir, this is no other but the hand
of God, to him alone be the glory, wherein none are to
ſhare with him. The Generall ſerved you with all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
and honour, and the beſt commendation I can
give him, is, I dare ſay he attributes all to God, and had
rather periſh then aſſume it to himſelfe, which is an
honeſt, and a thriving way, yet as much bravery may be
given to him in this Action, as to a man.</p>

that had marched ſo hard, and the night before had not a
bit of Bread to a regiment for their refreſhment,) the Foot and the
Traine Marched this night to <hi>Harborough</hi> (foure miles) where
our head quarter is. Time will not give me leave to enlarge my ſelf
on particulers otherwiſe it were worth your knowledge and fit
to be had in memory, I ſhall not attribute more to one Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

on earth could doe, and ſo did the Enemies foote, which before
the battaile wee leaſt valued, <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Maurice</hi> (having at leaſt
two thouſand Horſe more then ours that charged, were ſo well
received by our men though our left wing gave backe a little as
their hearts were broake at the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that which made our Horſe ſo

the beginning, the day was doubtfull, but bleſſed be the

on the place to relate it, who cannot but admire their valour, and
thus hath the Lord gone along with this new moulded Army, ſo
much contemned by many &amp; left as ſheepe to the ſlaughter by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but from the beginning I was confident, a bleſſing from
heaven did attend this Army, there were in it ſo many pious men,
men of integrity, hating vice, fighting not out of ambitiouſneſſe
or by ends, but ayming at Gods glory and the preſervation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
&amp; Liberty, and the deſtruction of the Enemy which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

If this advantage be improved (as what a wearied out and tyred

the Enemy in all probability will not this Summer get head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
