            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE PRESENT STATE OF THE Socinian Controversy, AND THE Doctrine of the Catholick Fathers Concerning A TRINITY in UNITY.</p>
            <p>By WILLIAM SHERLOCK, D. D. Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, Master of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and Chaplain in Ordinary to His MAJESTY.</p>
            <p>LONDON: Printed for <hi>William Rogers,</hi> at the <hi>Sun</hi> against St. <hi>Dunstan</hi>'s Church in <hi>Fleetstreet.</hi> MDCXC VIII.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Have little to say to the Reader, having suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently Explained the Design of this Treatise in the First Section. Those who remember how this Controversy has been of late managed, may possibly expect, what they will not find, some sharp Resentments of the Ill Usage I have met with, and as sharp Returns; but I write not to Revenge my self, but to Explain and Vindicate the Truly Ancient, Catholick and Apostolick Faith of a Trinity in Unity, which requires a Composed and Sedate Mind both in the Writer and Reader. For this Reason I have thus long delayed the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of this Treatise, the greatest part of which was Printed Two Years since, that those who will ever grow Cool, might have time to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Temper: And did I not hope that the Publication of it at this time would tend more to quiet Mens Minds, to stop the Mouths of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
<pb facs="tcp:50623:3"/>
and to secure the Catholick Faith, than a Passive Silence, it should never see the Light, how much soever my own Reputation might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by it. But I persuade my self, That the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Catholick Church, and of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Fathers, is not at so low an Ebb, even in this Age, as to be easily despised; and therefore their Explications, their Arguments, their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the Objections of Hereticks, will have their due weight; and I have not gone one step further. I appeal to the Catholick Fathers, and am contented to stand or fall by their Sentence. I have not wilfully misrepresented their Sense in any thing, and have taken all possible care not to mistake it; and as far as Human Authority is concerned, here I must leave the matter, for I know of no further Appeal.</p>

But that which is most to be lamented is, That the lukewarmness of some, and the intemperate Zeal of others, have given greater scandal to the World, and more shaken the Faith of Christians, than all the Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Adversaries could have done. I need say no more, the Case is too well known, and the Evil Effects too visible among us.</p>
                  <p>I will make no new Quarrels, if I can help it, but sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely endeavour to prevent the Mischiefs of what has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready happened, as far as is nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To do this, I shall endeavour in the first place to restore this Controversie to its original state, and take off those Vizards which make it appear very frightful to ordinary Christians.</p>
                  <p>This Dispute about the Holy and ever Blessed Trinity, has of late been dressed up anew with some old School-Terms, which how proper soever they may be to give Learned Men a more distinct Idea and Conception of that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50623:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Adorable Mystery, only amuse common Christians, and confound them, instead of teaching them better.</p>
                  <p>This, as it was at first occasioned by Hereticks, who denied or corrupted the Christian Faith, which forced the Catholick Fathers to use some unscriptural Term<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, which by degrees improved into great Subtilties, and disturbed the Church with very nice and wrangling Disputes; so our Modern <hi>Socinians</hi> at this day place the main strength of their Cause in these Disputes, and think it a sufficient Confutation of the Faith of the Ever Blessed Trinity, that the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> themselves cannot agree about the Sense of <hi>Person, Hypostasis, Substance, Nature, Essence,</hi> nor in what Sense <hi>God is One and Three;</hi> but advance very different, and, as they think, contrary Hypotheses, to reconcile the Unity of God with the distinction of Three Persons in the Godhead. As if there were no difference between what is fundamental in this Faith, and such Metaphysical Speculations: As if no man could believe in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out determining all the Disputes of the Schools. Learned men may dispute these matters, and things may so happen as to make such Disputes necessary; but the Faith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians may be secured, and Heresies may be confuted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. The Faith is plain and certain, even all that is necessary to the purposes of Religion; but men may leap out of their depths, where they can find no footing; and when such Questions are asked, as no man can certainly answer, it is very likely, that they will be answered very different ways, and upon very different Hypotheses; and there is no great hurt in this neither, while these different Hypotheses are neither made new Articles of Faith, nor new Heresies, but serve only for Hypotheses, to give a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Answer to such Questions as ought never to have been asked; and to stop the mouths of Hereticks, when they charge the Catholick Faith with Nonsense and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50623:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
To distinguish rightly between these two, will set this Controversy upon its true ancient bottom; which will spoil the Triumph of our Adversaries, and possibly may rectify the Mistakes, and allay and qualify the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Heats and Animosities of those whom a common Faith ought to make Friends.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II. How to reduce this Dispute concerning the Trinity, to Scripture Terms.</head>
                  <p>THE Catholick Fathers have always appealed to the Form of Baptism as the Rule and Standard of Faith; that as we are baptized, so we must believe, <hi>In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> This is a plain simple Faith, which every Christian may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, and which every Christian must profess, That there is an Eternal Father, who has an Eternal Son, and an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit, of the same Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and inseparably united to himself; and that this Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are the joint Object of the Christian Faith and Worship.</p>
                  <p>This is the true Christian Faith, and this is all that we are concerned to defend against our Adversaries; and would men stick to this, without engaging in Philosophical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, which we know little or nothing of, and which the Scripture takes no notice of, we should soon find how weak and impotent all the Attempts of Hereticks would prove. Whatever Disputes there are about the signification of those words <hi>Nature, Essence, Substance, Person, Hypostasis, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistences, Relations,</hi> &amp;c. there is no Dispute about the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit;</hi> we have natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Idea's belong to these words, when applied to Creatures; and when God is pleased in Scripture to represent himself
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50623:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to us under th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se Characters, if we must understand any thing by them, we can understand nothing else, but what the words signify all the World over: only allowing for that infinite distance there is between God and Creatures, which requires us to abstract from all material and creature imperfections. We must not think that God begets a Son as men do, by corporeal passions, or division of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; or that he begets a Son without himself, or sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that because a Creature-father is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways older than his Son, therefore God can't beget a Son co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ternal with himself; for all these Circumstances do not belong to the essential Notion of a Father, but of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-father: But then it is essential to the Notion both of Father and Son, that the Father communicates his own Nature to the Son, and that the Son receives his Nature and Being from his Father; that Father and Son do truly and really subsist by themselves, though they may be, and when we speak of God the Father and his Son, are insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably united to each other: that the Son, with respect to his Nature, is perfectly the same that his Father is: the son of a man, as true and perfect Man as his Father is; and therefore the Son of God, as true and perfect God.</p>
                  <p>By these Arguments the Catholick Fathers confuted both the <hi>Sabellians,</hi> who made Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but Three Names; and the <hi>Arians,</hi> who denied the Consubstantiality of the Son, or that he had the same Nature with his Father, For both these Heresies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd the essential Notion and Idea of Father and Son; which includes in it both a real distinction and sameness of Nature; that they are as really Two, but infinitely more one and the same, than any other Father and Son in Nature are.</p>
                  <p>Now I cannot see, but that as these Names and Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters are better understood, and liable to less dispute; so they convey to our Minds a more distinct conception of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50623:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God the Father and his Eternal Son, than any other artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Terms.</p>
                  <p>Were there no Controversy about <hi>Nature, Essence, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Substance, Hypostasis,</hi> yet they immediately convey no Idea of God the Father and his Eternal Son to my mind, much less give me a more distinct Conception, than these Terms <hi>Father and Son</hi> do: For they neither acquaint me what God is, nor what Father and Son is; and as the Schools themselves assert, cannot be Univocally, or in the same sense spoken of Creatures and of God, who is Super-Essential, above all Praedicaments and Terms of Art; that is, <hi>Nature, Essence, Substance, Hypostasis, Person,</hi> do not, and cannot signify the same thing, when spoken of God, as when applied to Creatures. And this has occasioned all those Disputes concerning the Use and Signification of these words, when applied to God; which indeed is no reason for wholly discarding these Terms, which the Perverseness and Importunity of Hereticks has forced the Church to use, and which have now been so long used, that the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Sense of these Words is very well known to Learned men, if they would be contented to use them in that Received Ecclesiastical Sense in which the Catholick Fathers have always used them; but yet it is a reason not to clog the Faith of ordinary Christians with them, who are not skilled in Metaphysical and Abstracted Notions; and it is a reason to reduce the Controversy, as much as possibly we can, to Scripture Terms; when these Artificial and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical Terms divide even the Professors of the Catholick Faith, and give too just occasion to the vain Boasts and Triumphs of Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>To represent this matter plainly, I observe, That all all those Unscriptural Terms which the Catholick Fathers made use of for the Explication of this Adorable Mystery, were intended for no other purpose, but to give us some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Ideas and Conceptions of what the Scripture teaches
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50623:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
concerning the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, by using such Terms as signify something in Creatures, which bears some, though a very imperfect, anology and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to what we are to conceive of God. And therefore the Fathers justifie the use of such words, by shewing, That all they mean by them is contained in Scripture, and reject any Words, and any such Sense of Artificial Words, as cannot be justified by Scripture: Which, by the way, is a more infallible Rule than all Metaphysical Subtleties, to find out in what sense the Fathers used such Words, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving to what Scripture-Notions they apply them, and how they justifie their use from Scripture, when they are Disputed.</p>
                  <p>If this be the truth of the Case, as it certainly is, then the Catholick Faith does not depend upon the use of these Terms, for it was before them; for they were intended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to explain and illustrate the Catholick Faith, and to comprise Scripture-Notions in Terms of Art, which must be acknowledged to be of great use, and was by experience found to be so in the Disputes with ancient Hereticks, while the Fathers agreed in the sense of these Terms. But when these Terms themselves are become the great matter of Dispute; and men who, as is to be hoped, agree in the Catholick Faith, cannot agree about the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and Signification of such Terms, nor how they are to be applied and used, whether in the singular or plural Number, whether substantively or adjectively, in <hi>recto</hi> or <hi>obliquo</hi>; and our Adversaries abuse such Disputes to the Reproach of the Catholick Faith, as a perplex'd, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, contradictious Riddle and Mystery, which men can know nothing of, or can never agree in; it becomes absolutely necessary at present to take this Controversy out of Terms of Art, and to let our Adversaries see, That our Controversy with them is not concerned in these Disputes: That it is not about the Signification and Use of such
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50623:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
words as Essence, Nature, Substance, Person, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but, Whether the Supreme, Eternal, Self-originated Father, have not an Eternal Son, eternally begotten of himself, and an Eternal Spirit, the Spirit of the Father and of the Son, eternally proceeding from them: And whether this Eternal Son, and Eternal Spirit, are not True and Perfect God.</p>
                  <p>In this all sincere <hi>Trinitarians</hi> do heartily agree with each other, and are ready to join issue upon this State of the Controversy, with all their Adversaries, of what de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nomination soever. And if we can prove from Scripture, That God has an Eternal Son begotten of himself, and that this Eternal Son is True and Perfect God, as the Father is; and that the Father and Son have an Eternal Spirit, who is True and Perfect God, as Father and Son is; I hope this is a sufficient Confutation of <hi>Socinianism</hi>; and yet all this may be proved, without concerning our selves in any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical Disputes: And therefore such Disputes as these, though they give opportunity to our Adversaries to make some Flourishes, and to cast Mists before peoples eyes, are not of that moment as they would represent them; they neither prove <hi>Socinianism</hi> to be true, nor the Catholick Faith of the Trinity to be false or uncertain.</p>
                  <p>I do not intend at present to dispute this Point with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> Whether the Son and the Holy Spirit (for there is no dispute about the Father) be not each of them True and Perfect God: This has been proved often enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, to the satisfaction of all sober Enquirers, who pay a just Veneration to Scripture; and shall be done again, when a fair occasion offers: But the Question under De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate now is, Whether we cannot explain and defend the Doctrine of the Trinity, without the use of Ecclesiastical or Scholastick Terms; and whether the Disputes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines about the Use and Signification of such Terms, proves any D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50623:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the Scripture Explications of it. The great Dispute is about the Distinction and Unity of the Godhead, and by what Terms to express this <hi>Wonderful Distinction, and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Vnion,</hi> as some of the Fathers call it. All sincere <hi>Trinitarians</hi> do agree, That God is <hi>Vnus &amp; Trinus,</hi> One and Three; but we having nothing in Nature like this, we know not by what Names to call it: Those who have most critically examined the force of words, find them all upon some account or other defective, or improper for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: That St. <hi>Austin</hi> well said, That in these Sublime Mysteries we can no more express what we conceive of them in Words,<note place="margin">

When we profess to believe that there are Three in the Unity of the Godhead the next question is, What Three they are? That is, By what common Name to call them, which may be multiplied with them, or spoken of them in the Plural Number; which St. <hi>Austin</hi> thinks not easily found.<note place="margin">

could give no other reason why we say Three Persons, and not Three Essences, or Three Gods, but only this, That since we acknowledge there are Three, it is fitting to agree upon some common Name to denote the Trinity by; and Ecclesiastical Use had given this Signification to the word <hi>Person.</hi>

                  <p>But then besides this, the great Dispute is, What is meant by a Person, when applied to the Three in the Blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Some adhere to the old approved Definition of a Person, That it is the Individual Substance of a Rational Nature; which is the very definition of the <hi>Greek Hypostasis,</hi>

Others are afraid of this; for if every Person be an Individual Substance, and there are Three Persons, they know not how to avoid the Consequence, That then there are Three Individual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in the Trinity. And consequently, since we can have no other Notion of the Divine Substance, but Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mind and Spirit, there must be Three Infinite Minds and Spirits in the Godhead, which they think infers Three Gods. And therefore they will not allow a Person to be a Substance, at least not an Individual Substance, but a Mode, or at most a Mode of Subsistence, or Relation, or Property, or a Person, in the <hi>Tragedian</hi> or <hi>Comedian</hi> sense of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as one represents and personates another; or to signify an Office or Magistracy, and so one man may be as many several Persons as he has Offices.</p>
                  <p>I can't answer for all these different significations of the word <hi>Person,</hi> as applied to this Sacred Mystery, especially
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50623:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as they are used by some Modern Writers; for I believe there is no such material difference between the Fathers and the Schools, as some men imagine; of which more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: But as to my present purpose, I must profess, I can see no necessity why we must find out a Common Name for the Three in the Blessed Trinity, when the Scripture has given us no Common Name for them; much less why we should dispute eternally about the propriety and use of such words, to hazard the Catholick Faith, at least the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reputation of it, together with the Peace of the Church. If I am asked not only Who but What the Three in the Ever-blessed Trinity are? I know no better Answer to make, than what the Scripture has taught me, That they are <hi>God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost</hi>; which signifies all that can be express'd by any Artificial and Unscriptural words; is an Answer liable to no Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Misrepresentations, and in which all must agree, who believe a Trinity; and it shames and silences all those Disputes which are often occasioned by other words, though never so wisely and reasonably chosen.</p>
                  <p>This Answer shews us what their Nature is, what their Distinction is, and what Relation they stand in to each other; which is the most perfect knowledge we can have of the Ever-blessed Trinity in this world.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III. That the Title of <hi>GOD,</hi> attributed in Scripture distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, gives us the best Account of their Nature, and must determine the Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Ecclesiastical Words.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AS for the first, the design of some common Name for these Three, is to form some common Notion and Idea of them, in which they all agree: And is any thing else so common to them? Is there any thing else which is common to them, but the Name and Nature of God? Can any thing else give us so true and perfect a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Idea of each of them, as this does? When we say the Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Ghost is God, we attribute every thing to each of them, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies any Perfection; for the Idea of God comprehends all possible Perfections: And we reject every thing which has the least signification of Imperfection; we abstract our minds from all Material and Creature-Images, which Names common to Creatures are apt to impose upon us; and when we are forced to apply any such Names to God, we learn from hence in what Notion to understand such Words, when applied to God.</p>
                  <p>Men may very subtilly distinguish between the formal Conceptions of <hi>Nature, Essence, Substance, Hypostasis, Existence, Subsistence, Person, Personality, Suppositality,</hi> and the like, and neither understand God nor Creatures much the better for it: But let them but tell us what they mean by these Terms, and then every Child can tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they belong to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or not: For as far as they are included in the Notion of God, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50623:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
signify true Divine Perfections, so far they belong to all Three: For if the Father be God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God, then Father, Son and Holy Ghost, each of them by themselves are whatever is included in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Idea of God, excepting their Relations of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, whereby they are distinguished into Three.</p>
                  <p>As for Example: If by <hi>Nature, Essence, Substance, Existence, Subsistence,</hi> however they may differ in their formal Conceptions, they only mean a true and real Being, who actually, perfectly, compleatly is what it is; God is Essence, Substance, Subsistence, in the most perfect sense of all; for he is All Being; his Name is <hi>Iehovah</hi>; which as Learned Men most probably conclude, signifies a Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Perfection of Being, which is such a Perfection as includes all other Perfections in it; for Perfect Being is every thing which perfectly is.</p>
                  <p>This is the peculiar Name and essential Character of God, and of God only: God is, that is, is Eternal, Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, Immutable Life and Being; in which sense the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tells us, That He only has Immortality. Creatures are, but are not Essential Life and Being: Being is not inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the formal Conception or Definition of any Created Nature. <hi>Man is a Reasonable Creature,</hi> was a true Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Human Nature, before any man was created; and would be so for ever, though all mankind were annihilated. And therefore we may reasonably enough in Creatures di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between Nature, Substance, Existence, Subsistence; if by Nature we understand that Idea or Pattern according to which they are made; and by Substance, that which is made, whatever it is, whether Matter or Spirit, which is the Subject of those Moral or Natural Perfections which belong to the Idea of such a Creature; and by Existence and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, their actual Being which they receive from their Maker, with regard to their compleat or incompleat manner of Existence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:50623:14"/>But now we can form no Idea of God without perfect life and being; for whatever else, according to our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ct manner of conceiving, is contained in the Idea of God, is nonsense and contradiction without it: Infinite Wisdom, Infinite Power, and Infinite Goodness, is the Idea of nothing, without Eternal and Necessary Being; and an Infinitely Perfect Nothing is a contradiction in the very Notion. But Infinite, Perfect, Life, and Being, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all other Perfections, and is the most simple and comprehensive Idea of God; for whatever perfectly is, is whatever is any real Perfection. So that there is no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, nor any occasion, for such Distinctions, of Essence, Nature, Substance, Existence, Subsistence, in God; for his Essence, Nature, Substance, is his Being; and his Being is perfect Existence and Subsistence. These Terms differ in their formal Conceptions, when applied to Creatures; but in essential Life and Being, these cannot be formally distinguished; for we cannot conceive Existence or Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, as superadded to Nature, as we do in Creatures; because Necessary Essential Being, is the Divine Nature: Nor can we distinguish between Essence, Nature, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, because there is no distinction in God between the Subject, and its Faculties and Powers, which is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that distinction in Creatures. Men, who do not love to use words without any Notion belonging to them, find themselves extremely puzzled to fit any distinct Ideas to these words when applied to God.</p>
                  <p>When the Fathers and Schoolmen apply these Terms to God, they take care to shew how differently they are used when applied to God, from what they signifie when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Creatures: They assert the most absolute simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Divine Nature without the least composition, and indeed expound all these Terms to the sense of <gap reason="foreign">

But notwithstanding this, that God is the most Pure Simple Being, without any imaginable composition, yet since we cannot comprize all that is necessary for us to know of God, in one simple uncompounded thought, we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably conceive the Idea of God by Parts, under different formal Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, such as his Wisdom, his Power, his Goodness, his Truth and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for such distinct representations as these, God makes of himself in the Holy Scriptures; they are what we can distinctly apprehend, and are absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the Government of our lives, and to know what we are to expect from God. But such distinctions as we can frame no distinct conceptions of, as are apt to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt our Notions of God with corporeal Representations, and perplex our Minds with endless and inextricable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, ought to be cautiously used, and carefully explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to prevent all mistakes, and to reduce them to such plain and simple Notions, as come nearest to the absolute simplicity of the Divine Essence.</p>
                  <p>And now, I suppose, it will admit of no dispute, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Father, who is God, be Essence, Substance, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence; or whether the Son, who is God, be Essence,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50623:15"/>
Substance, Subsistence; and so in like manner the Holy Ghost. For this signifies no more than <hi>To Be</hi> in the most perfect and absolute sense of <hi>Being,</hi> which is the first and most simple Idea of God, <hi>Absolute Essence and Being.</hi> So that if the Father is, the Son is, and the Holy Ghost is; each of them is Essence, Substance, Subsistence, in the most Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and Absolute sense of these Terms: For if each of them is, and each of them is God; each of them is, only in that Notion of Being, which is included in the Idea of God, which contains the most absolute Perfection of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that is, all that is absolutely Perfect. And will any <hi>Trinitarian</hi> deny, <hi>That the Father is, the Son is, and the Holy Ghost is?</hi> And then I know not what other Dispute there can be about this matter; if the Father be God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God, then the Father is, the Son is, and the Holy Ghost is, in the most Perfect No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Being, and that is all that is meant by Essence, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, Subsistence, when spoken of God.</p>
                  <p>In the same manner we may examine the signification of the word <hi>Person,</hi> which has occasioned no small Dispute. We say that there are Three Persons in the Godhead, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and each of these Divine Persons is in himself True and Perfect God. Now if we must call these Divine Three, Three Persons, (which long Use and Custom has made Reasonable, and in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure Necessary) the most certain way to determine the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of <hi>Person,</hi> when applied to God, is to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in what sense one who is True and Perfect God, may be called a Person; for <hi>GOD</hi> is the Scripture Name and Character which is distinctly attributed to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and therefore that must give the Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all other words of Human Use and Institution, as far as relates to this Mystery.</p>
                  <p>These words <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> were very anciently used, without any Definition to determine their Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50623:15"/>
till they became matter of dispute. <hi>Boetius</hi> has given us a definition of <hi>Person</hi>; which has been generally allowed of ever since, that a <hi>Person is an individual Substance of a rational Nature.</hi> Let us then examine whether this definition can belong to a Divine Person, to one who is True and Perfect God.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Substance, Boetius</hi> tells us, That it is essential to the Notion of <hi>Person;</hi>

And therefore the Father is not the Son, nor the Holy Spirit; nor the Son the Father, or Holy Spirit; nor the Holy Spirit either Father or Son: And yet, if each of them be God, each of them Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>is Perfect Being,</hi> and therefore are as Perfectly Distinct, as three which perfectly are, and are not one another.

So that if Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, be so in a true and proper Notion, are in truth and reality what these Names of Father, Son, and Spirit, signify: That the Father is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p>The only Question then is, Whether these Names, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, signify naturally and properly when spoken of the Holy Trinity, or are only metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and allusive Names; though what they should be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors of, is not easy to conceive, and as absurd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that there should be any Metaphors in God, who is all Perfect Essence and Being. The Divine Nature and Perfections, which we cannot conceive of as they are, may be expressed by Metaphors taken from some thing which is analogous in Creatures; upon which account we read of the Hands, and Eyes, and Ears, and Bowels, and Mouth of God. Creatures may serve for Metaphors, for Shadows, and Images, to represent something of God to us, but the reality of all is in God. So that we may allow Father and Son in some sense to be Metaphorical Names, when applied to God; not that God the Father is not in the highest and most perfect sense a Father; and his Son a most proper, natural, genuine Son, but because the Divine Generation is so perfect a Communication of the Divine Nature and Being from Father to Son; that Human Generations, Creature-Fathers and Sons, are but obscure, imperfect images and resemblances of it. When any thing is spoken Metaphorically of God, the Metaphor and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50623:18"/>
Image is always in the Creatures; the Truth, Perfection, and Reality of all in God. And if this be a certain and universal rule, then if God be a Father, if he have a Son, an only B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But, I think, this will admit of no Dispute, if we own, that God has a Son, who is himself True and Perfect God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For a Son, who is Perfect God, is God of God. That he is a Son, proves that he receives his Nature from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for this is Essential to the Notion of a Son; That he is Perfect God, proves the Perfection of his Generation from the Perfection of his Nature: For to be Perfect God, of Perfect God, is to receive the Whole, Perfect, Undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Nature of his Father, which is the most perfect Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration that is possible, for a Whole to beget a Whole. And if God the Father, and his Son, be Truly and Perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father and Son, they must be Truly and Perfectly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct; That is, they are in a proper sense Two, and by the same reason, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are Three: And we need no other proof of this, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Names of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them in a proper and natural Sense.</p>

                  <p n="3">III. THESE Names of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as they signify and prove a real Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between these Three, so they also signify and prove the Unity, Sameness, Identity of Nature, and Godhead: Which reconciles the Faith of the Trinity with the Faith of one God: The same One Divine Essence and Godhead, being and subsisting, Whole, Perfect, and Entire in each of these Divine Three.</p>
                  <p>I shall Explain and Confirm this matter more at large hereafter; and therefore at present shall only briefly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this Notion, and the reason of it.</p>
                  <p>One Eternal Self-Originated Divine Nature, is One Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity and One God; and nothing can destroy the Unity of God, but what destroys the Unity of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by Division or Multiplication: And if this be the true Notion of the Unity of God (and if it be not, I would desire to know, why this is not, and what is) then the Unity of God may be preserved in Three, each of whom is True and Perfect God, if the same One Divine Nature, or Divinity, subsists distinctly in them all: And the very Characters and Relations of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, do necessarily infer and prove, the same One Divinity in them all: And therefore the Christian Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is so far from contradicting, that it establishes the Faith of one God: As to explain this in a few words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:50623:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>All Christians agree, That God, whom we call the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is an Eternal Self-Originated Being, who had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Being, and received his being from no other, and that there is no other Self Originated Being, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. This is the Notion which all Mankind have of One God, That there is one Infinite, Eternal, Self-Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Being or Nature; and if there be (as it is certain there is) but one such Nature and Divinity, there can be but One God. And this is Established in the Christian Faith, which owns but One God the Father, who is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Scripture, in a peculiar manner, called <hi>the One God, and the Only True God.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r all Christians are agreed; but here our <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Adversaries stop: For how can the Son be God, and the Holy Ghost be God, if the Father be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Self-Originated Being, and the One True God?</p>
                  <p>Now the very Notion of a Son Answers this difficulty, or at least proves, that so it is, however it may exceed our finite Comprehension.</p>
                  <p>It is Essential to the Notion of a Son, to be of another, of him, whom we call his Father, and to receive the same Nature from him. Man begets a Man, and God begets God; but there is an infinite distance between these two, as there is between God and Creatures.</p>
                  <p>When Man begets a Man, he does not Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his own whole entire numerical Nature to his Son, but with part of his own Substance Communicates the same specifick Nature to him, or a Nature of the same kind; and therefore a Man and his Son are two Men, as having two particular Natures, though specifically the same.</p>
                  <p>But if we believe, that God has a Son, begotten by him of himself, I say, not created out of nothing, nor made of any other prae-existent Nature or Substance, but eternally begotten of himself, we must acknowledge,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50623:20"/>
that the Father and the Son are perfectly One, excepting that one is the Father, and the other the Son.</p>
                  <p>All men, who know any thing of the Divine Nature, know, that God is the most Pure, Simple, Uncompound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Being; and if God, who has no parts, and cannot be divided into any, begets a Son, he must Communicate his Whole, Undivided Nature to him: For to beget a Son, is to Communicate his own Nature to him; and if he have no parts, he cannot Communicate a part, but must Communicate the Whole; that is, he must Communicate his whole self, and be a second self in his Son.</p>
                  <p>Now a Whole, and a Whole of a Whole, are certainly two, but not two Natures, but one Nature, not meerly Specifically, but Identically One; for it is impossible that a Whole, which is Communicated without Division, or Separation, should have the least imaginable diversity from it self, so as to become another Nature from it self; for a Whole of a Whole must be perfectly and identically the same with that Whole of which it is; for a Whole can be but One. This is that <gap reason="foreign">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sameness and Identity of Nature, which the Fathers assert, and whereon they found the Unity of the Godhead.

                     </gap> in the Neuter-Gender, which must relate to Nature, not to Number.</p>
                  <p>To distinguish or multiply Natures, there must be some real or notional diversity and alterity between them, as <hi>Boetius</hi> observes: But a Whole can never differ in the least from the whole of which it is, no more than the same Whole can differ from it self; and it is this Sameness and Identity, which is called a Numerical Unity of Nature,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50623:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and is peculiar to the Divine Nature, there being nothing like it in Creatures: Not that the Divine Nature consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as in the Father, is the same in number with the Divine Nature as communicated to, and subsisting distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Son; for then the Father and the Son can't be two; for the Person of the Father and his Divinity, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, is the same; and the Person of the Son, and his Divine Nature is the same; and if this Oneness relate to number, there can be but One Person, as there is but One Nature: but a Numerical Unity of Nature does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Number of Persons, each of whom has the whole Divine Nature Perfectly and Distinctly in himself; it does not exclude the actual and perfect communication of the same Divine Nature to more than one, but only excludes all imaginable diversity and alterity; and what is not <hi>aliud,</hi> is <hi>unum;</hi> that which is not another thing, another different Nature, is but One: That is, the Divine Nature is nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically One, in opposition to any other Absolute, Self-ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated Divinity, not in opposition to the Eternal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of its self to the Son and Holy Spirit. If the Divine Nature, as actually and distinctly subsisting in Three, be as perfectly One, as the Idea of God is One, as any specifick Notion, suppose of Human Nature, is One; then it is Identically and Numerically one and the same. And indeed this is the true reason why the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Fathers so often represent the Unity of the Divine Nature by Allusions and Metaphors signifying a specifick Unity; because the Divine Nature, as subsisting in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is as perfect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, or Mode, or manner of Existence, and Being is, that he is Self-originated, and receives his Being from no other; the Son's is, that he is Eternally Begotten of the Father, and receives his Nature and Being without any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, from the Father; the Holy Ghost's is, that he Eternally Proceeds from Father and Son; and this is all the distinction that is between them: They have but one undivided, undiversified Nature; but these opposite Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions necessarily prove them Three in Number, as I have already shewn; though the Divine Essence, the <hi>res nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata,</hi> is but One; it being Communicated from Father to Son, and from Father and Son to the Holy Ghost, Whole of Whole; which makes it perfectly one and the same Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided, Undiversified, Essence, Subsisting Distinctly, but not Separately, in Three.</p>
                  <p>That this is the true Notion both of the Fathers and Schools, and all that the wisest Schoolmen meant by the Singularity of the Divine Essence and Nature, which they acknowledged to subsist <hi>in Tribus Suppositis,</hi> or <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonis,</hi> whole and entire in Three distinct Persons or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, may appear in due time, when Men have recovered

                  <p>This seems to be the true Reason why St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and after him the Schoolmen, lay such stress upon the Relations in the Trinity, to salve the Unity of the Divine Nature. For by Relations the Schools mean, <hi>Relationes Subsistentes,</hi> Subsisting Relations, or Relatives, not Relations without a Subject; which St. <hi>Austin</hi> rejects as absurd: For nothing can be Predicated Relatively which has not some Being and Substance of its own to be the foundation of that Relation: A Man who is a Master,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Now these Relations in the Trinity, of Father, Son, and Spirit, though each of them have the whole Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Substance, do yet prove that there are not Three Absolute Independent Divinities, but only One Divine Nature and Substance: As St. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks of Father and Son, <hi>utrunque Substantia, &amp; utrunque Vna Substantia;</hi> they are both of them Substance, and both of them One Substance; for the Son must receive his whole Being from his Father, and therefore have the same One Nature and Substance that his Father has; which proves, that a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Relatives can be but One God, because they can have but One Divine Nature in them all. But this is beyond my present design.</p>

This I have explained as easily and familiarly as possibly I could, that ordinary Christians, who are not skilled in School Terms or Subtilties, may know what they are to Believe, and see the plain Reasons of it. This is what all Christians, who sincerely Believe a Trinity, are agreed in; That there is an Eternal Father, who has an Eternal Son, and an Eternal Spirit, of the same Nature with himself: That the Father is God, God of himself; The Son is God, God of God, True and Perfect God, Begotten of his Father from all Eternity; That the Holy Ghost is God, True and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God, Eternally Proceeding from Father and Son: That the Father is not the Son, nor the Son the Father, nor the Holy Ghost Father or Son; but they are Three, truly and really distinct from each other: But that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, have all the same One Divinity, Communicated from the Father to the Son, and from Father and Son to the Holy Spirit, and therefore are but One God. All this, as I have shewn, is necessarily inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Names and Relations of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; which if they be not empty Names, but signify any thing real, must signify all this.</p>
                  <p>And what is there unintelligible in all this? Such a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, and such an Unity as is signified in the very Names of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, necessarily prove that God is Three and One: If the Father is himself True and Perfect God, the Son himself True and Perfect God, the Holy Ghost himself True and Perfect God, and the Father is not the Son, nor the Son the Father,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50623:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nor the Holy Ghost either Father or Son, then there are Three, each of whom is in himself True and perfect God, and that is a Divine Trinity: And if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther communicates his whole Nature without division or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to the Son, and Father and Son communicate the same whole Nature to the Holy Spirit, they are in the most perfect notion One, there being one and the same whole entire perfect Divinity in all Three. A Whole, a Whole, and a Whole, are Three in number, but are but one Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Nature; for a Whole of a Whole must be the same Whole; and in this Unity of Nature consists the Unity of the Godhead.</p>
                  <p>I grant a Whole of a Whole is very unconceivable to us; and so is the Notion of an Eternal self-originated Being, and of Creation, to the full as unconceivable, as the Eternal Generation of a Whole from a Whole: But this is a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the Notion of an Eternal Generation, not of a Trinity in Unity: If God begets a Son, as the Scripture assures us he has an only begotten Son, he must communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his own Nature to him; and besides the Testimony of Scripture, That all the Father has is the Son's, his whole Nature and Divinity, Reason assures us, that God being a pure simple Being, without composition or parts, if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his Nature to his Son, he must communicate it whole and entire, without division or separation; and if this be so, it is certain, that Father and Son, he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, and he who is begotten, are Two; and it is as certain, that the same whole Divinity, communicated by the Father to the Son, is but the same One Divinity; and One Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, though actually subsisting in Three, can be but One God, not Three Gods. It is certain, this is the most perfect Unity that can be, between Three who are truly and really the same, and yet distinct; for they can n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>BUT our <hi>Socinian</hi> Adversaries, and some who would not be thought <hi>Socinians,</hi> have espoused such a Notion of <hi>One God,</hi> as makes the Faith of a Trinity absolutely irreconcilable with the Faith of One God.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>One God,</hi> they mean <hi>One</hi> who is God; but the Faith of the Trinity owns Three, each of whom is by himself True and Perfect God; and I grant it is as absolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to reconcile these two, as it is to reconcile Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions; for to say that there is but One who is God, and to say that there are Three, each of whom is God, is a manifest Contradiction; and yet without saying this last, we must deny a Trinity. It is in vain to think to solve this with Words without Sense: If there is but One who is God, we must either make Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Three Names, or Modes, or Manifestations of the same One Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Divine Person; which was the ancient, exploded, anathematized Heresy of <hi>Noetus</hi> and <hi>Sabellius</hi>; or we must make the Son and Holy Spirit to be mere Creatures, if we allow any Personality to them, as <hi>Arius, Macedonius, Paulus Samosatenus,</hi> and such like Hereticks, and our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Socinians</hi> do.</p>
                  <p>But we, with the Scriptures and the Catholick Church, reject this Notion of the Unity of God, which is to assert the Unity, but to deny a Trinity. And because this seems to be so prevailing a Notion at this time, I shall shelter my self as well as I can, under the Authority of the Catholick Fathers, and the Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>That there is but One God, was always the Faith of the Catholick Church, as appears from all the Ancient Creeds;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50623:24"/>
but then they did not believe in One God, as One God sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies One Divine Separate Person; which is never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in any Christian Creed, but <hi>in One God the Father,</hi> who has an only begotten Son, and an Eternal Spirit, in the Unity of the same Godhead. There is no Christian Creed, which teaches the Belief of One God who is not a Father; and if the One God be a Father, he must have a Son of his own Nature and Substance; and the Son of God, consubstantial with God the Father, must be God the Son.

                  <p>It were easy to multiply Quotations to this purpose, both out of these and numerous other Ancient Writers; but this is Proof enough, that the Primitive Fathers would not be frighted out of the true Catholick Faith of a Real and Substantial Trinity, by the loud Clamours of <hi>Tritheism</hi>; but rejected such a Notion of One God, as confined the Godhead to One Single Solitary Person, as <hi>Iudaism,</hi> and an <hi>Anti-trinitarian</hi> Heresy.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50623:26"/>
conceive no otherwise of him, than as he himself hath taught us.</p>
                  <p>This is very reasonable, if we believe upon God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, To believe all that God reveals, and to expound the Revelation by it self; not to put such a sense upon one part of the Revelation, as shall contradict another; but to put such a sense upon the words, as makes the whole consistent with it self.</p>
                  <p>As in the present Dispute concerning the Unity of God. The Scripture assures us, that there is but One God, and we believe that there is but One God. Excepting the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinians,</hi> and such kind of Hereticks, all Christians, both Catholicks, and Hereticks, agree in this Profession. But the Question is, In what sense the Scripture teaches that there is but <hi>One God?</hi> Whether this <hi>One God</hi> signifies One single Divine Person, or One God with his Only begotten Son and Eternal Spirit, who have the same Nature and Divinity?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> embrace the first Sense of the words, That One God is One Divine Person, and for this reason will not own Christ, or the Holy Spirit, to be True and Perfect God, because there is but One God, and Three Divine Persons, they say, are Three Gods. Now unless we will pretend to understand the Divine Nature, and the Divine Unity, better than God himself does, we must refer this Dispute to Scripture; and if we have the same Authority to believe more Divine Persons than One, that we have to believe but One God, then the Unity of God in the Scripture-notion of it, is no Tritheism, nor any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection against the belief of a Trinity; for there may be but One only God, and yet Three Divine Persons in the Unity of the same Godhead.</p>
                  <p>This is St. <hi>Hilary</hi>'s Argument,<note place="margin">

And therefore, though we do, and must believe One God, we must not so believe One God, as to deny the Son of God to be God, for this is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>This Argument he prosecutes at large throughout the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and V<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Books of the Trinity, and alledges all those <hi>Old Testament</hi> Proofs for the plurality of Divine Persons, and for the Divinity of Christ; which, whatever opinion some Modern Wits and Criticks have of them, have been applied to that purpose by all Christian Writers from the beginning of Christianity; and were that my present Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, might be easily vindicated from the Cavils and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, That <hi>there is One God the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and One Iesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.6.</p>

                  <p>I shall not dispute these matters now, which will be more proper in another place; it is enough at present, that we learn from them what Sense these Fathers had concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Unity of God; <hi>viz.</hi> That it is not the Unity of a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This is plain sense which every Christian may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, and what every one must believe who wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l be a Christian: We must believe in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, that the Father is not the Son, nor the Son the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50623:31"/>
Father, nor the Holy Ghost either Father or Son; and that each of these Three is in himself, as distinguished from the other Two, true and perfect God; but though they are Three, and each of them true and perfect God, yet they are not Three Gods, because there is but One and the same Divinity in them: The same individual numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Divine Nature, being whole, perfect, undivided in them all; originally in the Father, by Generation in the Son, and by Procession in the Holy Ghost, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready explained it, which is the most perfect Unity we can conceive between Three Wholes, or Three, each of which have the same whole undivided Nature distinctly in themselves.</p>
                  <p>If this will not be allowed to be such a Unity as is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Notion of One God; that the natural Notion of One God is of One only who is God, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to the belief of Three, each of whom is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self true and perfect God; the answer the Catholick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers give to this (as I have now shewn) ought to satisfy all Christians; that this is not the Scripture-notion of One God, That there is but One, who is God; because the same Holy Scriptures which teach us, that there is but One God, do also teach us, that there are Three in the Unity of the Godhead. That not only the Father is God, as an Infinite, Eternal, Self-originated Being, and upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in a peculiar manner called the One and only true God; but the Son also is true God, and the Holy Ghost true God, by the Communication of the same Divine Nature to them. Now God knows his own Nature and Unity best, and if he declares himself to be but One God, but yet requires us to believe his Eternal Son to be true and perfect God, and his Eternal Spirit to be true and perfect God; it is certain that the Divinity of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is very reconcilable with the Unity of God. For as far as Revelation must decide this Dispute, we are
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50623:31"/>
as much obliged to believe, That the Father is God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God, as we are to believe, That there is but One God.</p>
                  <p>Those who will not acquiesce in this, must appeal from Scripture to Natural Reason, which is a very absurd and impudent Appeal; for the plain sense of it is this, That they will believe their own Reason before the Scriptures, in matters relating to the Divine Nature and Unity, which all wise men acknowledge to be so much above human comprehension: That is, That they know the Unity of God better than God himself does; or, which is the same thing, That they will never believe any Revelation to come from God, or any thing, how express soever the words are, to be the meaning of the Revelation, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their own Reason approves it: Of which more elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>And yet I dare appeal to any man of a free and unbiass'd Reason in this Cause, What is that Natural Notion we have of One God? Is it any thing more, than that there is and can be but One Eternal Self-originated Being, who is the Principle or Cause of all other Beings? And does not the Scripture, do not all <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> with the whole Catholick Church, own this? Do not all the Christian Creeds teach us to profess our Faith in One God the Father, from whom the Son and the Holy Spirit receive their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head? Thus far then Scripture, and Reason, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith agree: Does Reason then deny, that God can beget of himself an Eternal Son, his own perfect Image and Likeness? If it does, then indeed Scripture and Reason contradict each other: But I believe these men will not pretend to prove from Reason, That God could not beget an Eternal Son; and if this cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Reason, as I am certain it never can, then Reason does not contradict Scripture, which teaches us that God has an only begotten Son: And if God have an only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50623:32"/>
Son, Reason will teach us that the Son of God must be True and Perfect God, and yet not another God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he has one and the same Nature with his Father.</p>
                  <p>This is all that any Christian need to believe concerning this matter, and all this every Christian may understand; and all this every one who sincerely believes the Faith of the Holy Trinity, does and must agree in: Those who do not, I will at any time undertake to prove to be secret He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and Enemies to the Christian Faith: and as for those who do, I will never dispute with them about some Terms of Art, and the Propriety of Words, in a matter which is so much above all words and forms of speech.</p>
                  <p>And here I leave this matter upon a sure Bottom; and here we are ready to join Issue with our <hi>Socinian</hi> Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Our only Controversy as to the Doctrine of the Trinity with them is, Whether the Son, and the Holy Spirit, each of them, be True and Perfect God: If we can prove this, which has been the Faith of the Catholick Church in all Ages, we need dispute no other matters with them; nor can any Disputes among our selves give any Support to their Cause. A Dispute about Words may look like a difference in Faith, when both contending Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may mean the same thing; as those must do, who sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely own and believe, That the Son is True and Perfect God, and the Holy Ghost is True and Perfect God, and that neither of them are the Father, nor each other.</p>
                  <p>And therefore those different Explications of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity which the <hi>Socinians</hi> of late have so much triumphed in, and made more and greater than real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are, and more sensless too by their false Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, can do them no real service among Wise Men, tho it may help to amuse the Ignorant. If any men have subtilly distinguished away the Catholick Faith, they may take them to themselves, and increase their Party by them: But if this were the Case, as I hope it is not, it is no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50623:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
against the Catholick Faith, that some men openly oppose it, and others, at least in some mens opinions, do secretly undermine it. There is reason to guard the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith against all inconvenient or dangerous Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which seem to approach near Heresy, if this be done with due Christian Temper and Moderation; but I hope the Disputes of the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> are not so irreconcilable, but that they will all unite against a Pestilent and Insolent Heresy, which now promises it self glorious Successes only from their private Quarrels.</p>

                  <head>SECT. I. Concerning the Ways of managing this Controversy.</head>
                  <p>BEfore I put an end to this Discourse, it will contribute very much to the better understanding of what I have said, and give a clearer Notion of the Use of it, to apply these Principles to the Examination of a late Treatise, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Some Considerations concerning the Trinity.</hi> The Author I know not; he writes with Temper; and though he takes the liberty to find fault, he does it Civilly, and therefore he ought to meet with Civil Usage, and so he shall from me, as far as the bare Censure of his Principles will admit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:50623:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>I was, I confess, startled at the first entrance, to find him own <hi>the Vncertainty of our Faith in these Points</hi> (concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Trinity);<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> p. 1.</note> for if after the most perfect Revelation of the Gospel that we must ever expect, and the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Tradition of the Catholick Church for above Sixteen Hundred years, this Faith is still uncertain, it is time to leave off all Enquiries about it. As for <hi>the many absurd and blasphemous Expositions that have been made of this Doctrine;</hi> if by them he means the Ancient Heresies which infested the Church, they are so far from rendring our Faith uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that (as I shall shew him anon) the very Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those Heresies by the Catholick Church, gives us a more certain account what the true Catholick Faith was. I agree with him, that <hi>the warm and indiscreet Management</hi> of <hi>contrary Parties,</hi> has been <hi>to the Prejudice of Religion,</hi> among unthinking people, who hence conclude the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of our Faith; and it concerns good men to remove this Prejudice, by distinguishing the Catholick Faith from the Disputes about Ecclesiastical Words, and the Catholick Sense of them; and I hope I have made it appear this may be done, and then the Faith is secure, notwithstanding these Disputes; and as for any other Offence or Scandal, let those look to it, who either give or take it.</p>
                  <p>This Considerer dislikes all the Ways and Methods which have hitherto been taken to compose these Disputes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He dislikes those who are <hi>for reverencing the Mystery of the Trinity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Consid.</hi> p. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>without ever looking into it at all</hi>; who <hi>think it proposed to us only as a Trial and Exercise of our Faith; and the more implicit that is, the fuller do we express our Trust and Reliance upon God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if by <hi>not looking into it at all,</hi> he means not enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what they are to believe concerning the Trinity, nor why they believe it; this I acknowledge is a very odd sort of Faith; but I believe he cannot name any such men whose
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50623:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
avowed Principle this is: An <hi>Implicit Faith</hi> is only merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but then an <hi>Implicit Faith</hi> is to believe without knowing what or why; but these <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus or Mystery-Trinitarians</hi> (as some late <hi>Socinian</hi> Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers have insolently and reproachfully called them, and whom our Author ought not to have imitated) never teach such an Implicit Faith as this, much less admire <hi>the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and Merit of Faith in believing Contradictions, and the more the better.</hi> Under all the appearance of Modesty and Temper, these are very severe and scandalous Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon some of the Wisest and Greatest Men amongst us, and which this Considerer had little reason for, as will soon appear.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine of the Holy Trinity is the most Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Article of the whole Christian Faith, and therefore an explicite Knowledge and Belief of it is essential to the Christian Profession, and thus all Protestant Divines teach; and whatever Voluminous Disputes there may be about it, the true Christian Faith of the Trinity is comprized in a few words, and the Proofs of it are plain and easy: For the Scriptures plainly and expresly teach us, that there is but One God; and that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God; that the Father is not the Son, nor the Son the Father, nor the Holy Ghost either Father or Son; as I have already explained it: This we all teach our people to believe upon the Authority of Scripture (which is the only Authority we can have for matters of pure Revelation), and expound those Texts to them which expresly contain this Faith, and vindicate them from the Cavils and perverse Comments of Hereticks: And this, I think, is not to <hi>reverence the Mystery, without ever looking into it at all,</hi> when we look as far as we can, till Revelation bounds our prospect: And this is to look into it as far as God would have us, and as far as is necessary to all the purposes of Religion; that is, as far as the knowledge of this Mystery is of any use to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:50623:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>Now when this is done, there are a great many wise men who think we ought to look into this Mystery no further; and there seems to be a very good reason for it; <hi>viz.</hi> because with all our looking, we can see no further. There are indeed some curious Questions started about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the Unity of God with the belief of a Trinity, in which there are Three, each of whom is by himself True and Perfect God; for if there be but One God, how can there be Three, each of whom is True God? Now whatever Answer may be given to such kind of Objections and pretended Contradictions, these Learned Men think there is no reason to clog the Christian Faith with them, nor to disturb the minds of ordinary Christians with such Subtilties: That the Authority of God who has revealed this, and the acknowledged Incomprehensibility of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, is a sufficient Answer to all Objections; and as ridiculously as a Witty Man may represent this, That is the truest Faith, not which can believe Contradictions, but which can despise the pretence of Contradictions, when opposed to a Divine Revelation; for that resolves Faith wholly into Divine Authority, which is the true Notion of a Divine Faith.</p>
                  <p>To say that this will not <hi>suppress any of our Doubts or Disputes in Religion,</hi> is a manifest mistake; for such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Veneration for the Authority of God, would silence them all: And whatever is <hi>the Natural Propension of the Soul to the search of Truth,</hi> Natural Reason will tell us, that there are a thousand things which we can know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of, and that it is in vain to search after them; but that the Divine Wisdom is unsearchable, and therefore God is to be believed beyond our own knowledge or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension; and when we are agreed about the Truth and Certainty of the Revelation, that will silence all our Disputes about what is revealed, and set bounds to our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:50623:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>And I never knew before, the danger of submitting our Reason to Faith, of <hi>a blind resignation of judgment</hi> (as he is pleased to call it) to a Divine Revelation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Consid.</hi> p. 3.</note> for that is the matter in debate. <hi>Blasphemies and Contradictions may, and have been imposed upon mens Faith, under the Venerable Name of Mysteries</hi>; but such Blasphemies and Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were never revealed in Scripture, and therefore belong not to the present Enquiry, which only concerns believing what we allow to be revealed, without looking any farther into it. We allow all men to examine the Truth and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Revelation, and to examine what is revealed; but here we must stop, and not pretend to judge of what is revealed, by the measures of human Reason, which is so inadequate a Rule for Divine and Supernatural Truths. This is all very plain; and if he will allow the Truth of this, he must confess, that what he has said upon this first Head is nothing to the purpose. It is a very popular thing to decry Mysteries, and to cry up Reason, but to be very cautiously imitated, because it is generally found that such men are either no great Believers, or no very deep Reasoners.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the next place he tells us of a very strange sort of men, <hi>who call the Doctrine of the Trinity an Incomprehensible Mystery,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>and yet are at a great deal of pains to bring it down to a level with Human Vnderstanding; and are all very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest to have their own particular Explications acknowledged as necessary Articles of Faith.</hi> An <hi>Incomprehensible Mystery</hi> is what Human Reason cannot comprehend; to bring an Incomprehensible Mystery <hi>down to the level of Human Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,</hi> is to make it comprehensible by Reason; and those are notable men indeed, who undertake to make that comprehensible by Reason, which at the same time they acknowledge to be incomprehensible: It is to be hoped this Considerer does a little mistake them: Men may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe the Trinity to be an Incomprehensible Mystery,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50623:35"/>
and yet speak of it in words which may be understood, which does not pretend to make the Mystery comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, but to deliver it from Nonsense, Jargon, and Heresy; that is, not to explain the Mystery, which is and will be a Mystery still, but to secure the true Christian Doctrine of the Trinity, which they desire may continue an Article of the Christian Faith still.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">P. 5.</note>There are, he tells us, a third sort of men who are for no Mystery; that is, the <hi>Socinians</hi>; and I was glad to find them censured and rejected, but wonder'd how they came to be numbred among those men who <hi>have laboured in this good design</hi> of explaining the Trinity,<note place="margin">P. 2.</note> and reconciling the Disputes about it.</p>
                  <p>Well: All these Methods have proved ineffectual; let us then (to omit other matters) enquire what Course our <hi>Considerer</hi> took to make himself a fit and competent Judge of this Controversy: Take the account of it in his own words; <hi>I have endeavoured to deliver my self from Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and Confusion of Terms, and to speak justly and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>And not being yet prepossess'd in favour of any particular Explication, the better to preserve my freedom of examining the Subject in hand, I have purposely forborn to search the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Schoolmen, or</hi> Fratres Poloni, <hi>or read over any later Treatises concerning this Controversy, while I was composing the present Essay, resolving to consult nothing but Scripture and my own Natural Sentiments, and draw all my Reflections from thence, taking only such which easily and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint offered themselves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Des Cartes</hi> made a New Philosophy, and this is the best way that can be thought of to make a New Faith. This has an appearance of great Indifferency and Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, but it is a great mistake when men boast in this as a virtue and attainment, and an excellent disposition of mind for the Examination of Matters of Faith. I never in my life yet saw any one example to the contrary, but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50623:35"/>
that when men who had been educated in the Christian Faith, and tolerably instructed in the meaning and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of it, could persuade themselves to be thus perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different whether it were true or false, but this indifference was owing to a secret byass and inclination to Infidelity or Heresy. It is in vain to pretend such an absolute freedom of Judgment, without being perfectly indifferent which side is true or false: For if we wish and desire to find one side of the question true, and the other false, this is a Byass, and our Judgment is not equally poiz'd. And certainly in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of such vast consequence as the Christian Faith, and especially that great Fundamental Article of the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, such an Indifferency as this is, can never recommend either an Author or his Writings to sober Christians. Will this Considerer then own, that it was indifferent to him when he undertook this design, whether the Doctrine of the Trinity should upon Examination appear true or false? If it were not, the <hi>Socinians</hi> will tell him that he had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served a Freedom of Judgment, and then he did well in not consulting the <hi>Fratres Poloni,</hi> for he had condemn'd them without hearing; or if he were persuaded concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrine of the Trinity, Was it indifferent to him whether the <hi>Sabellian,</hi> or <hi>Arian,</hi> or True Catholick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Trinity, contained in the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creeds, were the True Faith? That is, Was it indifferent to him, whether the Ancient Heresies condemn'd by the Catholick Church, or that Faith which the Catholick Church has always own'd and professed, be the True Faith? For my part, I confess, I am not thus indifferent; I will never shut my eyes against plain Conviction, which is all the Freedom of judging which is allowable; but my Prejudices are, and I hope always will be, on the side of the Catholick Faith. No wise man can be thus indifferent. And we shall find this <hi>Considerer</hi> was not so very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; for the main Principles he reasons on, are some Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50623:36"/>
Mistakes and Prejudices, which he seems to have espoused without due Consideration.</p>
                  <p>But let us allow him to be as free and unprejudic'd as he pleases, I cannot think that he took a good method to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this Sacred Mystery. He laid aside <hi>Fathers, School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and other later Treatises concerning this Controversy, and consulted nothing but Scripture, and his own natural Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents.</hi> To consult Scripture is indeed a very good way, and absolutely necessary in matters of pure Revelation, which can be certainly known no other way; but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at least are very good Guides, and have very great Authority in expounding Scripture; and our <hi>Natural Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,</hi> otherwise called Natural Reason, is a very bad, a very dangerous Expositor of Scripture in such Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Mysteries, and has no Authority in these mattters; and how our <hi>Considerer</hi> has been misled by his Natural Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, will soon appear.</p>
                  <p>A few words might serve for an Answer to the <hi>Considerer</hi>; but since this is the great Pretence of <hi>Socinians</hi> and other Hereticks, to set up Scripture and Natural Reason, against Scripture and the Traditionary Faith of the Catholick Church; and our <hi>Considerer</hi> and some other unwary Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters chime in with them, it will be very necessary to shew how this betrays the Catholick Faith, and makes Reason and Criticism the Supreme Judge of Controversy; and then men may dispute on without end, and believe at last as they please.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50623:36"/>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch has been, especially in the first and purest Ages of it, This I take to be a <hi>Traditionary Faith</hi>; nor is it the less <hi>Traditionary because the Fathers and Ancient Writers sound their Expositions of the Trinity wholly upon Scripture:</hi> For if this be true, then we have a Traditionary Faith of the Trinity, and a Traditionary Exposition of the Scripture, for the Reason and Proof of that Faith, both in one; which I take to be a greater Authority, and safer Guide, than mere <hi>Scripture</hi> and our <hi>Natural Sentiments:</hi> And though Protestants al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the only Standard of Faith, yet he might have remembred, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to expound Scripture as the Ancient Fathers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it.</p>
                  <p>But this <hi>Wholly</hi> is a Mistake; for the Primitive Fathers pleaded Tradition as well as Scripture against the Ancient Hereticks, as two distinct, but agreeing Testimonies; as this Author might have known, would he have been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have consulted <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian de praescriptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus,</hi> with divers others.

                  <head>SECT. II. Concerning the Traditionary Faith of the Church, with respect to the Doctrine of the Trinity.</head>
                  <p>FIrst then, Let us consider what that Catholick Church is, from whence we must receive this Traditionary Faith.</p>
                  <p>Now since Christ gave the Supreme Authority of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel, and planting Churches, to his Apostles, those only must be reckoned the true Apostolick Churches, from which we must receive the true Christian Faith, which were planted by the Apostles, or by Apostolick men, and lived in Communion with them.</p>
                  <p>It is not sufficient to prove any Doctrine to be the true Primitive Faith, That it was preached in the Apostles days, but that it was the Faith of the Apostolick Churches, which were planted by the Apostles, and received their Faith from them; for that Only is the Primitive and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Faith. And therefore though <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> could prove their Heresies to be as Ancient as the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Age, (as we grant something like them was) this does not prove theirs to be the true Christian Faith, if it were not the Faith of the Apostolick Churches.</p>
                  <p>And this was very visible in those days, what these Churches were which were planted by the Apostles, and lived in Communion with them, and is very visible still in the most Authentick Records of the Church. For the Hereticks which sprang up in that Age, separated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Apostles, and thereby made a visible distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between the True Apostolick Churches, and Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Conventicles: And in after-Ages they either separated themselves, or were cast out of the Communion of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50623:37"/>
Church. This St. <hi>Iohn</hi> accounted a great advantage to the Christian Church, and an Infallible Proof of False Doctrine and Heresy, as it certainly was at that time; for if the Apostles taught the True Faith, those who separated from the Apostles, and preached another Gospel, which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learnt from them, must be Hereticks; 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.18, 19. <hi>Little Children, it is the last time; and as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even now there are many Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs; whereby we know that it is the last time: They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they no doubt would have continued with us; but they went out, that they might be made manifest, that they were not all of us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Separation of Hereticks in that Age was a visible renouncing the Apostolick Faith and Communion; and therefore how many Heresies soever started up, it was still visible, where the Apostolick Faith and Tradition was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; and this was of admirable use to preserve the Faith of the Church sincere and uncorrupt: For had these Hereticks continued in Communion with the Apostles and Apostolick Churches, and secretly propagated their Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and infected great numbers of Christians, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding into distinct and opposite Communions, it would have been a great dispute in the next Age, which had been the true Apostolick Faith, when the Members of the same Churches, which all their time lived in Communion with the Apostles, should preach contrary Doctrines, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with equal confidence, Apostolick Tradition; which the greatest Hereticks might very plausibly have done, had they always lived in Communion with the Apostles: But <hi>they went out from us,</hi> says St. <hi>Iohn, that they might be made manifest, that they were not all of us</hi>; that the world might know how to distinguish between Catholick Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and Hereticks; and between the True Catholick Faith, and the Corrupt Innovations of Perverse men.</p>

I am satisfied this Holy Faith can never be Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but could these men prevail, it might soon be Lost.</p>
                  <p>But to return: This is a sure Foundation for our Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into the Faith of the Primitive Church, To know what the Primitive Church is; for otherwise we may mistake Old Heresies for the Primitive Faith. But those Churches which were planted by the Apostles or Apostolical men, and received their Faith from them, and lived in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, are the true Primitive and Apostolick Churches, and their Faith is the true Primitive Apostolick Faith; and what that was, <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

us; The Faith and Worship of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: And what their Faith was as to all these Three Divine Persons, is evident from the Writings of those Ancient Fathers, who preserved the Succession and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of these Apostolick Churches. But this is not what I intend at present; but from hence it appears, That those Ancient Heresies which were rejected and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apostolick Churches, as soon as they appeared, could not be the Apostolick Faith. These Hereticks separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Apostles, and Apostolick Churches, and therefore could not receive their Faith from them; nor did they pretend to this, while the Apostles lived, though they forged new Gospels, and Acts, and Revelations for them when they were dead. And thus all the Heresies of <hi>Simon Magus, Menander, Cerinthus, Ebion, Valentinus,</hi> and all those other Divisions and Subdivisions of Hereticks, who denied or corrupted the Doctrine of the Divinity of our Saviour, or his Incarnation, are all rejected from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Faith; for these Hereticks did not receive their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines from the Apostles and Apostolick Churches, as they themselves owned by their Separation from the Apostolick Churches; and these Churches gave Testimony against their Corruptions, as soon as they were known; and there is no need of any other Confutation of them, if we allow the Doctrine of the Apostles to be the only Infallible Rule of Faith.</p>
                  <p>This is the Argument from Prescription, which <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> insists so largely on, and is frequently urged by <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> and other Catholick Writers; which is not, as some mistake it, an Argument merely from Antiquity; for though the true Faith was ancienter than any Heresies, yet some Heresies had Antiquity enough to make them vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, if that alone would do it; but the Argument was from the Tradition of the Apostolick Churches, which were planted by the Apostles, and had preserved an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50623:39"/>
Succession from them, and all the world over taught the same Faith, without any material change or variation: Whereas none of these Heresies, how Ancient soever they might be, could pretend to such an Original, were never taught by the Apostles, or any Apostolical men, nor were received or owned by any Churches planted by them. And this is an unanswerable Argument, as long as we can reasonably suppose the Tradition of the Catholick Faith, and the Communion of the Church, was preserved entire, which it visibly was, at least till the first <hi>Nicene</hi> Council; and during all this Period, had we no other ways to know it, we might learn the Faith of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, by its opposition to those Heresies which it condemned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> And this is the only Evidence which I shall at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent insist on for the Catholick Tradition of the Faith of the Holy and Ever blessed Trinity; for we may see the plain Footsteps of the Ancient Catholick Tradition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in those Ancient Heresies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was the first Heretick we read of, and may be very justly accounted the Father of many of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Heresies, having led the way, and sown the Seeds and Principles of them.</p>
                  <p>Now if we believe that Account which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> gives of him, this wicked Impostor pretended himself to be God, both Father and Son, and affirmed that his Lewd Woman, who was called sometimes <hi>Helena,</hi> sometimes <hi>Selene,</hi> was the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>These Names and Distinctions of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, he could not possibly learn from any persons, but only from the Christian Church, in which he was baptized in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. And therefore we may observe, that before his Baptism he only pretended <hi>to be some Great One,</hi> and the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50623:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deluded people thought him to be <hi>the great power of God,</hi> 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 9, 10. But when he was baptized, and soon a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ter apostatized from the Christian Faith, the Devil, whose <hi>great Power</hi> he was, set him up for the God of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, both Father and Son. And though he blasphemously attributed these Titles of God the Father and Son to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and wickedly corrupted this Faith, by making the Father and Son but one Person under different appearances; that he appeared to his Countreymen the <hi>Samaritans</hi> as God the Father, and to the <hi>Iews</hi> as the Son; yet there had been no pretence for this, had not the Christian Church owned Jesus Christ, the Son of God, to be true and perfect God. For had the Father been God, and the Son a mere Man, it is certain Father and Son could never be the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: And besides the Wickedness and Impudence of the Impostor, in pretending himself to be Father and Son, it had been ridiculous to pretend this to Christians, had he not known that the Catholick Faith taught the Son to be True and Real God, as well as the Father; and then if he could persuade them that he was God the Father, he might with the same ease persuade them that he was God the Son too, under a different appearance.</p>
                  <p>Thus when he pretends that his wicked Strumpet was the Holy Ghost, by whom he created the Angels, which created the World; the very Prophanation of this Holy Mystery shews what the Faith of the Church in that Age was concerning the Divinity of the Holy Ghost; for he could have no other Inducement to make his Woman, whom he calls the Holy Ghost, such a Divine Power, but because he knew the Christian Church believed the Holy Ghost to be God, and the Spirit of God, as he made her to be his Divine Creating Intelligence.</p>
                  <p>Another Heresy concerning the Person of Christ, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed Divinity to him, owned him to be the Son of God, though not of the Maker of the world, (who they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50623:40"/>
said was but an Inferior Angel), but of the Unknown and Incomprehensible Father; and that he appeared indeed in the world like a Man, but was no true and real Man. Now what should put such a wild Conceit as this into their heads, had they not known this to be the Catholick Faith, That Jesus Christ was the Son of God? Their eyes could not see him to be God,<note place="margin">

This they could not believe, that the Son of God would so unite himself to Human Nature, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come true and real man; and yet they thought it so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he was the Son of God, or at least saw that this Faith was accounted so sacred, that they would not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to deny that, and therefore chose to deny his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and make a mere Apparition of him.</p>
                  <p>But then on the other hand, <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and <hi>Ebion</hi> thought it too evident to be denied, That he was a true and real Man; and therefore they taught, That <hi>Iesus</hi> was a Man, and no more than a Man, born as other Men are, of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> But then it is worth considering, how they came to make this the distinguishing Doctrine of their Sect, That Christ was but a mere Man, if the Apostolick Churches, whom they opposed, and from whom they sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, had not taught, That he was more than a Man, That he was God as well as Man. Was there ever any Dispute either before or since, concerning any other Man in the world, who was owned to be a Man, Whether he were a mere Man or not? When one sort of Hereticks deny Christ to be a Man, and another deny him to be God, and both of them in contradiction to the Apostolick
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50623:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Faith, it is a very strong presumption at least, what the True Catholick Apostolick Faith was, That Christ was both God and Man.</p>
                  <p>And yet <hi>Cerinthus</hi> himself, though he makes Jesus to be a mere Man, owns Christ to be a Divine Person, and that this Christ descended on Jesus at his Baptism, in the form of a Dove, and rested on him, or dwelt in him, and wrought Miracles by him, but left him at his Crucifixion, and flew up again to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>So that, according to <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> from the time that Jesus was baptized, till he was crucified, the Divinity was very nearly and intimately united to him; not that he was God and Man in one Person, as the Catholick Faith teaches, but yet that Jesus Christ was a Divine and Human Person, though Christ was one Person, and Jesus another. And therefore as the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed (which we find also in the Ancient <hi>Oriental</hi> Creeds) teaches us to believe <hi>in One God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth, and of all things visible and invisible;</hi> not to exclude Christ from being the Maker of the World, but in opposition to those Hereticks who would not allow the Supreme God, who is the Father of Christ, to be the Maker of the World, but attributed the Creation of this World to one or more Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Angels; So they add, <hi>And in One Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> the only begotten Son of God, in opposition to those who made Christ and Jesus Two Persons. And yet in this very Heresy we may see what the Ancient Catholick Faith was, That Jesus Christ was God and Man; as <hi>Cerinthus</hi> himself owned, though he would not unite Christ and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus into One Person, nor make the Union inseparable.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Valentinian</hi> Heresy, though dressed up after the mode of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Theology, was a manifest Corruption of the Christian Faith, under a Pretence of a more perfect knowledge of Divine Mysteries; and we may still see the broken Remains of the Catholick Tradition of the Trinity among them.</p>

                  <p>Now from these wild Conceits we may in some measure learn what the Catholick Faith was: That the Godhead was not confined to one Single and Solitary Person, but that there is such a Foecundity in the Divine Nature, as communicates it self to more Persons than one. For had it been the known and received Faith of the Christian Church, That there is but One Person in the Godhead, as well as but One God, there had been no pretence for these Hereticks, who called themselves Christians, and boasted of a more perfect knowledge of the Christian Faith, to have invented such a number of <hi>Aeons,</hi> which they included within their <hi>Pleroma,</hi> as the several Emanations of their Deity. And we may observe, that most of the Names which they gave to their several <hi>Aeons,</hi> are Scripture-Names and Titles, which the <hi>Pagan</hi> Theology knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of, and which they could learn no where, but from the Christian Church.</p>

                  <p>To confirm this, I observe farther, That most of the Names which they give to their other <hi>Aeons,</hi> are such Names, Titles, or Characters, as the Scripture gives to Christ, or the Holy Spirit, which they have multiplied into so many distinct Persons or <hi>Aeons,</hi> such as the <hi>Mind, Word, Prudence, Power,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom; Truth, Life, Light, the Only begotten, the Paraclete,</hi> and the like.</p>

                  <p>When these Heresies were pretty well silenced, up start <hi>Noetus</hi> and <hi>Sabellius,</hi> who ran into the other Extreme. The <hi>Valentinians</hi> had corrupted the Doctrine of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by multiplying Three Divine Persons into Thirty <hi>Aeons,</hi> besides all their other Pagan and Fabulous Conceits about them: This offended these men, as downright <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism</hi> (as indeed it was no better); and to avoid this, they reject a Trinity of Real and Substantial Persons, for a Trinity of Names; that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are but Three Names of the same Person, who is sometimes called the Father, at other times the Son, or the Holy Ghost, with respect to his different Appearances or Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: Or they made the Son and Holy Ghost not Two Persons, but Two Personal Attributes in God, his Wisdom, or Power: Or they made the Trinity but Three Parts of One Compounded God, as a Man consists of Body, Soul, and Spirit; which of late have been revived among us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der different Names.</p>
                  <p>After these men, arose <hi>Arius</hi> and his Followers, who out of great Zeal also for the Unity of God, framed a New and more Subtile Heresy: They were sensible that Father and Son were not Two Names, but Two Real Distinct Persons, and therefore they attributed the whole entire Divinity to the Father, and made the Son not to be God by Nature, but the most Perfect and Excellent Creature, as Perfect an Image of God, as any Creature can be, but not <hi>Consubstantial</hi> with God, nor Coequal and Coeternal with him.</p>
                  <p>All these Heresies were rejected and condemned by the Catholick Church in their several Ages, as soon as they

appeared, and were taken notice of: And this is one very good way to learn what the Catholick Faith was, from its Opposition to those Heresies which the Catholick Church condemned, and from the Corrupted Remains of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Faith which appeared in them.

                  <p>The occasion of this Heresy was, That they thought that Three Real Distinct Persons in the Godhead were Three Gods; and therefore, though being profess'd Christians, and consequently baptized in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, they durst not deny Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, yet neither would they own Three Divine Persons, but turned them into Three Names, or Three Parts of One Person; which has much more sense in it than Three Modes; though Three Modes of the same Person, let them call them Three Personalities if they please, is the same Heresy, if there be but One <hi>Suppositum</hi>; as One Man may be the Subject of Three, or Three and twenty Modes, and be but One Human Person still.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Noetus</hi> and <hi>Sabellius</hi> did certainly apprehend, that by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost, the Catholick Church under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood Three Distinct, Substantial, Divine Persons, or else why should they charge them with <hi>Tritheism</hi> upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and turn Three Persons into Three Names, or Three Parts of One and the same God, to avoid the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Three Gods? And if this had not been the belief of the Catholick Church, what meant their Zeal against this Heresy? For all the Wit of Man can't find a Medium between <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> and Three Divine Substantial Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. A Trinity must be <hi>Three Somewhats,</hi> as it has been lately called; and then it must either be One <hi>Suppositum</hi> or Person, under Three Names, or Three Modes, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Three Parts; or be Three Distinct <hi>Suppositums</hi> and Persons. Now if this had been the Catholick Faith, That the Trinity is but One <hi>Suppositum</hi> or Person, under

Three Names or Modes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I cannot imagine why the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church should have quarrell'd with these Hereticks, or they with the Catholick Church, unless they both mistook one another: But if the <hi>Sabellians</hi> and Catholicks understood themselves and each other, and did intend to contradict each other, we certainly know what the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith was: For there is nothing contradicts a <hi>Noetian</hi> and <hi>Sabellian</hi> Trinity, but a Trinity, of Distinct, Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, Divine Persons.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Novatianus</hi> well observes, That these Hereticks did acknowledge the Divinity of Christ; That whoever Christ was, it was evident from those Characters given of him in Scripture, That he was True and Perfect God: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Father is True and Perfect God, and Christ True and Perfect God, for fear of owning Two Gods, they make the Father and the Son to be but One and the same Person.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Nay, St <hi>Austin</hi> expresly tells us, That <hi>Arius</hi> agreed with the Catholicks against the <hi>Sabellians,</hi>

                  <p>Now when <hi>Arius</hi> would have reduced Christ into the number of Creatures, though he made him the first and most excellent Creature, created before the World, and God's Minister in making the World, as like to God as a Creature can possibly be, but not of the same Nature with God; the Catholick Church would not bear this, but in a most Venerable Synod collected from most parts of the Christian World, condemn this as contrary to the Faith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways received and owned in their several Churches.</p>
                  <p>Thus far, at least, the Tradition of the Church was Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and Venerable, and the concurrent Testimony of all these several Churches, was a more certain Proof of the Apostolick Faith, than all the Wit and Subtilty of <hi>Arius:</hi> For Wit may patronize New Errors, but cannot prove That to be the Ancient Apostolick Faith, which the Church had never received from the Apostles, nor ever heard of before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:50623:45"/>This I take to be a very sensible Proof what the Faith of the Christian Church was, from the Times of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles till the Council of <hi>Nice</hi>; and consequently, what that Faith was which the Church received from the Apostles: And this abundantly satisfies me, That whatever loose Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions we may meet with in some of the Fathers, before the <hi>Arian</hi> Controversy was started, and managed with great Art and Subtilty (though I know of none but what are capable of a very Orthodox Sense), it is certain that they were not <hi>Arians,</hi> nor intended any such thing in what they said. For had <hi>Arianism</hi> been the Traditionary Faith of the Church, it must have been known to be so; and then how came the Church to be so strangely alarm'd at the first news of it? Or what shall we think of those Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Fathers and Confessors in that Great Council, who either did not know the Faith of the Church, or did so horribly prevaricate in the Condemnation of <hi>Arius,</hi> when they had no other apparent Interest or Temptation to do so, but a Warm and Hearty Zeal for the Truly Ancient and Apostolick Faith?</p>
                  <p>It is certain <hi>Arius</hi> never pretended Catholick Tradition for his Opinion, but undertook to reform the Catholick Faith by the Principles of Philosophy, and to reconcile it to Scripture by new-coin'd Interpretations; though in this he fail'd, and found the Great <hi>Athanasius</hi> an over-match for him.</p>
                  <p>It is not with Faith, as it is with Arts and Sciences of Human Invention, which may be improved in every Age by greater Wits or new Observations; but Faith depends upon Revelation, not Invention; and we can no more make a New Catholick Faith, by the power of Wit and Reason, than we can write a True History of what the Apostles did and taught, out of our own Invention, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Authority of any Ancient Records: Men may do such things if they please, but one will be Heresy, and the other a Romance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:50623:45"/>And yet this is the bold and brave Attempt of <hi>Secinus</hi> and his Disciples: They are so modest indeed, as not to pretend Antiquity to be on their side; they can find no other Antiquity for themselves, but in <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and <hi>Ebion,</hi> who separated from the Catholick Church, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by them; and it does not seem very modest, to set up such men as these, against the Universal Consent of the first and purest Ages of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Socinians,</hi> who know very well what the Charge of Novelty signifies in matters of Religion; That a New Faith is but another Name for New Heresies; Though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Doctrine of the Fathers, and the Catholick Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Faith from the Apostolick Age, yet they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Natural Sentiments,</hi> as the greatest and best Antiquity, in opposition to Apostolick Tradition. This is our <hi>Considerer</hi>'s way, which he prefers before a Traditionary Faith; and by the same reason the <hi>Socinians</hi> may oppose it to a Traditionary Faith: And if we must always expound Scripture by our Natural Sentiments, this Author had best consider whether he can prove a Trinity by Natural Reason; or fairly reconcile the Natural Notion of One God, with the Catholick Faith of the Trinity, or of Three, each of whom is True and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. Let us now, in opposition to this pretence, consider of what Authority the Traditionary Faith of the Catholick Church ought to be, in expounding Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The Holy Scripture, at least in pretence, is allowed on all hands to be a Compleat and Authentick Rule of Faith; but the question is, since men differ so much in expounding Scripture, What is the safest Rule to expound Scripture by; whether the Traditionary Faith of the Church, or <hi>our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sentiments, or Natural Reason?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:50623:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>I do not mean, that we must learn the Critical Sense of every Text from Catholick Tradition; for we have not in all points such a Traditionary Exposition of Scripture; though even in this respect, we shall find that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Fathers have unanimously agreed in the Interpretation of the most material Texts relating to the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity, and the Divinity and Incarnation of Christ. They sometimes indeed alledge such Texts, especially out of the Old Testament, as our Modern Criticks will not allow to be proper and apposite; but even this shews what their Faith was; and yet these very Expositions, which have been so anciently and unanimously received (though they may appear at this distance of time too forc'd and mystical) have too Sacred and Venerable an Authority to be wantonly rejected. We may learn from Christ and his Apostles, what mysterious and hidden Senses were contain'd in the Writings of the Old Testament, such as it is very probable we should never have found in them, had not Christ and his Apostles explained their meaning: And the nearer any Writers were to the Apostolick Age, the more they were addicted to these Mystical Interpretations; which is a good reason to believe that they learnt it from the Apostles themselves.</p>
                  <p>But this is not what I now intend; my present Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reaches no farther than this; That if we can learn what the Doctrine of the Catholick Church concerning the Holy Trinity, and the Divinity and Incarnation of Christ has always been: Then</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is very reasonable to conclude, That they received this Doctrine from the Apostles, it being the Faith of those Churches which were planted by the Apostles, received their Faith from them, and always lived in Communion with them.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:50623:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. This makes it reasonable to believe, that this very Faith is contained in the Writings of the New Testament; for, I suppose, no man questions, but that the Apostles taught the same Faith by Writing, which they did by Preaching; and then this is a Demonstration against all such Interpretations of Scripture as contradict the Catholick Faith; whatever fine Colours Wit and Criticism may give them. Nay,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a certain Proof, That these Primitive Christians, who received these Inspired Writings from the Apostles which now make up the Canon of the New Testament, did believe that the same Faith which the Apostles and Apostolical men had taught them by Word of Mouth, was contained in their Writings; for they could not possibly have believed both what the Apostles taught, and what they writ, if their Preaching and Writings had contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each other. We know what the Faith of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church was, and we know they received these Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Writings with the profoundest Veneration, as an Inspired Rule of Faith; and had we no other presumption of it but this, we might safely conclude, That they found the same Faith in these Writings, which the Apostles had before taught them by Word of Mouth.</p>
                  <p>But besides this, we find that all the Catholick Writers appeal to the Scriptures, and prove their Faith from them; and the Authority of such men who were so near the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Apostolick Tradition, must be very Venerable.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I shall only add this, That since we know what the Catholick Faith was, and how the Catholick Fathers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Scripture, if the Words of Scripture will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and easily admit that Sense, much more if they will not admit any other Sense without great force and violence, let any man judge which is most safe and reasonable, to expound Scripture as the Catholick Faith and Catholick Fathers expound it, and as the Scripture most easily and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50623:47"/>
expounds it self, or to force New Senses and Old Heresies upon Scripture, which the Catholick Church has always rejected and condemned.</p>
                  <p>This, I hope, may satisfy our <hi>Considerer,</hi> that he did very ill in rejecting a Traditionary Faith, and venturing to expound Scripture by his <hi>Natural Sentiments,</hi> which is a very Unsafe Rule in Matters of Pure Revelation, of which mere Natural Reason is no competent Judge.</p>

the Resemblances and Analogies in Nature with some Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Ideas, this will not serve the turn; for though they know what such Terms signify when applied to Natural, they know not what they signify when applied to Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Objects, nor have they any Ideas to answer them: As for Instance; We know what Father and Son signify when applied to Men; but when we say, God is not only Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal himself, but an Eternal Father, who begot an Eternal Son; these Terms of <hi>Father and Son, begetting and being begotten,</hi> must signify quite otherwise than they do among men, something which we have no Idea of; and therefore say the <hi>Socinians,</hi> All this is unintelligible and impossible to be believed, unless we can believe without understanding the Terms: This <hi>Considerer</hi> asserts the Premises, he had best consider again how he will avoid the Conclusion.</p>
                  <p>Another <hi>Socinian</hi> Topick is <hi>Contradiction,</hi> and this our Considerer makes another requisite to the possibility of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, That the thing <hi>do not imply a Contradiction to our former knowledge</hi>; that is, to any Natural Ideas: And here he learnedly disputes against believing Contradictions; and <hi>that it is not consistent with the Wisdom, Iustice, and Goodness of God to require us to believe Contradictions.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 13.</note> But if instead of all this he had only said, That God cannot reveal such plain and evident Contradictions, as he cannot require us to believe; and consequently, That whatever is plainly revealed, implies no Contradiction, how much soever it may be above our comprehension, because God does require us to believe what he plainly reveals; this had put an end to this Dispute, and left the belief of the Trinity possible, whatever difficulties we might apprehend in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it: But this great Zeal against believing Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, when applied to the belief of the Trinity, is a very untoward Insinuation, as if the Doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as commonly understood, were clogg'd with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, and that we must cast all such Contradictions
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50623:48"/>
(which in the <hi>Socinian</hi> account is the Doctrine it self) out of our Faith; and therefore, That whatever the Scripture says, we must put no such sense on it as <hi>implies any Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to our former knowledge.</hi> This is an admirable Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for <hi>Considerations concerning the Trinity</hi>; and what an admirable Superstructure he has rais'd on it, we shall soon see.</p>
                  <p>I may possibly discourse this Point of Contradictions more at large elsewhere; at present I shall only tell this Author, That as self-evident as he thinks it, this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is false, <hi>That it is impossible to believe what implies a Contradiction to our former knowledge;</hi> and that God cannot require us to believe it.</p>
                  <p>I grant that all Logical Contradictions which are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>is not,</hi> are impossible to be believed, because they are impossible to be true; and such is his Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the Whole and its Parts; for to say, <hi>That the Whole is not bigger than any of its Parts,</hi> is to say, That a Whole is a Whole, and is not a Whole; and that a Part is a Part, and is not a Part. But contradictory Ideas may both be true, and therefore both be believed, and every man believes great numbers of them: <hi>The Ideas of Heat and Cold, White and Black, Body and Spirit, Extension and No Extension, Eternity and Time, to have A Beginning and to have No Beginning,</hi> are contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ideas, and yet we believe them all; that is, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and know that there really are such things, whose Natures are directly opposite and contrary to each other. Now when there are such Contrarieties and Contradictions in Created Nature, it may justly be thought very strange to <hi>true Considerers,</hi> that our Natural Ideas should be made the adequate measures of Truth or Falshood, of the Possibilities or Impossibilities of things; that we must not believe what God reveals concerning himself, if it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts any Natural Ideas. And yet I challenge this <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,</hi> and all the <hi>Socinian, Sabellian, Arian</hi> Fraternities,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50623:49"/>
to shew me any appearance of Contradictions in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity, but what are of this kind; that is, not Logical Contradictions, but Contradictions to our other Natural Ideas: And if our Natural Ideas of Created Nature contradict each other, it would be wonderful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if the Divine Uncreated Nature should not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict all our Natural Ideas. Every thing we know of God is a direct Contradiction to all the Ideas we have of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; an Uncreated and a Created Nature, an Infinite and a Finite Nature, are direct Contradictions to each other: Eternity without Succession, Omnipresence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Extension, Parts, or Place; a pure simple Act, which is all in one, without Composition; an Omnipotent Thought, which thinks all things into Being, and into a Beautiful Order; these and such like Ideas of God are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Contradictions to all the Ideas we have of Creatures; and can any Contradiction then to any Ideas of Created Nature be thought a reasonable Objection against believing any thing which God reveals to us concerning himself? But of this more hereafter.</p>

                  <p>We meet with different forms of speech in Catholick Writers concerning the Unity and Trinity in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, all which must be reconciled, to form a distinct and compleat Notion of the Trinity.

That each Person, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is by himself True and Perfect God, is likewise the Doctrine both of the Holy Scriptures, and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Fathers.

and not content himself with any one of them, as, to make the best of it, the <hi>Considerer</hi> here does, when he only proposes to enquire, How <hi>One and the same God is Three Persons</hi>: But he ought to have enquired also in what sense each Person is by himself True and Perfect God; and the Person of the Father in a peculiar and eminent sense the <hi>One God;</hi> and to have framed his Notions of Unity and Distinction with an equal regard to all these Catholick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions; which would have secured him from the <hi>Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Heresy, which now his Words are very guilty of, whatever He himself be.</p>

This had been the true Explication of the Term God, as applied to the Doctrine of the Trinity, To have told us what is meant by <hi>God,</hi> when this Name is peculiarly attributed to the Person of the Father, when it is attributed to each Person distinctly, and when it is jointly attributed to them all, That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are One God: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50623:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
matter had been very proper, and would have saved all his other Labour. And therefore to save me some labour, I will briefly tell him how the Catholick Fathers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood it; which is the only possible way I know, of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling these different Expressions.</p>
                  <p>When they tell us, That the Person of the Father is in an eminent and peculiar manner the <hi>One</hi> God; by this they understand, That the Father alone is self-originated, and from himself; That the Whole Divinity and Godhead is originally his own, which he received from no other: Which is the first and most natural notion we have of God, and of One God.</p>
                  <p>When they say, That though the Father in this sense be the One God, yet the Son also is True and Perfect God, and the Holy Ghost True and Perfect God, they ascribe Divinity to the Son and Holy Ghost, upon account of the Eternal and Perfect Communication of the Divine Nature to them: For he who has the True Divine Nature, is True and Perfect God: And therefore the Son, who is eternally begotten of his Father, of the Substance of his Father, and is Consubstantial with him, is True and Perfect God, but God of God; and the like may be said of the Holy Spirit, who eternally proceeds from Father and Son.</p>
                  <p>When they teach, That the Trinity is One God, they mean by it, That the same One Divinity does subsist whole and entire, indivisibly and inseparably, but yet distinctly in them all, as I have already explained it: So that the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Godhead gives an account of all these Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Why the Father is said to be the One God, and yet that the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost God, and Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but One God. All this is taught in Scripture, and is the Faith of the Catholick Church; and I would never desire a better Proof of the Truth and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of any Notion, than that it takes in the whole My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50623:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and answers to every part of it; which no other account I have ever yet met with, can do.</p>

                  <p>AND now the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Scene opens apace: If the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy of <hi>Sabellius</hi> was, That there is but One who is God, but One Divine Intelligent Person, as well as One Divine Nature, this our <hi>Considerer</hi> expresly owns, and does his Endeavour to prove it absolutely impossible that it should be otherwise; that is, That the Catholick Faith, asserted and defended by the Catholick Church, against <hi>Sabellius,</hi> is absolutely impossible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">P. 20.</note>To explain the word <hi>Person,</hi> he tells us, <hi>It signifies one of these two things; either a particular Intelligent Being; or an Office, Character, or some such complex Notion, applicable to such a Being:</hi> If you would know in which of these senses we must understand the word <hi>Person,</hi> when we say there are <hi>Three Persons in the Trinity</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 24.</note> he tells us plainly, That <hi>the simple Idea</hi> (of God) <hi>can be applied but to One single Person, in the first sense of the word Person, as it signifies a particular Intelligent Being, Nature, or Principle.</hi> — And <hi>that all the Personal Distinction we can conceive in the Deity, must be founded on some accessory Ideas, extrinsecal to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature; a certain Combination of which Ideas, makes up the second Notion signified by the word Person.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for this he appeals to <hi>Natural Sentiments,</hi> mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Heresy for Nature. <hi>And if we fairly and impartially examine our own Thoughts upon this Subject, we shall find, That when we name God the Father, we conceive the Idea of God, so far as we are capable of conceiving it, as acting so and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50623:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so, under such respects and relations; and when we name God the Son, we conceive nothing else but the same Idea of God over again, under different relations; and so likewise of the Holy Ghost. Noetus, Praxeas,</hi> or <hi>Sabellius,</hi> never taught their Heresy in more express words than these.</p>
                  <p>And what is to be done now? Must we dispute this Point over again with the <hi>Considerer,</hi> and confute a Heresy which has been so early, so often, and so constantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Catholick Church?

                  <p>But since the <hi>Considerer</hi> makes a great Flourish with his Ideas, and clear and distinct Conceptions, and fetches his Proofs from the most intimate knowledge of Nature, he may take it ill if no notice or regard be had of them: We see very well where he has been trading; and I doubt the Ingenious Author of <hi>Human Vnderstanding,</hi> will have more Disciples of different kinds than he was well aware of, in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50623:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whom he will have no great reason to glory: For it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more Skill than every man is Master of, to form simple and distinct Notions and Ideas, and to apply them dexterously to their proper Subjects. And to refer all men to Natural Ideas and Perceptions, when so very few know how to distinguish between Natural Notions, and the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and Prepossessions of Education, the Delusions of Fancy, and the Byass of Inclination, is like the Quakers appeal to the Light within, which is just what every man will have it to be.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Considerer</hi> reduces all the Notions he can find of <hi>Vnity and Distinction,</hi> to Three Heads: The Unity or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of <hi>Ideas,</hi> of <hi>Principle,</hi> and of <hi>Position</hi>; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to prove from them all, That it is impossible, or absolutely unconceivable, that there should be more than <hi>One Intelligent Person,</hi> in the proper Notion of a Person, in the Godhead.</p>
                  <p>Now in the first place I would be glad to hear a good reason why the Considerer takes no notice of that old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived definition of <hi>One,</hi> that <hi>Vnum est Indivisum</hi>; that is One, which is Undivided: The most perfect <hi>One</hi> is that which neither is nor can be divided; an absolute perfect <hi>Monad,</hi> which is absolutely and perfectly Simple, without any Parts to be divided into: And this is the Unity of the Divine Nature, as Scripture, Fathers, Schoolmen, and all men of improved and exercised Reason teach; and it is strange he should not find this Notion of Unity among all his Natural Ideas, which is the only Natural Notion of the Divine Unity, and belongs to no other Being. And this would have given him a true Catholick Notion of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God in a Trinity of Persons; for all agree, That the Divine Nature is indivisibly and inseparably One.</p>
                  <p>And this is another thing I would be glad to know the reason of, Why in such an Enquiry concerning the Unity and Distinction of the Trinity, he takes no notice of that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50623:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Old Catholick distinction, <hi>That God is One in Nature, and Three in Persons</hi>; which would have been a good direction to him, what kind of Unity, and what distinction to have enquired after: What Unity belongs to Nature, and what it is which distinguishes Persons: But our <hi>Considerer</hi> has no regard to the different Notions of Nature and Person, but applies all his Notions of Unity to a Person, which as far as they are true, belong to Nature, and from the Unity of Nature proves against the Catholick Faith, that there can be but One proper Divine Person.</p>
                  <p>And there is one thing I am sorry for, That having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned a very good Notion, he let it slip between his fingers without making any use of it.<note place="margin">P. 20.</note> He tells us, That <hi>Identity is nothing else but a repetition of Vnity, as Number is of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</hi> This is very Catholick, and it is great pity we hear no more of it. Upon this Principle the Fathers justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Unity of the Godhead in a Trinity of Persons: For the Divine Nature is but One, a perfect <hi>Monad,</hi> and is communicated whole and entire, without the least Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or Separation, to the Son and Holy Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is perfectly and identically one and the same in all Three; for the perfect repetition of a Monad and Unit makes no Number: God, and God, and God, are not Three Gods, but One God, because the same Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without the least difference or diversity, is distinctly in them all; and the repetition of what is perfectly the same, makes no Number; but Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost are three, for they are really distinguished from each other, not by any difference of Nature, but only by Personal differences, or the different manner of having the same Nature: That the Father has the Whole Divine Nature originally in himself, is God of himself: The Son receives the same Divine Nature by an Eternal Generation, and is God of God: And the Holy Ghost in like manner by an Eternal Procession from Father and Son: This incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municably
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50623:53"/>
distinguishes Persons, that one can never be another; and this is difference enough to make a Number; not to make Three Gods of them, because the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is perfectly One and the same in Three, but to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them into Three Persons, each of whom is True and Perfect God, and all but One God. Why the <hi>Considerer</hi> should wave such a Notion as this of Unity and Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which any one would have thought his own Notions of <hi>Identity</hi> and <hi>Number</hi> must unavoidably have led him into, I cannot guess; but I hope this may satisfy him, that there are other Notions of Unity and Distinction, than what he insists on, and such as may be as easily understood, and which fairly reconcile the belief of Three proper Divine Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Persons, with the Unity of the Godhead: But let us now briefly consider his Ideas of Unity and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>stinction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first is, <hi>The Vnity of Idea:</hi> This he discourses of very confusedly,<note place="margin">P. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> and does not seem well pleased with it himself: The Unity of the Idea he places in being <hi>perceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at one view, and having one uniform appearance:</hi> Which makes it one Idea indeed, right or wrong, but proves no other kind of Unity: This he grew sensible of, that <hi>the reality of things</hi> may not answer our <hi>Ideas or Appearances</hi>; and I know not how they sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Considerer,</hi> by forsaking his good old Rules, for new Methods of Thinking, has quite mistaken the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When we enquire into the general Notion of Unity, the meaning is not, When we conceive of any thing as <hi>One,</hi> but what it is that makes any thing <hi>One.</hi> The Unity of Idea, whether simple or compounded, may be Answer enough to the first Question, Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50623:54"/>
Reality of Things, and therefore I know not what this Rule is good for at all. But our general Notion of Unity is of a very different Consideration; and our particular Ideas of particular Things, contribute nothing to it: For the question is not, How many Things are united in One Being? or, How many partial Conceptions are united in One Idea? But, What it is that makes it One; or what the formal Conception of its Unity is?</p>
                  <p>But our <hi>Considerer</hi> takes heart at last, from the Unity of the Idea of God, to prove that there can be but One Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Person in a proper sense; or but One who is True and Perfect God.<note place="margin">P. 21.</note> His Argument is this; <hi>We cannot conceive that any Object should be truly and adequately represented to any Mind or Vnderstanding under One Idea, and truly and adequately represented under Three Ideas.</hi> And what is the Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>quence of this? That he tells us plainly, That <hi>all the Perfections</hi> (of the Deity) <hi>though considered separate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under different apprehensions by our imperfect Faculties,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>being really but One simple Idea, can be applied to but One sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Person, in the first sense of the word Person, as it signifies a particular Intelligent Being, Nature, and Principle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Now in the first place this Argument supposes an Idea which <hi>truly and adequately represent its Object,</hi> and yet our <hi>Considerer</hi> is so modest as not to pretend to a full and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Idea of God: And therefore, according to his own way, he can never conclude from the Idea of God, That it can belong but to One single Person, because he has not an adequate Idea of the Divine Nature; and then there may be something in the Idea of God, which he does not comprehend, which may make it applicable to more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons than one. Certainly it seems very reasonable, when we confess that we have not an adequate Idea of the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, to refer this whole Dispute, not to Natural Ideas, which can never determine it, but to Revelation,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50623:54"/>
which is more certain and more perfect than our Natural Knowledge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I grant, That <hi>One Object cannot be truly and adequate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly represented to my mind under One Idea, and truly and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately represented under Three different Ideas:</hi> But it is as true, That One and the same Idea may be truly and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately applied to Three distinct and different Persons: The adequate Idea of <hi>Peter</hi> can be applied to none but <hi>Peter</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Idea of Man, or of Human Nature, may be <hi>truly and adequately</hi> applied to <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and to every single human Person in the world.</p>
                  <p>The Idea of God, as abstracted from the Consideration of a Trinity of Persons, is only the Idea of the Divine Nature, which is but One, and can never be Three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Natures; for the Divine Nature always was, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways will be but One and the same; and this is that <hi>One Object</hi> which is <hi>adequately,</hi> in his sense, represented by <hi>One Idea.</hi> And this is the account the Catholick Fathers give of the Unity of God, That there is but One Divinity, One Divine Nature in Three Persons; and thus the Trinity is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the One Divinity, that One Object re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by the One Idea of God. The Divine Persons are not distinguished by any difference of Nature, which is One and the same in all, but by Personal differences; That the Father is <hi>unbegotten,</hi> the Son <hi>begotten,</hi> and the Holy Ghost <hi>proceeds</hi> from Father and Son: These are Three different Ideas for the Three Divine Persons; but the Idea of the Divinity is but One, as the Divine Nature is One and the same in all.</p>
                  <p>Could he indeed prove, That the Idea of God is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>One simple Idea,</hi> but the Idea of <hi>One single Person,</hi> that would be somewhat more to the purpose; it would be such an Argument against a Trinity of Persons, from the Idea of God, as <hi>Necessary Existence,</hi> as included in the Idea of God, is for the Being of God: But this he can never
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50623:55"/>
prove; and at best, these Arguments from Ideas are thought too fine and subtle by most men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His next kind of Unity is a <hi>Vnity of Principle</hi>; that is One thing, which has but One Principle of Action: And <hi>we cannot conceive that One Principle or Nature should be but One,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 16, 20, 21.</note> 
                     <hi>and yet Three different Principles and Natures.</hi> But I suppose he can conceive, That if One and the same undivided Principle and Nature be and act in Three, these Three are One by the Unity of Principle and Nature. And this is the Catholick Faith of the Trinity, not <hi>Three different Principles and Natures</hi> in Three Persons, but One and the same Principle and Nature, inseparably and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly subsisting and acting in Three: Upon account of which Identity of Principle and Operation, the Catholick Fathers asserted but One Life, Energy, and Power, not confusedly, but distinctly in Three; which asserts the Unity of Principle, together with the real distinction of true and proper Persons. If indeed he can prove from his <hi>Vnity of Principle,</hi> That One Nature and Principle can live, subsist, and act but in One; such a Unity of Principle as this, will admit but of One single Person, and must overthrow the Catholick Faith of a Real Trinity. But though the Unity of Principle does prove That to be but One, which has but One Principle; it does not prove, That this One Nature and Principle can be but in One.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. His Third kind of Unity is very surprizing, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as applied to the Unity of God; it is the Unity of <hi>Position,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 16.</note> of <hi>Place,</hi> or of <hi>Vbi. When we perceive any Object in a continued Position, bounded and fenced out from other things round about it, all within such Terms and Limits we call One.</hi> Bless me! thought I; How is this applicable to the Unity of God? who has no Body, no Parts, no <hi>continued Position</hi>; can't be <hi>bounded and fenced round about,</hi> nor confined <hi>within Terms and Limits</hi>; and therefore can never have this <hi>Vnity of Position,</hi> which is a very sorry kind of Unity at best.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:50623:55"/>His Philosophy belonging to this Head is very admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but to let that pass, he would not be thought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute Extension to Spirits;<note place="margin">P. 18.</note> but the <hi>Idea of a Point</hi> is more applicable <hi>to Spiritual Beings</hi>; but a Physical Point is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended still, though it be the least conceivable Extension, and has parts, and therefore can't represent simple Unity, and is the Idea of Body, not of Spirit. Nor does he <hi>think local presence or determination any way contained within the Idea of a Spiritual Being,</hi> and therefore this can't belong to the Unity of a Spirit. Well: <hi>But he is not able to comprehend the Vnion or Separation of Two Spiritual Beings,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering them in the same or different Localities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know not how to help this, that he can't conceive of Spirits, but only after the manner of Bodies. Are Spirits united by Juxta-position of Parts, or Penetration of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions? If not, One <hi>Vbi</hi> can't unite them, though Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate <hi>Vbi's</hi> may prove them Separate.</p>
                  <p>But still what is all this to the Unity of God? Why, he tells us, <hi>It is plain at first sight,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>that we cannot possibly conceive God under any difference of Position:</hi> I add further, That we cannot conceive <hi>God</hi> under <hi>any Position,</hi> and therefore the Unity of Position can never belong to the <hi>Vnity of God.</hi> But the reason he gives why we can't <hi>conceive God under any difference of Position,</hi> is, because <hi>we cannot exclude Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from any imaginable point of Space</hi>; nor can we include it in it; which proves that God has no Position, but is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent without Position, as he is without Extension, and without Parts. God needs no place to subsist in, but is <hi>Place</hi> to himself, and <hi>Place</hi> to every thing else; as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> called God <hi>Mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m,</hi> or <hi>Place</hi>; according to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Notion of it, That <hi>in him we live, move, and have our being</hi>; that as all things receive Being by his Almighty Word, so all things subsist in Infinite Mind, as the Ideas and Notions of things do in Finite Minds. God could not create any thing without himself, because
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50623:56"/>
there is nothing <hi>extra</hi> without him; and this is the <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence</hi> of God, not his <hi>Commensuration to Infinite Space</hi>; which is a gross Corporeal Representation of Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence by Infinite Extension, or Commensuration to Infinite Extension, and makes something else as Infinite as God, <hi>viz.</hi> Infinite Space, which must be commensurate to God, if God be commensurate to Space; but the Omnipresence of God is his Comprehension of all things in himself.</p>
                  <p>And yet his way of proving the <hi>Omnipresence</hi> of God from his <hi>Omnipotence, That we cannot exclude Omnipotence from any imaginable Point of Space,</hi> if by <hi>Omnipresence</hi> he means an <hi>Essential Omnipresence,</hi> as he must do here, is not so self-evident as he seems to think it: The only foundation of it is this, That nothing can act where it is not; which holds true only where Contact is necessary to Action, that is, only in Bodies, whose Power consists in Contact, or touching each other; but any Being which acts without Contact, as God certainly does, may be Omnipotent, without being Omnipresent; that is, may act at an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite distance, without any Local Presence with the thing on which it acts. It is the first time, to the best of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that ever I met with this Notion, That <hi>'tis the limited Powers and Faculties of Created Beings, which are the foundation of all local distinction.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 21.</note> Finite Creatures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have finite and limited Powers; but it is not the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Powers and Faculties, but of their Presence, which makes a local or <hi>Vbi</hi> distinction: If this were so, Power must be proportioned to Presence, which we know is false; for the greatest things, which fill the largest space, are not the most powerful: Spirits, which fill no space at all, have the greatest Power, and most enlarged Faculties.</p>
                  <p>But it is time to see the Pinch of this Argument from <hi>the Vnity of Position</hi>; and the Sum of it is this: Whatever is One, must be in some One Place or <hi>Vbi,</hi> which distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes and separates it from other things: That he cannot
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50623:56"/>
conceive the distinction of two or three Beings from each other, without considering them in so many different Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Localities: That God is <hi>Omnipresent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 22.</note> and <hi>he can no more conceive Three Omnipresent, than he can conceive Three straight Lines drawn between the same Points.</hi> That is, in plain <hi>English,</hi> There are not Three Distinct Infinite Spaces for Three Distinct Omnipresent Persons to be in, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there cannot be a Trinity of True and Proper Persons; but as there is but One Omnipresent Divine Nature, so there can be but One single Omnipresent Person; and there is an end of the Trinity, till we can find room in the world for Three Persons, each of whom is Omnipresent.</p>
                  <p>I perceive our <hi>Considerer</hi> has not been so fair and equal as he pretended to be. He would not consult the Fathers, for fear of Prejudices and Prepossessions; but either good Wits jump, or he has taken care to consult the Ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; for this was the old <hi>Sabellian</hi> Argument, which was long since answered and scorned by <hi>Athanasius;</hi> as he will find in the Chapter of <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> to which I refer him and the Reader.</p>
                  <p>But in good earnest, does any sober Christian want an Answer to this Argument? Does God then fill a Space, as Bodies do, that Three Divine Omnipresent Persons must have Three separate Localities, and be commensurate to Three Infinite Spaces? Has God any Place; does he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in any thing but himself? If the <hi>Considerer</hi> can't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Beings to be distinct without distinct Localities, How does he distinguish God from Creatures, when he owns that God is in every imaginable Point of Space, that is, in the very same <hi>Vbi</hi>'s and Localities, whereever any Creatures are?</p>
                  <p>But do not all Catholick Christians own, That there is but One Infinite, Inseparable, Undivided Nature, in Three Persons? And must this One Undivided <hi>Monad</hi> be in Three separate Localities, because it subsists in three distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons?
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50623:57"/>
especially when these distinct Persons are whole and entire in each other; as our Saviour assures us, <hi>I am in the Father, and the Father in me.</hi> And is not this a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful demonstration against Three Real and Proper Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Trinity, That there cannot be Three such Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Omnipresent Persons, unless they subsist in Three Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and Separate Localities? But enough of this in all reason.</p>
                  <p>These are the Premises, from whence with so much open Assurance and Confidence he draws that <hi>Sabellian</hi> Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,<note place="margin">P. 24.</note> That the Idea of God <hi>being really but One simple Idea, can be applied but to One single Person, in the first sense of the word Person, as it signifies a particular Intelligent Being, Nature, or Principle. — From whence,</hi> he says, <hi>it follows, that according to the Notions we are capable of framing of Vnity and Distinction, — all the Personal distinction we can conceive in the Deity, must be founded on some accessory Ideas, extrinsecal to the Divine Nature.</hi> So that there is not a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <hi>in</hi> the Divine Nature, as the Catholick Church has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways believed; but the Divine Nature, which really is but One single Person, is a Trinity with respect to something which does not belong to the Divine Nature, but is <hi>extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal</hi> to it. Whether these be not <hi>New Terms</hi> and <hi>New Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> too, unknown to the Catholick Church, or known only as condemned Heresies, I appeal to all men, who will consult any Catholick Historian, or any Catholick Father, without prejudice.</p>
                  <p>And here I might reasonably enough break off; for I have followed the <hi>Considerer</hi> till we have heard him demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate against a Trinity of Real, Proper Persons in the Unity of the Godhead; which puts an end to the whole Dispute about <hi>a Trinity in Vnity,</hi> because there is no such thing. He has found out indeed a Unity for God, but it is not a Unity in Trinity, but the Unity of One single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and he has found a Trinity, but it is not a Trinity in

the Unity of the Divine Nature, but a Trinity of <hi>extrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal accessory Ideas.</hi> But since he has used some Art in pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating this Heresy, it will be necessary to take off the Disguise.</p>
                  <p>The first step he makes to it, is by seeming to own,<note place="margin">P. 24, 25.</note> That there may be some greater Mystery and Obscurity in the Doctrine of the Trinity, than that Account which he has given of it: <hi>But if this Account,</hi> says he, <hi>of the Trinity be too easy, and falls far short of those high expressions of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction found in Scripture (as I think it does), and no other, grounded upon any Notions our Souls have framed of Vnity and Distinction, can be true or consistent (as I have before parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly proved), then it necessarily follows, That God must be One and Three in some way or manner not conceivable by human Vnderstanding.</hi> Here he thinks he has found a safe Retreat: He asserts, and proves (as he would have us believe) from all the Notions of Distinction and Unity which our minds can frame, That God is and can be <hi>One</hi> in no other Notion, than of <hi>One single Person,</hi> in the first and proper sense of a Person, for an Intelligent Person; and that God neither is nor can be Three in the sense of Three Proper Distinct Persons: If you charge him with <hi>Sabellianism</hi> for this, then he retreats to an <hi>obscure, confused knowledge</hi>; to such a way and manner of God's being One and Three, as is not conceivable by human Understanding.</p>
                  <p>Well: But will he allow us with this <hi>obscure and confused knowledge,</hi> to believe the Holy Trinity to be Three Divine, Proper, Distinct Persons, and One God, <hi>in a way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner unconceivable by Human Vnderstanding</hi>? By no means! This he has proved by all the Notions of Unity and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction cannot <hi>be true or consistent;</hi> nor is it possible for us to believe what we do not understand the terms of, or what contradicts our former knowledge; and we are not bound to believe what is not possible to be believed, nor can God in Justice or Goodness require such a Faith of us,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50623:58"/>
as we have already heard: So that <hi>Sabellianism</hi> we may believe, and must not believe any thing contrary to it; and then we may believe that there is something more in it than we understand, if we please.</p>
                  <p>And therefore we may observe, That he is not concerned about any difficulties in the Notion of the Divine Unity, which all Catholick Writers have been most concerned for; how to reconcile the Unity of God with a Trinity of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons; but that which troubles him most, is the <hi>Distinction,</hi> which the Catholick Fathers never disputed about, but positively asserted in the most proper and real sense, against the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Hereticks: But he seems sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as well he may be, that the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Notion of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>falls very short of those high Expressions of Distinction which are found in Scripture:</hi> And here it is that he allows of an obscure and confused Knowledge. When he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected a True Personal distinction, all other kinds of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction he can think of, will not answer those high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of distinction found in Scripture; and therefore provided you do not believe them distinct Persons, you may believe, if you please, that there is some other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and unconceivable distinction between them.</p>
                  <p>This is plainly what he means by his <hi>obscure confused Knowledge,</hi> by his <hi>general confused Faith,</hi> by his <hi>general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Notion of the Trinity;</hi> and therefore he religiously keeps to that form of words, That <hi>One and the same God is Three</hi>; which must be understood in his Notion of <hi>One and the same God,</hi> that is, <hi>One single Person;</hi> for all his Notions of <hi>Vnity and Distinction</hi> are on purpose designed to prove, That <hi>One God</hi> can't be <hi>Three,</hi> in a true and proper Notion of <hi>a Person;</hi> and therefore he never so much as names that question, How <hi>Three Divine Persons are One God</hi>? Which can never be reconciled to a <hi>Sabellian</hi> Unity of a Single Person.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VI. What it is the Scripture requires us to believe concerning the Trinity.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Considerer</hi> having laid the Foundations of <hi>Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianism</hi> in his <hi>Natural Sentiments,</hi> proceeds to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what the Doctrine of the Scripture is concerning this matter; and to reconcile the Scripture to his <hi>Natural Sentiments;</hi> though the more reasonable and safer way had been first to have learnt the Faith from Scripture, and then to have corrected the Mistakes of his Natural Sentiments by Scripture.</p>
                  <p>I do not intend to enter into a long dispute with him here, but shall only let the Reader see what it is he would prove, and what he asserts; for his whole business in short is to prove, That the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Notion of the Unity of God, or of <hi>One single Person,</hi> and of <hi>Three Names, Titles, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, extrinsecal Respects and Relations,</hi> is the True Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Doctrine of the Trinity.</p>
                  <p>This he very freely tells us,<note place="margin">P. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> That <hi>the Sum of all that the Scriptures plainly and expresly teach concerning a Trinity, is this, That there is but One only God</hi> (and what he means by <hi>One only God,</hi> we have often heard), <hi>the Author and Maker of all things: But that One God ought to be acknowledge and adored by us under those Three different Titles or Characters of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost:</hi> Which Words are very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. He does not say, That this <hi>One God</hi> is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and adored in Three, who have the same One Divinity subsisting whole, and perfect, and distinctly in each of them, which is the Catholick Faith: But this <hi>One God is to be acknowledged and adored by us under these Three different Titles and Characters of Father, Son, and Holy
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50623:59"/>
Ghost:</hi> So that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not the One God, for neither of them is God, but they are only <hi>the different Titles and Characters of the One God</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And though God, when represented by different Characters, is God still under each Character, yet neither of the Characters is God, no more than the Titles and Characters of a Man, is the Man.</p>
                  <p>Now one might have expected that the <hi>Considerer</hi> should have proved, That the Scripture-Notion of <hi>One God</hi> is, That there is but <hi>One single Divine Person</hi> (in the true and proper Notion of the word <hi>Person) who is God</hi>; and that these Names of <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> do not in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture signify Three Distinct, Real Persons, but are only <hi>Three Different Titles and Characters</hi> of the same One Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Person: This indeed had effectually proved what he pretends to; but he was too wise to attempt either. The first he says nothing at all of, but takes it for granted, that he has demonstrated That by his Natural Notions of Unity and Distinction; but had he not first demonstrated that nothing could be <hi>true and consistent,</hi> and that God can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to believe nothing which contradicts his Natural Notions, he should have a little enquired what the Notion of Scripture is about this matter: But taking it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he had already demonstrated this, That One God signifies One single Person, he only proves, That the Titles and Characters of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, belong to God; and therefore, That <hi>these Terms must all be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, as to include the same God</hi> (the One single Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Person) <hi>in their Signification.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 30.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first, I think, he proves well enough, That these <hi>Titles and Characters of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God; and this vindicates him from being a <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>: But when he applies all these <hi>Titles and Characters</hi> to <hi>One and the same God,</hi> that is in his sense, to One and the same <hi>single Person,</hi> this proves him to be a <hi>Sabellian</hi>; for
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50623:59"/>
this was the Doctrine of <hi>Noetus</hi> and <hi>Sabellius,</hi> That these <hi>different Titles and Characters</hi> did belong but to One <hi>single Person,</hi> who is God.</p>
                  <p>He proves, That these <hi>Titles and Characters, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> do signify God, from <hi>the forms of Baptism, Salutation, and Blessing. Go teach all nations,</hi>

                     <hi>baptizing them in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. From whence,</hi> as he adds, <hi>I infer,</hi> That <hi>all these terms, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost, signify God; because I cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly conceive 'tis agreeable to the nature of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that the Ministers of it should teach, baptize, or bless the people in any other name but God's.</hi> I like this Argument very well, but if it proves any thing, it proves more than he would have it, That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are each of them by himself true and perfect God, and not all Three <hi>One single Person;</hi> for it seems altogether as absurd to <hi>teach, baptize, or bless</hi> in Three Names and Titles, when there is but <hi>One single Person</hi> signified by those Three Names. And therefore his Inference is not very plain,<note place="margin">P. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>That if any One of these Terms signify God, they must all Three signify God; and if all Three signify God, they must all Three signify One and the same God; for God is One.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is very artificial, but not <hi>plain:</hi> The consequence is plain, That if Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are the Names of God, they must all signify <hi>One God</hi> by the Unity and sameness of Nature, because there is but <hi>One God</hi>; but not by the <hi>Vnity of Person,</hi> because the Scripture mentions <hi>Three,</hi> each of whom is God: Which proves, <hi>That God is One in Nature, but Three in Persons</hi>; as the Catholick Church has always believed.</p>
                  <p>As for what he adds, <hi>That the One Supreme God, the Lord and Maker of all things, is here meant by the word Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a thing not questioned; and therefore S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But though we allow this with the Catholick Church, That the Father is <hi>the One Supreme God</hi>; we have no reason to allow this to <hi>the Considerer,</hi> who will not allow <hi>Father, Son,</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> to be Names of Divine Persons, or to be Names or Relations of the Divine Nature, considered as the Divine Nature; for he says they are <hi>extrinsecal,</hi> that is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is evident indeed from other Texts, That <hi>Father</hi> is the Name of God, but then it is the Name of <hi>God the Father;</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> the Spirit of the Father and of the Son; and this does prove, That <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> have the same One Divinity, the same One Divine Nature, as the very Names and Relations of Father, and Son, and Spirit, prove: But surely this does not prove, That God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Son, are the same <hi>One single Person,</hi> as well as <hi>One God;</hi> for Father and Son all the world over signify Two distinct Persons; for no One Person can be Father and Son to himself; nor can the Eternal subsisting Spirit of God be the same Person with that God whose Spirit he is.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50623:60"/>
Unless he allows that Father in the form of Baptism is the Name of a Person, he can prove nothing from it; and if Father be the Name of a Person, <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Gh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus he proves the Son to be God, from that Religious Worship which is paid to him; which does indeed prove him to be God, but not the same One Person with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Our <hi>Considerer</hi> is much mistaken, if he thinks it sufficient to prove, That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are the Titles and Characters of the same <hi>One single Person,</hi> who is the One God, if he can prove that each of these Names signify One who is God. And the truth is, if these Names, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> do not signify <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> they cannot signify <hi>God</hi>; for then they are not Names of Nature, but <hi>something extrinsecal and accessory to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 37.</note> and therefore they may be the external Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of him who is God, but not the Names of God, considered as God, and therefore cannot signify <hi>God;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not signify the Divine Nature in the Persons of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but <hi>something extrinsical and accessory,</hi> that is, something which is not <hi>essential,</hi> and therefore which the Divine Nature might be without. I hope the <hi>Considerer</hi> did not think of this Consequence, <hi>That it is possible that God might neither have been Father, Son, nor Holy Ghost</hi>; which yet must be allowed possible, if these be mere <hi>extrinsecal and accessory Titles and Characters:</hi> Nay, this must be allowed, unless we will grant that these Names signify <hi>Three Real, Subsisting, Intelligent, Coeternal Persons, in the Vnity of the same Godhead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But these <hi>Three Persons</hi> do somewhat <hi>puzzle</hi> him. <hi>That God should be called Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is as easily to be believed, as that he should be called</hi> Adonai, Elohim,<note place="margin">P. 36.</note>

                     <hi>and</hi> Jehovah: <hi>That the same thing should be signified and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by several Names, is no such incredible Mystery.</hi> Which still shews us what it is he believes and would prove in all this, That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are but Three Names of that <hi>One single Person, who is God. But,</hi> as he proceeds, <hi>if we allow that these terms, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are all applied to God in Scripture, 'tis not thought sufficient to say, That these are Three several Names, which signify God; but we are further required to believe, That God is One and Three; the same God</hi> (not the same single Person), <hi>but Three different Hypostases or Persons; and that one of these Three Hypostases or Persons is both God and Man.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>These are the Hard Sayings which puzzle some mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.</hi> This is the Faith of the Catholick Church, and will always be <hi>Hard Sayings</hi> to <hi>Sabellian</hi> Understandings, which they will never be able to reconcile with their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis of <hi>One single Person</hi> in the Godhead. But let us hear how he clears himself of these difficulties.</p>
                  <p>

                        <hi>P.</hi> 37.</note>He observes in the first place, <hi>That these Names, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are applied to God in Scripture in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent way from what any of his other Names are.</hi> So far he is in the right; but what is this <hi>different way?</hi> In short, it is this; That <hi>the other Names of God signify only partial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the Divine Nature, such as Self-existence, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and are all contained within the same Idea of God, and therefore cannot be the foundation of any distinction in the Godhead.</hi> Let this pass. <hi>But each of these Names, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, includes the whole Idea we have of God, and something more; as being extrinsecal and accessory to the Divine Nature, and the whole Idea of God full and compleat, before the application of these terms.</hi> Let us examine this first.</p>
                  <p>He says, <hi>Each of these Names includes the whole Idea of God.</hi> I beseech you how can that be, when they <hi>signify something extrinsecal and accessory to the Divine Nature, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50623:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the whole Idea of God may be conceived full and compleat without them?</hi> For if these Names are not included in the Idea of God, which is full and compleat without them (which Assertion, by the way, overthrows the whole Christian Faith of the Trinity), how can they include the Idea of God in them, which they are not so much as any part of, much less the <hi>whole, and something more?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I grant the Names of <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> may connote the Idea of God, as the Name of a King and a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther connote the Idea of a Man who is King and Father, which I suppose is all he intends by it; but then the King must be a Man, and the Father must be a Man, to connote the Idea of Man: And thus in the Blessed Trinity; if these Names, <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> connote the Idea of God, the Father must be True and Perfect God, and the Son must be True and Perfect God, and the Holy Ghost must be True and Perfect God; for neither Father, Son, or Holy Ghost, connote the Idea of God upon any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, than as the Whole and Perfect Divine Nature sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in each of them, and that makes the whole Idea of God belong to each of them.</p>
                  <p>To proceed: He tells us, That <hi>though all these Names are separately and together affirmed of God, yet each of them in so peculiar a manner, that there are several occasions, where, when one of these terms is used with relation to God, 'twould be improper to use either of the other.</hi> That is, when it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to call God <hi>Father,</hi> it is improper to call him, <hi>Son,</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and so on the contrary: But the reason of this in his Hypothesis, is not that their Persons are distinct and incommunicable, but that there are <hi>several occasions</hi> which make such change of Names improper: As a Man who is a King, a Husband, and a Father, all these Names do se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately and together belong to him, but you must have a care of speaking improperly, by applying these Names to improper Relations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:50623:62"/>Well: however, <hi>From hence,</hi> he says, <hi>it follows, that these Three Names of God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note a Threefold difference of distinction belonging to God.</hi> I grant, it makes a distinction of Names and external Offices and Relations in God, but no distinction of Hypostases and Persons, which was the distinction to be shewn; but this he absolutely rejects; for it must be no other difference or distinction, <hi>but such as is consistent with the Vnity and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Divine Nature.</hi> This we would all subscribe to, did he mean honestly; but his <hi>Vnity and Simplicity of the Divine Nature,</hi> is nothing else but the Unity and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of <hi>One single Person</hi>; and all the distinction he will allow these different Names to make, is no more than what <hi>One single Person</hi> is capable of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For each of these Names includes the whole Idea we have of God, and something more.</hi> Very right; if we allow these Names, <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> to be the Names of true and proper Divine Persons; for then each of them is true and perfect God, and <hi>the whole Idea of God is included in each of them,</hi> because the whole Divine Nature is in each of them; otherwise neither of these Names include the Idea of God, but only connote it, as I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
                  <p>And what he adds, That <hi>as far as these Names express the Nature of God, they all adequately and exactly signify the same</hi>; is very true also, if by <hi>the same,</hi> he means the <hi>same Nature,</hi> not the <hi>same One single Person:</hi> And then what he adds, <hi>'Tis the additional signification which makes all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between them,</hi> is very true also; but he ought to have told us what this <hi>additional signification,</hi> this <hi>something more</hi> than the <hi>whole Idea of God,</hi> is, which is included in these Names, <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> and then we might have known what this distinction is.</p>
                  <p>All the <hi>additional signification</hi> that I know of, is this; That <hi>Father</hi> signifies God, <hi>includes the whole Idea of God</hi>;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50623:62"/>
but besides this, <hi>Father,</hi> when it signifies God, signifies a Self-originated, Unbegotten God, who is God of himself, and begets a Son of his own Nature, and Coeternal with himself. <hi>Son</hi> signifies God, but <hi>begotten God, God of God,</hi> the living and perfect Image of his Father. <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies God, but God proceeding eternally from Father and Son, in the Unity and Perfection of the same Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And this is all the difference between them, not a difference of Nature, but a distinction of True, Real, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Persons.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Considerer</hi> seems to allow this.<note place="margin">P. 38.</note> That <hi>Person</hi> is a proper Name for this distinction; For <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost — have plainly a Personal significati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These Words would betray an Unwary Reader, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Considerer</hi> as Orthodox as the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, and that he did acknowledge <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> to be Three Persons, without a Figure, as a Person signifies an <hi>Intelligent Being</hi>; but he has secured himself against this Imputation by an artificial addition, <hi>some Intelligent Being acting in such,</hi> or such, <hi>a manner:</hi> He will not allow Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to signify absolutely <hi>an Intelligent Being</hi>

                  <p>The whole Mystery and Sophistry of this, is, That <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>One single Person,</hi> is upon different accounts sometimes called <hi>the Father,</hi> sometimes <hi>the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50623:63"/>
the same single Person; for they are all of them attributed to God, and God is but <hi>One,</hi> or <hi>One Person,</hi> though this One proper Person may sustain Three figurative Persons, or <hi>Personal Characters.</hi> This is plain dealing: and this is his Answer to his first <hi>Hard Saying, That God is One and Three; the same God, but Three different Hypostases or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>: That God is One and the same single Person, under Three Personal Characters, which may be called Three Persons, because each of them signifies the True and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Person of God.</p>
                  <p>And here we see in what sense these Gentlemen allow, That each Person is <hi>Substance,</hi> is <hi>Mind,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and yet that God is but <hi>One Substance, One Mind,</hi> and <hi>Spirit; viz.</hi> in the very same sense that this Author affirms that God is but <hi>One single Person,</hi> and yet that the Father is a Person, the Son a Person, and the Holy Ghost a Person; and for the same reason, that they decry and abhor <hi>Three Substances, Three distinct Minds and Spirits</hi> in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, though affirmed to be indivisibly and inseparably One Infinite Substance, Mind, and Spirit; for the same reason they reject <hi>Three Intelligent Substantial Persons</hi>; though our Modern <hi>Sabellians</hi> have been more cautious generally than this <hi>Considerer,</hi> not to own it in express words.</p>
                  <p>Now as for these Terms of <hi>Three Substances,</hi> and <hi>Three Minds,</hi> there may be good reason to let them alone, tho when rightly explained no reason to condemn them of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy; but we must insist on <hi>Three Distinct, Infinite, Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, Substantial Persons,</hi> Each of which is Mind and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and One is not the Other: If they disown this (as the <hi>Considerer</hi> does) they are downright <hi>Sabellians</hi>; if they own it, we have no farther Dispute about this matter.</p>
                  <p>Let us now consider his other Hard Saying, <hi>That One of these Three Hyp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:50623:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>Now the <hi>Hardness of this Saying</hi> is not, That it is hard to prove from Scripture, that so it is; or that it is hard to conceive <hi>how God and Man can be united</hi>; which is all that he touches on: But it is and always will be a Hard Saying to the <hi>Considerer</hi> upon another account; that is, To recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile it with <hi>a Trinity of One proper single Person, and Three Personal Characters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrine of the Incarnation is this; That the Eternal Son of God became True and Perfect Man, by taking the Human Nature into a Personal Union to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. That the Son only became Man, not the Father, nor the Holy Ghost: That two perfect distinct Natures, the Divine and Human Nature, were without Confusion uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the One Person of Christ; and that this One Person is the Eternal Word and Son of God. Now if there be but <hi>One single Person</hi> in the Godhead, and Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are but Three Names, or Personal Characters of this One single Person, How can the Son be Incarnate, and not the Father, nor the Holy Ghost? It is only a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that can be Incarnate, for a Personal Character can't be Incarnate without the Person; and if there be but One single Person, and this same One Person is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, it is impossible that that Person who is the Son, should be Incarnate, but the Person who is the Father and the Holy Ghost, must be Incarnate also; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the same Person who is the Son, is the Father and the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>The short Question is this; Whether a True, Proper, Divine Person was Incarnate, in the Incarnation of Christ? If not, then Christ was not <hi>a Divine Person,</hi> how Divine soever he might be upon other accounts; the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did not <hi>pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50623:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and properly Incarnate in the Person of Christ, then if there be but One single Divine Person in the Godhead, but <hi>One Divine Nature</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the sense of <hi>One single Person,</hi> then the whole Godhead, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, which are but One True and Proper Person, was Incarnate in Christ.</p>
                  <p>This is the true difficulty, and he is so wise as to take no notice of it. It does not appear to me, that he believes one word concerning the Incarnation of God, or of a True Divine Person;<note place="margin">P. 38.</note> he says, <hi>He that is in Scripture called the Son of God, did appear in the likeness of men:</hi> He certainly was a True Man, but that is not our present dispute; Was he in his own Person True and Perfect God? Was he a Human Person; or the Person of the Son of God appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Human Nature?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">P. 39.</note>
                     <hi>He was,</hi> he says, <hi>in the Form of God, before he took the Nature of Man upon him.</hi> This sounds well; but why does he not speak out, and tell us what this <hi>Form of God</hi> is? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the True Divine Nature subsisting in him, a True Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Person?</p>
                  <p>Well: <hi>But God did suffer himself to be worshipped and adored in and by the Man Christ Iesus; the least that can be inferred from which is, That God was more immediately and peculiarly present in Christ, than ever he was said to have been any where else? as in the Heavens, the</hi> Jewish <hi>Temple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Cherubims, in Prophets and Holy Men, who spake as they were moved by the Spirit.</hi> Now all this might have been spared, would he but have said, That <hi>the Person Iesus Christ</hi> was worshipped with Divine Honours, as being in his own Person True and Perfect God, as well as Man; and without saying this, he says nothing to prove that Christ is the Son of God Incarnate.</p>
                  <p>To say, <hi>That God did suffer himself to be worshipped in and by the Man Christ Iesus,</hi> as he was worshipped <hi>in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, in the</hi> Jewish <hi>Temple, between the Cherubims</hi> (for that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50623:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
must be the force of the Comparison) does no more prove Christ to be God, than it proves the Heavens, the <hi>Iewish</hi> Temple, and the Cherubims, to be God: It may prove a more perfect symbolical Presence of God in Christ, which he calls <hi>the Fulness of the Godhead,</hi> but not the Incarnation of the Son of God. But this is not the Doctrine of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, merely to say, <hi>That God suffers himself to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the Man Christ Iesus</hi>; as if <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Man Christ Iesus,</hi> were not <hi>One Person</hi>; but that he commands us to worship that Person who is called Christ Jesus, not as a Man, in whom the Power of God dwells, and is present, as in <hi>the Heavens, or in the</hi> Jewish <hi>Temple, or in the Prophets and Holy Men</hi> (who were never for this reason thought the Objects of Worship) but as his own Eternal Son Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. That <hi>all men should honour the Son, as they honour the Father</hi>; which does not only signify to honour the Father in the Son, but to pay Divine Honours to the Person of the Son, which makes them distinct Objects of Worship, and therefore True and Proper Persons, not <hi>Personal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,</hi> which may be distinct Reasons of Worship, but are not distinct Objects.</p>
                  <p>But we shall better understand this, by the account he gives of the Union of God and Man, In what manner Soul and Body, or God and Man, are united, is not the question; for we know nothing how this Physical Union is made; but the question is concerning the Nature and Kind of this Union: Whether, as the Soul and Body are united in One Person, so as to be One Man, so God and Man are united in One Person: <hi>That as the reasonable Soul and Flesh is One Man, so God and Man is One Christ.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Divine and Human Natures are united in One Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; or God be united to Man only as an assisting Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by a perpetual and constant Influx of Divine Powers and Virtues. These two are vastly different: The first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50623:65"/>
always includes the second in the most perfect man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but the second does not always infer the first.</p>
                  <p>A Personal Union is always a Union of Life, Influence, and Power; as he describes the <hi>Vnion of Soul and Body; That there is some Intelligent Power that makes use of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of my Body, and acts in conjunction with the motions there produced</hi>: This is all true, and necessarily consequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Personal Union, but a very lame account of the Vital Union of Soul and Body; for thus Angels may use the Bodies they assume, without a Personal Union: But a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious Life, Sensation, and Government, which makes <hi>One self,</hi> is a great deal more than to act <hi>in conjunction with the Motions of the Body.</hi> The Union of Influence and Power may be without Personal Union, and therefore does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways make One Person.</p>
                  <p>It is the first we enquire after, it is the first the Scripture teaches, That <hi>the Word was made Flesh;</hi> That <hi>God sent forth his Son,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>made of a woman:</hi> This is the Catholick Faith of the Incarnation; but this <hi>the Considerer</hi> takes no notice of; but all he says, relates only to the Union of Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I may,</hi> says he, <hi>as well consider God united to Man, when he so acts by the Ministry and Operation of Man, that the Actions of God seem conveyed to us the same way as the actions of one man are to another.</hi> But does this make God True and Perfect Man? This falls short of the conjunct Operations of Soul and Body, which are much more close and intimate than the actions of one man are to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; however, to be sure the actions of one man upon another, do not make Two such Men One Person; nor therefore can the like Influence of God on Man, make God and Man One Person. But he proceeds:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Had those who upon some occasions spake by the Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Assistance of a Divine Power, been constantly so directed and assisted, how could they have distinguished the Motions of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50623:65"/>
their Souls from the Impressions of God?</hi> Just as they did when they were <hi>sometimes</hi> thus assisted; for External Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions are always distinguishable from Internal Motions. But suppose they could not distinguish them, does this prove that God is Incarnate in such men; or would it be a reason to worship such men as God?</p>
                  <p>He adds, <hi>And why then should we not think such an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Power as this, as much united to such men, as that common ordinary Power we call the Soul, is to those Bodies in which it acts and exerts it self.</hi> The Answer is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it would be an External, not an Internal Principle of Life, and Motion, and Sensation, how constant soever its Influences were. He calls it an <hi>Extraordinary Power,</hi> which shews that it is not a Natural Principle of Action; it is an <hi>Extraordinary Power united to a Man,</hi> and therefore the Man is the <hi>Person,</hi> this <hi>Extraordinary Power</hi> only an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal assisting Principle, of the same kind with that in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, though more constant and regular in its actings: But here is nothing of <hi>Incarnation</hi> in all this.</p>
                  <p>Is this Extraordinary Power a Divine Subsisting Person, in the true and proper Notion of a Person? Is it the Son of God, that Eternal <hi>Word, which was in the beginning, was with God, and was God</hi>? Is this <hi>Extraordinary Power</hi> so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Human Nature, as to become Man? Is it the Person of Christ Jesus, who was conceived in the Womb of the Virgin, lived in the World as a Man, suffered, and died, and rose again from the dead, and now sits at the Right Hand of God in the highest Heavens? Not one word of all this, which is the true Mystery, and the only Use of this Doctrine of the Incarnation, whereon all our Hopes of Salvation by Christ depend. This Extraordinary Power is not a Person, but such <hi>a constant regular Inspiration,</hi> as he says, <hi>some are of opinion the Soul of man is</hi>: But whether that be so or not, as he thinks <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>st probably it is not</hi> (which yet argues some kind of Inclination to it), <hi>yet it seems to him
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50623:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
plain from Scripture, that such a Power as we ascribe to God</hi> (he will not say such a Power as is God, or a True Divine Person) <hi>did as constantly and regularly act in and through Christ, as the Human Soul is perceived to do in any other man.</hi> That such a Power did constantly appear and act in Christ, is true; but whether by Nature, or by <hi>a constant and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Inspiration,</hi> is the Question. Our Saviour proves his Divine Nature from his Works; our <hi>Considerer</hi> thinks it proves no more than <hi>a constant and regular Inspiration:</hi> The first is necessary to the Catholick Faith of the Incarnation, That <hi>the Word was made Flesh</hi>; the second proves him only to be an extraordinary and perpetual Prophet: The first makes him <hi>True God-Man</hi>; the second makes him only a <hi>Divine Man.</hi> And this is all he can mean by this <hi>Power regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and constantly acting in and through Christ:</hi> For if Christ be <hi>God-Man,</hi> he is this <hi>Divine Power</hi> in his own Person; it is his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> not an external adventitious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, how <hi>regularly and constantly</hi> soever it acts; it is not merely <hi>an uninterrupted Presence and Concurrence of the Deity</hi> with the Man Christ Jesus, as he represents it, but the Personal Union of the Divine Nature of Christ to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature. He was not only <hi>as conscious of all the Divine Perfections in himself,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 41.</note> 
                     <hi>as a man is conscious of his own thoughts,</hi> (which yet, by the way, is absolutely impossible, without being True and Perfect God in his own Person), but he knew himself to be God, the Eternal Son of God, not the same Person with his Father, but <hi>One with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Were a man thus <hi>regularly and constantly Inspired,</hi> he would know that he was thus Inspired, and he would also know, that these Divine Perfections are not in himself, not seated in his own Human Person, nor under the Conduct of his own Will, as his own Natural Powers are, and therefore must know himself to be a mere Man still, not <hi>God-Man.</hi>

                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:50623:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>So that this <hi>constant and regular Inspiration,</hi> this <hi>uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Presence and Concurrence of the Deity,</hi> which is all he allows in this matter, cannot make any Person <hi>God-Man.</hi> This Inspiration is not a subsisting Person, is not the Person of the Son of God, is not Incarnate by its Union to Man, no more than it is Incarnate in other Prophets: The Man is the <hi>Person,</hi> and therefore a mere Creature still, tho never so Divinely Inspired.</p>
                  <p>This is such an <hi>Incarnation</hi> as <hi>Socinians</hi> themselves own, in as high expressions as the <hi>Considerer</hi> can invent. <hi>Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> owned something more, That <hi>Christ</hi> who descended on <hi>Iesus</hi> at his Baptism, was <hi>a Divine Person,</hi> not a mere Inspiration, and rested on him, and was most intimately united to him, till his Crucifixion. That Sect of the <hi>Noe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> and <hi>Sabellians</hi> who were called <hi>Patripassians</hi> (for they do not seem by the accounts we have of them, to have been all of that mind) did acknowledge the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God in a true and proper sense, as the Catholick Church did the Incarnation of Christ: But then their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity being but One proper single Divine Person, distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Three Names or Personal Characters (which is the express Doctrine of the <hi>Considerer</hi>) their whole Trinity was Incarnate, suffered, and died, in the Incarnation and Sufferings of Christ, the Father as well as the Son; as it must of necessity be, if there be but One Divine Person, who is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and if this One Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is in a true and proper sense Incarnate: But this the Catholick Church abhorred and condemned, under the name of the <hi>Patripassian Heresy.</hi> Others of them were <hi>Sabellians</hi> in the Doctrine of the Trinity, but <hi>Photinians,</hi> or <hi>Samosatenians,</hi> that is, <hi>Socinians,</hi> as to the Doctrine of the Incarnation, as <hi>Athanasius</hi> often intimates: And if I understand him, this is <hi>the Considerer</hi>'s way, who believes a Trinity in <hi>One single Person,</hi> and <hi>an Inspired Man</hi> for <hi>a God Incarnate.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:50623:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>And thus we have lost the Trinity and Incarnation, and must part with every thing which is peculiar and essential to Christianity, with them. And now one would wonder after all this, what he has to say more about the Faith of the Trinity and Incarnation; and yet this is his next En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,<note place="margin">P. 41.</note> 
                     <hi>What the Scriptures necessarily oblige us to believe in this Point,</hi> that is, concerning <hi>the Trinity and Incarnation?</hi> Though he has been careful all along never to use this term <hi>Incarnation,</hi> as being sensible that all he said about <hi>God-Man,</hi> would not reach the Catholick Notion of <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I met with this Enquiry, I was in hope that there was something behind to unsay all that he had hitherto said; for if what he has already said be true, it is certain the Scripture requires us to believe nothing about them. But upon Examination I found, that the Question was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laciously stated; and the true meaning of it was, What the Scriptures oblige us to believe, instead of what has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto passed for the true Catholick Faith of <hi>the Trinity and Incarnation</hi>? I shall not dispute this Point with him now; to shew what he means, will be Confutation enough.</p>

                     <hi>We must not,</hi> he says, <hi>look upon the Doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as a nice abstracted Speculation, designed for the exercise of our Vnderstandings; but as a plainer Revelation of God's Love and Good Will towards men, and a greater Motive and Incitement to Piety than ever we had before this Doctrine was delivered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This we grant, That the Christian Faith is not designed merely for Speculation, but for Practice; but yet all the Doctrines of Faith are matters of Speculation, and the Doctrine it self must be believed in order to Practice, or else the Revelation of it is of no use at all.</p>
                  <p>The Question then is, Whether we must not believe the Doctrines of <hi>the Trinity and Incarnation?</hi> Or how much we must believe of them? Must we not believe, That God
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50623:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
has in a true and proper sense an Eternal and Only-begotten Son, begotten from Eternity of his own Substance; his True, Perfect, Living, Subsisting Image?

Truly, No; if I understand him: All this is <hi>a nice abstracted Speculation,</hi> and a very perplexing <hi>exercise of our Vnderstandings</hi>; and we are bound to understand no more by God's giving his own Son to dye for us, but his <hi>Love and G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But how can we learn <hi>God's Love and Good Will to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> from this Doctrine, if it be not true? if God have no Eternal Son, and therefore did not give his Eternal Son to become Man, and to suffer and dye for us? The Gospel proves the great Love of God to Sinners, by the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Death, and Sufferings of his Son; that if we do not believe this Doctrine strictly and literally true, we lose the Gospel Proof of God's Love to Sinners, and of the Virtue and Efficacy of Christ's Death and Sacrifice to expiate our sins, and of the Power of his Intercession as the Eternal, Only-begotten, and Well-beloved Son of God.</p>

                  <p>This he resolves <hi>into the Eternal Purpose and Decree of God, to redeem Mankind by the Death and constant Mediation of a Man chosen and enabled for this work by the Fulness of the Godhead dwelling in him: And in consideration of his Passion and Intercession, to impart such Gifts, Graces, and Spiritual Assistances, as would be sufficient to render this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption effectual to the saving of much people.</hi> So that God decreed from Eternity, <hi>upon his Foreknowledge of Man's Fall,</hi> that in order to redeem Man he would take upon himself the <hi>Distinctions and Offices</hi> of <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; Saviour, Mediator, and Comforter,</hi> in time; and this is all <hi>the Eternal Distinction in the Godhead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well: But it seems God did not decree from Eternity to redeem Man by his own Son, but <hi>by a Man chosen and enabled for this Work by the Fulness of the Godhead dwelling in him</hi>; that is, as we have already heard, by an Inspired and Deified Man,<note place="margin">

                  <p>But if God redeems us by a Man, however he be enabled by a Divine Power, Why is he said to give his Son for us? For this Divine Power is not a Person, and therefore no Son, nor is the Man his own and only begotten Son.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. A Brief Account of the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Heresy, and by what Arguments the Catholick Fathers opposed it.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Considerer</hi> has given us the most Compleat and Artificial Scheme of <hi>Sabellianism</hi> that I have yet met with, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d has very fairly and openly confessed his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, to prove, That <hi>One God</hi> must signify that there is but <hi>One</hi> who is God, but <hi>One single Divine Person,</hi> in the proper Notion of a Person, as it signifies <hi>an Intelligent Being.</hi> I have endeavoured to shew him his Mistake, and what it is that has mis-led him; and how hopeless an Attempt it is to reconcile his Hypothesis with the Catholick Faith of <hi>the Trinity and Incarnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is so bold an Attempt, openly to assert and defend a Heresy which has been constantly condemned by the Catholick Church, since its first appearance, that I am apt to hope he does not believe his Hypothesis to be <hi>Sabellia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> or that Heresy which now is best known by that name, though <hi>Sabellius</hi> was not the first Author of it. And therefore I will shew him what <hi>Sabellianism</hi> is, and how the Fathers opposed it.</p>
               <p>There were Two Points in dispute between them and the Catholick Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Concerning the Personality of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Concerning the Unity of God, Whether it were the Unity of One Person, as they pretended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:50623:69"/>That we may rightly understand this matter, we must distinguish between the several kinds of <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Arguments and Answers of the Fathers are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times adapted to one, and sometimes to another Notion of it. <hi>That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> were but <hi>One Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> was asserted by them all, but explained very different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that altered the state of the Question, and required different Answers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As first, They made Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to be only Three Names, Appearances, or Offices of the same Person, as I observed before: And then the state of the Question was not, Whether the Son was a Person, and the Holy Ghost a Person, in as true and proper a sense as the Father was a Person? For this they owned by making Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost, Three Names of the same Person; whereas it is impossible they should be the same Person, if the Son were not a Person, nor the Holy Ghost a Person. If the Son be the same Person with the Father, the Son must be a Person, for <hi>no</hi> Person can't be the <hi>same</hi> Person: Which is the same Argument to prove that these Hereticks owned Christ to be a True and Real Person, that <hi>Novatianus</hi> used (as I observed before) to prove that they owned Christ to be true and perfect God, because they made him the same with the Father, who is true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God, and a true, and real, and substantial Person. And if he be the very same with the Father, he must be the same we acknowledge the Father to be; <hi>viz.</hi> a true and real Person, and perfect God.</p>
               <p>The Dispute then which the Catholick Fathers had with these Hereticks, with respect to this Notion, That Father, Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Holy Ghost, were the very same Person, was not, Whether the Son was a Person, and the Holy Ghost a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? but, Whether the Son and Holy Ghost were truly and really distinct Persons from the Father, as the Catholick
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50623:70"/>
Church always believed? or, Whether they were the same Person, distinguished only by Three Names.</p>
               <p>Now when the Fathers asserted not only the Personality of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost (which this Notion did not oppose), but the real distinction of Persons, That the Son was a Person, but not the same Person with the Father, they must ascribe the same kind of Personality to the Son, which they do to the Father; That the Son is as truly and really a Person as the Father is, though not the same Person; as truly a Person as God would be, were there but One Person in the Godhead, as these Hereticks affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For according to all the Rules of Disputation, we must take Words in the sense of those whom we oppose; for otherwise it is a mere wrangle about Words, without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing one another. And therefore since the <hi>Sabellians</hi> by Person understood such a Person as every single Person is, (for they made Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but Three different Names of the same single individual Person) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could oppose or confute them, but to prove, That Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost, are Three distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, in the same Notion of a Person which belongs to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry single individual Person, as far as mere Personality is concerned. For to prove them Three in any other sense, whether Three Modes, or Three Powers, or Three Parts of the same One single Person, is what they would have; and allow them to be but One Person, and they will dispute no further; nay, will give you leave to call Three Modes, or Three Names, or Three Parts of the same One Person, Three Persons, if you please.</p>
               <p>But for the clearer understanding of this matter, we must consider by what Arguments the Ancient Writers opposed this Heresy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in opposition to <hi>Praxeas,</hi> reduces this to a short Question, Whether God have any Son, and who he is,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50623:70"/>
and how he is his Son.<note place="margin">

                  </note> For if God have a Son, the Son must be as true and real a Person as the Father, and Father and Son must be Two distinct Persons; for the same Person can't be both Father and Son to himself; the very Names of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son signify, that one is of the other, and we must understand things to be what they are called, whether Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Son, which can no more be the same than Night and Day, with respect to these different Relations. The Father makes the Son, and the Son makes the Father; and those who receive these Relations from each other, can never be these Relations to themselves, that the Father should make himself a Son to himself, or the Son make himself a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to himself. This Order God has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in all other Beings, and he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves it himself. A Father must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity have a Son, to be a Father; and a Son must have a Father, that he may be a Son, but <hi>to have,</hi> and <hi>to be,</hi> are two things; as for instance, for a man to be a Husband, signifies that he has a Wife, not that he is a Wife to himself; and thus to be a Father, signifies to have a Son, not to be a Son to himself; in such Relations we must be one, and have another; that to be both is to be neither, because we can have neither. If I be Father and Son to my self, I am no Father, because I have no Son, who makes a Father, but am Son my self;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50623:71"/>
and I am no Son, because I have no Father, who makes the Son, but am Son my self; and thus while they make Father and Son one and the same Person, they destroy the Notion both of Father and Son.</p>
               <p>Now would any man have argued at this rate, who did not believe Father and Son to be real and Substantial Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and as distinct from each other as a human Father and Son are; for if they be not, all this reasoning from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Relations of Father and Son, which require a real di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of Persons, is quite lost: And whether this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument be good, or no, (which is not the present Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) it is certain that whoever uses it, if he understands himself, must believe, That Father and Son signify as true and real Relations, and as real and distinct Persons in the Godhead, as they do in human Nature.</p>
               <p>The like may be said of that other Argument against the Father and the Son being One and the same Person, That then the same Person must, in order of Nature, be both before and after himself; for he who begets must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in order of Nature (though not of Time, in an Eternal Generation) be before him who is begotten by him: That as Father, he is before himself as Son; as Son, he is after himself as Father; which had been Iudicrous trifling, if they had not believed a real substantial Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Person, and consequently that the Son is a real substantial Person: For this Argument will not hold in the Generation of Modes and Postures, or in one part of the Deity generating another.</p>

               <p>Thus they prove the distinction of Persons between Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son, from those Texts which tell us, That the Father sends the Son, and the Son is sent; That the Father anoints, and the Son is anointed; That the Father gives Commands, and the Son receives them, and doth the Will of his Father; That the Father knows the Son, and the Son the Father; That he sees all that the Father doth, and can do all that he sees the Father do: For there must be distinct Subjects for such different Acts; the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, with respect to himself, can't with any propriety of speech be said to send, and to be sent; to anoint, and to be anointed; to command, and to obey; to come forth from himself, and to come into the world, and to leave the world, and go to himself: And therefore he who sends, and he who is sent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> must be Two.</p>
               <p>Nay, it is well observed by these Fathers, That Christ himself expresly teaches us, that He and his Father, with respect to the distinction of Persons, are Two; so Two, as

               <p>These and such like Arguments we may find in all the Ancient Writers who have engaged in this Controversy; and from hence we learn not only what they thought of the distinction of Persons between Father and Son, but what kind of Person they believed the Son to be; such a Person as has a Personal Knowledge, and Will, and Power, who is capable of being sent, of receiving and executing Commands, and has all this as distinctly in himself, as he is a distinct Person. The Father knows the Son, and the Son knows the Father, but each of them know by their own Personal Knowledge; the Father wills, and the Son wills, and wills all the same with the Father, but each of them wills by his own Personal Will; the Father works, and the Son works, and they inseparably do the same things, but each of them work by their own Personal Power.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50623:72"/>
Knowledge, and Will, and Power of acting, is essential to the Notion of a Person, and therefore every distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must have a distinct Personal Knowledge, and Will, and Power; and those must acknowledge this, who prove the distinction of Persons from distinct Personal Acts, as all these Fathers did. This is all we ask, when we assert a distinction of Persons in the Trinity; and this we must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on, or deny a Trinity; for if there are not Three who have all the same distinct Personal Acts, there cannot be Three distinct compleat Persons; for Personal Acts shew a Person, and distinct Personal Acts prove distinct Persons; and in this sense (as all these Arguments prove) the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers owned a distinction of Three Persons in the Unity of the Godhead.</p>
               <p>Their distinction between <hi>Deus invisibilis,</hi> and <hi>Deus visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis,</hi> the invisible and visible God, whereby they proved the real distinction between God the Father and God the Son, is an undeniable Proof of their Opinion in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for I urge it no farther.</p>
               <p>It was the received Opinion (as far as I can find) of all the Ancient Fathers, till St. <hi>Austin,</hi> That God the Father never appeared in any visible Representation of himself; for he tells <hi>Moses, No man can see my face, and live:</hi> And St. <hi>Iohn</hi> assures us, <hi>No man hath seen God at any time, but the only-begotten Son,</hi>

               <p>This we may see largely proved by <hi>Tertullian</hi> and St. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary,</hi> and observed by St. <hi>Athanasius</hi>; and the plain conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence they draw from it, is, That this <hi>invisible</hi> and <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>

                  </gap>-evident, that it needs no Proof; but it evidently proves what a real, substantial, as well as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Person they thought the Son, who could visibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, while the Father remained invisible; for as a visible and invisible God can't be the same Person, so a visible God must be a real substantial Person.</p>
               <p>And though St. <hi>Austin</hi> was of opinion, That those Three Men which appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> were the Three Persons of the Sacred Trinity, and thereby rejected the distinction of the invisible and visible God, by attributing a visible Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to God the Father, which none of the Ancients had done before him; yet by these Three distinct Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances he confirmed the real distinction of the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who were as distinct Persons as they appeared to be, and therefore as distinct as Three Human Persons, for they appeared as Three distinct men. And therefore he observes, That whereas Two of these Three went to <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom, Lot</hi> speaks to them as to One, 19. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>And Lot said unto them,</hi>

I do not justify St. <hi>Austin</hi> in this, because I doubt whether the Argument be good; but by this we may understand St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Judgment of the real distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Persons.</p>
               <p>And to the same purpose the Voice from Heaven at our Saviour's Baptism, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased</hi>; and the Descent of the Holy Spirit like a Dove, and lighting upon him, is urged by the Ancient Fathers to prove a real Trinity of Divine Persons:<note place="margin">

               <p>The <hi>Sabellians</hi> being unable to maintain this Point, which is so manifestly absurd, and so irreconcilable with all the forms of speech used in Scripture concerning Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, found it necessary to allow some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between them, but yet were so afraid of <hi>Tritheism,</hi> that they kept religiously to their main Point, that One God was but One Person, and therefore would admit of no other distinction but what was reconcilable with the Unity of a Person.</p>

Hence, secondly, some of them taught, That the Son is distinguished from the Father, not as one Person is distinguished from another, but as a man's Word or Wisdom which is in his Heart and Soul, may be distinguished from himself; that is, That the Son is not a living, substantial, subsisting Word, no more than the Word of a Man, which is only the motion of a living subsisting heart, but does not live and subsist it self, but being spoke it vanishes, and being often repeated, never continues;<note place="margin">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50623:74"/>
Divine Word is true and perfect God, God of God, and God with God; and therefore they make God and his Word but One Person, as Man and his Word is One Man.</p>
               <p>In answer to this, St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> urges all those Texts which prove Christ and God the Father to be Two distinct Persons; for if they be Two Persons, then the Son is as True and Real a Person as the Father is. This I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken notice of, and need not now repeat it; only I cannot but observe what <hi>Athanasius</hi> tells us of these He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, That when they were convinced by the plain Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Scripture, that God the Father, and Christ who called himself the Son of God, were Two Persons, they then took Courage, and owned Christ to be a Person, but not a Divine Person, as the Eternal Word of God, but only a Human Person, as he was Man. But <hi>Athanasius</hi> tells them, That this was neither better nor worse than the Heresy of <hi>Paulus Samosatenus,</hi> or what we now call <hi>Socinianism,</hi> to make Christ a mere Man; for he can be no more, if the Divine Word, which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us was Incarnate, be not the Person: If the Word Incarnate be the Person, then Christ is God-Man; if the Man be the Person, he can be no more than a Man.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Athanasius</hi> confutes at large, and proves, That what Christ says of himself, cannot belong to a mere Man. But that which I would observe, is this, That both these Hereticks, who denied the Divine Word to be a Person, and <hi>Athanasius</hi> and the other Catholick Fathers who affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be a Person, agreed very well in the Notion of a Person, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Person is a distinct, intelligent Being, who does really and actually subsist, and subsists distinctly from all other intelligent Beings. That the Divine Word in the Godhead is such a Person as a Man is in Human Nature: Such a Person these Hereticks would allow Christ to be, considered as a Man; and such a Person <hi>Athanasius</hi> affirms
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50623:74"/>
Christ to be, considered as God, or the Divine Word; for otherwise they wrangle about words, and do not oppose each other.</p>
               <p>The Fathers proved, That Christ was a Person, and a distinct Person from the Father, by those Texts which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present him as speaking to and of his Father, and which attribute many Personal Acts to him: The <hi>Sabellians</hi> could not deny but that these were Personal Acts, and did prove Christ to be a real subsisting Person; but then would not allow the <hi>Word</hi> to be the Person, but only the Man Christ Jesus to be the Person: The Fathers, on the other hand, allow their Notion of a Person, which is the only true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Notion, but prove, That the Divine Word which was Incarnate, not merely the Man Christ Jesus, was this Person; and therefore that this Divine Word is a real, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial, subsisting Word, not like the Word of a man, which is a transient Act, but has no subsistence of its own.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sabellians</hi> would have allowed a Trinity of Persons in any other Notion of a Person, than as a Person signifies a real, subsisting, intelligent Being; but the Catholick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would own no other Notion of Person but this; and taught that there were Three Persons in the Trinity, in the same sense in which the <hi>Sabellians</hi> denied there were Three Persons; Three such Persons as they affirmed there was but One; that the Son and Holy Ghost were Divine Persons, in the same sense that the <hi>Sabellians</hi> owned the Father to be a Person; that is, Three such Persons as they called Three Gods.</p>
               <p>The reason of this I'm sure is not to be answered, That if the Catholick Fathers understood what they did, when they opposed the <hi>Sabellians,</hi> who made the Divine Word only to be the Word of a Divine Person, but not a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Person himself, they must assert the Divine Word in a strict and proper sense to be a Divine Person, and not
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50623:75"/>
merely the transient Word of a Person, which has no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence; which is a more sensible Argument than all the Criticisms about <hi>Persona</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

him: And tells us particularly, That this Divine Word, which is the Son of God, begotten and born of him, is not a mere Sound or Voice, like the Word of a Man, but that substantial Virtue and Power which proceeds from God: A Divine Substance, whose Name is the Word: Such a Word as is both the Son of God, and God: God proceeding from God, and making a Second Person in the Godhead.</p>

                  <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> in opposition to the Heresies of <hi>Noetus</hi> and <hi>Sabellius,</hi> who made Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but One Substantial Person, affirms over and over, That the Father is Substance, the Son Substance, and the Holy

Ghost Substance, that is, each of them Substance by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and as distinct in Substance as they are in Person: Three Substantial Persons, which are not one another, nor all the same. These Hereticks allowed the Father to be Substance, the Son Substance, the Holy Ghost Substance, but denied them to be Three in Substance, but taught that they were but One Substance, as they were but One and the same Person, Three Names, or Three distinct Virtues and Powers of the same One Substance or Person. And therefore when in opposition to these men <hi>Epiphanius</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, That the Father is Substance, the Son Substance, and the Holy Ghost Substance, he can mean no less but that each of them is as distinctly Substance as he is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; for to oppose One Substance, and One substantial Person, you must assert, not Three diverse or different Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, but Three as distinct in Substance as they are in Person, or Three distinct substantial Persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> asserts against these Hereticks, That the Son is not the Father, but truly and properly a Son, begotten of God the Father, as to Substance.

and the Son Perfect Power, as born of him. It were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to transcribe such Sayings as these out of the Fathers; but I cannot miss <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Argument from those words of our Saviour, <hi>I am in the Father, and the Father in me.</hi> Now, says he, the Father is not the Word in the Heart of the Son,<note place="margin">

               <p>The Answer <hi>Athanasius</hi> gives to a <hi>Sabellian</hi> Objection against the substantial Generation and Subsistence of the Word and Son of God, is an unanswerable Proof what he thought of this matter.</p>
               <p>The Objection is this, That if the Word and Son be truly and substantially begotten, this substantial Word must go out of the Father, and subsist separately from him:<note place="margin">

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50623:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therefore we must have no imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Place, when we think of God, the Son, and the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; That these are false and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical Reasonings; That the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence of God is not a co-extension with all Creatures, which is a bodily or kind of Corporeal Omnipresence; but his Power holds and contains all things, for Power is unbodied and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, which neither encompasses o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, nor is encompassed by them; and therefore it is impious to ask for, or to conceive what is the Place of God, of the Word, or of the Holy Spirit.

               <p>So that <hi>Athanasius</hi> acknowledges the Son to be as true and substantial a Son, as the Father is a substantial Father; and that he does as perfectly and compleatly subsist by himself, as the Father does; but denies that it hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, as the <hi>Sabellians</hi> objected, That the Son, if he be a distinct substantial Person himself, must be divided and parted from the Substance of his Father, and that if he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist distinctly by himself, he must subsist in a separate place from his Father; that this distinction of Persons and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence cannot be conceived without a Local Separation.</p>
               <p>For he tells them, All these Mistakes are owing to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Imaginations; that they conceive of God after the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50623:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
manner of Bodies; that because Body cannot generate another, without parting and dividing of Substance, nor subsist without being in some place, nor subsist distinctly without being in distinct and separate places, therefore if God beget a Son, and this Son subsist distinctly by himself, this Son must go out of the Divine Substance, and be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally separated from God the Father, as a human Son is from his Father; whereas the Divine Nature and Substance cannot be divided, nor does God subsist in a place; and therefore the Son may be substantially begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and subsist distinctly by himself, without any division of the Divine Substance, or separation of place.</p>
               <p>Let us now proceed to a Third sort of these Hereticks, who did allow a real and substantial difference between Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost, but made God a compound Being, but one Person, as well as one God, and that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost, were the Three Parts of this One God.

               <p>This all the Catholick Fathers unanimously reject, and for the same reasons; because there can be no composition in the pure and simple Nature of God; and it was the received Doctrine of the Catholick Church, That each Person is by himself True and Perfect God, not an incompleat Part of the Deity.</p>

               <p>Let us now then consider the true state of the Question between these <hi>Sabellians,</hi> and the Catholick Fathers: These Hereticks owned at last, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to be Three distinct Substances, but not Three substantial Wholes, but Three substantial Parts, which by their Union and Composition made up One whole intire God. The Catholick Fathers join with them so far, as to own these Divine Persons to be Three substantial subsisting Persons, but reject their Notion of a compounded God, or Three Parts of the Deity, with the utmost abhorrence, and affirm, that each Person is by himself entire and perfect God, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and complete Divine Essence or Substance, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Damascen</hi> speaks; and that they are not One God by Composition, or as One Person is One God, but as Three
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50623:80"/>
complete and perfect Persons, each of which is perfect God, can be One God.</p>
               <p>Now I think after this we need not dispute, what the Metaphysical Notions of Person and Personality are: for a Person in this Sacred Mystery, signifies One who is true and perfect God, and therefore is whatever God is; for the true and perfect definition of God, must belong to every Person who is true and perfect God. If then we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God to be Infinite Substance, Mind, Life, Knowledge, Power, every Person who is God must be all this; and if each Person be true and perfect God, and yet no One Person is the other, nor the Motion, Affection, or perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power, nor part of the other, then each Person is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly and by himself complete and perfect God, and therefore has distinctly in himself all those Attributes and Perfections which belong to the perfect Notion and Idea of God; and to make any Person less than what God is, is to make him no God.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Athanasius</hi> has another Argument against the <hi>Sabellian</hi> compounded Deity,<note place="margin">

The Scripture assures us, that God sends his Son, and that the Son sends the Holy Ghost; whereas were the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Three inseparable Parts of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Deity, how could this One God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, send part of himself, and one part of the same One God send another?</p>
               <p>To send, and to be sent, necessarily supposes Persons really and substantially distinct, such as can give and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and execute Commands, who have distinct Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, Wills, and Powers of Action, for no other Beings are capable of sending or being sent; and Three

such distinct Persons, each of which is complete and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God, is the Trinity asserted by the Catholick Fathers, in contradiction to the Heresy of <hi>Sabellius.</hi>

The <hi>Sabellians</hi> took the first way to secure the Catholick Faith of One God, they denied Three real, distinct, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Persons in the Godhead; but the Catholick Faith owns Three real, distinct, substantial, divine Persons, and teaches that these Three are One God; not with such an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as belongs to One Person, but as Three Persons are One God: which should be a warning to some late Writers, who think they cannot sufficiently defend the Unity of God, without opposing a real and substantial Trinity, which is to oppose the ancient Catholick Faith.</p>
               <p>To conclude this <hi>Chapter,</hi> the result of the whole in short is this, That in opposition to the <hi>Noetians,</hi> who made Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to be only Three Names of the same One Divine Person, whom we call God, the Catholick Fathers asserted that they were Three distinct Persons, not the same Person under Three Names, or Three Appearances; in opposition to those <hi>Sabellians,</hi> who denied the Substantiality of the Son, and of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, but made the Son like the Word in the mind or heart of man, which had no substantial, permanent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of its own, and the Holy Ghost in like manner to be a transient efflux of Power from God; so that God the Father was the only subsisting Person, and the One God, but the Son, and the Holy Ghost, the insubstantial, transient Word and Power of God. These ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in like manner asserted the Substantiality of the Son,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50623:81"/>
and of the Holy Ghost, that they were real, distinct, subsisting Persons, as true and perfect Persons as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himself is: in opposition to those <hi>Sabellians</hi> who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted a compound Deity, and made a Trinity of Parts, instead of a Trinity of Persons in the Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; they unanimously rejected all composition in the Deity, and asserted each Person distinctly by himself, not to be a part of God, but true and perfect God.</p>
               <p>Now had these Fathers asserted nothing positively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Three Divine Persons, but only rejected these <hi>Noetian</hi> and <hi>Sabellian</hi> Heresies, it had been evidence enough what their Faith was concerning the Ever-blessed Trinity; for remove these Heresies, and all such as are manifestly the same, however they may differ in words, and there is nothing left for any man to believe concerning a Divine Trinity, but the true Catholick Faith of Three real, distinct, substantial, Divine Persons, each of which is distinctly, and by himself complete, entire, perfect God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are not one and the same Person, distinguisht only by Three Names, according to their different Appearances and Operations; nor one single Person with two personal Vertues and Powers, called the Son, and the Spirit, like the word and emotion in a man's heart, which is no person, and has no subsistence of its own; nor three parts of one compounded Deity, as a man is compounded of Body, Soul, and Spirit, then of necessity Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, must be Three complete, substantial, subsisting Persons, Thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

If the Unity of God be not the Unity of a Person, it must be the Unity and Sameness of Nature, and the inseparable Union of Persons; and this is the Unity in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, which the Catholick Fathers taught, and which is the only thing they could reasonably teach, when they had rejected the <hi>Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Unity. There is no <hi>medium</hi> that I know of in this Controversy concerning the Unity of God, between the Unity of One single Person, and that Oneness which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults from the Unity, and the Consubstantiality of Nature, and inseparable Union of Persons; and therefore if the first be Heresy, the second must be the Catholick Faith; and whatever Notions men advance against this, is <hi>Sabellianism</hi> in its Principle, and last result: for if the Unity of God be not the Union of Three complete Divine Persons, each of which is distinctly by himself perfect God, it must be the Unity of One Divine Person, which is the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Unity.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Concerning <hi>the Homoousion,</hi> or <hi>One Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</head>
               <p>IN the last <hi>Chapter</hi> I have plainly shewn what <hi>Sabellia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism</hi> is, and by what Arguments the Catholick Fathers opposed and confuted it, which is proof enough what they meant by Person, when in opposition to <hi>Sabellius,</hi> they taught that there were Three Persons in the Unity of the Godhead; not Three personal Characters and Relations, which <hi>Sabellius</hi> owned, but Three true and proper Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, each of whom is by himself true and perfect God.</p>
               <p>But yet the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith of the <hi>Homocusion,</hi> or <hi>One Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of Father and Son, is so expounded by some, as to countenance the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Heresy, which all the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers condemned, though one would think that should be an unanswerable Objection against it; this has made it so absolutely necessary to the Vindication of the Catholick Faith, and to compose some warm Disputes, rightly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this matter, that I shall carefully inquire what the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers meant by these terms of the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> and <hi>One Substance,</hi> which they have put into their Creed, as the most express opposition to the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresy.</p>
               <p>And we cannot long doubt of this, if we consider the true state of the <hi>Arian</hi> Controversy: There was no Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute between the <hi>Arians</hi> and Catholicks concerning the Personality of the Son; they both condemned <hi>Sabellius,</hi> and therefore <hi>One Substance,</hi> when opposed to the <hi>Arians,</hi> can't signify a <hi>Sabellian</hi> Unity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:50623:82"/>The <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Sabellians</hi> both agreed in this, That <hi>One God</hi> is but One Divine Person, who is truly and properly God; and that to assert Three Persons, each of which is true and perfect God, is to make Three Gods. The <hi>Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> to avoid this <hi>Tritheism,</hi> make Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but One Divine Person, and in that sense but One God. The <hi>Arians</hi> on the other hand, allow Father and Son to be two real distinct Persons, but attribute true and perfect Divinity only to the Father, and make the Son a Creature, though the most excellent Creature, made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World, and as like to God as any Creature can be, and the Minister of God in making the World.</p>
               <p>This Heresy was condemned by the first general Council assembled at <hi>Nice</hi>; and if we would understand the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, we must expound it in opposition to the <hi>Arian</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy, without running into the other Extreme of <hi>Sabellia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism.</hi> And therefore when we are taught to believe <hi>in One Lord Iesus Christ, the Only begotten Son of God, begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of his Father before all Worlds, God of God, Light of Light, Very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of One Substance with the Father, by whom all things were made</hi>; Wemust understand a Son, who is a distinct Person from his Father, as the <hi>Arians</hi> allowed him to be, but not a made or created Son, as they taught, but a Son by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, begotten of his Father's substance, and that not in Time, but from all Eternity; and therefore not a Creature, but God by Nature, true and perfect God, as God of God, begotten of God, and therefore of <hi>One Substance</hi> with the Father; not in the <hi>Sabellian</hi> sense, as <hi>One Substance</hi> is One Person, but as One Substance signifies the same Nature, in opposition to the <hi>Arians,</hi> who made him not only a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Person, but of a different Nature, like his Father, but not the same; not of the substance of his Father, but a new created Substance, made out of nothing, as all other Creatures are. The opposition of this Creed to the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50623:83"/>
                  <hi>Arian</hi> Heresy is certainly the best way of expounding it, and then we find nothing in it, but the true ancient Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, of the real distinction of Persons in the Unity of the Divine Essence. But the present Inquiry is, What is the true Notion of the <hi>Homousion,</hi> or <hi>One Substance</hi> of Father and Son; and besides that positive account the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers give us of it, we may learn this from those false Glosses and Interpretations which they reject, and those Rules they give for the expounding these words.</p>

                     </note>A third Reason they assigned against this word <hi>Homoousion</hi> was this, That to be <hi>Consubstantial,</hi> or of <hi>One Substance,</hi> in the strict and proper acceptation of these words, signifies, that the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Son, is by the division of the Father's Substance, as if he were

cut out of him, and One Substance divided into Two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and so Father and Son are of One Substance, as a part cut out of the whole, is of the same nature with that from whence it is taken.</p>
                  <p>This was objected against the <hi>Homoousion</hi> in the time of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, while this word was under debate, which <hi>Socrates</hi> gives a more particular account of.

                  </p>
                  <p>For this very reason <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Caesarea</hi> was for some time in suspense about the <hi>Homoousion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eusebii Epist. ad Caesariensis apud So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat.</hi> Ibid</note> which he afterwards rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily received, when the Council had declared in what sense they understood it, and rejected all corporeal passions, all division and partition, change and diminution of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Essence; which pure, simple, unbodied, eternal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Mind is not capable of. Now all that I shall observe at present is, That this very Objection, which was thought so formidable, necessarily supposes that both they who made it, and they who were so much concerned to answer it, did acknowledge <hi>a substantial generation of the Son</hi>; for this whole Dispute is downright Nonsense with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: If God the Father in begetting his Son, does not
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50623:85"/>
so communicate his own Nature and Substance to him, as to make him a true substantial Son, of the same Substance indeed, but yet as distinct in Substance from the Father, as he is in Person, How ridiculous is all this Dispute, how the Father communicates his own Nature to his Son? for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these men, he does not communicate or propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate his own Nature and Substance at all, there being but one singular solitary Divine Nature and Substance, with a Trinity of Names, Modes, or Offices, and therefore no danger of any division or partition of the Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                  <p>The Dispute between the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and the <hi>Arians</hi> about the generation of the Son was this: They both owned against the <hi>Sabellians,</hi> that the Son is a real, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial, subsisting Person; but the Question was, whence he had his Nature? whether he was created out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and consequently had a beginning of Being, as the <hi>Arians</hi> affirmed; or was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, of the Substance of his Father, and so coeternal with his Father, as the <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil affirmed, That the Substance of the Son was of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Father, <hi>God of God, Light of Light.</hi> Against this the <hi>Arians</hi> objected, That the Son could not be of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Father, without the division of the Father's Substance, which is impossible in an infinite uncreated Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as God is; which Argument is only against a substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial generation. The <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers allow this Objection to be good as to corporeal generations, but deny that it is thus as to the Eternal Generation of the Son of God; for an Eternal, Uncreated, Immutable Mind, if it can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate its own Nature at all, (and we learn from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that God has a Son) must do it without division of parts; for the Divine Nature and Substance has no parts, and is capable of no division: And it is very absurd to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from corporeal Passions, to the Affections and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Spirits, much more of an infinite eternal Spirit.</p>

                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:50623:85"/>Had not the <hi>Arians</hi> understood the Catholick Fathers, of the substantial Generation of the Son, they had more wit than to urge an Argument to no purpose; for where there is no communication of Substance, it is certain there can be no division of it: And had not the Catholick Fathers owned this substantial Generation, they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Argument with scorn, as nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and not have distinguished between corporeal gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and the Generation of Eternal and Infinite Mind. That though Bodies cannot communicate their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Substance without division, yet an Eternal Mind can; so that from these perverse Interpretations of the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> which the Catholick Fathers rejected, we may learn what they meant by it: for if Father and Son are not <hi>Consubstantial</hi> in the sense of the <hi>Sabellians</hi> and <hi>Modalists</hi>; that is, that Father and Son are not One Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with Two Names, nor One singular solitary Substance common to them both, then the Father must be a substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Father, and the Son a substantial Son, and these Two substantial Persons are <hi>Consubstantial,</hi> as having the same One Divine Nature and Substance intirely, perfectly and distinctly in themselves, without any division, diminution, or separation of Substance, by a complete and perfect Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, whereby the Father communicates his whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Nature to the Son without any change or alteration in himself.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>SEcondly,</hi> Let us now examine what account the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Post-Nicene</hi> Fathers give of the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> and in what sense they understood it. But before I tell you what they expresly say of this matter, I shall observe by the way two or three Rules they give us for expounding the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> which are of great use in this Enquiry.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first is, To give the <hi>Homoousion</hi> the right place in our Creed, as the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers have done. They do not tell us abruptly, in the first place, That the Son is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantial, or of one Substance with the Father. They first tell us, That Jesus Christ our Lord is the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of his Father, that is, of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his Father, before all Worlds, God of God, Light of Light, Very God of Very God, Begotten, not made; and then they add, Of One Substance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>This St. <hi>Hilary</hi> lays great stress on, and his Reason is very considerable;<note place="margin">
                        <p>
                           <hi>In his igitur tot tamque gravibus fidei periculis, verborum brevitas temperanda est, ne impie dici existi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metur, quod pic intelligitur: ne secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra atque innocente conscientia, per oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionem haereticorum reus sermo sit, dicturus unam substantiam Catholicus Patris &amp; Filii, non inde incipiat; neque hoc quasi maximum teneat, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam sine hoc vera fides nulla sit.</hi> Hilar. de Synodis.</p>
                     </note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
if in the first place we say, Father and Son are consubstantial, or of One Substance, this is capable of an Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal as well as Orthodox Sense, as we have already heard; for they may be One Substance in the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Notion, as that signifies One Person; or One by the Division or Partition of the same
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50623:86"/>
Substance, of which each has a part; for all these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Senses may be affix'd to it, when this word <hi>Consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi> or <hi>One Substance,</hi> stands singly by it self, or is put in the first place, without any thing to limit or determine its signification. And therefore a true Catholick Christian must not begin his Creed with saying, That Father and Son are of One Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;<note place="margin">

                     </note> but then he may safely say <hi>One Substance,</hi> when he has first said, The Father is unbegotten, the Son is born, and subsists of his Father, like to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all Perfections, Honour, and Nature; not of nothing, but born; not unborn, but coaeval; not the Father, but the Son of the Father; not a Part of the Father, but All that the Father is; not the Author, but the Image, the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, begotten of God, and born God; not a Creature, but God; not Another God, of a different Kind and Substance, but One God, as having the same Essence and Nature, which differs in nothing from the Substance of the Father; that God is One, not in Person, but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Father and Son having nothing unlike, or of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kind in them: And after this we may safely add, That Father and Son are One Substance, and cannot deny it without Sin.</p>
                  <p>This is as plain as words can make it, and needs no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but fixes and determines the Catholick Sense of the <hi>Homoousion.</hi> For if we must acknowledge the Son to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantial, or of one Substance with the Father, in no other sense than as a True and Real Son is consubstantial, a Son, not created out of Nothing, but begotten of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Substance; the Son of God, who in his own proper Person is true and perfect God; not a part of God, but all
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50623:87"/>
that God is; not One God, as One Person with the Father, but as having the true Divine Nature distinctly in his own Person. This is a Demonstration that the <hi>Nicene Consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiality,</hi> is the <hi>Consubstantiality</hi> of Two real substantial Persons, who have the same Nature distinctly subsisting in each of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Another Rule for expounding the <hi>Homoousion</hi> is, that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, are equipollent terms; that to be of one Substance, and to be in all things alike to each other, signify the same thing. I know the Fathers condemned the <hi>Arian Homoiousion</hi>; for they asserted, That the Son was like the Father, in opposition to his being of the same Nature with the Father, and therefore this was an imperfect likeness and resemblance, or indeed no likeness at all; for a created and uncreated Nature are at such an infinite distance, as to have no true and real likeness to each other; to be sure not such a likeness as there must be between a Son and a Father: Nay sometimes they would not allow, that likeness can be properly applied to two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Natures of the same <hi>species,</hi> as to two individual human Natures, which are not like to each other, but are the same.

                     </note> he always thought that what is signified by both these words, is the same: that perfect likeness of Nature is the sameness of Nature; for nothing can be perfectly alike, which has not the same Nature. And this he says he learnt from the Evangelists and Apostles, before ever he heard of the <hi>Nicene Faith,</hi> which he had not heard of till a little before he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for that Faith. This observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of great use, as St. <hi>Hilary</hi> notes, to confute <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> and to fix the true sense of the <hi>Homoousion:</hi> for if to be Consubstantial, or of one Nature, signifies a perfect likeness, similitude, and equality of Nature, Consubstantiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty must at least signify Two, who are thus consubstantial, as likeness, simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and equality does; and these Two must have One and the same Nature, not in the sense of Singularity, and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellian</hi> Unity, but of likeness and simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: that Father and Son are One Substance, not as One Person is One with himself, but as Two Persons are One by a perfect likeness and similitude of Nature, which must be the true meaning of Consubstantial, if Consubstantiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and likeness of Nature be the same.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I observe farther, That the Catholick Fathers did not make the <hi>Homoousion</hi> the Rule of Faith, that whatever sense some critical Wits can put on it, must therefore be owned for the Catholick Faith; but they chose it as the most comprehensive word, to comprize the true Catholick
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50623:88"/>

From whence it appears, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> would have allowed those for Orthodox Christians (as I observed before St. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary</hi> did) who should confess the Eternal Generation of the Son, that there was no time before he was, and that he had no beginning of Being; that he is no Creature, nor of any other Substance, but only of the Father, and that he always was inseparably united to him, and one with him, though they should have boggled at those words, That the Son is <hi>of the Substance</hi> of the Father, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantial with him. But the true reason why the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers did so earnestly contend for these words, <hi>of the Substance of the Father,</hi> and <hi>Consubstantial,</hi> was because they found by experience, that no other words would hold the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereticks, who concealed their Poyson under any other form of words, though in appearance very Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox; as the Catholick Bishops found to their cost in the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> and upon several other occasions; which<note place="margin">

the Fountain and Rivers, which are not the same with each other, but have the same Nature.

                  <p>I shall only observe farther, That the Learned Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> takes this very way to prove that the <hi>Ante Nicene</hi> Fathers did own the Faith of the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> or that the Son is consubstantial to the Father, though we seldom meet with the word it self in their Writings; because they teach the same things which the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers intended by that word:<note place="margin">

When they affirm the Son of God is not only of the Father, but that he proceeds from, and is begotten of the Father. 2. That the Son is the True, Genuine, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Natural Son of God. 3. When they explain the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Son, by the Root and its Branches, the Sun and its Rays, the Fountain and River, which are of the same Nature, and therefore represent the Father and Son to be of the same Substance. 4. When they except the Son of God out of the number of Creatures, and deny him to be a Creature. 5. When they ascribe such things to the Son, as are proper and peculiar only to the True God. 6.

                  <p>This is the true Notion of the <hi>Homoousion</hi>; and now let any man judge, Whether a Consubstantial Trinity be a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Personal Characters, Relations, or Names, or of

Real, Substantial, Subsisting Persons. If we will allow ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, or the <hi>Arian</hi> Bishops to be well in their wits, can we think that there would have been any such Disputes between them, as whether the Son be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternal with the Father, or had a Beginning? whether there were any time, the least conceivable moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son was? whether he was made <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of nothing, as all other Creatures are, or begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Substance of the Father, and is the true, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, natural Son of God, or a Son only by Adoption? whether he be true perfect God, in opposition to the most perfect created Nature, or be only a made and Creature-God? whether he be Consubstantial with the Father, or have only a Nature like the Fathers, but not the same? and whether he be like his Father in all things, in Substance and Essence, or only in Will and Affection. I say, Could any men in their wits dispute such matters as these, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less both sides were agreed, that the Son is a Real, Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Son, as human Sons are, who are begotten of the Substance of their Parents; that he has a Subsistence of his own, distinct from his Father's Subsistence; that he has a Substance of his own, eternally begotten of his Father's Substance, and therefore the same, but proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to his own Person, which makes him the Son, and not the Father. For till these things are agreed, there is no foundation for the other Disputes; for if the Son have no real Subsistence of his own, who would dispute whether he began to subsist in time, or did subsist from all Eternity? If he have no Substance of his own, is it not ludicrous to dispute whether he be of the Father, that is, have his Substance of his Father's Substance, or be a new created Substance, as like his Father's Substance as a created Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance can be, but not the same? For if he have no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Substance of his own, neither of these can be true. To what purpose is it to dispute, whether he be a begotten
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50623:92"/>
or created God, if he be not as true and perfect a Person, and as true and perfect God (upon the Catholick Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis) in his own Person, as the Father himself is?</p>
                  <p>In short, to conclude this Argument, If the <hi>Homoousion</hi> signifies, that the Son of God, who is Consubstantial to his Father, is no Creature, was not made out of Nothing, had no Beginning of Being, is of his Father's Substance, begotten of his Substance from all Eternity, a true and perfect Son of a true and perfect Father, and upon all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the very same that the Father is, excepting that he is the Son and not the Father, it is impossible the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers should have been either <hi>Sabellians</hi> or <hi>Modalists.</hi>

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50623:94"/>
and in their peculiar Characters, yet that Divine Nature which subsists distinctly in each of them, has but one and the same Notion and Definition, and therefore is but one and the same in all. If this be not a specifick Sameness and Unity, all our Logicks deceive us: I'm sure the Unity of an <hi>Individuum</hi> or singular Nature was never thought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in a common Notion or Definition of its Nature; and yet this is the account which the Fathers unanimously give of the One common Divinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>No man who understands any thing of this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, can be ignorant of that famous Dispute <hi>de Ingenito &amp; Genito,</hi> concerning <hi>the Vnbegotten</hi> and <hi>the begotten Nature.</hi> By this Sophism the <hi>Arians</hi> endeavoured to prove, That the Son could not be <hi>Homoousios,</hi> consubstantial, or of the same Nature with the Father, because an Unbegotten Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be the same with a Begotten Nature.</p>
                  <p>Now had the Catholick Fathers believed the singularity of the Divine Nature in the modern Notion of it, this Objection had been unanswerable; for it is absolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that the same singular Nature should be both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and unbegotten, as much as it is that the same single Person should be both begotten and unbegotten. I desire to know, how any <hi>Sabellianist,</hi> who acknowledges but One singular solitary Substance of the Deity, would answer this Objection; I know no possible way they have, but to deny that the Divine Nature of the Son is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; that though the Son be begotten, his Divine Nature is not begotten, but only his Personality, or Mode of Subsistence, without a begotten subsisting Nature: And this, indeed, would effectually answer the Objection; for if there be not a begotten and unbegotten Nature, the foundation of the Objection is lost. And this is so obvious an Answer upon the Hypothesis of Singularity, that it is sufficient to satisfy any thinking man, that the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ibid. p. 734</note> He says, That the Substance of the Son was begotten, having no Being before its own proper subsistence, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten before all things by the Will of God. This was very craftily expressed, to insinuate that there was a time when the Substance of the Son did not exist; for it could not be before it was begotten, and had a proper subsistence of its own. St. <hi>Basil</hi> exposes this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry at large, and shews, that by the same Argument they might prove, that there was a time when the Father's Substance was not; for that could not be older than its own subsistence: But if the Father be Eternal, though his Substance could not be before its subsistence, so may the Son be also, by an Eternal generation and subsistence. But that which I would take notice of is, that St. <hi>Basil</hi> observes the vain Sophistry of this way of speaking, that when he durst not say that the Son was of nothing, or that there was a time when he was not, he insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates the same thing concerning the Substance of the Son,<note place="margin">

Now if the Son and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Son be the same, then if the Son is begotten, the Substance of the Son is begotten; if the Son be not the Father, the Substance of the Son is not the Substance of the Father. And yet all the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the ancient Fathers, not excepting St. <hi>Austin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, would not allow of any difference between the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

of the Father, and his Being, Essence, Substance, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, Nature, nor between the Person of the Son, and his Being, Subsistence, Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore the Son is as distinct from the Father in Nature, Being, Life, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as in Person and Subsistence.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed: There was no dispute between the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> and the <hi>Arians</hi> about the singularity of the Divine Substance, they both rejected that as <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted Father and Son to be as distinct in Nature and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as they are in Person; and therefore this Objection <hi>de ingenito &amp; genito,</hi> concerning the unbegotten and the begotten Nature, was intended not to prove a numerical distinction, (which it effectually does) but a specifick difference and diversity of Nature between Father and Son; that the Son is no more consubstantial to the Father, than to be unbegotten and to be begotten are the same. The whole Controversy turned upon this one Point, Whether <hi>unbegotten</hi> and <hi>begotten,</hi> were Names of Nature; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, whether to be unbegotten, and to be begotten, made a specifick difference of Natures. This the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Fathers unanimously denied; and not to take notice of all they say on this Argument, there is one Answer which they all give, very observable to my present purpose, and that is this: That to be unbegotten or begotten, makes no specifick difference in created Natures, and therefore there is no reason to say that it makes any such diversity in the Divine Nature; and they all give the Example of <hi>Adam, Seth,</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> who all had the same human Nature;<note place="margin">

Existence, or coming into Being, and there is no imaginable reason why the same specifick Nature considered in its Individuals, may not have very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Beginnings, without any alteration of Nature. Nay, as <hi>Damascen</hi> observes,<note place="margin">

This is so plain and express, that I need add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to shew how this overthrows the Opinion of Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, and owns a Specifick Unity and Sameness of the Divine Nature: That though the Father be unbegotten, and the Son begotten, yet they are Consubstantial, or of the same Nature; not with the Sameness of Singularity, which is impossible, but with such a Sameness of Nature as is between two of the same kind and <hi>species,</hi> as the Example of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> proves.

                  <p>BUT yet after all this, the Catholick Fathers did not allow the Divine Nature in a strict and proper Notion to be a <hi>species,</hi> which is only a notional and logical Unity and Sameness of Nature; for the Divine Nature, which is perfect Essence, is not logically, but essentially One, though it subsists distinctly in Three Persons, and this was the Faith of the Catholick Fathers.

Can the Specifick Notional Unity of Human Nature, make three men one man, as the One common Divine Nature makes Three Persons One God?

And thus the Son must be begotten, if he be

                  <p>This Eternal Generation of the Son is a great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable Mystery, and has always been owned to be so by the Catholick Church; we have no Notion or Idea of it, but no more have we of the Eternal Existence of the Divine Nature it self, without any Cause or Beginning, or of the Creation of all things out of nothing, or of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Production and Propagation of Created Beings; our present Inquiry is not concerning the Mystery of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation, but concerning the Unity of the Divine Nature in Father and Son, in what sense they are <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>of the same Substance,</hi> and that the Eternal Generation gives an account of: For if the Father communicate his whole Nature and Substance to the Son, without division and separation (which is the Catholick Faith) the Son must of necessity have the same one Substance with the Father; for a whole same of a whole same, cannot be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore must be the same One Substance, whole of whole.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> reasons very subtilly against the <hi>Arians</hi> upon this Point: They taught that the Son was <gap reason="foreign">

Other Creatures are the Sons of God by the participation of the Holy Spirit; but the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is given by the Son, not the Son, as the Eternal Son of God, sanctified by the Spirit; for the Spirit receives all from Father and Son, not the Son from the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>He must then partake of the Father: But what is that, and whence is it?<note place="margin">

is essential to the very Notion of a Birth, which cannot be conceived without it; and therefore we must not wholly reject all Prolation and Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Son from the Father, but only reject all Corporeal Emanations, which are very imperfect Images of Divine Mysteries, and have nothing like the eternal generation of the Son, but only that the Son is truly begotten of his Father's Substance.</p>
                  <p>This is that adorable and unsearchable Mystery of the Divine Generation: The Son is truly and properly begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, receives his whole Being and Nature from his Father, is substance of his Father's substance, whole of whole, and therefore one and the same substance with the Father; not that substance, which is the Person of the Father, nor a new or another separate substance, as it is in human generations, but the nature and substance of the Father, born and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in the Nativity of the Son, as St. <hi>Hilary</hi> speaks:<note place="margin">

It will be of great use briefly to consider this matter; for the difficulty consists more in want of words to express this Unity and Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by, than in the Notion it self.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>singularity</hi> of the Divine Essence and Substance in the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Notion of One Substance, the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers universally rejected, as irreconcilable with a real distinction of Persons, which destroys the Faith of a Real Trinity. A mere specifick Unity of Nature and Substance, which is a meer Logical Notion, falls short of the Natural and Essential Unity of the Godhead; and yet we have no word to serve as a middle Term between the Unity of singularity, and a Specifick Unity of Nature. For there is no such Unity as this in Created Nature, and therefore no name for it; and yet the Unity of the Divine Nature in a Trinity of Persons, is neither of these, but bears some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance and Analogy to both. As to shew this briefly. The Unity of the Divine Nature is not a meer Specifick Unity. A Species is only an Idea, or Pattern of Nature, according to which particular Creatures are formed; and such Creatures as are made according to the same Pattern, are specifically the same; and as far as we can observe this Correspondence and Ideal Sameness of Nature, so we rank them under the same Species. So that there can be no Species but among created Beings; for they must be all made, and made according to the same Original Pattern. But an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Necessary Nature was not made, and therefore not made according to any Pattern, nor can any other be made according to its Pattern; for what is made cannot be Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and Eternal. So that the Divine Nature can be but One, and One Numerical Nature is no Species; it can communicate its own Substance by an Eternal Generation and Procession, but it can't be a Pattern and Idea for any other Beings of the same kind, which are not its own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>

                  <p>But then there is something in the Divine Nature, as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially communicated to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, which bears some analogy to a <hi>Species,</hi> and to a Specifick Unity; and for this reason the Catholick Fathers in their Disputes both with the <hi>Sabellians</hi> and <hi>Arians,</hi> frequently express the Unity of the Nature, as subsisting in Three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Persons, by a Specifick Unity.</p>
                  <p>The Notion and Idea of a Common Nature, which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in many Individuals, is called a <hi>Species;</hi> the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notion and definition belonging to all the Individuals of the same kind: Now if we believe the Doctrine of a Real Trinity, we must acknowledge, That the same One Divine Nature, which is originally in the Father, is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Son and Holy Spirit, and does subsist distinctly and substantially in all Three; and therefore has this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance

to a <hi>Species,</hi> that it is a common Nature, which has the same Notion and Definition, and is the same in Three, but not meerly by a Notional Identity and Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but by the Real Identity of Substance; there being but One Divine Substance, unmade, uncreated, unbegot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but communicated whole and entire to the Son by an eternal generation, and to the Holy Spirit by an eternal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession: so that the Divine Nature is so far a <hi>Species,</hi> as by its actual communication to the Son and Holy Spirit, and its distinct subsistence in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, it is in truth and reality a common Nature and Substance, which a <hi>Species</hi> is only in Notion and Idea. The Notion and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of human Nature in <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> is the very same, and therefore there is a specifick Sameness and Unity of Nature between them. The Divine Nature in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is the same, not merely in Notion and Idea, but Substantially the same; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the names of a Specifick Sameness and Unity, do in a more perfect and excellent manner belong to the Sameness and Unity of the Divine Nature, as Subsisting Perfectly, Indivisibly, and yet Distinctly, in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: And when we speak of the Sameness of the Divine Nature, as subsisting distinctly in Three Divine Persons, we have no other words to express it by, but such as signify a Specifick Unity; and we must use such words as we have, and qualifie their sense as well as we can.</p>

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50623:106"/>
into a great mistake, as if they meant no more by it but a specifick Sameness, and Unity of the Divine Nature; that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost have one Substance no otherwise, than as <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> have one and the same Humane Nature: For the Divine Nature is not One merely <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>For the same reason it is very difficult what Three to call Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, so as to avoid the Heresies of both Extreams; for there is no Example of such Three in Nature: They are certainly Three, for the Father is not the Son, nor the Holy Ghost, nor the Son the Father, or the Holy Ghost, and each of the Three is perfect God, and therefore an Infinite Mind, an Infinite Spirit, and the most Perfect Essence and Substance: And that Substance which is the Person of the Son, is not that Substance which is the Person of the Father, no more than the Person of the Son is the Person of the Father, or an unbegotten is a begotten Nature and Substance; and therefore in opposition to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellius,</hi> they asserted Three Substantial Persons, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, Three Hypostases, or Personal Substances, as <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasis</hi> signifies; <hi>tria in substantia, tres substantias, tres res,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and yet at the same time did assert, That there is but One Divine Nature and Substance, which indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibly and inseparably, though distinctly, subsists in all Three.</p>
                  <p>For the understanding of which we must observe, That as the Divine Nature, which is common to Three, is not a mere Species, but is really and actually One and the same in all; so these Three Divine Persons, which have one and the same common Nature, are not in a strict and proper no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Individuals of the same common Nature: Though we
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50623:106"/>
have no Names for these Three, but such as signify Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, as Persons, Hypostases, Subsistences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there being no Created Person, Hypostasis, or Subsistence, but what is an Individual.</p>
                  <p>To shew you the difference, with respect to the notion of an Individual, between the Three Divine Persons, and three individual Humane Persons, I observe, That every Humane Person is such an Individual as has a particular Humane Nature of his own, which is not the particular Nature of any other Person; the notion and definition of Humane Nature is the same in all men; but the same Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Humane Nature does not subsist in all, but every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular individual man has one particular individual Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature appropriated to himself, that is, which is his particular Person; and as many particular Persons as there are, so many particular Humane Natures, and particular men there are.</p>
                  <p>But now the Divine Persons are not Three such Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals as these; because they have not three individual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Natures, but the same One Divine Nature common to them all, originally in the Father, and communicated whole and entire to the Son by an Eternal Generation, and from Father and Son to the Holy Spirit by an Eternal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</p>
                  <p>How impossible soever it is, for our finite Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to comprehend these Mysteries of the eternal Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Procession, it is not so hard to conceive the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Three Persons who have One individual Nature common to them all, but subsisting so distinctly in each of them, as to make them Three distinct Persons; and Three Persons who have Three Individual Natures of the same Kind and Species.</p>
                  <p>As for Instance; Three Human Persons, which have Three individual Human Natures, are by the confession of all Mankind Three Men: But could we conceive One in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50623:107"/>
Human Nature, which originally constitutes but One Person, to Communicate it self Whole and Entire, without Division or Separation to Two other Persons, we must acknowledge Three Human Persons, each of which Persons is distinctly and by himself, True and Perfect Man, but not Three Men; for Man is a name of Nature, and if Persons can be multiplied without multiplying the Nature, (as we at present suppose) there must be Three Human Persons in One individual Human Nature, that is, Three Persons and One Man; but not Three Men, no more than Three Human Natures.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is with respect to the Divine Nature: Were there Three individual Divine Natures Self-originated and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on each other, though perfectly the same in their Notion and Definition; Three such Persons would be as Perfectly Three Gods, as Three Human Persons, that have Three individual Human Natures, are Three Men. But whereas the Scripture teaches, and the Catholick Church has always believed, there is but One Infinite, Self-originated, Divine Nature, Originally in the Father, and by Communication in the Son, and Holy Spirit; these Three Divine Persons are each of them True and Perfect God, but not Three Gods; because they have not Three Individual Divine Natures, but One Divine Nature subsisting distinctly, but Whole and Perfect in them all.</p>
                  <p>This, I think, may give us some Notion of One Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Common Nature, which is no Species, and of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which are no Individuals. St. <hi>Austin</hi> shews particularly,<note place="margin">

                     </note> how impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per it is to call the One Divine Essence a <hi>Genus,</hi> and the Three Divine Persons <hi>Species</hi>; or to call the Divine Essence a Species, and the Divine Persons Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals; for in both these cases we must multiply the name of Essence with the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50623:107"/>
                     <hi>Species</hi> and Individuals, as we not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say three Horses, but three Animals; and as <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> are three Individuals, so they are three Men; in consequence of which, we must not only say Three Divine Persons, but Three Divine Essences, not One Essence. But besides this, <hi>One Essence</hi> can't be a <hi>Genus,</hi> because what is but <hi>One</hi> can have no <hi>Species:</hi> nor can it for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be a <hi>Species,</hi> because what is One can't be subdivided into Individuals, as though <hi>Man,</hi> considered as a <hi>Species,</hi> is divided into <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> yet One Man can't be subdivided into Three Men; for One Man is One single Man. Why then do we say, <hi>One Essence, and Three Substances or Persons;</hi> (which are St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s words, who always ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the <hi>Greek</hi> Hypostases by <hi>Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and makes <hi>Substances</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> equivalent) for if <hi>Essence</hi> be a <hi>Species,</hi> as <hi>Man</hi> is, there can be but One Essence in the Sense and Notion of One Man: which, by the way, he objects as a great Absurdity, for it is the <hi>Sabellian</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy.</p>
                  <p>Thus far St. <hi>Austin</hi> was certainly in the right; but here I think, with all submission, this great Man missed the true Notion which he had so happily started. One Essence can't be a <hi>Species,</hi> because what is but One, can have no proper Individuals under it, as One Man can't be subdivided into Three Men: But then he might have applied <hi>Individual</hi> to <hi>Essence,</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:50623:108"/>
which <hi>One Essence</hi> naturally led to; and have found Three Persons in <hi>One Individual Essence,</hi> which would not indeed be Three Individuals of One <hi>Species,</hi> but Three Singulars of One Individual Nature. And though <hi>One Man,</hi> who is but One Individual of Human Nature, can't be subdivided into Three proper Individuals, yet to conceive One Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Human Nature to be communicated whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, without division or separation to Two others, is the truest Image of Three distinct Persons in One Individual Essence, and the only possible Explication of <hi>totus ex toto,</hi> whole of whole, which is the true Catholick Faith. Such an <hi>One Essence</hi> is no <hi>Species,</hi> but yet is a common Nature; and such Persons are not what we call Individuals, as not having each of them a particular individual Nature to himself, but yet they have a particular singular Subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as other Individuals have, and are each of them by himself as true and perfect God, though all but One God, as every individual Man is true and perfect Man.</p>
                  <p>It seems plain to me, that this is the very Notion St. <hi>Austin</hi> intended, in what he immediately adds, the <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis eademque materia,</hi> that One common Matter which he prefers before either a generical or specifick Unity. That the same One Divine Essence is common to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; not as if Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, had their Subsistence out of the same common Essence, as three golden Statues are made of the same Gold; this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Exposition of the <hi>Homoousion</hi> was rejected with abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence by the Catholick Fathers, as I shewed before; and St. <hi>Austin</hi> expresly rejects it here, and therefore though these Three Persons are One Essence, <hi>una essentia &amp; unius essentiae,</hi> he will not allow us to say, that they are <hi>ex una essentia,</hi> out of One Essence, as golden Statues are of, or cut out of the same Gold; nay, nor as Three Men are of the same Nature, that is, which is specifically, not identical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the same, as I observed a little above. Now remove
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50623:108"/>
these two Notions of One common Essence, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains only a third, which is that very Notion I now insist on, One and the same Essence common to Three, by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect communication of the same One whole undivided Essence.</p>
                  <p>And this answers exactly to that Notion of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> which he could find no Image of in Nature; that the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is not more or greater all together,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Non enim major essentia est pater &amp; filius &amp; spiritus sanctus simul, quam solus pater out solus filius; sed tres simul illae substantiae sive perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae, si ita dicendae sunt, aequales sunt singules, quod animalis homo non per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit.</hi> Ibid.</note> than the Father alone, or the Son alone: but these Three Substances or Persons, if they may be so called, all together are equal to each single Person, which a carnal Man cannot apprehend. But now if we believe a whole of a whole, we must confess that it is impossible it should be otherwise; for if the Son have the same whole Essence with the Father, if the Father be the whole Divine Essence, if the Son be the same whole Divine Essence, and so the Holy Ghost; the same whole, though subsisting distinctly in Three, can never be greater nor less than it self: Three Persons are more in number than One, but One and the same whole undivided Essence can be but one whole.</p>
                  <p>This is the true Notion (and there can be no other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Sense made of it) of what the Fathers so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally teach, That there is in the Trinity <hi>Vna Substantia,</hi> but not <hi>unus subsistens,</hi> One Substance, but not one only who subsists; when yet at the same time they as universally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, That the Father is Substance, the Son Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the Holy Ghost Substance; and neither of them each other: That the Person of the Father is the Essence and Substance of the Father, the Person of the Son the Substance of the Son; that the Person is not one thing, and the Essence and Substance another, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> upon all occasions teaches: Now that there should be but One
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50623:109"/>
Substance, and Three substantial Subsisting Persons, can never be reconciled any other way, than by the perfect Communication of the same whole undivided Essence and Substance of the Father to the Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>For the same reason they tells us, That the Father is Wisdom, the Son Wisdom of Wisdom, and yet but One Wisdom; the Father is Spirit, the Son Spirit, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost Spirit, and yet not Three Spirits, but One Spirit; and the Father is God, the Son God, the Holy Ghost God, yet there are not Three Gods, but One God: For <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>In this Sense we are so often told, That in the Trinity there is <hi>alius &amp; alius,</hi> another and another, that is, distinct Subsisting Persons, who are not each other, but not <hi>aliud</hi> in the Neuter Gender; not another Essence or Nature, not only not specifically another, as the <hi>Arians</hi> asserted, but not another Nature, though of the same <hi>Species,</hi> but the same One Individual Nature communicated whole and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided to more than One.</p>
                  <p>Upon the same account, the <hi>Father</hi> is acknowledged by all Catholick Writers to be the <hi>One only God,</hi> and they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Objection of <hi>Tritheism,</hi> by this very Principle, That they own but One Eternal, Self-originated, Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Father, and therefore but One God; They grant, That Three Fathers would be Three Gods; but when there
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50623:109"/>
is but One Eternal Father, though he have an Eternal Son, and an Eternal Spirit, there can be but One God.</p>
                  <p>Now what is the meaning of this? Is it because none is, or can be God, True and Perfect God, but he, who is God of himself, Self-originated and Unbegotten? This would destroy the Perfect Godhead of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and answer the Objection of Tritheism by denying the Trinity.

                  <p>The natural Notion of God is an Eternal, Unmade, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created Essence, which gives being to all Creatures; but neither Begotten, nor Unbegotten, belongs to the natural Notion of God, but is matter of pure Revelation; and therefore Three that are Eternal, as to the natural Notion of God, are as much Three Gods, as Three that are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begotten.</p>

                  <p>Now such a singularity as this, as admits of a real and substantial Communication of the Divine Nature, whole of whole, to the Son and Holy Spirit, is certainly the Doctrine of the Catholick Fathers, and what they meant by the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>That there must be this Sameness and Identy of Nature in all Three Divine Persons, is evident from the last Section; for a whole of a whole, must be identically the same Whole; not so the same, as one singular Whole is the same with it self, but as the same Whole, which thrice sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists, without the least conceivable difference, is the same with it self in Three.

And I dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to any man who is competently skill'd in these Matters, and will impartially examine the Testimonies <hi>Petavius</hi> has produced for the Singularity of the Divine Essence, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the most pertinent of them all prove any more than this, That the Nature of the Father, without the least al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration or diversity, is communicated whole and perfect, without any division or separation of Substance, to the Son, (of which more presently); not that the same singular Nature and Substance which is the Person of the Father, is also the Person of the Son; which makes the Father and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50623:112"/>
Son to be but One Person, as well as One Nature and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; but so One, that the One Nature, Substance, and Divinity, which is the Father, is wholly and perfectly the same in the Son, excepting this, That one is the Father, and the other the Son: Which is not the Unity of Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is properly the Unity of a Person; but the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Identity and Sameness, which is the Unity of One Individual Nature, which is common to more than one. I don't intend to transcribe all the Quotations of <hi>Petavius,</hi> which he has alledged to this purpose; but yet I will give such a general View of them, as may satisfy any impartial Reader as to this Point; not to confute <hi>Petavius,</hi> who, as I have already observed, rejects the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Singularity; but to undeceive those who mistake <hi>Petavius</hi> and the Schools too, as will appear more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>I shall only premise, That it had become the Learning and Acuteness of <hi>Petavius</hi> to have reconciled the Fathers with themselves; for they were Wise Men, and true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, and knew very well what a Contradiction meant; and therefore we ought not easily to believe that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually contradicted themselves.</p>
                  <p>He acknowledges and proves, That the Catholick Fathers did teach a Specifick Unity of the Divine Nature;<note place="margin">

Nature. <hi>Petavius</hi> was very sensible how inconsistent these two kinds of Unity are; and yet that the Fathers did most commonly explain the Unity of the Divine Nature by a Specifick Unity, and did more cautiously mention the Unity of Singularity; he might have said, did absolutely reject it, as St. <hi>Hilary</hi> does in a hundred places. And was not this a much better reason, so to qualify the Notions of a Specifick Unity and Singularity of Nature, as to reconcile them to each other, than to make the Fathers contradict themselves; which destroys three parts of their Reasoning about the Unity of the Godhead, and very much weakens the Authoity of all the rest?</p>

the Divine Unity: But if there be nothing in the Divine Nature, which is analogous to this Specifick Unity, and may be truly and properly represented by it, as the best Image we have in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I cannot understand either the Prudence or Honesty of this. Yes, he says, they were to take Care so to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Arianism</hi> as to avoid <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> which otherwise they might easily slip into: And therefore so tempered their Style as to speak more sparingly of that highest Unity and Conjunction, which <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> calls a <hi>Perfect Monad,</hi> lest they should seem to favour a <hi>Sabellian</hi> Solitude and Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but did more freely use the Examples of a Specifick Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which was sufficient to confute the <hi>Arians</hi>; who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted the Diversity and Dissimilitude of Nature between Father and Son, which cannot be between those of the same Kind and Species; and yet at the same time shewed how far they were from <hi>Sabellianism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this is a very false account of the matter appears from the former Sections of this Chapter, and will appear more fully from what is to follow; but if it were true, it would be a very scandalous account; for the sum of it is this, That to oppose <hi>Sabellianism</hi> and <hi>Arianism,</hi> the ancient Fathers advanced a false Notion of the Divine Unity, and dissembled the true one: Which is no great commendation of the Catholick Faith, that it needs such Arts, nor of the Catholick Fathers to use them; when both these sorts of Hereticks, as I have often observed, charged the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith with Tritheism, and made that the very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their Heresies. Can any man think it prudent in these Fathers to conceal or very cautiously mention the true Notion of the Divine Unity, and to insist on a Specifick
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50623:113"/>
Unity, which, if we believe <hi>Petavius,</hi> is no better than Tritheism; which would rather have confirmed them in their Heresies than have confuted them?</p>
                  <p>These two Heresies being in two extreams, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith must be in the middle, and the only true Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um between them, is a real distinction of Persons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least diversity of Nature; and this is what they meant both by their Monad, and Specifick Unity, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Sameness and Identity of Essence, actually, indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, inseparably subsisting in Three, a thrice subsisting Monad, or Individual Essence or Substance, but not one Singular and Solitary Substance.

                  <p>But the same Father starts an Objection; That since the wisest Philosophers owned but One Divinity in all their Gods, as we acknowledge but One Humanity in all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and yet they believed Many Gods, as we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, there are Many Men, though but One Common Humanity: Why must not we confess, That Father, Son and Holy Ghost are Three Gods also, though they have but One Common Divinity? This <hi>Petavius</hi> says, <hi>Causoe jugulum petit</hi>; and it is indeed an unanswerable Objection against a meer Specifick Unity of Nature, which is Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in Individuals, and therefore must Multiply Gods as well as Men; but the Perfect Communication of the Same Whole Individual Nature does not Multiply Natures or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinities, though it Multiplies Persons. And this is the

That there is not One Common Subsisting Human Nature in all Men, and therefore Human Nature is One, only in Notion, not in Reality, every Particular Man's hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Particular Human Nature of his own; and therefore there are as many Men, as there are Subsisting Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but the Divine Nature is One and Common, not in meer Notion and Idea, but by an Actual Communication without Division or Separation: This proves it to be One Individual, but not a Singular Nature; for it is <gap reason="foreign">

meant by this <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, Sameness and Identity of Nature. 2. How they proved the Unity of the Godhead from this Sameness of Nature. 3. How they distinguish'd the Divine Persons in this Sameness of Nature.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for the first, That the Fathers by this Sameness and Identity of Nature did not mean One singular, solitary, Personal Nature, is abundantly evident from what I have already discours'd: The Fathers, in opposition to <hi>Sabellius,</hi> universally rejected One singular, solitary Nature and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as destroying a Trinity of Real Persons; for in their Philosophy, One singular Substance is but One Person; and therefore Three Persons, each of which is by himself True and Perfect Substance, can't be One singular Substance; which is Proof enough, that when they explain the Unity of the Divine Substance by its Sameness and Identity, they could not by this Sameness and Identity mean Singularity; but such a Sameness as is between Real, Distinct, Subsisting, Substantial Persons, who are every way alike, without the least Change or Variation: Which the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers commonly call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; the <hi>Latin</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as St. <hi>Hilary</hi> especially, <hi>Indifferens &amp; Indissimilis Natura.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this is the True Notion of this Sameness and Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Nature appears from those Representations which the Catholick Fathers make of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is such a Sameness and Identity, as there is between a Perfect, Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Subsisting Word, and that Perfect Mind, whose Word it is; such a Sameness as is between Father and Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prototype and the Image, between the Seal and the Impression; between Life of Life, Wisdom of Wisdom, Power of Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither of which is the other, and yet both are the same.</p>
                  <p>That God hath an Eternal Word, which was in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, was with God, and was God; that this Eternal Word was the Son of God, and this Son the Perfect Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50623:116"/>
and Image of his Father, the Brightness of his Glory, and the Express Character of his Substance, is the known Doctrine of the Scripture and Fathers.</p>
                  <p>That this Word is not like the Word of a Man, but the Substantial, Essential, Living, Subsisting, Omnipotent Word; and this Son a True, Natural, Genuine Son, and this Image a Substantial, Living Image, and a Living, Substantial Character of the Father; that this Word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a Distinct Person from him, whose Word he is; that the Son is not the Father, nor the Father the Son, but that they are <hi>alius &amp; alius</hi>; that the Image is not the Prototype, nor the Prototype the Image, nor the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Impression, that whose Character it is; I have already proved to be the Received Doctrine of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Fathers against the <hi>Sabellians,</hi> and were there any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for it, I could confirm it with innumerable Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: The only Question then is, What this Sameness and Identity of Nature is. And if we will allow for that difference there is between God and Creatures, we may learn, as the Fathers teach us, what this Sameness of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture between the Divine Persons is, from the Sameness and Identity between a Mind and its Word, between Father and Son, between the Prototype and the Image, the Seal and its Character and Impression.</p>
                  <p>Now what this Sameness and Identity is, is so visible, that a few words will explain it.</p>
                  <p>It is not the Sameness of Singularity; for the Mind and its Word, a Father and Son, the Prototype and its Image, the Seal and its Impression, are visibly Two: Nor is it the Sameness of meer Likeness and Similitude, how Exact and Perfect soever we conceive that Likeness to be; for every one must confess, that there is a vast difference between the Perfect Likeness of Two Minds, Two Men, Two Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and Two Seals, and that Sameness, which is between a Mind and its own Word, a Father and his own Son, a
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50623:116"/>
Prototype and its own Natural Image, and the Seal and the Impression which is made by it; just as much difference as there is between Similitude and Nature, or between a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Likeness of Nature and Identity.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the complete and adequate Notion of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>meness and Identity between Two, who are really distinct in Subsistence and Personality, and are not each other, must be this, That an Eternal Unproduced Person produces another in his own Nature, Whole, Perfect, Entire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least Conceivable or Possible Difference or Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity; excepting this, That One Produces, and the Other is Produced: For Two such, who distinctly subsist, are really Two Persons in One and the Same Individual Nature.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is with a Perfect Mind and its Perfect Living, Subsisting Word, which is perfectly it self, as its own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, Natural Image; Two in Number, but One <hi>in Re,</hi> in Nature. Thus it is with a Father and such a Son, as is Whole of Whole, they are Two and the Same, the Son the Natural Living Image of the Father, in whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sees Himself, and is seen in Him, as Christ tells us, <hi>He that hath seen me hath seen the Father:</hi> Which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the common Forms of Speech, to call the King's Picture or Image, the King, as the Catholick Writers fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently observe; which would be exactly and philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally true, were it a Perfect, Natural, Living, Insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Image: And this is what the Catholick Fathers call <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the Sameness or Identity of Nature; as might easily be proved by numerous Citations: But I will content my self with a few.</p>

There is One God, because a Father; but the Son also is One God, not Two Gods, because of the Sameness and Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Son with the Father; for there is not One Divinity in the Father, and Another in the Son; nor One Nature of the Father, and another of the Son.

And therefore Substance is the same with Glory, and Character with Brightness: So that the Divine Glory remaining perfect and undiminished, emits a perfect Splendor and Brightness: And thus the very Nature of an Image expounded as it becomes God, confirms the Faith of One Divinity. For the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in the Son, and the Son in the Father; because such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such as the Son is, such is the Father: And thus Two are One, because the Son in nothing differs, as receiving no other Form or Character, but that of his Father.

                     </note> and therefore I shall only refer my Readers to some
few Quotations in the Margin.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be denied, but that all the Fathers unanimously agree in this Account of the Unity of the Divine Nature in Three Distinct Persons: Which should make modest
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50623:120"/>
men very cautious of charging it with a direct Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to all Reason and Philosophy: But Modesty and Reverence to the Catholick Fathers, are none of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Virtues of this Age.</p>
                  <p>But is it indeed such a Contradiction to say, That the same Nature, which is perfectly and in every thing the same in Three, is but One Nature in Three, and that such Three have not Three Natures, but One Nature? Is it such a direct Contradiction to Sense and Reason, to say, That there is <hi>alius, &amp; alius, &amp; alius,</hi> in the Trinity, but not <hi>aliud?</hi> That there is Another, and Another, and Another Person in the Holy Trinity; but that there is nothing in any One of these Persons, which can be called Another thing from what is in the other Two? This is so far from a Contradiction, that it seems plain Sense, nay, plain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration to me, That Three Persons who have nothing in themselves but what each of them have, without the least conceivable Variation, are in Nature but one and the same; and though each of them be Another Person, yet not Another Thing, or Another Nature.</p>
                  <p>There are several Examples in Nature which justify this distinction between <hi>alius &amp; aliud,</hi> and must make all think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men confess that they cannot speak properly without it. I would not be mistaken in this matter, and therefore desire the Reader carefully to observe, That I do not alledge these Instances which follow, as Resemblances of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but only as Examples of a perfect Sameness and Unity in Nature; where we must confess, That the thing is but One and the same, and yet that there is Another and Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And if there be any Images of this in Nature, there is no reason to call this a Contradiction in the Faith of the Trinity.</p>
                  <p>Let me then ask this plain Question: When Five hundred Men hear the same Man speak, do they all hear one and the same Voice, or Five hundred Voices? It will, I think, be
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50623:121"/>
granted, that it is but one and the same Voice which they all hear, and yet it is heard five hundred times, and is distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in five hundred Ears: The Voice is essentially one and the same in all, and yet no man dares deny that the Voice in <hi>Peter's</hi> Ear is another from that Voice which is in <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Ear; and therefore is Another and Another, but not Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thing: And were a Voice Essence and Substance, there would be One Nature, Essence, and Substance, in a Plurality of <hi>Hypostases.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Sight furnishes us with as many Examples of this as Hearing: When five hundred Men see the same thing, the Object is one and the same, and yet is Another and Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the number of the Persons who see it: Is one and the same in Nature, and subsists the same, and yet distinctly in each eye.</p>
                  <p>Sight and Hearing approach nearest to an Incorporeal Nature, and therefore give us the nearest Resemblances of a Spiritual Sameness, Unity, and Distinction: But we have still more perfect Images of this, in what is more perfectly Spiritual.</p>
                  <p>The same Notion and Idea, though it subsist in Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Minds, is perfectly the same in all. A perfect true Idea of any thing, is and can be but One; and therefore how many Minds soever it subsist in, it must be one and the same in all; but yet the Idea in the Mind of <hi>Peter</hi> is not the same in Subsistence with the Idea in the Mind of <hi>Paul:</hi> It is Another and Another, and yet the same Idea in Nature and Essence: As suppose the perfect Idea of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, or Human Nature, and the perfect Idea of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature; if they be true and perfect, they are perfectly the same in all the Minds in the World; and nothing but the different Notions men have of things, can multiply such Ideas.</p>
                  <p>Now if we advance but one step higher, we shall plainly see what this Unity of Sameness is; what the true Notion
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50623:121"/>
of it is, and how far it reaches: For though this be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely essential to the Divine Unity, yet as I have already noted, and will appear more hereafter, this is not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and adequate Notion of it.</p>
                  <p>Let us suppose then that Human Nature, for instance, did subsist as perfectly the same in <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hn,</hi> as the true and perfect Idea of Human Nature is one and the same in all; that a Man were nothing else but the living subsisting Idea of Human Nature, without the least change or variation in Nature to distinguish one from another: I say, in such a Case as this, would not Three such Persons be perfectly one and the same, <gap reason="foreign">

Would not Human Nature be as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the same in Three Persons or Subsistences, as the Idea of Human Nature is one and the same in Three Minds? Or could we in proper speaking, with reference to this Sameness of Nature, any more say that there are Three Men, than that there are Three Humanities, when a Man is nothing else but the subsisting Idea of Humanity?

                  <p>This indeed is but an imaginary Case, as to Finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who never were, and never can be so perfectly One and the same, as their Idea is; but yet it is the properest and most sensible representation we can make of the Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Identity of the Divine Nature, which has really and actually all that Sameness and Identity which we only suppose in Creatures to help our Conceptions of the Divine
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50623:122"/>
Unity; how different Hypostases may be One in Nature by this Sameness and Identy of Nature.</p>
                  <p>The Divine Nature and Essence is more perfectly simple and uncompounded than any Notion and Idea which we can frame of it; and therefore must subsist as simply as the simplest Idea, and consequently must be as perfectly one and the same in all Three Persons of the Trinity, as the same Idea is one and the same with it self: And though this be not the whole notion of the Sameness and Identity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which requires not only two perfect Sames, but that one be of the other without division or Separation; yet this is essential to this Notion, and there can be no Identity of Nature without it: This is what the Catholick Fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in many Passages, which some Modern Writers have so miserably mistaken and misrepresented, as to charge those Wise men, and Learned Philosophers, with the most wild and absurd Conceits, and those great Advocates of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith with the worst of Heresies, even Tritheism it self. I can't do right to my Cause, without doing right to these great Lights of the Church, in giving a plain account of this matter.</p>
                  <p>And to explain what they meant by this Sameness and Identity of Nature, and to shew how groundless this Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Tritheism is, I shall begin with their natural Proof and Demonstration of the Unity of God against the Pagan Polytheism, which they unanimously resolve into <hi>this Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Identity of Nature.</hi> They prove, that there can be but One God, and One Divinity, because the Divine Nature is not capable of the least conceivable change and diversity, which is necessary to make a Number: For what is, and always must be the same with it self, cannot be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or a Second Nature; and One Divinity is but One God.</p>
                  <p>This they prove from all the Notions which we have of God, especially that comprehensive One of an Absolute and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50623:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Perfect Being; for Absolute Perfection is, and can be but One, without any possibility of change; for all change and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity must be either for the better or for the worse, and Absolute Perfection can admit of neither; and without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity and alterity there can be but One. An Infinite Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which nothing can distinguish from it self, can be but One; and could we imagine any thing to be added to, or taken from it, to make this distinction, it would destroy, not only its Unity, but its Infinity too; it would indeed make a Number, but not of absolute perfect Beings.</p>

                  <p>Well! But can't there be more than one of these Eternal, infinitely Wise, infinitely Good, and Omnipotent Natures? No: For if this Nature must of necessity be always the same, and is unmade and self-originated, it can be but one: For though in Created Natures several of the same kind may be made according to the same Pattern, there being nothing in the Idea of any Created Nature which hinders the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of its Individuals, yet a Nature which subsists of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50623:123"/>
it self; and is absolutely uncapable of any diversity, and consequently of number, can be but One; for a Self-sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting Nature must subsist according to its own Essential Idea, that is, according to its own Nature, and that is but One; for as far as we can judge of these Matters, what we cannot possibly conceive should ever be Two, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to be One.</p>
                  <p>But besides this, these Fathers observed, That if there were more than one Self-originated Divinity, or more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Natures than one, they must be divided and separated from each other; for if to the Sameness and Identity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you add an inseparable and indivisible Union too, it is impossible they should be more than One. And yet two or more such divided and separated Natures are inconsistent with the Notion of a Divine Nature and Essence, which is <gap reason="foreign">

to compleat the Notion and Definition of One Divinity. Thus it is certain <hi>Melanchton</hi> understood it, and therefore rejects the Definition which <hi>Plato</hi> gives of God, That he is an Eternal Mind, the Cause of all Good in the World; for though he owns it to be True and Learned, when rightly explained, yet he says it is defective, and must be supplied by the Gospel Revelation. <hi>That God is a Spiritual Intelligent Essence,</hi>

                  <p>So that the Holy and Ever Blessed Trinity is but One Eternal Coessential Divinity; that were there more Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than One, there must of necessity be more Trinities also, according to the Doctrine of these Fathers; which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough, that this Argument against a plurality of Divinities from the perfect Sameness and Identity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, which can't be multiplied, can't concern a Trinity of Real Subsisting Persons in the same One Eternal Undivided Divinity: For the same One Divinity is not multiplied by a Trinity of Persons Coeternal and Coessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; if this be the Nature and Unity of the Deity, to subsist whole and perfectly in Three, which was the constant Doctrine of the Fathers, and which this Argument don't oppose; nay so far from it, that it as evidently proves the Unity of the Godhead in a Trinity of Persons, as it confutes a Plurality of Godheads and Divinities; for if the Sameness and Identity of Nature will not admit of a Plurality of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then if Three are perfectly One and the same in Nature, they are but One Divinity, One God. Thus the Incircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptibility or Omnipresence of the Divine Nature is a good Argument against a Plurality of God's, or Divinities, which
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50623:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
must be separated, if they be more than One, and therefore circumscribed, or of a limited and confined presence; but it is no Argument against a Trinity of Persons in the Unity of Essence, which are all mutually in each other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore equally Unconfined and Omnipresent, and perfectly One by an Essential and Inseparable Union. And are not these Fathers now like to prove very notable Tritheites, who prove the impossibility, that there should be more Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than One, and the perfect Unity of the Godhead in a Trinity of Divine Persons, from that perfect Sameness and Identity of Nature which is between them?</p>
                  <p>But yet for all this Tritheites they are and must be, if they acknowledge Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to be One God, in no other sense than <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> are one Man; that is, because they agree in the same common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which has the same notion and definition, and is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account One and the same in all. This is what they are charged with, and I should not have wondred at it, had only some Careless and Unskilful Readers charged them with it, for they do say something which at first view may look like it; but then such Sayings as manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict their avowed Doctrine, not only in other places of their Writings, but in those very Places where these Sayings are found, ought in all Reason and Justice to be expounded only by way of Analogy and accommodation, as containing some imperfect Image and Resemblance of that, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has no proper and adequate Example of. This must be allowed in all the Natural Representations which are made by the Catholick Fathers of the Unity and Distinction of the Ever-blessed Trinity; or there is not one of them, but what literally and Philosophically applied, would furnish out some new Heresy: This I have already shewn in the Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Unity of the Divine Nature, which the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers did teach in a qualified Sense; though it appears from all I have said in the last, and this present Section, how far they
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50623:125"/>
were from thinking the Divine Nature to be a meer Species, or Logical Notion, though it has this resemblance to a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that it is One and Common, but not merely <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This was the Objection St. <hi>Gregory</hi> was to answer; and therefore his business was to prove, That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not, and ought not to be called Three Gods, as <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> are and may be called Three Men; and therefore he must prove, That they are neither Three nor One, in the same sense that Three Men are Three and One; for if they were, they would be as truly and properly Three Gods, as <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> are Three Men; and no more One God, than they are One Man; which had been to give up the Cause to the <hi>Arians,</hi> instead of answering their Objection.</p>

And can this have any other sense, than that the same Divine Nature makes Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but One God, as the same Human Nature makes all the Men in the World but one Man? The Interpretation of which seems to be, That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are as much Three Gods, as <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> are Three Men; but that it is very improper to call either the one or the other Three, for they are but <hi>One,</hi> by One Common Nature.</p>
                  <p>Now this Father does indeed say, and so many others of them say, That the name of Nature ought not to be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the Individuals; but he was far enough either from saying or thinking what he is charged with, That <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> are not Three Men, but One Man;
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50623:126"/>
or that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are One God in no other sense, but as Three Men are One: And a due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to the Series of the Argument, would have discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Falseness and Absurdity of this Imputation; which therefore I shall briefly explain.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arian</hi> Objection which St. <hi>Gregory</hi> undertook to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, as I observed before, was this; That since the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church owned the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to be consubstantial, and to have the same undiversified Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they must for that reason be Three Gods; as <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> upon account of the same common Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, are acknowledged to be Three Men: That is, that whether in God or Man, the same Nature in Three must make Three Individuals of the same Kind and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and therefore as the same Human Nature in Three makes Three Men, so the same Divine Nature Three Gods.</p>
                  <p>In answer to this, St. <hi>Gregory</hi> first observes, That it is not the same common Nature which distinguishes and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies Individuals, no, not in Men: <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> are not Three Individuals in the Species of Humanity, merely by having the same Nature (which is the force of the <hi>Arian</hi> Objection); for what is perfectly the same in all, can't distinguish or multiply them. And this is plainly all that he means, when he says, That the name of Nature ought not to be used plurally; and therefore <hi>Man</hi> being the name of Nature, and signifying the same with Humanity, we ought no more, if we speak properly and Philosophically, to say Three Men, than Three Humanities, or Three Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Natures; for he proves, that the name <hi>Man</hi> does not distinguish one Man from another, nor can we single any particular Man out of a Crowd by that Compellation; for there is but One Man,<note place="margin">

                  <p>This is not merely to criticize upon Words, or to dispute against the common Forms of Speech, but to give a true Philosophical Reason of their different Use, when applied to God and Creatures. We commonly call <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> Three Men, and right enough; but then they are not Three Men merely upon account of the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Humanity in them all, (which was the <hi>Arian</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection); for Humanity is but One in all, and what is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly One can't be numbred. To say there are Three Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manities, all Men grant to be absurd; and yet it is to the full as absurd, to say that <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> are Three Men, merely upon account of the same Humanity, strictly and precisely taken, as to say that there are Three Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities: So that though <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> could not be, nor be called Three Men, without the same Common Nature, yet some peculiar, distinguishing, diversifying Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties make them Three Men. Could Human Nature sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist as perfectly and indivisibly the same in Three, as the perfect Idea of Humanity, their Persons might be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, but their Nature would be as perfectly One, as the Idea of Humanity is one and the same in distinct Minds; and in this Case (as far as this perfect Sameness of Nature can make them one, which, as I have observed, is not the compleat Notion of the Divine Unity, though it be essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to it) they might be called Three Human Persons, but
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50623:127"/>
not Three Men: But such peculiar Properties as diversify and thereby distinguish the same common Nature into Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, make the Number: Which is one reason why we must not say Three Gods, as we do Three Men, though the same Divinity be common to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; because this same One Divinity subsists whole and perfect, without the least Change, Diversity, or Alteration in Three: That though their Persons are distinct, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity is perfectly One and the Same in All, and therefore they are but One God.</p>
                  <p>So that these Fathers do not insist on a mere Specifick Unity, but on the Sameness and Identity of the Divine Nature in Three, as the reason why we must not say that there are Three Gods; for the same One undiversified Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity can be but One God. And therefore having answered that Popular Objection, That <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> are allowed to be called Three Men, upon account of the same common Nature, by shewing that it is a great Popular Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, that merely the same One Common Nature makes them Three Men, or will justify their being called so; this Father proceeds to shew, That there is such an Unity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as is not, and cannot be between any Three Creatures, though they partake of the same Common Nature: Such an Unity as makes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost, essentially One God, though <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> are Three Men. Nay, such an Unity, as even a perfect Sameness and Identity of Nature cannot make between Creatures who have an absolute and separate Subsistence.</p>
                  <p>This gives a reasonable Account of this whole Argument, and vindicates it from those Absurdities which are charged on it. It was necessary to lay the Foundation of the Divine Unity in the perfect and invariable Sameness and Identity of Nature: For if the Divine Nature in Three is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the same, it cannot be One; for Diversity and Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50623:128"/>
makes a Number: But if it subsist as perfectly the same in Three, as its Idea is the same, it must be as perfectly one as its Idea is one. No, say these <hi>Arians,</hi> the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture subsisting in Three, becomes Three Individual Natures of the same Species; and the name of Nature must be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied with the Individuals, as all allow it must be as to Men, who partake of the same Common Nature: For <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> are acknowledged to be Three Men, though they have but one common Humanity; and by the same reason, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, must be Three Gods, if they have the same common Divinity.</p>
                  <p>To which St. <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> answers, That it is not the common Humanity which makes them Three Men; for that which is but one and the same in all, can't distinguish or multiply them; and therefore in strict and accurate speaking, as <hi>Man</hi> signifies pure and abstracted Humanity, we cannot properly say Three Men, because there are not Three Humanities; and accordingly, the name <hi>Man</hi> does not and cannot distinguish one Man from another, nor is ever used to that purpose; but that which multiplies Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the name of Nature, are those peculiar Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which distinguish and diversify Nature, as well as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and thus the common Nature, with diversifying Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is distinguish'd and multiplied by a kind of Composition; for the same Nature with one peculiar diversifying Property, is distinguish'd from the same Nature with other Properties; and thus the same Nature divided and distinguish'd with these Properties, makes a Number, and gives the name of Nature to each Individual Person, and thus it is in all Creatures: But where the same Nature subsists in Three, without any thing to distinguish or diversify Nature, as it is in the Blessed Trinity, though the Persons may be distinguish'd, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the name of Nature can be but One: Which is the reason why Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are but One
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50623:128"/>
God, because they have but One undistinguish'd, undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versified Nature, though their Persons are distinct.</p>
                  <p>This is the true Account of this Matter; which is so far from such a mere Specifick Unity of Nature as is between Three Men, that it is that very Sameness and Identity of Nature, which the Catholick Fathers make essential to the Unity of the Godhead.</p>
                  <p>And the better to understand this, we must consider their Philosophy about Numbers; for according to them, nothing properly but Alterity and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity makes a Number:<note place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Boetius</hi> has given the best Account of this, according to the Philosophy of the Ancients, by distinguishing between Numbers; for he says, Number is twofold, that by which we number, and that which is in the things numbred: As

to the first, the repetition of Units makes a Number, for One, and One, and One, are Three; and both the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Fathers and Schools reject this kind of Number, which is a Species of Quantity, from the Divinity; for God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no Predicament, and therefore the Unity of God not reducible to the Predicament of Quantity; for God is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and above all Unity, as he is above Substance, above Essence, above every thing which we have any Notion or Conception of; as <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite</hi> speaks.</p>

                     </note> the World is one in number, but not one in nature; for it is compounded of great variety of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and we say, one Man, but Man is compounded of Body and Soul; and even any Angel is not perfectly pure and simple, but is compounded of Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Qualities, such as Holiness, which is not pure and simple Nature, for it may be separated. He adds, that Number is a Species of quantity, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the Question, How many, which properly belongs to a Corporeal Nature:—And indeed all Number denotes such things as have a material, or at least a circumscribed and limited Nature, but <hi>Monad and Vnity</hi> denote the Simple, Uncompounded, Uncircumscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Infinite Essence: And when he says, That Number must belong to things of a Circumscribed Nature, thereby he tells us, he means, not merely such things as are circumscribed by Place, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongs to Bodies; but all such Natures as have a limited and confined Idea, as all Created Natures, whether Body or Spirit, have, whose Natures are limited, circumscribed, fixt and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by that Infinite Mind, which gives being to them.</p>
                  <p>The meaning of all which is this, That to make a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, there must be Alterity and Diversity in Nature, or a separate Existence: But a Perfect, Simple, Uncompounded
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50623:130"/>
Nature, can admit of no possible alteration and diversity; for the same Nature can never differ from it self, without some kind of composition; and where there is no difference and diversity, there can be no number, and an Infinite Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumscribed Nature can never be divided and separated, or subsist a-part, and therefore can't be numbred: So that Number can belong only to Created Natures, which are compounded and finite, and therefore by some diversifying Qualities or Affections, and a separate Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>istence may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished into Individuals, which may be numbred; but the Unity of the Divine Nature, which is a Perfect Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, Uncompounded, Infinite Monad, is not the Unity of Number, but a Perfect Invariable Sameness and Identity, and an Indivisible, inseparable Union.</p>
                  <p>Now some Men, who do not duly attend to the nature and design of these Reasonings, apply all this to prove the Perfect Singularity of the Divine Essence, in the most strict and proper notion of Singularity, as that signifies One in Number; which contradicts the whole Intention of this Hypothesis, which is to prove, that the Unity of God does not consist in the Unity of Number, but of Nature; and that the Unity of the Divine Nature is not a Unity of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but a Unity of Sameness, Identity, and Inseparability. This is a Matter of great consequence, and therefore let us consider it over again.</p>
                  <p>This distinction between the Unity of Number, and the Unity of Nature, was alledged by the Catholick Fathers to avoid the Charge of Tritheism: The <hi>Sabellians</hi> and <hi>Arians</hi> asserted the Unity of God to be a Unity of Number; that One Divinity is not One, unless it be One in Number, One Single Solitary Divine Nature: And this, say they, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the Trinity of Divine Persons, each of which is in his own Person True and Perfect God: For Three such Divine Persons must be Three Gods, Three Divinities, if each Divine Person have the True Perfect Divine Nature in
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50623:130"/>
himself; and it is impossible to understand what a Divine Person is, without the Divine Nature: So that if the Father be God, the Son God, the Holy Ghost God, if Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, be Three, they must be Three Gods.</p>
                  <p>This was the great Difficulty, and it is the only material Difficulty to this day. To have asserted but One Singular Divine Nature, which is but One in Number, had given up the Cause to the <hi>Sabellians</hi> or <hi>Arians:</hi> For then either Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost, are but Three Names or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the same One Divine Person, who is the One God, as the <hi>Sabellians</hi> taught: Or Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are not a Consubstantial Trinity, but the Father alone is God, and the Son and Holy Ghost but mere Creatures, how Excellent Creatures soever they are.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, should they have denied that Three Ones make Three, this had been false counting, as the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> tell us now; and therefore to avoid both these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, they distinguish between the Number by which we reckon, and the thing which is numbred; and thus they find a Real Trinity in Perfect Unity: As <hi>Greg. Nyssen</hi> tells us, That <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the very same thing, the same Divinity, is both numbred, and not subject to Number. It may so far be numbred with the Persons, as each Divine Person has the whole and perfect Divinity in himself, but yet the Divinity can't be numbred; not because it is One Single Solitary Divinity, for it really subsists in Three; but by reason of that perfect Sameness and Identity, which admits of no Number; for that which is perfectly one and the same in Three, can't be numbred.</p>
                  <p>Had they thought of such a Singularity of the Divine Nature, as is but One in Number, they must have disputed at another rate against <hi>Sabellians</hi> and <hi>Arians.</hi> Would they have taught, That the Divinity may be numbred, and yet is without Number? Which is impossible to be true of the same singular Divinity, which is but One in Number, and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:50623:131"/>
therefore can never be more than One in Number; that is, in that Father's sense, cannot be numbred, much less can the same Singular Nature be numbred, and incapable of Number, that is, be One, and More than One.</p>
                  <p>Would they have taken so much pains to prove, That Sameness and Identity of Nature excludes all Number; if by this they had meant the Sameness and Identity of Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, as the same thing is one and the same thing with it self, which is no great Mystery? And is it not evident, that this whole Dispute is concerning the Unity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature in Three distinct Persons, and consequently, concerning that Sameness and Identity of Nature which is between Three who have the same Nature, and therefore not One in the Notion of Singularity, which is One in Number, not in the Sameness and Identity of Nature?</p>
                  <p>Would they have insisted on that distinction of Units in Number, and Units in Nature; that the first multiplies, the second does not, had they believed that there are no Units in the Divinity; not One, and One, and One, but only One Singular Divinity? At least, could <hi>Boetius,</hi> who so particularly explains and urges this distinction, intend to prove by it the Singularity of the Divine Essence, when at the same time he defines a Person to be the Individual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a Rational Nature; and assigns this distinction as the Reason why though we number Three in the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, yet there are not Three Divinities, or Three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Natures or Essences; because the Repetition of Units in the thing to be numbred, where there is a perfect Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Identity of Nature, makes no Number?</p>
                  <p>In this sense it was, that the Schools asserted the Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the Divine Substance; because the Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, by reason of its perfect Sameness and Identity can't be numbred, and what can't be numbred, they call a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Substance: But they expresly reject (as the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Fathers did) Singularity in the sense of Solitude, as it
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50623:131"/>
signifies one alone by himself, without any Communion or Fellowship <hi>(consortium</hi>) with any other in the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Essence. And therefore the Master of the Sentences expresly distinguishes between Diversity,<note place="margin">Peter Lomb. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>dist.</hi> 23.</note> Singularity or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and Unity and Trinity, Distinction and Identity. Now let any man judge, what that Unity is, which is not Singularity or Solitude, but a Unity in Trinity; and what that Distinction is, which is perfect Identity without any Diversity: For my part I can make nothing of it, but this perfect Sameness and Identity of Nature in Three, which numbers Persons, but not Natures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Estius</hi> takes notice of that Objection against the Trinity, That the Father is God, and the Son is God, therefore the Father is the Son; which Consequence is resolved into that Maxim, <hi>Quaecunque eadem sunt uni tertio, eadem sunt inter se,</hi> whatever things are the same with the same Third, are the same with each other: To which he answers, That this Rule holds true only where the <hi>Third</hi> is a perfect Singular: <hi>Deus autem non prorsus singulare nomen est,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> is not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Accounts a name of Singularity, that is, does not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify One only who is God; but signifies such a Singular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as is communicable to Three, <hi>Significat enim Naturam Singularem, sed quae communicari possit tribus suppositis:</hi> That is, It is not a Singular Nature,<note place="margin">Estius, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>dist.</hi> 2. <hi>sect.</hi> 5.</note> with the Singularity of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, because it is communicable, and can subsist distinctly in Three, but only with the Singularity of Identity, as he explains it from St. <hi>Hilary, Dist.</hi> 23. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. to which he refers his Reader. So that though the Schools did use this Phrase of <hi>a Singular Nature and Substance,</hi> which the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Fathers rejected as <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> yet they did not use it in that Sense, which the Fathers rejected, for One Solitary Nature, which can be but One Person; and therefore <hi>Estius</hi> observes, that <hi>Aquinas</hi> uses this name of <hi>Singularity,</hi> when applied to the Divinity, <hi>non simpliciter, sed cum cautela,</hi> not simply and absolutely, but with caution, and qualifies it with
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50623:132"/>
                     <hi>ut sic liceat loqui,</hi> if I may have leave so to speak: And he imitates this Caution himself, <hi>Dist.</hi> 23. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. when he tells us, That the Divine Essence may <hi>quodam sensu</hi> in a certain sense be said to be individual, as it neither is a Genus nor Species, but <hi>res una numero, &amp; ut it a dicamus singularis,</hi> nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically One, and if we may say so, Singular; though it be not <hi>individual,</hi> in the sense that <hi>Boetius</hi> defines a Person to be <hi>an Individual Substance,</hi> because it is not incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.</p>
                  <p>This shews, That though the Schools have in this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion changed the Ancient Catholick Language, by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That the Divine Essence is <hi>Vna Numero, &amp; Singularis,</hi> One in Number, and Singular; whereas the Catholick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers denied that God was One in Number, but only in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and denied the Singularity of the Divine Nature (which Confusion, and appearing Contradiction of Terms occasions great Mistakes) yet they meant the very same thing, and their Philosophy about Singularity and Number was the same: For they taught a Communicable Singularity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is opposed to a <hi>Sabellian</hi> Solitude, and rejected the numbring Number from the Divinity. They univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally deny, That God is One in that sense of Unity, which is the beginning of Number: For Number is a Species of Quantity, <hi>&amp; nascitur ex divisione continui,</hi> is made by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision; and to assert God to be One in this Sense, is to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe Quantity to him; for nothing can be thus One, but what has Magnitude and Figure, that is, nothing but Body; for Number, as it is a Species of Quantity, can belong to nothing, but Body, which has divisible Parts, and Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and Magnitude, which may be One or more. This is certainly true, as to that kind of Number, which is a Species of Quantity; for that can measure only such things as have Quantity: But then they were sensible, that other Beings are numbred besides Bodies, even Incorporeal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who have no Quantity, Parts, or Divisibility, and yet
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50623:132"/>
these we number, when we say, a Hundred, or Thousands, or Millions of Angels. This they own, and call it a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendental Number, that is, such a Number as is not reduced to the Predicament of Quantity: But that is little to the purpose; if Spirits, which have no Quantity may be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, what is it that makes a Number in them? And why may not Number then belong to the Divinity, though it be not <hi>quantum,</hi> have no Predicamental, that is, Corporeal Quantity? To this they answer, <hi>That this Transcendental Vnity adds no form to the thing, but only signifies the thing it self, as undivided from it self:</hi> Well! But if this be all, then God, who is thus indivisible from himself, may as properly be called One, as One Angel is said to be One: No, say they, For to entitle any thing even to this Transcendental Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Unity, <hi>ratione rei subjectoe Naturam ejus designat ut li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatam, atque extra res alias positam,</hi> it must be considered to have a Finite and Limited Nature, and to subsist separate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from all other Beings, and to be diversified from each other in Nature or Qualities. <hi>Res una ab alia, Natura vel qualitatibus discreta intelligitur.</hi> But now Unity in God, though it resemble this Transcendental Unity, as adding no Form to God; that is, not supposing him to be Corporeal, as the Predicamental Unity does, yet it does not signify any thing limited and finite in God; but only his Undivided In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable Being: As Number in God (that is, the Trinity) does signify the real distinction of Three, <hi>Non ita tamen, ut ea plura Natura vel Qualitatibus discreta intelligantur, &amp; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula suis velut limitibus circumsepta.</hi> But not so, as if these Three were distinguished and separated by Nature and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, or as if each of them had their own Separate and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed Bounds and Limits.</p>
                  <p>This is the Account <hi>Estius</hi> gives us of Unity and Number in God, <hi>dist.</hi> 24. <hi>sect.</hi> 1. which perfectly agrees with that Account I have already given of this matter from St. <hi>Basil:</hi> That an Infinite, Undiversified, Indivisible Nature (as the

Eternal Divinity is) is neither One nor Three, in the same Sense, and for the same Reasons, which give these Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations to any Created Beings. And therefore there are no Arguments in Nature to confute the Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head from a Trinity of proper Subsisting Persons, nor a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Persons from the Unity of the Godhead, because Three and One in God do not signify what they do in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>This appeared a great difficulty to the Master of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>dist.</hi> 23.</note> That since we neither allow of Diversity nor Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, Multiplicity nor Solitude in the Trinity, what should be the meaning of One, and Two, and Three, of Trinity and Plurality, and Distinction, as when we say, One God, Two Persons, Three Persons, more Persons, distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; or a distinction of Persons, Plurality of Persons, a Trinity of Persons, which seems to ascribe a Numerical Quantity, a Multitude and Multiplicity to God. To this the Master answers, That these words, when applied to God, are rather intended to remove every thing from God, which is inconsistent with the Perfect Simplicity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, than positively to affirm any thing of him: This Answer does not please <hi>Estius,</hi> because it seems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that God is not in a true and proper Sense One and Three; but this is his own Mistake: For <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> meant no more but this, That though God be in the most perfect sense One and Three, yet those positive Ideas, which we have of One, or Two, or Three, of Distinction, and Trinity, when applied to Creatures, do not belong to the Divine Nature; and therefore we must conceive of them in God, rather by way of Negation, than by any positive Ideas, by denying such things of God, as are inconsistent with the Perfect Simplicity of his Nature; which is true of most other Divine Perfections, that we have rather a negative than positive conception of them, as attributed to God; for Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Power, and Goodness in God, are no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50623:133"/>
under the Predicament of Quality, as they are in Creatures, than the Unity of God is reducible to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament of Quantity.</p>
                  <p>Thus he tells us, when we say <hi>One God,</hi> we thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude more Gods, but do not attribute the quantity of Number to God; that is, we do not mean that there is One God, in that Notion of One as it is the beginning of Number, which is a Species of Quantity, for so nothing can be One, but what has Quantity, which God has not: Thus when we say, <hi>One Father,</hi> and <hi>One Son,</hi> the meaning is, that there are not many Fathers, nor many Sons. When we say there are more Persons, we exclude Singularity and Solitude, but do not introduce Diversity or Multiplicity into the Divine Nature. Thus <hi>Three Persons</hi> does not signify the Quantity of Number, or any Diversity (as it is in Creatures) but only determines our Thoughts to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, that each of these Persons is in the Godhead, and none else. <hi>Distinct Persons,</hi> or <hi>Distinction of Persons, excludes Confusion and Mixture</hi>; signifies that they are Another and Another, without any Diversity, or <hi>Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Confusion. The meaning of which is, That we must not form such a Notion of One God, as we have of One Man, nor of Three Persons, as of Three Men; but must acknowledge One God, in opposition to more Gods, or more Divinities; and Three Persons, in opposition to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity and Solitude in the Divinity: All which resolves it self into the Unity of Identity, which excludes both all manner of Diversity, and Singularity and Solitude.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VII. Concerning the Distinction of Persons in the Unity and Identity of the Divine Essence.</head>
                  <p>THIS fairly brings me to the Third Enquiry I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, concerning the Real Distinction of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons, in the perfect Sameness and Identity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; how we can distinguish Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, when their Nature is perfectly One, by the Unity of Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and Sameness. This is the Seat of most of those nice distinctions which we meet with both in the Fathers and Schools, and therefore it deserves to be carefully examined; for a sensible Account of this Matter would answer many great Difficulties in the Doctrine of the Trinity: And to this purpose I shall first give a general Account of it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to those Principles which I have now laid down; and then more particularly explain what the Fathers and Schools say of it; which will appear to be no such Mysterious Nonsense, as the Adversaries of our Holy Faith would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present it to be.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The general Account of this is very short: The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Fathers universally teach, That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are each of them by himself in his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Person, True and Perfect God: That the same One Whole Undivided Divinity subsists distinctly in each of them: That the Person of the Father, as he is True and Perfect God, is the whole Divinity; That the Person of the Son, as True and Perfect God, is also the same One Whole Divinity; and so of the Holy Ghost: That this Divinity is One and the Same, not by an Unity of Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50623:134"/>
and Solitude, which is irreconcilable with the Notion of a Real Trinity; for One Singular Divinity can be but One Single Divine Person; but by the Unity of Sameness and Identity, which admits of a Trinity of subsisting Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the same undiversified Nature: That whatever the Father is, That the Son is, and that the Holy Ghost is.</p>
                  <p>That a Divine Person is nothing but the Divine Nature and Essence; for the perfect absolute Simplicity of God admits of no imaginable Composition, not so much as of Nature and <hi>Suppositum,</hi> or that which is the subject of all Natural Powers, as it is in Created Beings.</p>
                  <p>This makes it very evident that these Divine Persons are not distinguished by Nature; for there is nothing in Nature to distinguish them, it being perfectly and invariably the same in all; and where there is no distinction, there can be no Number; for which reason they will not allow that the Divine Essence is multiplied with the Persons, there being but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, one and the same Divinity in them all.</p>
                  <p>They agree farther, That the Divine Persons are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable: That the Person of the Father is not, and can never be the Person of the Son; nor the Person of the Son, the Person of the Father; nor the Person of the Holy Ghost, the Person either of Father or Son.</p>
                  <p>But then this seems to make the difficulty insuperable; That if a Divine Person be nothing else but the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how there should be Three such distinct incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Persons in the same undivided, undistinguished Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Why we may not call Three Divine Persons, who have each of them the whole Divine Nature distinctly and incommunicably, Three Divinities, as well as Three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons, when a Divine Person is nothing else but the Divinity? And then Three distinct Persons must be Three distinct Divinities.</p>
                  <p>This Unity and Distinction in the Godhead has always been acknowledged by the Catholick Fathers to be a Great
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50623:135"/>
and Inexplicable Mystery, a wonderful Union, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Distinction. <hi>Damascen,</hi> as I observed above, tells us, That the Divine Nature, though subsisting in Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>Damascen. de Orthod. fide l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> as Human Nature is, which subsists only in Individuals, and has a particular, distinct, separate Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence in every particular Man, and therefore can be One in its Individuals in no other sense, but only as the same common Notion and Definition of Humanity belongs to them all; that is, Human Nature is One in all the Men in the World, not by a Real Subsisting, but by a Specifick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Unity: But the Divine Nature is One with a Real Subsisting Unity, being perfectly the same in Three, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Division or Separation: And an indivisible, insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, undiversified Same, is really and actually One, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the most simple Notions we can form of Unity.</p>
                  <p>But what room then does this leave for a Real Trinity of Persons, in this One, Simple, Uncompounded, Indivisible, Inseparable Nature?</p>
                  <p>To this he answers, That this Real Distinction of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the perfect Unity and Simplicity of Nature, may be known and understood by Reason, though there be nothing in Nature to distinguish them. Father, Son,<note place="margin">

We acknowledge One God, distinguished only by these Personal Properties of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, Filiation, and Procession, as a Cause, and that which is caused; and as each of them has a compleat perfect Hypostasis, distinguish'd only by these different Modes of Subsistence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:50623:135"/>This proves a Real Distinction, without any Diversity, Division, or Separation, and therefore a Real Distinction in perfect Unity.</p>
                  <p>The Divine Nature is Infinite and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumscribed,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> — Ibid.</note> and therefore the Divine Persons cannot be divided and separated from each other, but are perfectly in each other, without Confusion. The Divine Nature is perfectly One in Three, by the Unity of Sameness and Identity, and therefore there can be no diversity or division of Will, or Counsel, or Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or Power: Now a Nature which is perfectly the same, and undivided, must be perfectly One. But then Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are certainly Three; for He who begets, is not He who is begotten, for nothing begets it self: To beget, and to be begotten, and to proceed, are the Characters of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and can belong only to True, Real, Substantial Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: He who begets, must be a Person, and so must He who is begotten, and He who proceeds; they have each of them <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, whatever makes a compleat and perfect Person; but then these Three can never meet in the same Person, and consequently must distinguish Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; for the same Person can't be unbegotten, begotten, and proceed; can't be the Cause, and that which is caused.</p>
                  <p>This is demonstratively certain, That a begotten and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begotten Person, and consequently a begotten and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Nature (a Divine Person being nothing else but the Divine Nature) are and must be Two, and never can be each other; and therefore this distinguishes Persons, though it makes no distinction or diversity in the Divine Essence; as the Catholick Fathers proved against the <hi>Arians,</hi> that to be unbegotten, and to be begotten, does not. But to be unbegotten, to be begotten, and to proceed, whatever
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50623:136"/>
you will call them, whether Personal Properties, or Modes of Subsistence, though they do not make the Persons, that is, are not the formal Notion of a Person, yet they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly distinguish them, or prove them to be as distinct and incommunicable, as Unbegotten, Begotten, and Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for if these Terms or Characters can never signify each other, then the Persons characterized by them can never be each other: And this is all the distinction that can be in an undistinguished, undiversified, undivided Essence.</p>
                  <p>Well; but still the difficulty remains, how to distinguish between Essence and Person in God; for if Person be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Essence, and each Person distinctly in himself be the whole Divine Essence, or the whole Divinity, how can we avoid acknowledging Three Essences, and Three Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, as well as Three Persons in the Trinity? Now the account of this must be taken from the nature of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction and Unity which is in God; for such a Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as does not destroy the Unity, can't multiply Natures, though it distinguishes Persons. Each Person is the Divine Nature, but without any diversity, division, or separation of the Divinity; and what is Identically and Indivisibly the same, is but One. The Divine Nature, as self-originated and unbegotten, is the Person of the Father; as communicated by Generation, is the Person of the Son; as proceeding is the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Holy Ghost, and these are Three; but the Son is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Substance of his Father, and the Holy Ghost pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Father and Son, without any diversity, division, or separation of Substance, and therefore the Divinity is but One. The Divine Nature subsists distinctly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicably in Three, according to their distinct Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Unbegotten, Begotten, and Proceeding; and these we call Persons, because they bear some Analogy to Individuals in created Beings, which in an Intelligent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are called Persons; but they are not Three Divinities, because the Divine Nature, though it be distinct, yet is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diversified,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50623:136"/>
and undivided in Three, and therefore is but One in Three.</p>
                  <p>This seems to me a very intelligible Account of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Unity, and the difference between Person and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, though a Divine Person is the Divine Essence. When we distinguish between Person and Essence, and say there are Three Persons and One Essence, by Essence we mean an undistinguished, undivided Divinity, which is but One; by Three Persons we mean the Divine Essence, unbegotten, and communicated by Generation, and Procession, which are really distinct Persons, and subsist distinctly, but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the Unity of an undistinguished and undivided Divinity; which makes them really and actually Three and One; the same without diversity, and distinct without division. And this seems to be the reason why the Catholick Fathers, tho they called the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons <hi>Tres Res,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <hi>Tres Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistentes,</hi> Three Things, and Three that subsist, yet were more cautious in calling them Three Natures, or Essences, or Substances (though there are some Examples of this kind), because though the Divine Essence subsists distinctly in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, which makes them Three Distinct, Real, Subsisting Persons, yet the Divine Nature is not distinguished nor separated, but is perfectly One, Same, Undivided Essence; and therefore <hi>Vna Substantia,</hi> though not <hi>Vnus Subsistens;</hi> One Substance, though not One, but Three, that subsist.</p>
                  <p>What I have thus briefly represented, I hope I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the First Chapter, from the Authority of Scripture, and Reason founded on Scripture: And from what I have already discoursed of the Doctrine of the Fathers, it may appear to careful and intelligent Readers, who use such Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication as this Argument deserves and requires, that this is their Unanimous Sense also. But yet as far as it is possible, to clear this Matter more fully, and vindicate the Fathers and Schools from those Obscurities, Inconsistences,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:50623:137"/>
and Contradictions which are generally charged on them in so concerning an Article, I shall reassume this Matter, and particularly shew,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That what they call a Divine Person, is the Divine Essence and Substance, and nothing else.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That this Divine Essence and Substance, as constituting these Divine Persons, is proper and peculiar to each, and incommunicable to one another; and therefore that this Divine Essence and Substance, as subsisting distinctly in Three, is no more numerically One, than their Persons are One.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What difference they made between Nature and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and Hypostasis and Person.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whether the Catholick Faith of a Real and Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Trinity, can be as reasonably and intelligibly explained by the Notion of One Singular Substance in the Divinity, as by asserting Three Personal Substances or <hi>Suppositums:</hi> And whether the Singularity of the Divine Essence in this Notion, deliver the Asserters of it from any Inconveniences and Objections which the contrary Opinion is thought lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for the first, That a Divine Person is the Divine Essence, it is and must be in some sense acknowledged by all who profess the Faith of a Real Trinity; for there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Real Trinity of Divine Persons, if each Person be not True and Perfect God, that is, the whole Divinity, or Divine Nature and Essence. And therefore those who assert in the strictest sense the Singularity of the Divine Essence, yet assert, That this One Singular Essence subsists distinctly in each Divine Person; which, whether it be to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood or not, yet is an acknowledgment that there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a Divine Person without the Divine Essence: But we need not be beholden to any man for this Concession, for the thing is plain and evident in all Catholick Writers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:50623:137"/>
                     <hi>Petavius</hi> has very critically observed the different use of Words in Catholick Writers, relating to this Venerable My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery; such as Essence, Nature, Substance, Hypostasis, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, Person, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which sometimes occasioned great Misunderstandings between them, and is to this day made a pretence of charging the Fathers with great Uncertainty and Obscurity, and with contradicting each other, and themselves.</p>
                  <p>This of late has been much insisted on, in order to dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Authority of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. That very Ambiguity which the Fathers are charged with in the use of Words, does certainly prove, that by a Divine Person, they meant the Divine Essence, Nature, and Substance.</p>
                  <p>The plain Case is this. The Catholick Fathers did univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally own and profess a Trinity in Unity, Three Persons, and One God; So that there was no difference in their Faith, how different soever their words were: The most common Terms, whereby they exprest the Unity of the Godhead, were <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:50623:138"/>
is by saying, That when these Fathers use such Expressions, as Three Essences, Three Natures, Three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, they do not understand this of Three divers, or spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically different, Essences, Natures, Substances, which is <hi>Arianism,</hi> but of Three Persons; and when they affirm, that there is but One Hypostasis, they do not by One Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis mean One Person, which is <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> but One Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Essence, or Substance: As we know this very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy about One or Three Hypostases, was thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Synod, where <hi>Athanasius</hi> presided: And no doubt but this is the true Solution, since those, who were neither <hi>Arians,</hi> nor <hi>Sabellians,</hi> could not understand such Expressions in any other sense.</p>
                  <p>But then the Question still remains, How this Ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty should happen, or how it comes to pass, that such contradictory Terms, as One Essence, and Three Essences, One Substance, and Three Substances, One Hypostasis, and Three Hypostases, should both be Orthodox and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</p>
                  <p>Now the only Account I can give of this matter, is this; That these Terms, Essence, Nature, Substance, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasis (which originally signifies Substance, of which more presently) may signify, as the Philosopher speaks, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the First or Second Substance; either the common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which has the same notion and definition, common to the whole Kind, as Humanity, which is the same in all Men; or a Singular Subsisting Nature, and Substance, which in Creatures we call Individuals, and in reasonable Creatures, Persons: Now in analogy to this common Specifick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is one and the same in all its Individuals, the Catholick Fathers taught but One Essence, Nature, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and in this sense but One Hypostasis in the Godhead, that is, a Consubstantial Trinity, in analogy to the several Individuals of the same Species, in whom only this common Nature did really and actually subsist; they ordinarily assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Three Hypostases, sometimes, as we see, Three Natures, and Essences, and Substances, in the Trinity, that is, Three Real, Substantial, subsisting Persons; and in this sense, Three Essences, Three Natures, Three Substances, was accounted Catholick Doctrine.

                     </gap>, Three Essences, or Substances, says,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Now that which I observe from hence is this, That had they not believed each Divine Person to be distinctly by himself the Divine Nature, Essence, and Substance, there could never have been any occasion for this Dispute about One Essence, Nature, Substance, Hypostasis, and Three Essences, Natures, Substances, Hypostases; nor for that known Distinction, by which they reconciled this difference between Essence and Hypostasis, that the first signifies some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing analogous to a Common Specifick Nature, the second to Individuals. If the Divine Nature subsisted in Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or were but One Singular Subsisting Nature, Essence and Hypostasis must signify the same thing; for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Essence is Substance, and so is Hypostasis, and in this sense, they must both signify a first Substance, and then one singular Subsisting Nature or Substance; and three singular Subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Natures and Substances, is an irreconcilable Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Had the Singularity of the Divine Nature been the Catholick Faith, we should never have heard of the <gap reason="foreign">

But to set aside this Dispute concerning Three Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences, Three Natures, Three Substances, and One Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis in the Trinity, which though allowed to be Catholick, yet were sparingly and cautiously used, because they were liable to Heretical Senses; I observe farther, That these words, Essence, Nature, Substance, are distinctly applied to each Person of the Holy Trinity, which could not be Orthodox, were not each Person distinctly in himself, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, Nature, Substance.</p>
                  <p>What I have already discoursed with relation to <hi>Sabellia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> and upon several other occasions, sufficiently proves this, and I shall not trouble my Readers with a needless Repetition: <hi>Petavius</hi> owns it, and has given several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of it, That <gap reason="foreign">

construed with the name of a Person, as the Essence and Substance of the Father, or of the Son: But this is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, if the Essence be not the Person; if the Essence of the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> I observe farther, That all those words, which are more peculiarly appropriated to signify the Divine Persons, were always used by Catholick Writers in the notion of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and were never thought Catholick in any other sense.</p>
                  <p>Hypostasis is the most received word among the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, to signify a Person; and One Essence and Three Hypostases was the Catholick Language. Now it is agreed on all hands, That Hypostasis literally signifies Substance; and as I have already observed, the only dispute about it was, that some by Hypostasis understood the Common Nature and Substance in the notion of Essence, and for that reason asserted, That there is but One Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis, as there is but One Essence in the Trinity; others understood a singular Subsisting Nature and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and in this sense asserted Three Hypostases; but none of them ever understood Hypostasis in any other
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50623:140"/>
notion, but that of Substance, either a Common, or Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Substance: And to prevent this Ambiguity, as far as they could, which might conceal very different Heresies, <hi>Sabellianism</hi> on one hand, and <hi>Arianism</hi> on the other, and many times occasioned the Orthodox to suspect each other of these opposite Heresies, though Essence and Hypostasis signified much the same thing, yet they appropriated the name Essence to signify a Common Nature and Substance, and Hypostasis to signify Individuals: As we learn from St. <hi>Basil, Greg. Nyssen, Damascen,</hi> and many other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Writers, who assign this difference between Essence and Hypostasis.</p>
                  <p>But yet this did not wholly silence this Dispute among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> much less did it satisfy the <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers, who knew no difference between <hi>Essentia &amp; Substantia,</hi> but translated the <hi>Homoousion</hi> by <hi>Vnius Substantiae</hi>; and therefore it was as great Heresy to them to say Three Substances (as they translated the <hi>Greek</hi> Hypostases) as to say Three Essences in the Trinity: St. <hi>Austin</hi> professes, That he knew not what the <hi>Greeks</hi> meant by One Essence, and Three Substances; and for the same reason, it is well known, St. <hi>Ierom</hi> rejected Three Substances, for both by Essence and Substance they understood a Common Nature, which made it Heresy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to assert Three Substances, which in this acceptation of the word must signify Three divers Substances, which specifically differ: And therefore tho they did not reject the <hi>Greek</hi> Faith, but did believe as heartily as they, that each Person by himself was perfect Hypostasis and Substance, and rejected the Sabellian <hi>One Hypostasis,</hi> and <hi>One Substance</hi>; yet they did not like the Phrase of <hi>Three Hypostases,</hi> and <hi>Three Substances</hi>; for they knew no difference between Three Substances and Three Essences, and by both understood Three different Kinds and Species of Beings. And for this Reason, both to secure the Catholick Faith from such a diversity and dissimilitude of Nature, as Three Essences
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:50623:140"/>
and Substances may signify, and from a <hi>Sabellian</hi> Unity and Singularity, they chose such words, as signified a Real Perfect Subsisting Being, but did not immediatly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally signify Essence and Substance, tho they did necessarily suppose and connote it. Such among the <hi>Greeks</hi> are <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This I hope is a sufficient Proof of the first thing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, That a Divine Person is the Divine Essence and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; but I added also, That it is nothing else; and I must speak something briefly to this.</p>
                  <p>The absolute Simplicity of the Divine Nature, which admits of no kind of Composition, neither of Parts, nor of Substance and Accident, nor of Nature and <hi>Suppositum,</hi> that which has, and that which is had, is the universal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine both of the Catholick Fathers and Schools, as I need not prove; and the necessary Consequence of this is, That a Divine Person can be nothing else but the Divine Nature, Essence, and Substance; for were a Divine Person the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature and something else, there must be a Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Divine Nature, something superadded to it, to make it a Person.</p>
                  <p>The Unity of the Divine Nature in a Trinity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as I have shewn at large, is resolved into the perfect invariable S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>meness and Identity of Nature (the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) in Three; and therefore each Divine Person must be the whole Divine Nature and Essence, and nothing else; for otherwise the Divine Essence could not be perfectly
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:50623:143"/>
one and the same in Three, but would be distinguished and multiplied by some new Accidents and Modifications, as Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature is in distinct Human Persons.</p>
                  <p>A Trinity of Persons is a known Objection against the absolute Simplicity of the Divine Nature; and the Answer to it is as well known, That those Relations which distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish Persons, make no Composition in the Divine Nature; and then a Person can be nothing else but the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if there be no Composition to make a Person: But of this more presently.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> The next thing I proposed was this, That accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Doctrine both of Fathers and Schools, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Essence and Substance, as subsisting distinctly in Three, is proper and peculiar to each, and incommunicable to one another.</p>
                  <p>This is so universally acknowledged by all who own real and substantial Persons, that I need say little of it. I have produced several express Testimonies already out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to this purpose; and indeed to say, That the Substance of each Person is proper and incommunicable, is no more than to say that their Persons are incommunicable; that the Father is not, and never can be the Son, nor the Son the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor the Holy Spirit either Father or Son; which is what they meant by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, properly and appropriately Father and Son; that the Father never was nor can be a Son, nor the Son a Father. Thus their different Characters prove an incommunicable distinction between them: The Son is the Image of God, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a Living Substantial Image; but the Image, tho by an Identity of Nature it is the same with the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, yet it is not and never can be the Prototype; not <hi>imaginale,</hi> but <hi>imaginalis imago,</hi> as <hi>Victorinus Afer</hi> speaks; not the Person, nor Personal Substance of the Father, but the express Image of his Person and Substance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:50623:144"/>In <hi>Boetius</hi>'s Definition of a Person by <hi>individua substantia,</hi> the Schools, as far as I have observed, universally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>incommunicabilis substantia,</hi> an incommunicable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; and therefore, as I observed before, though they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert the Divine Essence to be <hi>singularis,</hi> yet it is <hi>singularis communicabilis,</hi> a communicable Singular; but a Person is <hi>substantia individua,</hi> or <hi>singularis incommunicabilis,</hi> a singular incommunicable Substance.</p>
                  <p>Now this started a great Difficulty; How the Essence and Substance of the Father, which is but One, can be both communicable and incommunicable. The Person of the Father, which is his Divine Essence, is incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and yet the Father communicates his own Divine Nature and Essence to the Son and Holy Spirit, without communicating his Person.</p>
                  <p>Of the same Nature is what the Schools teach concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divine Generation and Procession. They allow that the Father does truly and properly, not metaphorically, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Son, and that the Son is truly and properly begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and that the Father by Divine Generation communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the Divine Essence to the Son; and that the Son has all that he has from the Father, and is all that the Father is, excepting that he is not the Father, but the Son: And yet they will not allow that the Divine Essence either begets, or is begotten, or proceeds.</p>
                  <p>They have a great Authority against them in this, as they all own; for the Fathers made no scruple to say, That God begat God, Essence Essence, Wisdom Wisdom, Life Life; and that the Son is begotten, and only begotten God, God of God, Light of Light, Wisdom of Wisdom, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Wisdom. Upon these Authorities <hi>Richardus Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> contends earnestly, that we ought in plain terms to own,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>De Trin. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 22, 23.</note> That Substance begets Substance, and that those who deny it, reject the Doctrine of all the Catholick Fathers: But <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> and most other Schoolmen, especially
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:50623:144"/>
since the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> justify themselves in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by saying, That the Fathers intended no more in such expressions, than what they themselves own, though they reject that way of speaking. When the Fathers taught, That God begat God, Essence Essence, Substance Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, Wisdom Wisdom, Life Life, they meant no more, than that the Father, who is God, Essence, Substance, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Life, begat his Son, who is also truly and really God, Essence, Substance, Wisdom, Life; and the reason why they rather chose to say, That the Father, who is God, and Essence, and Wisdom, begets the Son, who is God, and Essence, and Wisdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than to say, That God begets God, Essence Essence, Wisdom Wisdom, is this, Because God, and Essence, and Wisdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> signify absolutely, and so may multiply Gods, Essences, Wisdoms; as when we say Man begets a Man, the begotten Man is as absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Man, as he who begets; and he who begets, and he who is begotten, notwithstanding their relation, are two ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Men: And therefore, to prevent all such mistakes, and to secure the Catholick Faith of the Real Distinction of Persons and <hi>Suppositums</hi> in perfect Unity, without the least diversity or multiplication of Essence, they attributed Active Generation to the Person of the Father, and Passive Generation to the Person of the Son; which proves a Real Distinction of Persons and <hi>Suppositums</hi> (for he who begets cannot be he who is begotten), and yet preserves the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Identity of the Divine Nature.</p>
                  <p>But how can this be, if Person and Essence, <hi>Suppositum</hi> and Nature be the same, as it is in God? For then if the Person be begotten, the Essence, which is that Person, must be begotten also; and if the Person begets, the Essence must beget. Now this is in some sense true; and therefore the Catholick Fathers promiscuously used these terms; That the Father begets a Son, or God begets God, or Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence begets Essence; and the Schools themselves own,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:50623:145"/>
That the Father, who is God, begets the Son <hi>deitatem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentem,</hi> who has the Divinity, the Divine Nature and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and has it by his Generation and Birth; which in reality is the same, though they thought the expression less liable to mistake. For the truth of the Case is this; The Schools, that asserted the perfect Singularity of the Divine Essence, fenced against all Expressions of an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute signification, which multiplied Natures; for Two abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Natures cannot be singularly One; and therefore would not say, that Nature and Essence begets, or is begotten; for in these Propositions, the terms Nature and Essence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less qualified and restrained, signify absolutely, and so infer Two absolute Natures and Essences, that which begets, and that which is begotten; and therefore they rather call this a Communication than a Generation of Nature, because this last signifies relatively: That which is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, may be a Singular Nature, which subsists di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly in more than one, but with a necessary relation to its Original, and such a Communication does not multiply Natures, but only Essential Relations. And this is the difference they made between <hi>Deus &amp; Deitatem habens,</hi> God, and one who has the Divinity; that God signifies absolutely, an Absolute Independent Divinity, which has no relation or communication with any other; but One who has the Divinity, may signify One, who has it, not originally and absolutely, but by communication from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in an Essential Relation to him, as the Son and the Holy Spirit have, which is the same Divinity in Three, and but One in Three. And therefore I think the Schools were very much in the right, for rejecting <hi>Tres Dii,</hi> Three Gods, when at the same time they owned <hi>Tres Deitatem habentes,</hi> Three who have the Divinity, for these do not signify the same thing: The first, unless qualified, is Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism; the second, the Christian Trinity in Unity; though I confess, I should not chuse to call the Father, One who
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:50623:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
has the Divinity, but simply God, because he is absolutely and originally so, and not by communication; and for that reason is both in Scripture, and in the Fathers, eminently call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now every man must confess, that the Prototype and the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50623:146"/>
Image are two distinct Incommunicable <hi>Suppositums,</hi> the Prototype is not the Image, nor the Image the Prototype; and yet we must confess, that there is, and must be, but one and the same Nature in both, not Specifically, but Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically the same, for a perfect Image is, and can be nothing but the same that the Prototype is, the same Eternity, the same Life, the same Wisdom, Power, and Goodness, but all this not Personally the same, for their Persons are not, and cannot be the same; but identically and invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the same, or else it can't be a true and perfect Image. And this makes it evident, that though Person and Nature be perfectly the same in God, yet when he begets a Son, he neither begets his own Person, nor Nature, which would be to beget himself, which St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and the Schools after him, reject as absurd; for an Image of God is neither the Person, nor the Personal Nature of God, but of the same Nature with him, and perfectly the same, there being no other difference between them, but that one is the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, the other the Image; one the Father, the other the Son. So that when God of his own whole perfect Substance begets a whole, perfect, living, substantial Image, he does not beget himself, but another; he does not beget his own Nature, nor another Nature like his own, but his own Image, of the same Nature with himself: He begets ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Person, who is as truly and perfectly God, as the true, perfect, living, Image of God must be perfect God, but he does not in an absolute sense beget God, neither <hi>se Deum,</hi> nor <hi>alium Deum,</hi> as the Schools rightly determine, neither himself God, nor another God; for he neither begets his own Essence and Divinity, nor another Divinity, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is the perfect Image of his own Divine Essence: And what is here said of the Generation of the Son, as the living subsisting Image of God, must be applied to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Holy Spirit, who is the Eternal Spirit of God, as the Son is his Image.</p>

                  <p>And this is all that the Schools mean by the Singularity of the Divine Nature and Essence; and it is impossible they should mean any thing else, when they teach, that this singular Nature is communicable.</p>

                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:50623:147"/>They allow, as I have already shewn, that Nature and Person is the same, that each Person is <hi>Suppositum</hi> and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, a singular incommunicable Substance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that there were Three <hi>Suppositums,</hi> and in that sense Three Substances in the Trinity; but not Three Natures and Essences, though each Person be distinctly by himself, the Divine Nature and Essence. Now since what is strictly singular, is Numerically One; and what is Numerically One, and never can be more, can't be multiplied, as that seems to be, which is communicated, what sense can there possibly be in a <hi>singular communicable,</hi> which seem to be contradictory Terms?</p>
                  <p>But this is very good sense, and very Catholick Doctrine, if we understand this <hi>Singular Communicable,</hi> as the Schools did, of One absolute Divinity, or Divine Nature, which is so singular, that it can be but One, as is demonstrable by Reason: But yet may beget its own essential Image, which is not another Divinity, or another Nature, but its own singular Nature in its Image, which is another <hi>Suppositum</hi> and Person, but not another Nature.</p>
                  <p>That this is the Sense of the Schools, and all that they meant by the Singularity of the Divine Essence, is evident from the whole Doctrine of Relations. A Trinity of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Real Persons, each of which is Nature, Essence, and Substance, was made an Argument against the perfect Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as well as against the perfect Simplicity of the Divine Nature, for Plurality and Unity are opposed to each other.

                  <p>BUT it will be of great use more particularly to consider this Doctrine of Relations, without which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible rightly to understand what the Schools teach, about a Trinity in Unity: And to reduce it into as narrow a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass as I can, I shall 1. shew, What the Schools mean by Relations in the Divine Nature. 2. Why they insist so much upon Relations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What they mean by Divine Relations. Now they tells us, That they are real Relations, not made by the Mind from some external Respects and Habitudes which it observes between things, but antecedent to all the Acts of Reason in the things themselves: That they are not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Accidents, but Substance, and subsisting Relations; not relative Names and Appellations, but the Relatives themselves; the Persons related being the Relations, and the Relation the Person; which are therefore by some cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Substantiae Relativae,</hi> and <hi>Entia Realia Relativa,</hi> Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Substances, and Real Beings, but Relative; that is, not Absolute Substances, and Absolute Beings, with a Relation, as it is in Creatures, where the Son is as Absolute a Man, and as Absolute a Person as the Father is, though they are related to each other as Father and Son; but the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and Person is the Relation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="282" facs="tcp:50623:148"/>Before I shew, That this is the Doctrine of the Schools, the better to understand what they say, and the Reasons of it, it will be necessary to give as plain and intelligible an Idea of this as I can; especially since I find some Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men boggle very much at the Notion of Relative Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which are not merely the Subjects of Relations, but the Relations themselves.</p>
                  <p>What their Objection is against this, I can't tell, unless they think that a Relative Substance is not True and Perfect Substance; which is very far from the Notion of the Schools, who attribute compleat and perfect Subsistence to these Divine Relations or Persons, not as Accidents in their Subjects, nor as Parts in a Whole, which is their Notion of Substance and compleat Subsistence; but a Relative Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance only signifies such a Substance as is not the Original, but is all that it is from another, which they call the <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Originis,</hi> not merely such a Relation as is between the Cause and the Effect, which is seldom a substantial subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Relation, but the Relation between Substance and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, when one Substance, in the notion of <hi>Suppositum,</hi> is wholly and perfectly derived and expressed from the other.</p>
                  <p>The easiest Representation of this, is the relation between the Prototype or Original, and its Image; which is not a mere Relation of Likeness and Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,<note place="margin">

S. 8. &amp; Aquin 1. q 35. in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore.</note> but of Origination, that the Image is taken from the Original, which is the foundation of the Relation. Though Two Eggs were never so perfectly alike, yet One is not the Image of the Other, because it is not of the Other, nor its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Representation, though perfectly like it; but the Image is that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults from the Object, like a Face in the Glass, or the Impression of a Seal; and the whole Essence of such an Image, as
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:50623:148"/>
an Image is relative. And it is the same case as to a living substantial Image of that Life and Substance from whence it proceeds; it is as perfect Life and Substance it self, as its Original, or else it could not be a natural Image of Life and Substance; but yet it is Relative Life and Substance, Life of Life, the Prototype begetting its own Image in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Identity and Sameness of Nature, Whole of Whole. And this is the Notion of the Schools concerning Relative Substances, which is intelligible enough.</p>
                  <p>And that this is what they mean by Relations in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head or Divine Nature, is as plain.</p>
                  <p>The Master of the Sentences tells us, That these Names, Father, Son,<note place="margin">

Quia no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant relationes, quae non sunt Deo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentales, sed in ipsis Personis ab aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no sunt immutabiliter, ut non modo appellationes sunt relativae, sed etiam relationes, sive notiones in rebus ipsis, scilicet in Personis sint.</hi> Lomb. l. 1. dist. 26.</note> and Holy Ghost, signify the Properties of Paternity, Filiation, and Procession; for they are Relatives, which speak a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual respect, and denote Relations, which are not Accidents in God, but immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the Persons themselves; so that they are not mere relative Appellations, but are Relations or Notions in the things themselves, that is, in the Persons.</p>
                  <p>And by this Argument <hi>Tho. Aquinas</hi> proves, That these are real Relations,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Now the Answer, which <hi>Aquinas</hi> and others give to this Difficulty, is this. That it is not every Relation,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>ns are more subsisting Relations really distinct from each other; but there can be no real distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between the Divine Relations, but upon account of their relative opposition: And therefore two opposite Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions must belong to two Persons, but such Relations as are
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50623:150"/>
not opposite to each other, must belong to the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and therefore Paternity and Filiation must belong to two Persons, as being relatively opposed; and therefore a subsisting Paternity is the Person of the Father, and a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting Filiation the Person of the Son: Which can never be one Person, as requiring distinct <hi>Suppositums</hi> for such oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Relations: But now the other two Relations, Spiration and Procession are not opposed to either of these, but only to each other: And therefore Spiration does not constitute another Person, as not being opposed either to Paternity or Filiation, and therefore may and does belong both to Father and Son; but Procession must constitute a Third Person, as opposed to Spiration, and so necessarily distinguished from Father and Son.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, though there are Four Relations, yet one of them, <hi>Spiration,</hi> is not separated from the Person of the Father, and the Son, but belongs to them both; nor is it a Property, as not being proper and peculiar to any one Person; nor is it a Personal Relation, or that which consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes a Person, and therefore there are but Three Relations, Paternity, Filiation, and Procession, which are Personal Properties, which constitute Persons, and therefore but Three Persons.</p>
                  <p>Now this Answer evidently proves, That by Relations they did not mean meer Habitudes, Respects, and Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Denominations; for then every Relation must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity be a Person, and there must be as many Persons, as there are Relations; but they mean relative Beings, and Subsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and therefore allow no Relations to constitute distinct Persons, but such as necessarily require distinct Subjects; that is, such opposite Relations, as can never meet in the same Subject; and therefore their <hi>Suppositums</hi> must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally distinct, as Paternity and Filiation, for no one can be Father and Son to himself. There is no imaginable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, why only opposite Relations constitute Persons, but
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:50623:150"/>
because they distinguish their Subjects; for when opposite Relations meet in the same Subject, but not in opposition, they do not distinguish and multiply Persons, as the same man may be Father and Son, and but One Person; but when opposite Relations distinguish their Subjects, as the Divine Relations necessarily do, they multiply Persons too: And no Relations, Properties, Notions, according to the Doctrine of the Schools, constitute a Person, but such as distinguish their Subjects, that Three Persons, and Three Relations, are not Three Respects and Denominations of the same Singular Subject, but Three real distinct Relative Beings, and Subsistencies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us now consider, why they insist so much upon the notion of Relations, that when they allow every Divine Relation to be the Divine Essence, Substance, an incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable Subsistence and Substance, yet they will not allow us absolutely to say <hi>Three Substances,</hi> but Three Relations, or Three Relative Beings, Subsistencies, or Substances. And the plain and short account of it is this; That this is essential to the Unity of God, and gives us the truest and most perfect conception of a Trinity in Unity. As to shew this particularly;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. These Divine Relations (though each of them be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicably in his own Person, Essence, and Substance) secure the perfect Unity of the Divine Essence. For Three Relative Substances are essentially but One Substance, which Three Absolute Substances can never be, though they never so perfectly agree in the same Specifick Notion and Idea.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>an absolute Substance,</hi> I mean one intire, perfect, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, whole, which is compleat in it self, and subsists compleatly by it self, without any Internal, Essential Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to, or necessary dependence on, any Being of the same kind: By <hi>Relative Substances,</hi> I mean, such Substances as are internal subsisting Relations in the same One whole indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual

Nature: Of Absolute Substances we have as many Instances, as there are particular Creatures in the World; of Relative Substances we have no instance in Created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but some such Images and Resemblances, as may help us to form an intelligible notion of them.

                     <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> explains this particularly from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and it is evident that all these are very distinct, and never can be each other; but all have a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and necessary relation to each other; are in each other, and equal to each other, but are but One, One Mind, One Life, One Essence, and One Substance; because they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially exist in the same Soul and Mind, not as Accidents in their Subjects, which may be parted, but as Essential Properties and Powers.</p>
                  <p>This our <hi>Socinian</hi> Adversaries like well enough; for these distinct Properties and Powers do not multiply Persons, and therefore though they grant something like such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Powers in the Divine Nature, yet still there is but

One Divine Person, and therefore according to their own Notion, but One God.</p>
                  <p>But this is not the Question, Whether such distinct Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, Properties, and Powers, multiply Persons, which we grant they do not, because they do not multiply Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and One Individual Human Natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>estion is, Whether, if instead of these distinct Powers and Faculties, there were real subsisting Persons, as essentially related to each other in the same Individual Nature, they would any more divide or multiply Nature, than such distinct Powers and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do? And I am pretty confident, no man can give me any good reason, why Relative Subsistencies, or Personal Relations should any more divide or multiply the Divine Nature, than Relative Powers and Properties divide or multiply Human Nature: For if these Divine Persons are as essentially related to each other in the Divine Nature, as such distinct Powers and Faculties are in Human Nature, a Trinity of Persons must be as essentially One in the same One Individual Divinity, as a Trinity of Powers and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are in the same single Human Nature. It is certain, Three such Divine Persons, though each of them be by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self true and perfect God, are not Three Absolute Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and therefore not Three Gods, but Three Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Subsistencies in the same One Individual Godhead, and therefore but One God; as Memory, Understanding and Will, are all that a Mind is, and each of them all that the other is, and yet not Three Minds, but One Mind.</p>

For <hi>the Word</hi> is a Relative Term, and signifies a Relative Subsistence, and necessarily supposes the Father; for he is not the <hi>Word,</hi> but with relation to him, whose Word he is. And by this means he tells us, we may escape both the Polytheism of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the Singularity of the <hi>Iews,</hi> by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the Living, Energetical, Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Word, which the <hi>Iews</hi> deny, and the Unity and Identity of Nature, between the Word, and Him, whose Word he is. For as our Word proceeds out of our Mind, and is neither every way the same with the Mind, nor yet upon all accounts another. For that it
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:50623:153"/>
is of the Mind, proves that is is another, and not the Mind it self; but as it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly expresses and represents the Mind, it cannot be another Nature, but one and the same Nature, though a kind of different subsistence. So the Word of God, by a distinct subsistence of its own, is distinguished from him, from whom he receives his Subsistence and Hypostasis; but inasmuch as he is all, and the same that God is, he is perfectly one and the same in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>This is the Doctrine of all the other Catholick Fathers, as well as of <hi>Gregory Nyssen,</hi> who resolve the Unity of the Godhead in a Trinity of Persons, into Relative Subsistencies in the same Individual Nature, which no more multiplies Natures and Divinities, to make Two or Three Gods, than the Mind, its Word, and Love, make Three Minds.</p>
                  <p>This is the true and compleat notion of the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> which (as I have already shewn) does not signify a meer Specifick Unity, but the Unity of One Individual, not Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, Nature in Three; that Three Real, Distinct, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting Persons are as intimately and essentially related to each other in the same Individual Nature, as a Human Mind and its Word are; which are not, and never can be two Minds, but one Mind. Two compleat and perfect Minds can never in a proper notion be Consubstantial, or one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, though they have the same specifick Nature; for their Substance is not one and the same, but naturally two, and naturally separable, how closely soever they may be united; but Three Divine Persons, who are essentially rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to each other in the same Divinity, as the Mind and its Word are, are in the strictest notion Consubstantial, or One
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:50623:153"/>
Substance, being essentially related to each other in the same One Individual Nature and Essence.</p>
                  <p>And here I must take notice of a great mistake, which some Learned Men run into, concerning the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, singular and particular Natures, Substances, and Essences, by which they understand, what some others call Personal Substances; and conclude, That since <hi>Philoponus,</hi> and others, who asserted <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Three particular Natures and Essences, or Substances in the Godhead, were charged with Tritheism (as they deserved, if their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions be truly represented) those who assert Three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Persons, or Three distinct Personal Subsistencies or Substances, are liable also to the same Charge. This is a material Objection, and a fair Answer to it will set this whole matter in a clear light.</p>
                  <p>Now the Answer in short is this, That those who rejected the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and charged it with Tritheism, did not thereby understand particular, personal, relative, Subsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or Substances, but compleat, absolute, particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Substances; not Three Real, Substantial, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting Relations in One Individual Nature, as a Mind, its Internal, Essential, Word, and Spirit, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are Three; but Three absolute particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as Three Men, each of whom has a compleat, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, personal Nature of his own, are Three. Now if this be the true Account, every one sees the difference between Three personal, relative, Substances or Subsistencies of the same Nature, and Three absolute particular Natures; the first is a real Substantial Trinity, Three Subsisting Infinite Persons in the Unity of the same Godhead. Three Persons, and One God; the other is down-right Tritheism.</p>
                  <p>And that this is all they meant by particular Individual Natures, I have many Arguments to prove.</p>

On the other hand, the <hi>Severians</hi> denied the Union of Two Natures in the One Person of Christ, because an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Human Nature must be a Person, and then Christ must be two Persons, as well as two Natures: So that this <gap reason="foreign">

The very asserting three relative, personal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistencies, or Substances, in One Individual Nature, is a direct opposition to the Doctrine of <hi>Philoponus,</hi> and the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verians,</hi> that Nature and Person is the same, so the same,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:50623:155"/>
that One Nature can be but One Person, and One Person but One Nature, which necessarily overthrows a Trinity of Persons in the Unity of the Divine Essence, and the Union of the Divine and Humane Nature in the One Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ; but Three Relative Persons and Subsistencies in One Nature, and One Nature and One Person are direct Contradictions, as One Individual Substance, and Three Individual Substances are.</p>
                  <p>Indeed those who deny Three Relative Personal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistencies, that is, Three Real, Proper, Substantial Persons, in the Unity of the Divine Nature, go upon the same Principle with <hi>Philoponus</hi> and the <hi>Severians,</hi> that One Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is but One True and Proper Person, or Hypostasis, and therefore there cannot be Three Proper Subsisting Persons in the Unity of One Individual Substance; which, as <hi>Anastatius Sinaita,</hi> and the other Catholick Writers of that Age frequently observe, is that fundamental Error, which gave birth to <hi>Sabellianism, Arianism, Nestorianism,</hi> and <hi>Eutychanism</hi>; for as different as these Heresies are, the fundamental Principle is the same, that One Individual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, and can be but One Person, and One Person but One Nature: For this reason <hi>Sabellius,</hi> who acknowledged the Unity of the Divine Nature, rejected a Trinity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subsisting Persons; <hi>Arius,</hi> who owned a Trinity of Persons, denied their Consubstantiality, or Sameness and Identity of Nature; <hi>Nestorius,</hi> who owned Two Natures in Christ, asserted also Two Persons; and <hi>Eutyches</hi> made Christ but One Nature, as well as One Person; and in consequence of this <hi>Philoponus</hi> (if he was not mistaken) taught Three Individual Natures, as well as Three Persons in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. So that to make Nature and Person in the true and proper notion of Person commensurate and converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Terms; that a Nature is a Person, and a Person an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Nature; that One Nature is but One Person, and One Person but One Nature; and that Individual Natures
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:50623:156"/>
and Persons must always be multiplied with each other, is the fundamental Principle of all the Heresies relating to the Trinity and Incarnation, and then one would think, that those Doctrines which expresly contradict this Principle, and all these Heresies which result from it, should be the true Catholick Faith: And then Three Real, Substantial, Subsisting Persons, or Three Relative Personal Subsistencies, or Substances, in the Unity of the same Individual Essence, or one Godhead, is the True Catholick Faith; and to reject it upon pretence, that this must multiply Natures with Persons, and so make Three Divinities, and Three Gods, is to return to that condemned Heretical Principle, That One Nature can be but One True and Proper Person; which, if Men understand the true Consequences of what they say, must inevitably betray them to <hi>Sabellianism, Arianism,</hi> or <hi>Tritheism.</hi> And thus much for the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which, I hope, we shall hear no more of. The Doctrine of Relations demonstrates the Individual Unity of the Divine Essence; for if Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, though each of them in his own Person be True and Perfect God, yet are not Three Absolute Divinities, but Three Eternal Subsisting Relations, in the same One Divinity, they must be One Individual Essence and Substance, for else they cannot be the Relations of the same One Essence and Substance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As these Divine Relations prove the Individual Unity of Nature and Essence, so they prove the Sameness and Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Nature, wherein, as I have shewn at large, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Fathers place the Unity of the Godhead. That <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. One Divinity is One God. A few words will serve to explain this, after what I have already discoursed on this Argument.</p>

                     </gap>, as I have already shewn, does not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the Singularity, but the perfect invariable Sameness and Identity of Nature; not such a Sameness, as every single Person is the same with himself, but such a Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:50623:156"/>
as is between distinct Persons of the same Nature. Now the Doctrine of Relations necessarily infers this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Sameness and Identity, and this Relative Sameness and Identy proves a perfect Unity.</p>
                  <p>As for the first, there needs no other proof, but barely to represent it, for it is self-evident: For is it possible, that a Perfect, Living, Subsisting <hi>Word</hi> should not be perfectly the same with that Infinite Mind, whose Word it is, and from whom it proceeds? That a Perfect, Living, Subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Image, should not be perfectly the same with its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totype, from whom it receives its Being and Nature? For if the Word be not perfectly the same with the Mind, nor the Image with its Prototype, it is not a true and perfect Word, not a perfect Image: By these Relations of Father and Son, of a Mind and its Word, a Prototype and its Image, the Catholick Fathers, as I have already shewn, prove the perfect, invariable Sameness and Identity of Nature; for the thing proves it self. The Relation indeed of Father and Son, considered in general, proves no more than a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Sameness of Nature, which may admit of great changes and variety within the same Species; but when God is the Father, and begets a Son of his own Substance, his Nature being absolutely and immutably perfect, he must communicate the same perfect invariable Nature to his Son; especially when this Son is his own perfect living Word, and his perfect Image. But this is not all: A perfect Sameness between Two Absolute Natures, without the least conceivable difference or variation, would not be a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a Sameness of Identity; for though they could subsist as perfectly the same, as their Idea is, yet they would be Two Absolute Natures, not One Nature: But a perfect Sameness in Essential Relations, or Relative Subsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, proves a perfect Identity of Nature, that they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the same in the same One Individual Nature: As a living substantial Word must receive its substance and being,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:50623:157"/>
whole of whole, from that Mind, whose Word it is; for if it be not the same Substance, it can't be the substantial Word of that Mind, whose Substance it is not; nor can a living substantial Image be any other Substance, than that of the Prototype; for if it were, it might be its likeness, but not its natural Image. And thus this Sameness and Identity of Nature proves each Person by himself to be true and perfect God, and all Three but One God; for each Person, according to this Doctrine, has, and must have, the whole perfect Divinity in himself, and all Three but one and the same Divinity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. These Subsisting Relations in the Unity of Nature, give us an intelligible Notion of the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Union of the Divine Persons, as essential to the Unity of the Godhead, is so well known, that I need not multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Quotations to prove it, after what I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to that purpose.

                  <p>Now it is certain this relates to the inseparable Union of the Persons; for it is opposed to <gap reason="foreign">

That the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, this Inseparable Union and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50623:157"/>
Inbeing of Persons, does as necessarily prove the real Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of Persons as the Unity of Nature, as St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> and <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and the other Fathers, frequently observe, and that proves that the Unity of the Divine Nature, which is the Inseparable Union of Three proper subsisting Persons, is not the Unity of Singularity: Which shews by the way, how improperly the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> is made use of to prove the Singularity of the Divine Essence, for it proves quite the contrary; it is the Unity of Three which is a Trinity in Unity; not the Unity of One, which is Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and Solitude.</p>
                  <p>In the next place I observe, That by the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> all the Catholick Fathers understand in this Mystery the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable Union of Relatives in the same Individual Nature, not the Union of compleat, absolute Natures, how close and inseparable soever it may be. There is by Nature no Inseparable Union, but in the same Individual Nature. Three compleat Individuals, though of the same Kind and Species, how closely and intimately soever they be united, are not by Nature inseparable nor essentially One, for they may be parted by that Power which united them, and when they are parted, can subsist apart; as Three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Minds, how intimately soever they should be united by God, yet can never be essentially and inseparably One, for they are not essential to each other; they might have subsisted apart, and may be parted again, and an External Union cannot so make them One, as to be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inseparable. Which I think is a Demonstration that a Natural Inseparability, which is an Essential Unity, can be only in One Individual Nature between such Relatives as are Essential to each other, and can neither be, nor be conceived, divided, or separated: And therefore the Catholick Fathers represented the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> by Examples of Natural Unions between things Essentially related to each other in One Individual Nature, which either cannot
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:50623:158"/>
be conceived, or at least cannot subsist apart. Of this last Kind are a Fountain and its Streams, a Tree and its Branches, whereby they not only represent the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> but the Inseparable Union of the Divine Persons, as every one knows; for there cannot be a Fountain but its Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters must flow out, nor Streams without a Fountain from whence they flow; and though Branches may be separated from the Tree, yet they live no longer than they are united, and are Branches of that Tree no longer: But these are very imperfect Images, and without great caution will corrupt our Ideas of the Divine Unity. Of all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Unions the nearest resemblance we have of this, and which the Fathers most insist on, is the Sun, and its natural Splendor, for we cannot conceive the Sun without its Splendor, nor the Splendor without the Sun; they never were, never can be parted, and therefore, though two, are essentially one.

Internal Word, which are so essentially related to each other in the same Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Nature, that they can never be parted, nor conceived apart; the Mind can never be without its Word, nor the Word subsist but in the Mind: It is evident, That two compleat, absolute Minds can never be thus united; for they are not Essential to each other; not naturally one, and therefore not naturally inseparable; but a Mind and its Word, though two, are essentially One, and therefore can never be parted but must subsist together; and these are the Characters the Scripture gives us of God the Father and his Son; the Father Infinite, Eternal, Self-originated Mind; the Son his Eternal Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, Living, Subsisting Word.

                  <p>There is no need to multiply Quotations to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, which may be met with every where.

But Original Mind, its Word and Spirit are and must be in each other, as being Three in One Individual Essence; for the same undivided Essence can't be whole and entire in Three, but those Three must be in each other. If the Divinity of the Father is in the Son, the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father; the Mind is in its Word, and the Word in the Mind: The Son is in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as eternally begotten in the Substance of the Father, whole of whole, and essentially one and the same, as the Word is in the Mind, not by such an Union and Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as we may suppose between two Minds, but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Mind, and essentially one and the same with it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:50623:161"/>Now according to this Representation, which all the Catholick Fathers make of this Mystery, we must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity acknowledge Number without Multiplication, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction without Division or Separation, a perfect Trinity in perfect Unity; Three Persons, each of which is by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self True and Perfect God, but not Three Gods, but One God: A Mind and its Word are two, and a living, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting Word is true and perfect Mind, Mind of Mind, and yet not two Minds, but one Mind; for the Mind and its Word are essentially One, as all Men must confess; the Word is in the Mind, and the Mind in the Word, and therefore identically one and the same: for which reason the Fathers acknowledge that the Father is Spirit, the Son Spirit, and the Holy Ghost Spirit, and these are Three, but not Three Spirits, as essentially related to each other in the same individual Essence, essentially the same, and essentially in each other: And thus Will of Will, Wisdom of Wisdom, Life of Life, Power of Power, though they multiply and distinguish Persons, do not multiply Wills, Wisdoms, Lives, Powers, which are essentially One, as the Mind, its Word, and Spirit, are One: They are not One Life, One Will, One Understanding, One Power, in the Sense of but One who Lives, who Wills, who Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands, and has Power; but as the same, identically the same Life, and Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is in each of them, and indivisibly and inseparably in them all.</p>
                  <p>And this gives an account of the Unity of Operation, wherein the Catholick Fathers unanimously place the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, for One Almighty Agent is but One God, and One Essential Will, Wisdom, and Power, can be but One Agent; and Infinite, Original Mind, and its Eternal subsisting Word can have but One Will, and Wisdom, and Power, for the Will and Wisdom of the Mind is in its Word; the same, not merely specifically the same, or the same by consent, as it may be between Two Minds,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:50623:161"/>
which Will perfectly the same thing, but the same One Individual Will; the Father Wills, and the Son Wills, and they both Will distinctly, but with one Individual Will; as it is impossible that the Word should Will with any other Will, but the Will of that Mind, whose Word it is. And therefore Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, though Three Eternal, Infinite, Living, Intelligent, Willing, Persons, which Subsist and Act distinctly, yet being that to each other in a more perfect and excellent manner, that Mind, its Word, and Spirit, are in Men, they must be as perfectly One Almighty Agent as a created Mind is, which Wills and Acts in its Word and Spirit.</p>
                  <p>The Distinction and Unity of Operation necessarily proves the Distinction and Unity of Essence; it being in our way of conceiving things a necessary effect of it; there must be some real Distinction in the same Nature and Essence, in which there are Three who Act distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and there must be an Individual Unity of Essence, when in Three there is but One Individual Operation; and though these things may be distinguished in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where we distinguish the <hi>Suppositum</hi> and the Powers, and give a priority of Nature to the <hi>Suppositum,</hi> yet Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Energy being the same in God, who is a pure simple Act, there can be no priority nor posteriority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, but the Demonstration proceeds equally upon Nature or Operation; but that is the best, which is the most intelligible Representation of this Distinction and Unity.</p>
                  <p>For this reason the Fathers chose to explain the Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Unity of the Godhead by the Distinction and Unity of Operation, which I need not prove at large, as being universally owned, and therefore I shall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, how St. <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> represents this matter.</p>

we receive from God, as suppose Life, is attributed to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; but though it be given by Three, that which is given, or done for us, is not Three; we do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive three Lives, one from each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Trinity, but we have but one Life, which we receive from them all.

                  <p>The not considering this, how perfectly unknown and incomprehensible the Divine Nature it self is, occasioned a late Author to tell us, That <hi>An Hypothesis in this Affair, which leaves out the very</hi> Nexus, <hi>the Natural and Eternal Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and insists upon mutual consciousness, which at most is but the consequence thereof, wants the principal thing requisite to the salving the Vnity of the Godhead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is to philosophize about the abstracted Natures and Essences of Things, even the Divine Substance and Essence, which I dare not presume to do. No doubt but God is the most real substantial Being in the World, even Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and there is as little doubt, but there is as real and substantial an Union between them: But I know nothing of the Substance of God, as distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from his Essential Attributes and Perfections, nor of such a Distinction and Unity of Substance in the Deity, as can help us to form any notion of a Trinity in Unity, and defend it from the Charge of Contradiction and Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility, when we have done. For we must have a care of conceiving any Extension, or Parts, or Composition in God, without which we can have no notion of a Distinction and Union of Substances, considered purely under the notion of Substance. And therefore we must be contented to be ignorant of the Substance and Substantial Unions of the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:50623:164"/>
Deity, as we are of all other Substantial Unions. We know not what the Substance of a Spirit is, nor what the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Matter is, nor what their substantial Unity is: And therefore when we inquire into their Distinction and Unity, we never meddle with the Essential Reasons and Causes of Unity, which are concealed from us, but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as far as Sense, or Reason, or Observation will reach, wherein the Unity of any thing consists, and when a thing may be said to be One: As to instance at present only in the Unity of a Mind, and in the Union of Soul and Body.</p>
                  <p>Is there any thing else in the World which can make a Mind one with it self, and distinguish it from all other Minds, but a self-conscious Sensation, that it feels it self, and its whole self, and only it self? I suppose these Men will grant, that such a Mind is One, and but One, and distinct from all other Minds; but Self-consciousness is not the formal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Unity of a Mind, or of a Person, because in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature the Unity of a Mind or Person must go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Self-consciousness; that is, Self-consciousness is owing to the Unity of Essence, not the Unity of Essence to Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consciousness. Well, but what is this Essence of a Mind, and this Unity of Essence, which makes a Mind One? Truly that no body can tell; and therefore to say a Mind is one by the Unity of its Essence, is to say, it is One, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is so; for we know no more of the matter: But Self-consciousness is a sensible Unity, which we all feel in our selves, and know our selves from other Men by it.</p>
                  <p>This Unity of Essence we know nothing of, but by Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consciousness; and I desire to know, whatever the Unity of Essence be, whether any but a Self-conscious Unity would make a Mind One, and distinguish it from all other Minds? which shews, that we have nothing to do with the naked Essences and Substances of Things, but with their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and essential Properties; and when we know them,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:50623:165"/>
we know all that is to be known of Nature; and therefore we can know no more of the Unity of a Mind than <hi>Self-consciousness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Substances of things are distinguished from each other by their Essential Properties, and therefore from them we must learn their Unity or Distinction. A Mind is a Substance, and Matter is Substance; and the essential dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them, as far as we can understand, is, that a Mind is a thinking Substance, and Matter extended Substance; and therefore we must judge of a Mind by the properties of Thinking, and of Matter by extension: The Unity of a Thinking Substance must consist in the Unity of Thoughts and Sensations, that is, in one Consciousness; and the Unity of an Extended Substance in the continuity of its extension; and to ask farther, what is the cause or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Consciousness in a Mind, or of One Consciousness in One Mind, is to ask a reason of the natures of things; why a Mind is a Thinking Being, and why One Thinking Being has one Center of Thoughts: Why do they not ask also, how Extension comes to be essential to Matter, and how Matter is extended? I know no reason to be given of such matters, but the Will of God, who formed all things according to the Ideas of his own Infinite Wisdom.</p>
                  <p>This I hope is sufficient to be said concerning the order of Nature, and the priority and posteriority of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; for if we do not stop in our Inquiries at imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and essential Properties, but demand an antecedent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for them, this is to demand a Reason of Nature, Why things are what God has made them: Those who are not contented to contemplate Nature in its immediate and Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Properties, may philosophize by themselves for me; for there is nothing more to be known without an intuitive knowledge of Nature it self, which none can have but the Author of Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:50623:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thus should you inquire of me concerning the Union of Soul and Body; all that I know of it is, That they are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one Conscious Life; That the Soul feels all the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the Body, and directs and governs it. No, will such Philosophers say, here wants the <hi>Nexus,</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Union between Soul and Body; for they must be One by a Natural Union before there can be this Conscious Life and Sympathy between them, which is not the Union, but the effect and consequent of this Union. Very true! They must be vitally united to have One Life, and to receive impressions from each other; But can they give any other notion of this Vital Union, than that the Body is animated by the Soul, and lives with it? Could these Philosophers tell you, how a Soul, which is an Immaterial Being, could be fastened to a Body, what Union of Substances there is between them, (which is the thing they want to know) would they understand a Vital Union ever the better for it? An Union of Substances seems to signify some kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact, which is hard to conceive between Body and Spirit; but however an Union of Contact, and an Union of Life, are two very different kinds of Union, and do not include or infer each other; and therefore the true Answer to that Question, How Soul and Body are united, is not to say, That their Substances are united or fastened together, which gives us no notion of a Vital Union; but that the Soul lives in the Body, and gives life to it; receives im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions srom it, and governs its motions. But to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire farther, is to inquire into the Reasons of Natural and Essential Unions, which are as great Mysteries as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is: We may as well ask, How a Soul lives, as how it animates a Body; and God alone knows both. So that to inquire after the Natural <hi>Nexus,</hi> or Cement of this Union, is nothing at all to the purpose, and is not the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Human Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:50623:166"/>Now, though the Vital Union between Soul and Body, and the Union of mutual Consciousness, be of a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Kind and Nature, yet the Dispute about the <hi>Nexus,</hi> or the Natural Union of Substances, is much the same.</p>
                  <p>Consciousness is the Unity of a Spirit; Self-conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is the Unity of a Person, and by the same reason mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Consciousness is a Natural Union of Three distinct Self-conscious Persons in the Unity of the same Nature. And to reject this for want of a <hi>Nexus,</hi> or the Natural Union of Substances, is as if we should deny the Union of Soul and Body to be an Union of Life or Animation, because this don't explain the Natural <hi>Nexus</hi> between Soul and Body: If a Mutual Conscious Union be an Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Union of Three distinct Persons in the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as a Vital Union is the Essential Union of Soul and Body, we have nothing to do in either Case with the Union of Substances which we can know nothing of, and if we could, should understand these Unions never the better for it. For whatever Union of Substance we may suppose between Soul and Body, and the Three Divine Persons in the Holy Trinity, it is the Kind and Species of Union which gives us the Notion and Idea of it. If you inquire, what Spirit, and what Matter is? It would not be thought a good Answer to these Questions, to say a Spirit is a Substance, and Matter is a Substance, without adding their Specifick Differences, that a Spirit is an intelligent thinking Substance, and Matter is an extended Substance; nor is it a better Answer to that Question, what Union there is between Soul and Body, or between the Three Divine Persons in the Trinity, To say, That their Substances are united, which gives us no distinct Notion of their Union; but a Vital Union, and a Mutual Conscious Union, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain distinct Ideas; and if these be Natural and Essential Unions, though we know no more of the Union of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:50623:166"/>
than we do, what Substance is, yet we know that the Soul and Body must be one Natural Person, and the Three Divine Persons must be naturally and essentially One God; for a Natural Union makes One according to the Nature of that Union.</p>
                  <p>It is visible enough what has occasioned this Mistake: Men consider Mutual Consciousness between Three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, Absolute, Independent Minds, and rightly enough conclude, that how conscious soever they were to each other, this could not make them essentially One; for every compleat Mind is One by it self, and not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Conscious to any One but it self, and by whatever Power they should be so united, as to be mutually Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, this could not make them essentially One; they would be Three Mutually Conscious Minds, not essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally One Mind; for they are not by Nature One, nor mutually Conscious, and therefore may be parted again, and cease to be so. But then, in this way of stating it, the Objection equally lies against the <hi>Perichoresis,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable Union and In-being of Minds, which can never make Three Compleat Absolute Minds essentially One. But if we apply this to the Union of Living, Subsisting, Intelligent Relatives of the same Individual Essence, to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost, Eternal, Self-originated Mind, its Eternal, Living, Subsisting, Word, and Eternal Spirit, this Mutual Consciousness gives us the most Intelligible Notion of the Essential and Inseparable Union and In-being of Three in One. I dare not say what other Men can do; but I have tried my self, and can form no Notion of an Unity in Trinity, but what either necessarily includes, or ultimately resolves it self into One Natural Essential Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness in Three.</p>
                  <p>The Divine Nature is indivisibly and inseparably One in Three; but we must not understand this Inseparability after the manner of Bodies, whose Parts may be divided and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:50623:167"/>
separated from each other; God is not Body, and has no Parts; but in the Unity of the Godhead there is Eternal Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Mind, an Eternal Word, and Eternal Spirit, which are inseparable from each other, that is, can never be parted: What then can parting and separating signify in a Mind, which has no Parts to be torn and divided from each other? I can understand nothing by it, but that the Mind does no longer see, and know, and feel its Word in it self, nor the Word the Mind; for this would make a perfect Separation between the Mind and its Word; that Mind has no Word which does not see and feel it in it self; and were it possible that a living subsisting Word should lose all Conscious Sensation of the Mind, whose Word it is, it would cease to be a Word, and commence a perfect separate Mind it self: So that as far as we can conceive it, the Inseparable Union between Father and Son, between Original Infinite Mind, and its Eternal Word, is an inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Conscious Life and Sensation, which is such a Natural Demonstration of their Inseparable Union, as no other Notion can give us; for all Men feel that a Mind and its Word can never be parted; a Mind can never be without its Word, nor the Word subsist but in the Mind.</p>
                  <p>Thus what other possible Notion can we form of the <hi>Perichoresis,</hi> or Mutual In-being of Father and Son, as our Saviour tells us, <hi>I am in the Father, and the Father in me,</hi> which is their Natural and Essential Unity, <hi>I and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are one?</hi> We all feel how the Word is in the Mind, and the Mind in the Word; the Mind knows, and feels, and comprehends its own Word; and a perfect, living, subsisting Word knows and feels that whole Mind, whose Word it is, in it self; for the Word is nothing else but the whole Mind, living and subsisting in the Word, which is another Hypostasis, but perfectly One and the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and therefore as they know themselves, so they
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:50623:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>

And this he asserts to be a Conscious Knowledge, connate with him, a Conscious Sensation of his Father's Nature in himself, which our S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> long before describ'd this mutual Consciousness between God and his Eternal Word and Wisdom by what we feel in our selves when we silently muse alone, our Word does as it were talk with us, and return our Thoughts to us, is present with us in every Turn, and Motion, and Pulse of Thought, and internal Sensation, as conscious to all within us.</p>
                  <p>Thus he tells us, That the Son alone knows the Father, and does not his own, but his Father's Will, which he

knows, <hi>de proximo, imo de initio</hi>; that is, by an immediate Intuitive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, not by External Communication, but by Internal Sensation. Thus the Son does nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do; <hi>in sensu scilicet facientem,</hi> in his own Mind and Will; <hi>Pater enim sensu agit,</hi> the Father does all things by disposing and ordering all things in his own Mind and Will; <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius vero, qui in sensu Patris est, videns perficit:</hi> The Son, who is in the Mind, and Sense, and Will of the Father, sees the Father's Will, and does it: Now let any Man tell me what else can be meant by the Sons being <hi>in sensu Patris, &amp; videns in sensu Patris,</hi> but this Internal Conscious Sensation.

In short, If the whole Divine Nature is conscious to it self, as every Created Mind is conscious to all that is in it self; and the Three Divine Persons subsist in the Individual Unity of the same Nature, then these Divine Persons must be intimately and mutually conscious to each other, as a Mind, its Word, and Spirit, are; and however Men please to philosophize about this, as to the <hi>prius &amp; posterius,</hi> whether they will make the Unity of Nature the cause of this mutual Consciousness, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in order of Nature prior to it; or make mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness not the cause of this Unity, but the Essential Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Three Distinct Subsisting Persons in the Unity of the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:50623:170"/>
same Individual Nature; I will not contend with any Man which of these speak most properly. Consciousness is the Unity of an Intelligent Nature, and the mutual Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Persons in the same Nature, and the Conscious Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nature in Three Distinct Persons is the same thing. We cannot conceive the Unity of a Mind without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness, nor any other kind of Unity of a Mind, but a Conscious Unity; nor can we conceive an Internal Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Consciousness without an Essential Unity; and if the mutual Consciousness of Persons in the same Nature, is the Consciousness of Nature, I cannot see why we may not say, That it is at least One Notion of the Unity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture too.</p>
                  <p>But to return where I left off, (if this may be called a a Digression) what I have now said, is sufficient to shew, how necessary this Doctrine of Relations is to give us a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible notion of a Trinity in Unity.</p>
                  <p>To assert a Real Trinity, we must assert Three Real, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, Subsisting, Substantial, Intelligent Persons, neither of which is each other, and each of which is by himself, in his own proper Person, True and Perfect God: But this, say <hi>Sabellians, Arians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> is to assert Three Gods; which the Catholick Church always abhorred the thoughts of. Now how the Fathers answered this Charge, and vindicated the Divine Unity in a Trinity of Real Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting Persons, I have already particularly shown, as by the Consubstantiality, the perfect Sameness and Identity of Nature, whole of whole, their Inseparability, and Unity of Operation; but we can form no distinct Idea of all this, but only among Personal Subsisting Relatives of the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Nature. Whatever is not this, is a meer Specifick Consubstantiality and Identity of Nature, and an External Union, how inseparable soever it be, which must make a number of Individuals in the Divine, as well as Human

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:50623:172"/>
and Word, and Power, and Wisdom; and there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in conceiving all this, if we contemplate it in these Characters; nay it is impossible to conceive otherwise of it. As impossible as it is to form any notion at all of those Philosophical Terms, whereby this Mystery is commonly represented, when we abstract them from those sensible Characters and Ideas which the Scripture has given us, and begin our Inquiries with them. It will be of great use to represent this matter plainly, that every man may see what it is that obscures and perplexes the Doctrine of the Trinity, and confounds mens notions about it, to the great scandal of the Christian Religion, and the disturbance of the Christian Church.</p>
                  <p>The great difficulty concerns the Unity and Distinction of the Ever Blessed Trinity, that they are really and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly Three, and essentially One: And this is represented by One Nature, Essence, and Substance, and Three Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stases; and yet Hypostasis signifies Substance, and every Divine Hypostasis is the whole Divine Essence and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Now if we immediately contemplate this Mystery under the notion of Substance, it is impossible for us to conceive One Substance and Three Hypostases, that is, in some sense Three Substances, or which is all One as to the difficulty of conceiving it, though the form of Expression is more Catholick; Three, each of which is the whole Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Substance, and neither of them is each other; we may turn over our Minds as long as we please, and change Words and Phrases, but we can find no Idea to answer these, or any other words of this nature. But now if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Essence and Hypostasis, we put Mind and its Word, we can form a very intelligible notion of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Distinction, and prove that Unity of Substance, and Distinction of Hypostases, which we cannot immediately and directly form any notion of. For Eternal Original Mind, and its Living Subsisting Word, are certainly Two,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:50623:172"/>
and neither are, nor can be each other; the Mind cannot be its own Living Word, nor the Word the Mind, whose Word it is; and yet we must all grant, that Eternal Mind is the most Real Being, Essence, Substance, and that a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Subsisting Word is Life, Being, Substance, and the very same Life and Substance that the Mind is, and all that the Mind is; for a perfect Living Word can have no other Life and Substance but that of the Mind, and must be all the same that the Mind is.</p>

For if we can conceive Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; Eternal Original Mind, its Eternal Word, and Eternal Spirit, to be Essentially One and Three, the Catholick Faith is secured, though we do not so well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the distinction between those Abstract Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Terms of Nature, Essence, Substance, Hypostasis, especially when applied to the Unity and Distinction of the Eternal Godhead, which is above all Terms of Art. <hi>The Catholick Faith is, That the Father is God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God; but yet there are not Three Gods, but One God;</hi> and this the Doctrine of the Divine Relations gives us a very intelligible notion of; for we cannot conceive otherwise of the Eternal Mind, its Eternal Word, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit, but that each of them are True and Perfect God, and yet a Mind, its Word, and Spirit, can be but One, and therefore but One God.</p>
                  <p>But One Substance, and Three Hypostases, is but a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary notion of a Trinity in Unity, to secure the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith against the <hi>Sabellian</hi> and <hi>Arian</hi> Heresies: Against the <hi>Sabellians</hi> the Catholick Fathers asserted Three Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stases, against the <hi>Arians</hi> One Substance; and the Essential Relations of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, necessarily prove both the One Substance, and Three Hypostases; but though One Substance and Three Hypostases be the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Language, yet those Men begin at the wrong end, who think to form an intelligible notion of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Unity from these abstract Metaphysical Terms. This is not the Language of the Scripture, nor have we any Idea to answer these Terms, of One Substance in Three distinct Hypostases, when we consider them by themselves, without relation to the Divine Nature, to
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:50623:173"/>
which alone these Terms can belong, for there is no such thing in created Nature, and therefore we can have no Idea of it. It is abundantly sufficient in this Case, that we have a clear and distinct Notion of One Substance, and Three Hypostases in the Essential Unity and Distinction of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Three subsisting Relations in One Individual Essence and Substance, though when we abstractedly consider these Terms of One Substance and Three Hypostases, we can form no consistent Notion or Idea of it. And now let our <hi>Socinian</hi> Adversaries, who talk so loud of Absurdities, Contradictions, Nonsense, false Counting and Tritheism, try their skill to make good these Charges against the Divine subsisting Relations in the Unity of the same Individual Essence.</p>

                  <p>BUT since one Nature and Essence, and Three Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stases or Persons, is the Catholick Language, and necessary to guard the Faith from those Two Extremes of <hi>Sabellianism</hi> and <hi>Arianism,</hi> it will be necessary to consider how to apply these Ecclesiastical Terms to the Three and One in the ever Blessed Trinity. And here, were I so disposed, I might enter into a very large and perplext Dispute; but my design, as far as possibly I can attain it, is only to explain what the Catholick Fathers meant by these Terms, and to give a plain and sensible Notion of them: And after what I have already so largely discoursed concerning Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Hypostasis, I have little more to do, than to compare them together, and to shew in what the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Fathers placed this Distinction. And as nothing is of greater consequence, than rightly to understand this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, so nothing requires greater Caution, nor greater Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Mind.</p>
                  <p>Whosoever is conversant in the Writings of the Ancient Fathers, must acknowledge it not only reasonable but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, to distinguish between their Faith, and their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy. Their Faith, which they received srom the Scriptures, and the Universal Tradition of the Catholick Church, is plain and simple, and the same in all. That there is but One God, who has an Eternal Son, and an Eternal Spirit; that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:50623:174"/>
each of them by himself, True and Perfect God, and all but One God, which is a Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity; that they are in a true and proper Sense, Three and One. This is the Catholick Faith, wherein they all agree; but then those Philosophical Terms, which the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Hereticks, who corrupted either the Faith of the Unity or Trinity, forced them to use in the Explication of this Mystery, are of a different Consideration: These have not always been the same, nor have all agreed in them; and the wisest Men have owned great Improprieties in them all, when applied to this Sacred Mystery; and indeed it is impossible to be otherwise; for that infinite Difference and Diversity there is between the Divine and Humane Nature, nay all created Nature, can never admit of any Common Terms proper to express both. The most perfect Creatures bear only some imperfect Analogy and Resemblance to what we conceive of God; and therefore when we apply such Words and Terms to the Divine Natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, as are borrowed from Creatures, (and we have no other) we must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them only by way of Analogy and Accommodation; and when we expound such Terms as are used by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Fathers in such an accommodated Sense, we must apply them no further, than that particular Matter they intended to represent by them.

And therefore <hi>Theorianus</hi> observes, That the Catholick Fathers understood Essence and Hypostasis in a very different sense from the <hi>Greek</hi> Philosophers;<note place="margin">Theor. <hi>Leg. ad</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> that is, by Essence, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, they did not mean one singular <hi>Individuum,</hi> or sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Nature and Substance, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> did; but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nature, not a common Notion, as Genus or Species, which are <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s second Substances, but a common Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting Nature, which is one and the same, whole and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in every Individual of the same kind. And what <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> call'd his first Substance, a singular Subsisting Nature, that they called Hypostasis, a common Subsisting Nature, with its individuating Characters and Properties.</p>
                  <p>It is evident some Ages past, before these words <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Hypostasis</hi> were thus nicely distinguished, or at least be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:50623:175"/>
this Distinction was so unanimously received; for as I have already observed, these Words were used very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously, which occasioned the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Schism; and it does not appear to me, that this Distinction was setled by <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and the Bishops with him, in that Synod, as some seem to think; though soon after it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prevailed, as we may learn from St. <hi>Basil, Gregory Nyssen,</hi> St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Damascen, Leontius, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus, Theodorus Abucara, Ignatius Sinaita,</hi> and generally all the Catholick Writers of the <hi>Eutychian</hi> and <hi>Severian</hi> Age, who universally agree in this, That Essence and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasis differ as <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as that which is Universal, differs from what is Proper and Singular.</p>
                  <p>Now so far these Fathers were certainly in the right, That if they must apply Philosophical Terms to Divine Mysteries (which the Cavilling Objections of Hereticks made necessary) there was an absolute necessity for them to change their signification; for as there is nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to God and Creatures, so there can be no words in the same sense common to them; but then this only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an accommodation of words to Divine Mysteries by way of analogy and resemblance, but not to change the Language and Philosophy of Created Nature, which after all our Attempts, and all our Art of Expression, will fall infinitely short of the Divine Nature, and give us but a very imperfect Image of it. And if by such Attempts we confound our Notions and Ideas of Nature too, we shall so much the more confound and perplex our Ideas of God. It may help to ease mens Minds of some Notions which lie cross and uneven: Briefly to state this matter.</p>
                  <p>I confess, I am not satisfied of that absolute necessity, which some pretend, of stating nicely and Philosophically this distinction between Nature and Person, in order to understand the Doctrine of the Trinity. This was the Catholick Faith long before this Distinction was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:50623:176"/>
received; and Men who understand little of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, may believe very orthodoxly in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, without it: Nay the best, the safest, and easiest way, to understand these and all other Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Terms applied to the Explication of this Faith, is to fit them to those Scripture Ideas we have of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, each of them True and Perfect God, and all Three but One God, as I have shewn at large in the First Chapter. But since there is a very warm Dispute about Nature and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erson, and has been for many Ages, and this Distinction is become necessary to secure the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith against the Attempts of Hereticks on both sides, as the Church has found by long Experience; it will be necessary to set this matter in as clear a light as possible we can.</p>
                  <p>And the best way I can think of to do this, is 1. To consider this distinction of Nature and Person in Creatures: As for instance, in a Man; What the distinction between Nature and Person is in Man; and to shew, which way soever we state this matter, how improper all these No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to represent this distinction between Nature and Person in the Blessed Trinity. And 2. To shew how the Catholick Fathers accommodated these Names of Essence and Person to the Explication of this Mystery, and what Unity, and what Distinction they intended to represent by them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for the first, If the Infinite distance between God and Creatures will allow us to Philosophize freely about Created Nature, without incurring the Suspicion of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy; I must confess, I never could form a distinct notion of the difference between a subsisting Nature and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis, or Person in Man; but do what I can, I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no otherwise of an Individual Subsisting Human Nature, but as of an Individual Subsisting Human Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:50623:176"/>
or Person; nor of an Individual Human Person, than as of an Individual Subsisting Human Nature. And I have some reason to think, that this is not peculiarly my Case; for besides that I find other thinking Men blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this matter, and could never yet meet with a clear and sensible Explication of it; I observe, that there is no word, which in its original institution signifies this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and it is reasonable to think, as to Created Nature, that Mankind have no notion of that, which they have no word for.</p>
                  <p>It is sufficiently known, that Hypostasis originally sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Essence and Substance, not Person as distinguisht from Nature, which is a later, and a mere Ecclesiastical use of it; and it is confessed, that <hi>Persona</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> were taken from the Stage, and when they were applied to signify a true and real Man, they signified only the Man himself, not the Personality of a Man, as distinguished from an Individual Subsisting Nature: And, which is much more considerable, some of the Fathers, as I observed before, confess, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> knew no such distinction; but in his Philosophy, Essence and Hypostasis signified the same thing; for Nature and Essence, which is his first Substance, is an Individuum, which subsists not as part of another, but as whole and compleat, which the Fathers call Hypostasis; and therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s first Substance, and what these Fathers call Hypostasis, is in Creatures one and the same thing; and yet all confess, That no man ever more nicely distinguisht all the distinguishable Notions in Nature, than <hi>Aristotle</hi> did, that what escaped his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, must be very nice indeed.</p>
                  <p>And though St. <hi>Basil,</hi> and St. <hi>Gregory Nyssen,</hi> and the other Catholick Writers of that Age, do distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Essence and Hypostasis, that they differ as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:50623:177"/>
and peculiar to each Individual, and distinguishes one man from another; yet I do not remember, that they quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled with the <hi>Greek</hi> Philosophers, or apprehended that they themselves taught any new Philosophy in this Point, as afterwards <hi>Theorianus,</hi> and others did; nor can I see any other difference there is between them, if candidly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, but only in words.</p>
                  <p>The short account of the matter is this. <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s first Substance, which subsists by it self, these Fathers, as they themselves own, call Hypostasis, not Nature, Essence, and Substance; that is, every subsisting Individuum is <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Nature, Essence, and Substance, the Fathers Hypostasis; now when they mean the same thing, and own that they do so, so far they are agreed in the thing, and differ only in words. But then these Fathers in every Hypostasis distinguished between the common Nature, and such Personal Properties, which distinguished com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nature into Individuals, or were Characteristical Marks, whereby to know one Person from another. Now <hi>Aristotle</hi> indeed never made such a distinction as this; but yet all that is material in it, is included in his Notion and Definition of Substance.</p>
                  <p>For when these Fathers distinguish in every Hypostasis, what is common to the whole Kind, and what is proper and peculiar to each Individuum, they mean no more by it, but that <hi>Peter,</hi> for instance, considered as a Man, is perfectly the same that <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> are, considered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so as Men, though there is something so peculiar to <hi>Peter,</hi> as to make him a particular Human Person, and to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish him from <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and all other Men in the World. Now it is certain, neither <hi>Aristotle,</hi> nor any Man of sense, would ever have denied any thing of all this; for it is evident, that there is something wherein all Men agree, and something proper to every particular Man. That which is the same in all Men, the Fathers call a common Nature,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:50623:177"/>
and so does <hi>Aristotle,</hi> a common Specifick Nature; but here is some appearance of difference between them, which I think, if rightly stated, is none at all. <hi>Aristotle</hi> makes Nature as actually subsisting by it self; as suppose Human Nature in <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Iames,</hi> to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Individuum, a particular, Singular Nature, and that it is common only in Notion, as every particular Man has a Nature of the same kind, or a true Human Nature.</p>
                  <p>These Fathers on the contrary affirm, That Human Nature, as considered in <hi>Peter,</hi> or any other particular Man, is a common Nature, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished into Hypostases, by something proper, peculiar, and particular to each.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Now as great an appearance as here is of a direct Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, a little consideration, I believe, will satisfy all thinking Men, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> would have owned all that these Fathers say, and then the only Dispute will be, which of them speak most properly, which is of no great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Cause.</p>
                  <p>For what do these Fathers mean by a common Nature? Do they mean, that there is but one Numerical Subsisting Nature common to all the Individuals? but one Universal Human Nature in all the particular men in the World?

                  <p>In this sense also these Fathers rejected an Individual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This is the best and easiest Account I can give of the Philosophy of these Fathers, concerning a Common and Individual Nature, which if it be thought a new way of speaking, yet it is what may be understood, and has a great deal of old Truth in it; and will help us to understand the

For as <hi>Damascen</hi> tells us, Every Hypostasis is perfect Nature and Substance; and therefore the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stases do not differ from each other in Nature, but only in such peculiar and Characteristical Accidents, as distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish Hypostases. For the Definition of Hypostasis is Nature with its Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: That every Hypostasis has the common Nature with its peculiar di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing Accidents, subsisting by it self. So that an Hypostasis is nothing else but Nature with its Accidents and distinguishing Characters, subsisting by it self: Now we know Accidents do not subsist by themselves, but if they be Inherent Accidents, they subsist in Nature and Substance; and therefore though they may distinguish Hypostases and Persons, do not constitute an Hypostasis, and therefore are owned to be only <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the peculiar distinguishing Marks and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:50623:180"/>
of Hypostases or Persons, whereby they are known from each other: But the Marks and Characters which distinguish Hypostases, are not the Hypostases themselves; such as the Time when they were born, the Place where they lived, their Parentage, Name, Features of Body, Endowments of Mind, and a hundred other distingushing Marks, for these are very different in different Persons, and as changeable in the same Persons, as Time, Age, Place, Features of Body, Endowments of Mind, Trades, Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet all these are Persons, and the same Persons under all these Changes.</p>
                  <p>Now setting aside all these Characters and Accidents, which cannot make a Person, but only distinguish one Person from another, there is nothing left to be the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasis or Person, but only the common Nature subsisting by it self: Common, as it is the same in every Individual, but an Hypostasis or Individuum by a separate Existence, or subsisting by it self. For an Individuum, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is one undivided Whole, subsisting by it self, and therefore a whole, perfect, undivided Human Nature, subsisting by it self, is an Hypostasis, or Person, one single, individual Man, though there were no other Mark and Character to distinguish him from other Men, but only this Separate Subsistence.</p>
                  <p>The Humanity of our Saviour is a plain Demonstration of this, that it is only a Separate Existence, or subsisting by it self (which in Created Beings is the same thing) that makes Human Nature an Hypostasis, or Person. All Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Christians own, that Christ took Human Nature on him, but not a Human Hypostasis or Person, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in him we may see the difference between Nature and Person.</p>
                  <p>What then was Christ's Human Nature? I know no more of it, but that he had a true Body of Flesh, animated by a Reasonable Soul, such a Body, and such a Soul, as
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:50623:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other Men have, and this is Human Nature: But why is not this Human Body and Soul a Human Person too? Did he want the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Marks and Characters to distinguish him from all other Human Persons? By no means! He had more of these Marks of Distinction, and more Authentick ones, than any other Man ever had. The Time and Place of his Birth, his Parentage, his Miracles, his Doctrine, the minute Circumstances of his Death, his Resurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were foretold by Ancient Prophets, and he distinguished himself from all the rest of Mankind by those wonderful things he did, that if peculiar distinguishing Characters make a Person, he was more a Person than ever any Man was before or since. What then was wanting to make us Human Nature a Human Person? Truly nothing, but only subsisting by it self, which it never did, but in union to the Eternal Word. This I think looks very like a Demonstration, that an Hypostasis is nothing but Nature subsisting by it self; for all that the Humanity of Christ had, without being a Human Person, cannot make a Person, for then the Human Nature of Christ must have been a Human Person too; and that which alone was wanting to make the Human Nature of Christ a Person, which was subsisting by it self, must be the only thing which makes Nature a Person.</p>
                  <p>I have the rather chose this Instance, because the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Christ, which is no Person, is often alledged to prove, that there must be some peculiar <hi>mode of Subsistence,</hi> which must <hi>coalesce</hi> with common Nature to make a Person.</p>
                  <p>This, I confess, is Language which I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, if there be any thing more meant by i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, than that Nature subsisting by it self is a Person: For Nature which does not subsist, is nothing but in Idea, and Subsistence is a mere Notion without something that subsists; now we may unite these two Notions of Nature and Subsistence,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:50623:181"/>
and form the Idea of a Subsisting Nature, which is all the <hi>coalescing</hi> I know of; but actual Production makes a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting Nature, which is not <hi>Nature and Subsistence,</hi> or <hi>a mode of Subsistence coalescing,</hi> but Nature in Act. In a Subsisting Created Nature, which does not necessarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist, we may distinguish between the Notions of Nature and Subsistence, but a Subsisting Nature is nothing but Nature in being, Nature which is, that is, Nature it self; for the meer Idea of Nature is not Nature. But <hi>Subsistence has a Mode,</hi> and there must be a peculiar manner of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence to make a Person: Must every Person then have a peculiar manner of Subsistence? Are there then as many peculiar Manners and Modes of Subsistence, as there are, or ever have been, or ever shall be, distinct Persons in the World? This is beyond my Philosophy. I have heard of a Compleat and Incompleat Subsistence, to subsist by it self, or to subsist as a Part in the Whole, or an Accident in a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, &amp;c. but I never could understand, that any other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence strictly belongs to the Notion of an Hypostasis or Person, but to subsist by it self. The Human Nature of Christ did upon all other Accounts, as truly and properly subsist, as any other Man in the World, but was no Person, as not subsisting by it self, but in Union to the Eternal Word; which made it the Human Nature of the Word, which was made Flesh, and dwelt amongst us.</p>
                  <p>All this Talk about the different Modes and manner of Subsistence, seems to be a mistake of the Fathers Doctrine concerning the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which these Men tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate <hi>Modes of Subsistence,</hi> of which more anon; but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent I only observe, That the Fathers do not place the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in these Modes of Subsistence, but only distinguish and characterize their Persons by them, and from thence prove the real distinction of Persons in the Individual Unity of the Divine Essence: But then I do not remember, that they so much as distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish

all Created Persons by their <hi>peculiar Modes of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know very well, that both <hi>Damascen</hi> and others, give an Example of this in <hi>Adam, Eve,</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi>; that <hi>Adam</hi> was immediately formed by God of the Dust of the Earth, <hi>Eve</hi> formed of one of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Ribs, and <hi>Seth</hi> begotten of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> which they call their <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which in this Example can signify nothing else but their different manner of Production, not different Modes of Subsistence; but then they do not alledge this as the formal Reason of Personality, nay not as necessary to the distinction of Persons, (though such Peculiarities, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, will always distinguish Persons) but all they designed by it, was to prove, that such different ways of coming into being, made no change or alteration in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for <hi>Adam, Eve,</hi> and <hi>Seth,</hi> had all the same Human Nature, though formed after such a different manner; in answer to the <hi>Arian</hi> Objection against the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> that an Unbegotten and Begotten Nature cannot be the same, and therefore Father and Son not Consubstantial.<note place="margin">Damasc. Orth. Fid. l. 1. c. 9.</note> Indeed this would have been a very ill Example of the Distinction of Persons by these different Modes of Subsistence, because it could only distinguish <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> from all the rest of Mankind; for all Mankind ever since, excepting our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, have come into the World the same way that <hi>Seth</hi> did, and therefore are not distinguished by a peculiar manner of Subsistence, for they have all the same; and consequently ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are not distinct Persons, or else such peculiar Modes of Subsistence, <hi>coalescing with common Nature,</hi> do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute the Person.

And herein both Fathers and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, notwithstanding some difference in words, seem well enough agreed, and this is all that I need say concerning the Distinction between Nature and Person in Created Beings.</p>
                  <p>But now every one who understands the True Catholick Faith of the Trinity, must needs be sensible, how impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per all this is to explain that Venerable Mystery of One Nature, and Three Persons, in the Unity of the Godhead, if we apply these Terms strictly and properly.</p>
                  <p>The Catholick Fathers would not allow <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Nature, Essence, and Substance, that it is that which subsists by it self; because this leaves no possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble distinction between Essence and Hypostasis, without which we can never defend the Faith of One Nature in Three Persons; for what in his Sense thus subsists by it self, is an Individual and Singular Nature, which is the same with Hypostasis, and then it is impossible there should be Three Hypostases in One Singular Nature, which is but One Hypostasis.</p>
                  <p>But after all, Do these Fathers deny, that the Divine Nature is One Individual Nature? Do they not, as I have largely shewn, make this the Fundamental Reason of the Divine Unity, That there is but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, One Divinity in Three Perfect Hypstases; and that this One Divinity is <gap reason="foreign">

So that in some Sense these Fathers own, That the Divine Nature is as True an Individuum, and infinitely a more Perfect
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:50623:182"/>
                     <hi>Vnit</hi> and <hi>Monad,</hi> than <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s First Substance, though his First Substance is, and can be but One Hypostasis, and the Divine Nature subsists perfectly in Three.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to qualify this, they tell us, That Nature signifies the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that which is common to all the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postases of the same Nature; but the Hypostasis is the common Nature with some peculiar and distinguishing Properties, subsisting separately by it self; and this seems to give us a better image and resemblance of One Nature in Three Hypostases; for here is one common Nature, not only in Three, but in all the distinct Hypostases of that Nature, that ever were, or ever shall be: But I'm sure this needs greater qualification, when applied to the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Trinity, than <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irst Substance, or it will unavoidably introduce, not merely <hi>Tritheism,</hi> but <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytheism</hi> without end; for God can limit the Numbers of Created Hypostases, but the number of Hypostases in an Infinite necessary Nature can never be limited, if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature be common to the Divine Hypostases, only as Humane Nature is common to Human Hypostases.</p>
                  <p>They teach, as I have already observed, That Human Nature, for instance, is a common Nature, and that every Hypostasis, or every particular Man has this same common Nature; but then it is a common Nature, not as it is nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically One in all, for it subsists separately in every Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasis, and therefore in this sense is not One common Numerical, Individual Nature; but it is common only, as it is perfectly the same in all. Which they will not allow to be a meer common Notion, but a common Specifick Nature; for the Nature is the Species, which is the foundation of the common Predication: For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Men have the common Name and Definition of a Man, because they have the same common Human Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="352" facs="tcp:50623:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>And thus, though every Hypostasis has not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a particular Nature, as that signifies a distinction in the Nature it self, yet it has the common Specifick Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Nature; that is, that Nature which makes the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and is common, as it is the same in all, but yet sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists individually <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and separately in each Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis. But now will any Catholick Christian say, that thus it is in the Ever Blessed Trinity? That the One Common Divinity is One and Common, only as One Common Humanity is, that is, that it is perfectly the same in all? not One Individual, but One Specifick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Or will he say, That each Divine Person has one whole intire Specifick Divinity, as every Human Person has a whole Specifick Humanity? As far as I can see, this would as unavoidably make Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Three Gods, as <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> are three Men; and a common Nature, and personal Properties, and different Modes of Subsistence, would no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a Trinity of Gods. than a Trinity of Men.</p>
                  <p>This, I think, plainly shews, how vain an Attempt it is to find out any Notions of Unity and Distinction, of Nature and Person, or any words to express those Notions by, common to God and Creatures. These Creature-Ideas, and Creature Terms, can be applied to God only by way of Analogy and Accommodation, and that a very imperfect one too.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us then consider, how the Catholick Fathers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated these Names of <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Person</hi> to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Mystery, and what they intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present by them. I shall do this in as few words as possibly I can, that what I have to say may be the more easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>
                  <p>They tell us, That all Nature is common, that Human Nature is common to all Mankind, and the Divine Nature common to all the Three Divine Persons, Father, Son,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:50623:183"/>
and Holy Ghost; not that they thought the Divinity or Godhead a common Nature, merely as Human Nature is common, but there is this Analogy between them; that the Divine Nature is not singular, or does not subsist in Singularity, but in Three Hypostases, as Human Nature is common, because it is not confined to one, but is in all Human Hypostases; and that the Divine Nature is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and invariably the same in each Hypostasis, as the Human Nature is, which for this Reason is called a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, not a particular Nature; which is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Sameness, Identity, not Singularity, of Nature in the Blessed Trinity. Thus far the Analogy holds, (which is a direct opposition both to <hi>Sabellianism</hi> and <hi>Arianism)</hi> but it reaches no farther; for the Divine Nature is not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Specifick Nature, as all Created Nature is common, for the Godhead is no Species; that is, there is, and can be but One God: Which I have already at large shewn to be the Sense of the Fathers. They expresly teach, That the Divine Nature is an Individual Nature, but not Singular; it is common, as being whole and perfect in more Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stases than One, which excludes Singularity, but it is one whole Entire, Individual Nature; so one Individual, as Human Nature is one in one Man. For though Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual and Singular is the same in Creatures, it is not so in the Divine Nature; nor can it be, if the Catholick Faith be One Nature, One Divinity in Three Perfect Hypostases: And if we can form any sensible Notion of this, it will si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence all the pretences of Jargon, Nonsense, Contradiction, Tritheism, which are so constantly objected against this Venerable Mystery. And therefore I shall briefly inquire, 1. What that One Divinity is, which is common to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and how it is common: 2. How this <hi>common Nature</hi> is in a strict and proper Sense, One <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual</hi> Nature. And I think this is easily accounted for from the Doctrine of the Fathers.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="354" facs="tcp:50623:184"/>1. As for the first; This <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, One Divinity, is the Divinity of the Father, the <hi>Natura Patris,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Nature of the Father, and the Divinity of the Father, who is the Eternal Self-originated Mind, which has no Second, and therefore there can be no other, no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, or Third Divinity. Now this One Divine Nature, One Divinity of the Father, is common to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: Common, I say, not merely as Human Nature is common to all Men, because it is the same in all, perfectly the same <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, though it be not the same Individual Nature in all, which is singular and incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable in Creatures; but it is common by a perfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, whole of whole; that it is no New Divinity, but the Divinity of the Father, which is in the Son, who is therefore so often, as I observed above, called the Nature, and Divinity, and Mind of the Father, his Image and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and that which is signified by all this, his Eternal, Living, Omnipotent Word. I do not intend to prove all this over again, which I have abundantly proved already, but only to put every thing into its proper place, that we may view the Whole in a true light.</p>
                  <p>This Divine Nature then of the Father which is but One, is that One Divinity, which is by an Eternal Ineffable Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration communicated whole and perfect to the Son, and by a like Eternal and Ineffable Procession to the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: But still the difficulty is, How this is One Nature, which is not Singular, nor subsists in Singularity, but in Three Proper, Distinct, Compleat Hypostases, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And therefore rightly to apprehend this, we must inquire into the Notion of One Individual Nature. Now that which is most obvious, and which the Fathers perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually alledge in justification of the Divine Unity, is, That an Individual is an undivided Nature, and therefore the One Divinity of the Father, though actually communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:50623:184"/>
to the Son, and Holy Spirit, is One Individual Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, because it is communicated whole and perfect, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Division or Separation; and that which is undivided is One.</p>
                  <p>But though to be <hi>undivided</hi> be essential to the Notion of an Individual Nature, yet there must be something else to compleat this Notion, or at least to give us a more distinct conception of it.</p>
                  <p>Could Human Nature propagate it self whole and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat to Two or Three, without any division or separation of Substance, this could not make it One Individual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though they were undivided; for One Individual Nature, is One whole Compleat Nature, without division; which is all that is essential to such a Being, and is this all but once, and that without division.</p>
                  <p>But how will this agree with the Notion of One Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or One Individual Divine Nature? For does not the One Divine Nature, which is the Divinity of the Father, subsist compleatly and distinctly, though without division and separation, in the Son and Holy Ghost; and will you call this One Individual Nature, which is not singularly in One, but subsists distinctly in Three? Yes, I will, because all these Three, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Notion of One Divinity, and therefore are One Individual Divinity in Three; for an Individual Nature is that, which without division has all that is essential to such a Nature.</p>
                  <p>Well, But is not the Father then, in his own Person, True and Perfect God, and the Son True and Perfect God, and the Holy Ghost True and Perfect God? that is, Have not each of these Divine Persons all the Divine Perfections included in the Notion and Idea of God? And are they not Three who have all the Perfections of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? and how then is this One Individual Nature?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:50623:185"/>I answer: When I say, That One Individual Nature is that which has all that is essential to such a Nature; by <hi>Essential</hi> I mean, not only Essential Properties, Qualities, Powers, and Perfections, (which are commonly called Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there being no other notion of Nature in Created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) but Essential Productions too, which (when there is any such thing) are as essential to Nature, as any other Properties or Perfections. In the first Sense of <hi>Essential,</hi> the Divine Nature is not singular, but communicated by the Eternal Father to the Eternal Son, and by Father and Son to the Eternal Spirit, and all Three are Infinite in Wisdom, Power, and Goodness, and all other Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. This is but One Divinity, One Godhead; for there is not a Second and Third Divinity in the Son, and in the Holy Spirit, but the One Divinity of the Father.</p>
                  <p>But yet we must confess, that here is Number; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are Three, and how can that Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is perfectly and distinctly in Three, be One In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Nature, One Numerically; One as Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in every particular Man is One?</p>
                  <p>Now this must be resolved into the second Notion of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential,</hi> for Essential Productions; for all Essential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions in the Unity of Nature, though they may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished and numbred among themselves, are but One Individual Nature. It will be in vain to seek for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this in Created Nature, and I believe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it will be evident without it.</p>
                  <p>An Eternal Self-originated Mind is True and Perfect God, the First Supreme Cause of all things, and has all the Perfections of the Divinity wholly in it self, is the One and only True God: But if it be essential to an Eternal Mind to have an Eternal, Living, Subsisting Word and Spirit, by an Eternal Generation and Procession, then this Eternal Word and Spirit are essential to an Eternal
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:50623:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Mind, not as Essential Perfections, or Essential Parts, but as Essential Productions or Processions in the Unity and Identity of Nature. Thus the Scripture represents this Mystery, That there is One God, who has an Eternal Word, and an Eternal Spirit; and the Catholick Fathers, as I have already observed, insist on this as a natural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of a Trinity, That the Eternal Mind must have its Eternal Word and Eternal Spirit. Now if the Eternal Word and Eternal Spirit are essential to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mind, it is certain, that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the Eternal Mind, its Word, and Spirit, are but One Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Divinity; every thing that is essential, is included in the Notion of an Individual Nature; for that is not a Compleat and Perfect Nature, nor an adequate notion of Nature, that wants any thing that is essential. Now though we may have a general Notion and Idea of a God, That he is an Absolutely Perfect Being, which Includes all the Divine Attributes and Perfections, without knowing any thing of the Son, or Holy Ghost; yet if we consider this Absolutely Perfect Being as Eternal Self-originated Mind, with its Eternal Word and Spirit, as essential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions or Processions, we can consider them no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, but as One Individual Divinity; this Eternal Word and Spirit being essential Processions of the Eternal Mind, which can never be separated from it: For such essential Processions are not only coeval and consubstantial with the Nature from whence they proceed; as the Sun, its Light and Heat, (by which Argument the Catholick Fathers proved the Coeternity and Consubstantiality of the Son and Holy Spirit with the Eternal Father) but whatever distinction there is between them, they are One Individual Nature, if all that be One Individual Nature, which is essential to such a Being; and such all essential Processions are, as well as essential Perfections. These are two very different Questions, and of a very different consideration,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:50623:186"/>
                     <hi>What God is?</hi> and <hi>Who this God is?</hi> In an answer to the first, we form the Idea and Notion of all Divine Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or of an absolutely Perfect Being, which is the true notion of the Divinity, and whoever has all these Divine Perfections, is True and Perfect God; and this is our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural notion of God, as that signifies the Divinity, which gives no notice of any distinction in the Divinity; for there can be no diversity in Absolute Perfections and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no distinction or number, according to the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the Fathers.</p>
                  <p>But when we consider who God is, or what is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of all these Divine Perfections, we can form no other Idea of it, but an <hi>Eternal, Infinite, Self originated Mind</hi>; this the Wisest Philosophers, as well as Christians, are agreed in, That God is an Infinite Mind; and this right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained, may teach us some distinction in the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for all Men must grant, what they feel in themselves, that every Mind has its Word and Spirit, and cannot be conceived without them; and therefore the Eternal Mind must have its Eternal word and Spirit too; and the reason why this did not lead all Mankind into the natural belief of a Trinity of Persons, <hi>Mind, Word,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> in the Unity of the Godhead, was plainly this, Because they found that their own Word and Spirit were not permanent, subsisting Persons, but were the perishing Creatures of the Mind, which were no sooner produced, but died and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished as our Thoughts do, and thus they conceived it was with the Divine Mind; which is one kind of <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> as I observed above: But yet the Catholick Fathers thought this natural belief, That the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is not <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that the Divinity, or Divine Mind, is not without its Word, a very proper Medium to prove a real subsisting Word in the Divinity; for an Infinite Perfect Mind, which is all Life, Being, Substance, if it begets its own Word, as every Mind does, must beget a Living, Substantial, Subsisting
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:50623:186"/>
Word, the perfect Image and Character of its own Life and Infinite Being.</p>
                  <p>However, thus much I think we must own, That since every Mind must have its Word and Spirit in the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Unity of its own Nature; and the Holy Scripture as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us, that God, who is the most perfect Mind, has his Word and Spirit, and that this Divine Word and Spirit is an Eternal, Living, Subsisting Word and Spirit, this is a very good foundation for the belief of a Real Trinity both from Reason and Scripture. The natural Notion and Idea of a Mind, teaches us this distinction in the Divinity; and Natural Reason strongly infers, from the perfect Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of an infinitely perfect Mind; that the Divine Word and Spirit must be an Eternal, Living, Infinite Word and Spirit; and the Holy Scripture confirms all this: And therefore Scripture and Reason are so far from contradicting each other in this Article, that the Belief of the Trinity, though it be ultimately resolved into the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Revelation, yet has Reason on its side, as far as it can judge of such matters: Which proves a considerable Authority, when the obscure and imperfect Conjectures of Reason, are explained and confirmed by Revelation. For though the Notion of an absolutely perfect Being, which is the Natural Idea of the Divinity, teaches no such distinction, yet the Idea of an Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perfect and Self-originated Mind, which is as natural a Notion of God, does.<note place="margin">

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:50623:187"/>
shews the distinction of Persons in the Unity of the Divine Nature. But then (which is what I intended in all this) this very distinction proves one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Divinity, because it is in the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Unity of the same Numerical, not Specifick Nature; for all essential Processions, as the Eternal Word and Spirit are, which cannot so much as in Thought be separated from Original Mind, must continue in the Unity of the same individual Nature.</p>
                  <p>This is what the Fathers meant by the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the One common Divinity, which is individually One in Three perfect Hypostases, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: The Divinity of the Father, of Eternal, Self-originated Mind, is the common Divinity, communicated to the Eternal Word and Spirit, in the individual Unity of Nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now this will give us some Notion of the distinction of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> in the Eternal Godhead. I say, <hi>Persons,</hi> not <hi>Person</hi>; which I take to be the fundamental Mistake which has obscured and perplex'd this Mystery. Men have rack'd their Inventions, to find out some distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between Nature and Person in every single Person in the Godhead; which it is certain these Fathers never thought of; though their Attempt to distinguish between Nature and Person in every Man, gave some occasion to this Mistake: But I have already proved both from Fathers and Schoolmen, That when they spoke distinctly of each particular Person, they made Person and Nature the same: That the Person of the Father is the Nature of the Father, and the Person of the Son the Nature of the Son. Nor indeed had they any occasion to distinguish between Nature and Person in each single Person, which could do no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in this Mystery: For the true reason and occasion for this distinction, was to reconcile the Individual Unity of the Divine Nature, with a Trinity of real Hypostases or
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:50623:187"/>
Persons; how One Nature can subsist in Three distinct Hypostases, and continue One Individual Nature: Which had been no difficulty at all, were not each Divine Person by himself the Divine Nature. But how the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should subsist whole and perfect in Three distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and not be Three distinct Natures, but One Nature, and One Divinity; not specifically, but individually and numerically One; This was the difficulty they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to answer; which the distinction between Nature and Person in each single Person could not answer: For let us suppose such a distinction as this, whatever it be; if the Divine Nature subsist whole and perfect in each distinct Person, the difficulty still remains how the Persons are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, and the Nature individually One: As, to put the Case in Human Nature; whatever distinction we allow between Nature and Person in every particular Man; if we allow that every Man has Human Nature as distinctly in himself, as he is a distinct Person, the distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Nature and Person can never prove the Individual Numerical Unity of Human Nature in Three Men.</p>
                  <p>The Question then is, Not how Nature and Person is distinguish'd in each single Person, (much less, how Three Persons in One singular Nature are distinguished from that singular Nature, which unavoidably reduces a Trinity of Persons to an unintelligible Trinity of Modes); but, How the Three Persons in the Ever-blessed Trinity, which are Three in number, and each of them the Divine Nature, are distinguished from that One Individual Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which is in them all, or rather, which they all are. Now what I have already said, seems to me to give a very intelligible Notion of this, <hi>viz. That the Divine Nature, which is but One, is the Eternal, Self-originated Divinity, with its Eternal, Essential Processions or Productions</hi>; which, as I have already shewn, are but One, not Singular, but Individual Nature, and Individual Divinity: But then
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:50623:188"/>
this One Self-originated Divinity is most certainly an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, Eternal, Self-originated Person, if Infinite, Eternal, Self-originated Mind be a Person; and these Eternal Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Processions are Persons also, if an Eternal, Living, Subsisting Word be a Person, and an Eternal, Living, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting Spirit be a Person; and then it is evident, that there are Three Eternal, Subsisting Persons in the Individual Unity of Nature. These Divine Processions do not mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply nor divide the Divine Nature, because they are essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to an Infinite Mind, and are Processions <hi>ad intra</hi> in the perfect Identity (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>For these Three Divine Persons have their different Characters and Order, whereby they are distinguished from each other, which the Fathers call the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, signify that there are Three that do actually exist, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a different manner: That is, That the Father is Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, Self-originated Divinity, is God of himself, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other cause of his Being, and this Self-originated Unbegotten Divinity is the Person of the Father, and in the highest and most absolute sense the One God. The Son is Eternally begotten of his Father's Substance, and lives and subsists in him; and so the Holy Ghost Eternally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Father and Son: That is, There is One Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Self-originated Divinity with its two Eternal Processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the perfect Unity and Identity of the same Nature. The Father's manner of subsistence is easily understood, and secures to him the Prerogative of the One True God; but we must shew this a little more plainly with reference to the Son and Holy Spirit, each of which is by himself True and Perfect God, but not a Second and Third God: The right understanding of which depends upon the true stating of their different manners of subsistence.</p>
                  <p>And here I need only refer to what I have already dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed concerning the difference between an Absolute Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Relative Subsistencies in the same Nature. An Absolute Nature is a whole Compleat Nature, with all that essentially belongs to such a Nature, as every perfect Man has all that belongs essentially to the Nature of Man, and thus a Man begets a Man in his own Nature and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and the Son, which is begotten, is upon all accounts as much a Man, as he who begets, and Father and Son are two Men: And to beget, and to be begotten, tho they prove their Persons to be distinct, yet are but External Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations not different manners of subsistence in the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And thus God does not beget a Son, which would be to beget a Second God: For to beget, and to be begotten, when he who begets, begets in an absolute sense all the same that he
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:50623:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is himself, makes two of the same kind. And therefore we must observe, That <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is the Personal Character and Property of the Father, does not only signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, that he has no cause of his Being and Nature, but that what he is, he is absolutely in himself, has an Absolute, not a Relative Nature and Subsistence; and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is the Personal Property of the Son, signifies that his Being and Nature is Relative; not only, that he receives his Being and Nature from his Father, but that he so receives it, as to be a Relative Subsistence in his Father's Nature; and the like may be said of the Procession of the Holy Ghost. As to shew this more particularly.</p>
                  <p>God begets a Son, his own perfect Image and Likeness, but he does not beget his own Absolute Nature in his Son, as Man does, though he begets his Son of his own Nature and Substance; as for instance. God is Perfect, Absolute, Original Mind, not only as <hi>Original</hi> is opposed to what has a Cause, and a Beginning, but as opposed to an Image; but God does not beget an Absolute Original Mind in his Son, but only his own Eternal, Essential Word, which is the Perfect, Living Image of Eternal, Self-originated Mind, and is it self Eternal, Infinite Mind, in the Eternal Word; but is in its own proper Character, the Eternal Word of the Eternal Mind, not originally an Eternal Mind it self. It has all the Perfections of an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mind, as a Perfect Word must of necessity have, which is the perfect Sameness and Identity of Nature; but it has all these Perfections, not as Original Mind, but as a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Word, which is a different Mode of Subsistence, and a sensible distinction between the Eternal Mind and its Word in the perfect Identity of Nature.</p>
                  <p>This I take to be a True and Intelligible Account of these different manners of Subsistence, which distinguish the Divine Persons in the perfect Unity of Nature, that they have all the same Nature, and same Perfections, but
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:50623:189"/>
after a different manner; which can never be understood in Absolute Natures and Persons, for three Men, though Father, Son, and Grandson, have all of them Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture after the very same manner; but in an Absolute Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Relative Essential Processions, this is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, and proves a real distinction, and perfect Unity. It is evident to all Men, that the Mind and its Word are Two; and it is as evident, that Life, Wisdom, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, are in Absolute, Original Mind, after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than they are in its Word; and yet the very Notion of a Mind, and its Word, and that Essential Relation that is between them, makes it a contradiction to say, that any other Life, Wisdom, Knowledge, can be in the Word, than what is in the Mind; which would be to say, That the Word is not the Word of the Mind, if it have any thing that is not in the Mind: For a Natural Word can have nothing but what is in the Mind, and is no farther a Word, than it is the Natural Image of the Mind: And the like may be said concerning the Holy Spirit, which hath all the same Divine Perfections, but in a different manner, from Original Mind, and its Word, as eternally proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from both.</p>
                  <p>This is the Account which the Catholick Fathers give of the Unity of Nature, and Distinction of Persons, in the Ever Blessed Trinity, which answers the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our <hi>Sabellian, Arian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Adversaries, and vindicates those Catholick Forms of Speech, which they charge with Tritheism, Contradiction, and Nonsense: As to shew this briefly in one view, for each part of it has been sufficiently confirmed already.</p>
                  <p>The Catholick Faith teaches us, That there is but One God; and this is demonstrable from the Doctrine of these Fathers. For in this Account I have now given, there is but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, One Absolute Divinity, One Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore but One God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:50623:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>But, say our Adversaries, One God in Natural Religion, and according to the general Sense of Mankind, signifies One Person, who is God: And this also in some sense has always been owned by the Catholick Church; That as there is but One Absolute Divinity, so the Person of the Father, who is this One Absolute Divinity, is this One God; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, there is but One Person, who is God, in this Absolute Sense, because there is but One Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who, as they often speak, is the Fountain of the Deity, that is, of the Divine Processions, of the Son and Holy Spirit: He is the Whole Absolute Divinity himself, and whatever is Divine, Eternally and Essentially proceeds from him, in the Unity of his own Nature.</p>
                  <p>But at this rate, what Divinity do we leave for the Son, and the Holy Spirit? Truly, the very same by Eternal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Procession, which is originally and absolutely in the Father: For it is the Nature of the Father, and the Divinity of the Father, which is in the Son and Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; as the Fathers constantly own, and as of necessity it must be, because there is no other.</p>
                  <p>This Eternal Generation and Procession has always been owned as an ineffable Mystery; which we must believe upon the Authority of the Scriptures, without pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know how God begets an Eternal Son, or how the Eternal Spirit proceeds from Father and Son, which we confess we have no Notion of; but we know likewise, That this is no reason to reject this Faith, no more than it is a reason to reject the belief of an Eternal, Self-originated Being; because though it be demonstrable, That there must be an Eternal First Cause of all things, which has no Cause of its own Being, but an Eternal necessary Nature, yet we can no more conceive this, than we can an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation and Procession.</p>
                  <p>Supposing therefore (without disputing that matter at present) that God has an Eternal Son; that Eternal, Self-originated
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:50623:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Mind has an Eternal, Subsisting Word, and an Eternal Spirit, it is evident that this Eternal Word and Eternal Spirit, must have all the same Perfections of the Eternal Mind, must be all that the Eternal Mind is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, excepting its being an Absolute, Self-origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Mind. Now if he be God, who has the whole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature and Perfections, then the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, who by Eternal Generation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession have that same Divinity which is absolutely and originally in the Father.</p>
                  <p>Well then: Here is One Divine Person, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father, who is absolutely and originally God; and Two more, the Son, and Holy Ghost, who are each of them in his own Person, true and perfect God, by having all the Divine Perfections: But are not these Three then Three Gods? the Unbegotten God, who is originally and absolutely God, the Begotten God, and the Proceeding God. No, it is the constant Doctrine of the Catholick Fathers, that the Trinity is but One Divinity, and One God, <hi>una Summa res,</hi> One Supreme Being, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> taught, and from him <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> and was confirmed by the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> in the Condemnation of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot <hi>Ioachim.</hi> For Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, though they are Three true and proper Persons, are but One In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Nature; for it is Essential to the Eternal Mind to have its Eternal Word and Eternal Spirit, and the Eternal Word and Spirit live and subsist in the Mind; and though living, subsisting Persons, yet are as individually One with the Mind, as a Created Mind, its Word and Spirit are One.</p>
                  <p>Whatever is Essential to Nature, is in the Individual Unity of it; and that is but One Individual Nature which has nothing but what is Essential to it; and therefore if, as I have already observed, and as the Catholick Faith teaches, the Son and Spirit, the Eternal Word and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:50623:191"/>
Spirit, are Essential Processions of Eternal Original Mind, and essentially, indivisibly, and inseparably in it; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are as essentially and inseparably One Individual Divinity, as any One Nature is One with it self.</p>
                  <p>But is not this a kind of <hi>Sabellian</hi> Composition of a God? A whole Divinity made up of Three partial and incomplete Divinities? Which St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> calls a <hi>Triformis Deus:</hi>

                     </note> By no means! What is compounded, is made up of Parts, which make a compound Nature; but perfect Hypostases, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever united, can make no Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: However you unite <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> you can never make a compound Man of them, because each of them have a perfect Human Nature; and as <hi>Damascen</hi> observes, we do not say, That the Nature or Species is made up of the Hypostases, but is in the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stases: So that each Divine Person, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a complete and perfect Hypostasis, having the whole Divine Nature in himself, as being True and Perfect God; their Union in the same Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Nature, though it makes them One Essential Divinity, yet it cannot make a Compound God; for however their Persons are united, the Divinity or Divine Nature is not compounded, each of them being True and Perfect God, and not One God by Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by an Individual Unity of Nature in Three. For every Divine Person is not God, in the same sense,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:50623:191"/>
that every Human Person is a Man, as having an Absolute Individual Nature of his own; for in this sense the Father only is God, as being Absolute Original Divinity, an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Self-originated Mind; and Three such Persons must be acknowledged to be Three Gods; but as I have been forced often to repeat it, the Son and Holy Spirit are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons, as they are Eternal, Living, Subsisting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions in the Divine Nature, which proves them to have the very same Divinity, and to be but One Individual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, but not One Compound God. For One Individual Nature in Three, though distinguisht into Distinct Subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Persons, makes such a natural, inseparable Unity of Will, Energy, and Power, that they are as perfectly One Almighty Agent, as every single Person is One Agent, as I have shewn above.</p>
                  <p>It is thought by some a manifest Contradiction to say, as the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed teaches us, <hi>The Father is God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God, and yet there are not Three Gods, but One God.</hi> But whoever carefully considers what I have now said, must own, that this is the only true and proper way of speaking in this Mystery. If there be but One Absolute Divinity, there can be but One God; for the Divine Processions in the Unity and Identity of the same Individual Nature, cannot multiply the Divinity, nor multiply the Name and Title of God; for the Name God does not originally, absolutely, and immediately belong to them, but only relatively: The proper immediate Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Second Person in the Trinity is, not God, but the Son of God, and the Word of God; and so the Third, is the Spirit of God. And though we must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily own, that the Son of God, and the Spirit of God, are each of them True and Perfect God, equal in all Divine Perfections to the Father, as being all the same that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, excepting his being a Father; yet they are not Three Gods, for this is not their immediate, Original Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:50623:192" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but there is One God the Father, his Eternal Son, and Eternal Spirit. This is what I have above observed from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> That there is One God with his Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that is, his Son and Spirit, and that Christ is called God, when he is spoken of by himself; but when he is named to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Father, he must have his own proper Title, which is the Son of God; and the Reason is the same, as to the Holy Spirit; by which Rule, we can never say, That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, though each of them be God, are Three Gods; but there are Three, God the Father, his Son, and Holy Spirit: The Father God of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, the Son and Spirit Eternal Processions, and Divine Subsisting Relations in the Unity and Identity of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Godhead. They have all the same Divinity, their Glory equal, their Majesty coeternal, but their different manner of having it, the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, distinguishes their Names and Characters: The Father is God, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely God, an Unbegotten, Self-originated Being; so God, that there is no other God besides him. The Son is not absolutely God, but the Son of God; and when he is called God in Scripture, it is in no other sense,-but as the Son of God; for the Son of God, must be God the Son: Nor is the Holy Spirit absolutely God, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, which is all we mean, when we call him God; for the Spirit of God must be God the Holy Ghost: This is the Catholick Faith, and let any Man try if he can find Three Gods in it: For when we number Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, we must not number them by the common Name of Nature, which is One Undivided Divinity in them all; but by their Relative Names and Characters, which do not only distinguish their Persons, but signify their Unity, Order, and Relations in the same Nature. We must not call them Three Gods, because <hi>God</hi> is not the original Name of the Son, or Spirit, and therefore they are not Three Gods; but there are Three in the Unity
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:50623:192"/>
of the Godhead. The One God the Father, the Son of God, and the Spirit of God; so that there is but One God in the Christian Faith, if the Son of God be the Son of this One God the Father; and the Spirit of God, be the Spirit of this same One God: And though the Son of God be God, and the Spirit of God be God, that is the Name of their Nature, not of their Persons, and therefore can no more be multiplied with the Persons, than the Divine Nature is. The Son of God is God, but it is <hi>Authoritate Paternae Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,</hi> as St. <hi>Hilary</hi> speaks, not by any Absolute Godhead of his own, but in right of his Father's Nature and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which he received by an Eternal Generation. Thus it must be, where there is but One Absolute Nature, with its Internal Processions.</p>
                  <p>Let us put the Case in a Human Mind, and suppose, That its Word and Spirit were Distinct, Living, Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Hypostases in the Mind, Essential Processions in the Unity and Identity of Nature, perfectly the same with the Mind, but distinct Hypostases; but would any one for this Reason, call these Three, Three Men, or Three Minds? And yet such a Living, Subsisting Word, and a Living Subsisting Spirit, would as perfectly have the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Mind as the Mind it self, but neither of them would be an absolute Mind, but one the Word of the Mind, and the other the Spirit of the Mind; not Three Minds, but One Mind, with its Essential Word, and Spirit.</p>
                  <p>This, though an Imaginary Case, gives us a sensible representation of the difference between the Eternal Mind, and its Eternal Word and Spirit; which I freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge cannot properly be called Three Infinite Minds and Spirits; for though the Eternal, Subsisting Word is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mind, and so the Eternal, Subsisting Spirit, yet <hi>Mind,</hi> as well as <hi>God,</hi> is the Name of their Nature, not of their Persons, which is Identically one and the same in all.</p>

                     <pb n="372" facs="tcp:50623:193"/>This, as I take it, is what some Learned and truly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Writers mean, in distinguishing the several Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of this Name <hi>God.</hi> That sometimes it signifies the Divine Nature and Essence in general; as when we say, The Trinity is One God, that is, One Divinity; that there is but One Divine Nature and Essence in all the Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the Holy Trinity: Sometimes it signifies Personally, as when we say, The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God; that is, the Person of the Father, the Person of the Son, and the Person of the Holy Ghost is God: But then they are still forced to acknowledge, that the Name <hi>God</hi> is not predicated <hi>Vnivocally</hi> of all Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See Doctor</hi> Payn<hi>'s Letter to the</hi> B <hi>of</hi> R.</note> but that the Father is God in a more excellent and eminent Sense, than the Son is God, or the Holy Ghost God, as being God of himself, an Unbegotten, Self-origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated God, the Fountain of the Deity to the Son and Holy Spirit: Upon which account he is so often by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Fathers called the One God, and the only True God. Now all this is very True, and very Catholick, but with all submission, it seems to me to be an inconvenient way of speaking, which perplexes the Article with different Senses, and is liable to great Cavils and Misconstructions, as the Examples of Dr. <hi>Payn,</hi> and the Author of the 28 Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, witness; and when most dexterously managed, will sooner silence than convince an Adversary.</p>
                  <p>The Divine Essence must be considered only as in the Divine Persons; when we say, That the Trinity is One God, the true meaning is, That Three Persons are One God; and the general abstract Notion of the Unity of Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence does not account for this, but the Unity of the Divine Essence in Three.</p>
                  <p>Thus to say, That the Father is God in the highest sense of that Name God; and that He <hi>alone (strictly speaking) is a Being absolutely perfect, because he alone is Self-existent, and all other Beings, even the Son and Holy Ghost are from
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:50623:193"/>
him</hi>; may be expounded to a very Catholick Sense, and was certainly so meant; but is liable to great Cavils, when Men take more pains to pick Quarrels with Words, than to understand an Author. An Absolutely Perfect God; and a God that wants any Perfection, sounds not only like Two Gods, but like Gods of different Kinds; for every diversity of Nature alters the Species.</p>
                  <p>All that is meant by this is certainly True and Catholick, and taught in express words by the Primitive Fathers; That the Father is not the Son, nor the Son the Father; that the Son is all that the Father is, excepting his being the Father, and unbegotten, that is, excepting Paternity, and <hi>Self-existence,</hi> or Self-origination; and that upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Father is eminently called the One God, the Son, God of God; that is, God as the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>What I have now discoursed seems to me to give the fairest Account of this Matter. I take the Name <hi>God</hi> always to signify a Person, in whom the Divine Nature is, not the Divinity in the Abstract; and then the Name <hi>God</hi> must belong to any Person after the same manner, as the Divine Nature is his; that is, he must be called God in no other sense than as he is God. Now, as I have already shewn, there is but One Absolute Divinity, with Two Internal Processions in the Unity and Identity of Nature: And if we make this our Rule of Speaking, (as we must do, if this be the Catholick Faith of the Trinity, and we will fit our words to the nature of things) then it is very plain, That the Name <hi>God</hi> absolutely belongs only to him, who is this Absolute Divinity, that is, the Person of the Father, that no other Person is God <hi>in recto,</hi> absolutely and simply God, but only he; that he is the One God, the only True God, as both the Scripture and Fathers own.</p>
                  <p>But what becomes then of the Son, and Holy Ghost? Is not the Son God? and the Spirit God? Yes! the Name and Title of God belongs to them, as the Divine Nature
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:50623:194"/>
does; that is, not absolutely, as to the Absolute Divinity, but as to Divine Processions, to Divine Subsisting Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Unity of the Godhead; that is, the Second Person in the Trinity is God, but not <hi>in recto,</hi> as God sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that Person, who is the Divinity; but as the Son of God, as <hi>habens Deitatem,</hi> having the Divinity, not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and originally, but by Communication, by Eternal Generation: And so the Holy Spirit is not absolutely God, but the Spirit of God; and God only as the Spirit of God, as an Internal Procession in the Divine Nature.</p>
                  <p>But in what sense then can we say, That the Trinity is One God, or that Three Persons are One God? Must we not necessarily own, that <hi>God</hi> in these Propositions is taken <hi>Essentially</hi> for the Deity in the abstract, and not as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in any One Person? For will we say, That the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or Three Persons, are but One Person? No! and yet in this Proposition, <hi>The Trinity is One God</hi>; by <hi>One God,</hi> I understand, One, who is absolutely God, One Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Divinity, which is the Father, who has indeed a Son and Spirit, in the Unity of his own Nature and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, each of which is True and Perfect God, but not a Second, and Third God, but the Son of God, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; Divine Subsisting Relations in the One Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Godhead of the Father, which does not multiply the Name nor Nature of God.</p>
                  <p>This is the Account the Catholick Fathers give of the Unity of God in a Trinity of Persons, and therefore this must be the Catholick Sense of this Proposition: And here it will be proper to observe, That in the Account they give of the Unity of God, that is, the Unity in Trinity, they indifferently assign One Divinity, and One Father, as the Reason of it: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. There is One God, because there is One Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and there is One God, because there is One Father, which are not two different Reasons, but one and the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:50623:194"/>
same; from whence it necessarily follows, That this One Divinity is the Divinity of the Father, and that this One God in Trinity, is the Father; for One God must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily signify One Person, when the Father is the One God.</p>
                  <p>So that the Father, who is the One Absolute Divinity, is the One God, who ceases not to be the One God, (as St. <hi>Hilary</hi> and others constantly teach) by having a Son, and Holy Spirit, who receive all from him, live and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in him, and are eternally and inseparably One with him: Thus we are taught in the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed, to <hi>worship One God in Trinity,</hi> that is, the Eternal Father, who is the One God, with his Son, and Holy Spirit; <hi>and the Trinity in Vnity,</hi> that is, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, not Three Gods, but One in the Unity of the Father's Godhead. <hi>For the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one, the Glory equal, the Majesty Coeternal:</hi> There is but <hi>One Godhead, One Glory, One Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> and that is the Godhead, Glory, and Majesty of the Father; and the Son and Spirit are in the Godhead, Glory, Majesty of the Father, as Internal Processions, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, Subsisting Relations in the Father's Godhead.</p>
                  <p>This Account, which I confess is the only Account of this Matter that I can understand, whatever other Faults it may have, which I do not yet see, I'm sure is perfectly Orthodox; is neither <hi>Tritheism, Sabellianism, Arianism,</hi> nor <hi>Socinianism,</hi> but the True Catholick Faith, of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Unity.</p>
                  <p>Here is but One Absolute Divinity, but One Father with his Eternal Son and Spirit, in the Unity of his own Nature and Godhead, and therefore but One God: For Three Gods must be Three Absolute Divinities, without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Relation, or dependence on each other. Internal Relations, though Real, Subsisting Relations, can't mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply Nature, and therefore can't multiply Gods.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:50623:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>Here are Three Real, Proper, Living, Intelligent, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial, Divine Persons, and therefore no <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> not One Personal God, with three Names, Offices, Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festations, Modes, Powers, Parts.</p>
                  <p>Here are Three truly Divine Persons, each of which is by himself, or in his own Person, True and Perfect God. The Father God of himself, Unbegottan, Self-originated God, the Fountain of the Deity to the Son and Holy Spirit. The Son, the Son of God, and True and Perfect God, as the Son of God. The Spirit, the Spirit of the Father, and the Son, and True and Perfect God, as the Spirit of God: So that here is neither <hi>Arianism, Macedonianism,</hi> nor <hi>Socinianism</hi>; no Made or Created Nature, no Creature in the Ever Blessed Trinity.</p>
                  <p>No, say our <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Adversaries, neither the Son, nor the Holy Ghost, according to this Hypothesis, are True and Perfect God, as the Father is: Neither of them have Self-existence, or a Fecundity of Nature, which are thought great Perfections in the Father; but the Son is not of himself, but begotten of his Father; nor is the Spirit of himself, but proceeds from Father and Son; and neither of them have a Son, or Spirit of their own, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has.</p>
                  <p>All this I readily grant; for it is the Catholick Faith, that the Father is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, so a Father, that he never was a Son, and the Son <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, so a Son, that he never was, nor can be a Father, and so of the Holy Spirit; That <hi>there is but One Father, not Three Fathers; One Son, not Three Sons; One Holy Ghost, not Three Holy Ghosts,</hi> as the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed teaches.</p>
                  <p>This proves indeed, as we all own, that neither the Son, nor Spirit, are absolutely God, an Absolute Divinity, as the Father is, but only Divine Processions; an Absolute Divinity has a Fecundity of Nature; Absolute, Original Mind, according to this Hypothesis must have its Word
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:50623:195"/>
and Spirit, in the Unity of its Nature; but the Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Absolute Nature, can't beget another Word, nor the Spirit another Spirit. So that this Objection only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers us from the Charge of Tritheism, by proving Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost to be but One Divinity, One God: For if the Son were as absolutely God, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, there is no account to be given, why he should not beget a Son, as his Father did him, as we see it is among Men, where the Son begets a Son, and becomes a Father, and thus there could be no possible end of Divine Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but these are Generations <hi>ad extra,</hi> which give as compleat and absolute a Nature, and absolute Subsistence to the Son, as the Father has; but Internal, Essential Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are in the Individual Unity of Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot multiply, when Nature has all that is essential to it. So that Self-existence and Generation do not belong to the Character of a Son; and with the Catholick Church, we teach, That the Son of God is God, only as the Son; and it would be Heresy to ascribe the peculiar Prerogatives of the Father to him: And then it can be no Objection against the Divinity of the Son, that he has not what is peculiar and proper only to the Person of the Father, as Self-existence and Generation is.</p>
                  <p>Self-existence, Self-origination, to have no cause of his Being, I grant, is essential to the Idea of a God: And Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Necessary Existence to the Notion of any Person, who is in any sense God; for he, who ever began to be, and subsists precariously, can in no sense be God. But then though Self-existence be essential to the Notion of an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Divinity, yet a Person, who is a Son, and therefore not Self-originated, but eternally begotten of a Self-origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Father, and subsists eternally and necessarily as an Essential Procession and Relation in a Self-originated Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, must be the Son of God, and God the Son, True and Perfect God, as the Eternal, Necessary, Essential Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:50623:196"/>
of a Self-originated Divinity. For what is internally and essentially related to a Self-existent Nature, can be no Creature, and therefore must be True and Perfect God.</p>
                  <p>Thus to proceed: The same Rule of speaking (if Men be peaceably and charitably disposed to understand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) will easily reconcile that late warm Dispute, about One Substance, and Three Substances, in the Unity of the Godhead; for the Dispute is the very same, in other words, with One Nature and Three Persons.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, who asserted the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> the One Nature and Substance of Father, and Son, did not by this mean One Singular Substance, as I have abundantly shewn; and those who assert Three Substances in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> do not mean Three Absolute, nor Three divided and separated Substances, but One Individual Substance, as there is One Individual Nature in Three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial, Subsisting Persons. That is, There is but One Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Substance, with Two Relative, Substantial Procef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in the Individual Unity of the same One Substance: Which the Schools make no scruple to call Three Relative Substances. All Catholick Writers, both Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, own, that the Father is Substance, the Son Substance, and the Holy Ghost Substance; but yet are cautious of say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Three Substances; nor will they say, <hi>ter Vna,</hi> thrice One Substance, because Number does not belong to the Nature, but to the Persons; though at the same time they own,<note place="margin">Aqu. p. 1. Quaest. 31. Art. 1.</note> that <hi>Deus trinus</hi> signifies <hi>tria supposita Deitatis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These seem to be great Niceties, and Arbitrary Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, without any reason and foundation in Nature; for what difference is there between Three Substances, and Three Relative Substances? For Relative Substances are Substances. What difference between Three Substances, and <hi>tria supposita?</hi> when <hi>suppositum</hi> is only another name for Substance; and so St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> as I have observed, called them, <hi>tres substantias, &amp; tria in substantia,</hi> Three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:50623:196"/>
and Three in Substance. When there are Three, each of which is in his own Person Substance, and neither of them each other, what difference is there between say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Tres in una substantia, &amp; ter una substantia?</hi> Three in One Substance, and thrice Once Substance? <hi>Marius Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,</hi> as I observed before, ventures to say,<note place="margin">The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between Real and Nominal <hi>Trinitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Exam. p. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>ter ipsa Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia,</hi> (not <hi>ter una,</hi> as it is mistaken in a late Treatise, by trusting too much to memory) thrice the very same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; now thrice the same One Substance, is thrice One Substance; where the Number belongs to the Essence and Substance, which is <hi>Aquinas</hi>'s Objection against it.</p>
                  <p>But the whole Account of this must be resolved into the Distinction between Absolute and Relative. Substance, when it stands by it self, signifies Absolutely, and so Three Substances are Three Absolute Substances; Three Human Substances, Three Humanities; and Three Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, Three Divinities; and therefore we must not without great caution, say Three Substances in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for fear of asserting Three Gods; but yet we must own, that each Person is True and Perfect Substance; and both the Fathers and Schools own this; and Three in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance are Three Substances, but not Three Absolute but Relative Substances, Three Subsisting Relations in the Unity of the Divine Essence and Substance: Though, as I have more than once observed, in proper speaking, we cannot say Three Relative Substances; for though the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speaks a Relation to the Son, and Holy Spirit, it is as he is the Fountain of the Deity, Original, Absolute, Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Essence, Substance, in his own Person, not a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Subsistence; and therefore in the Blessed Trinity, there is One Absolute Substance, Absolute Divinity, and Two Relative Substances, as there are Two Internal Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Relations in the Unity of the same Substance. And to prevent Mistakes, I must here observe, That by <hi>Absolute</hi> we do not mean <hi>Compleat</hi> and <hi>Perfect,</hi> for so the Son is Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute

Substance, and the Holy Spirit Absolute Substance, Compleat and Perfect Substance, as each of them in his own Person is True and Perfect God; in which Sense St. <hi>Austin</hi> tells us, that <hi>persona ad se dicitur,</hi> that Person is predicated absolutely; that every Person, as considered in himself, is a Person, and not merely as related to another; but when we say, that there is but One <hi>Absolute</hi> Substance in the Godhead, by Absolute we mean <hi>Original,</hi> as I have already explained it, as distinguished from Relative Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as the Original is distinguished from the Image; though the Image, if a Living, Subsisting Image, is as Compleat and Perfect Nature and Substance, as the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal is. And this is the only difference I know, between <hi>Substance, Nature, Essence,</hi> and Suppositum, Subject, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, Subsistence, and the like: That the first signify Absolutely, or as the Schools speak, the Form; that is, an Original Substance, Nature, and Essence; and therefore these must not be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied in the Divinity, by saying Three Substances, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or Essences, for fear of a Diversity or Number of Divinities, and Gods. The other Terms, though they do not in common use signify Relatively, as Subject, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum, Thing, Being, Subsistence, do not, yet they signify any thing that really is, that has a Compleat, Actual Subsistence of its own, and therefore are applicable, to all substantial relative Processions, which are compleat Subsistencies, Things, Beings, as well as to original Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Substance: And both the Fathers and Schools for this reason owned the Three Divine Persons to be Three Things, Three Beings, <hi>Tres Entes, Tria Entia, Tres Res,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and scruple not the use of any such tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendental Terms, as do not necessarily multiply the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and original Form.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>One Substance</hi> of the Godhead either signifies the absolute Divinity of the Father, and this is but One,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:50623:197"/>
and can never be <hi>Ter Vna,</hi> Thrice One; or it signifies the One individual undivided Divinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, that is, the absolute Divinity of the Father, with his internal essential Processions in the perfect Unity and Identity of Nature, and this it is but One Substance, for there is but One Individual Nature; not <hi>Ter Vna,</hi> but <hi>Tres in Vna</hi>; not Thrice One Substance, but Three in One Undivided Nature and Substance; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which I have sometimes, not so properly, translated a Thrice subsisting Monad, but it is a Monad with Three Hypostases; which, in other words, is One Nature and Three Persons; not One singular Nature Thrice subsisting (which I cannot understand), but One individual Nature, and Three subsisting Hypostases; <hi>Vna Substantia, non Vnus Subsistens</hi>; One Substance, not One that subsists: This Individual Nature subsists but once; but in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Unity of the Father's Essence and Godhead, are those Eternal, Substantial, Subsisting Processions, the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postases of the Son, and Holy Spirit. And in this sense the One Individual Substance of the Divinity may proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough be stiled <hi>Ter ipsa,</hi> or <hi>Ter Vna Substantia</hi>; Thrice the same One Substance, not Thrice One Absolute Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, in which sense <hi>Aquinas</hi> rejected it; but <hi>Tria Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posita Vnius Substantiae,</hi> or <hi>Deitatis</hi>; which is One Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, by the individual Unity, and invariable Sameness and Identity of Nature; as I have shewn above.</p>
                  <p>Thus that warm Dispute among the Schoolmen, about one Absolute Subsistence and Existence in the Trinity, and Three Relative Subsistencies and Existences, which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with so much perplexing Subtilty, as far as I can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand any thing by it, may easily be composed after the same manner. For there is but One Absolute Being and Nature in the Divinity, and therefore there can be but One Absolute Subsistence and Existence, as <hi>Absolute</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, not <hi>Compleat and Perfect,</hi> but, to subsist and exist as
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:50623:198"/>
an Original, which in the Godhead signifies a self-origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Subsistence and Existence: But then to deny all rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Subsistencies and Existencies, is to deny the compleat Subsistence and Existence of the Son and Spirit, who are essential Relations in the Unity of the Father's Godhead, and therefore subsist not as Originals, but as Relatives, which is the meaning of a Relative Subsistence. There is but One Absolute Divinity, and Two Relative Processions, and therefore in this sense, but One Absolute, and Two, not Three, Relative Subsistencies; which seems fairly to divide the Question between them.</p>
                  <p>Thus, once more: It is a known Rule of speaking in this Mystery, That Substantives must be predicated in the Singular Number, Adjectives will admit a Plural Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the same difference is made between Abstract and Concrete Terms. There are not Three Gods, but <hi>Tres Deit atem habentes,</hi> there are Three who have the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity; not Three Omnipotencies, or Three Omniscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but Three who are Omnipotent and Omniscient. And the approved reason for this is, That Substantives and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract Terms, signify the Nature, Essence, and Form, and to multiply them, is to multiply Natures; but Adjectives immediately signify the Subjects, Suppositums, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and only connote the Nature and Form, which mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies the Persons, but not the Nature. Now though I understand what is meant by this, when applied to the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet I never could understand this Reason for it; for there is no such difference between Substantive and Adjective Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications in any other Case; Three men, and Three, who have Human Nature, signify the very same thing, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply the Form, as well as the Persons; Three, who have Human Nature, are truly and properly Three men; and then the meer difference between Substantives and Adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives cannot be a good Reason, why Three, who have the Divine Nature, are not Three Gods. But the difference
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:50623:198"/>
between an Absolute and Relative Predication does give an account of this. Substantives and Abstract Terms al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways signify the Form, as the Schools speak, that is, an Absolute and Original Nature, and in this Sense Number multiplies Nature, as well as Persons, and Three Gods are Three Absolute Original Divinities, as wellas Three Divine Persons; and thus it is as to Adjective Predicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in all Creatures, as I observed before, because there is no such distinction in Creatures between an Absolute Nature, and Internal Subsisting Processions in the Unity and Identity of Nature; and when Nature always signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Original Form, a Substantive or Adjective Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation can make no difference: but where there is such a distinction, as there is in the Divinity, Substantives and Adjectives do most aptly represent it, because Adjectives admit of a Relative Predication, and may signify a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who has the Divine Nature, as an Internal, Subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Procession in the Divinity, but is not the Absolute Divinity, nor in an Absolute Sense God, but the Son of God, and the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>Indeed in such Forms of Speech we must have more regard to the Absolute or Relative Signification, than to the Substantive or Adjective Form of the Words. Adjectives in an Absolute Sense must no more be multiplied than Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantives, which I take to be an easier Account of the <hi>tres aeterni,</hi> and <hi>unus aeternus</hi> in the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed, than to turn it with <hi>Aquinas</hi> into <hi>tria aeterna,</hi> and <hi>unum aeternum.</hi> For Three Eternals, whether Substantives or Adjectives, in an Absolute Sense are Three Gods; Three Eternal, Three Intelligent, Three Omniscient Persons, in an Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Sense, are Three Eternities, Three Omnisciences, and in this Sense there is but <hi>unus aeternus,</hi> One Eternal Self Originated Person, as there is but One God: and on the other hand, <hi>Deus</hi> or God, though a Substantive, may signify Relatively, as it does in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, God
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:50623:199"/>
of God; and in this Sense some of the Schoolmen, thought it very Orthodox to say Three Gods, if we explained in what Sense we meant it, as I observed above, <hi>Tertullian</hi> did, <hi>Ecce duos deos,</hi> though at the same time he rejects the use of such Forms, for their ambiguous Signification which might betray men into <hi>Polytheism.</hi> And if <hi>God</hi> may have a Relative Signification, so may <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> too, and then <hi>Three Minds and Spirits</hi> is as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, as Three that have an Intelligent and Spiritual Nature.</p>
                  <p>In short; as far as I can hitherto observe, all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Rules of Speaking relating to this Mystery must be resolved into this distinction of Absolute and Relative: This is the only distinction we know of in the Godhead, and this we as certainly know there is, as we know, that there is an Eternal Father, who has an Eternal Son, and an Eternal Spirit; One Absolute, Self-Originated Divinity, with its Internal, Essential Processions in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Unity and Identity of Nature: and if this be the Unity and Distinction of the Divinity, this must be our Rule of Speaking also, to have a due regard to the One Absolute Nature, and the Relative Processions of the Godhead; which will secure us both from a <hi>Sabellian</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, and a <hi>Tritheistick</hi> Trinity of Absolute Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

            <head>The CONCLUSION. With a short Application to the <hi>Socinians.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Proposed one thing more to be considered in relation to this Subject; <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the Catholick Faith of a Real a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Substantial Trinity, can be as reasonably and intelligibly explained by the Notion of One Singular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in the Divinity, as by asserting Three Personal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances or Suppositums: And whether the Singularity of the Divine Essence in this Notion, delivers the Asserters of it from any Inconveniences and Objections, which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion is thought liable to. But, I hope, after what I have already said, there is no occasion for this, and I will not needlesly revive old Quarrels. Let but Men sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and heartily believe in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Three Eternal, Infinite, Substantial, Living, Intelligent, Omnipotent, All-wise Persons, each of which is in his own Person True and Perfect God, and all Three but One Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and One God; and I will dispute with no such Orthodox Christians concerning the Philosophy of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, which is so infinitely above our comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. There may be a necessity for such Disputes, when we have to do with Hereticks, who ridicule the Catholick Faith as contradictions and absurd; but when Men agree in the Faith, such Disputes are of no use to them, and may prove of dangerous consequence; for there are too many, who will be sooner disputed out of their Faith, than out of their Philosophy; which should teach all Catholick Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, as much as it is possible, to silence all Disputes amongst themselves, which their common Adversaries are so apt to improve into Scepticism, Infidelity, or Heresy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="386" facs="tcp:50623:200"/>And therefore for a Conclusion, I shall only take a brief Review of the Doctrine of the Fathers concerning this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of a Trinity in Unity, and apply it in a few words to our <hi>Socinian</hi> Adversaries.</p>
            <p>The Faith of the Catholick Church taught by Christ and his Apostles is, that there is but One God; but this One God is a Father, who has an Eternal Son, and an Eternal Spirit, in the Essential Unity of the same Undivided and Undiversified Godhead: And this is the Faith which all the Catholick Fathers have owned and taught in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages. The whole Christian Church Baptizes, as our Saviour commanded, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; and this is the Rule of their Faith, to believe in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: A plain, simple Faith, could Men have been contented to believe God concerning himself.</p>
            <p>Let our <hi>Socinian</hi> Adversaries tell us, what there is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, impossible, or contradictious in this Faith? Will they venture to say, That it is absurd or contradictious, that God should have a Son? No! in some sense they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this true; they themselves believe in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; they acknowledge Jesus Christ to be the Son of God, as he is frequently called in Scripture, and that in a higher sense, than any other Man is the Son of God; but that he is but a Man after all, though advanced by God to Divine Honours, above all Principalities and Powers, and made the Judge both of the Quick and of the Dead; and this they affirm to be all that the Scripture means, in calling Christ the Son of God.</p>
            <p>But this is not the present Dispute: They know that the Catholick Church believed otherwise, that Christ is the Eternal Son of God, begotten of his Father before all worlds, God of God, very God of very God; and they know also, that thus the Catholick Fathers expounded those Texts which concern the Sonship and Divinity of our Saviour;
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:50623:200"/>
and they cannot but confess, That they are very capable of such an Exposition; nay, that it is very difficult to put any other sense upon many Texts; and the only reason why they reject these Catholick Expositions, is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Absurdity and Contradiction of the Catholick Faith. Here then we join issue with them, and desire them to shew us, what is impossible or contradictious in this Faith?</p>
            <p>That there is something incomprehensible in this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, that is, something which we have no Natural ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Ideas of, we readily acknowledge with the whole Catholick Church; and some of our Adversaries grant, That <hi>it is possible for a thing to be,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reply to theSecond Defence of the Twenty eight Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, <hi>p.</hi> 16.</note> 
               <hi>whereof we have no Idea</hi>; and then it seems to me very unreasonable to add, <hi>but we are no ways concerned, nor can we Reason or Discourse about those things whereof we have no Ideas:</hi> For the direct contrary seems to be the more natural consequence, that if God thinks fit to reveal such things to us, of which we have no Ideas, we are concerned and obliged to believe them; for if they may be true, they are the proper Objects of Faith, though they want the Evidence of Natural Ideas But I do not intend to dispute this now, but refer them to <hi>the Bishop of</hi> Worcester'<hi>s Answer to Mr.</hi> Lock'<hi>s Second Letter</hi>; and to a late Sermon, and its Vindication, <hi>Concerning the Danger of Corrupting the Faith by Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</hi> What I have now to say, is of another Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> That we have an Idea of a Trinity in Unity, and such an Idea, as contains nothing absurd, impossible, or contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious in it: That very Idea, which I have so largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, One Absolute Divinity, with Two Eternal, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Processions, in the Unity and Identity of Nature. The Eternal Father, Eternal Self-originated Mind, with his Eternal Word, his Eternal Son, and the Eternal Spirit of Father and Son.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:50623:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>This is that Idea which the Scripture gives us of it, and which the Catholick Church hath always taught: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man may understand what is meant by it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not Jargon and Nonsense; and I think I have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently vindicated it from <hi>Tritheism</hi> and Contradiction, and have no more to say of that nature, till I hear what they have to object against what is already said; and when they come to consider this Matter again, as Men that shall certainly be called to an Account for it in this World, as well as in the next, I hope they will see reason to grow out of conceit with their own Philosophy, about Emanations and Processions, a Priority of Time, and Priority of Nature, Self-Existence and Necessary Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, and such like <hi>Arian</hi> Objections, which were made and answered many Ages since, and which they may find sufficiently answered in this Treatise.</p>
            <p>This brings back the Dispute to Scripture, where the last Appeal must lie in all such Matters, without appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Sense of Scripture to Natural Ideas and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy: And if the Interpretations of the Catholick Fathers were of any Authority with these Men, I have already shewn how they expounded Scripture, which will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be a venerable Authority to modest Men and sober Christians, how much soever it be despised by Hereticks. But it is time to put an end to this Treatise; we may consider their Expositions of Scripture some other time.</p>
