            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVICE from A
Diſſenter in the City,
TO HIS
Friends in the Country.</head>
            <p>IN Regard of the many Charms made uſe
of, by a Virulent and Ill-deſigning Faction,
there was never more need of the <hi>Wiſdom
of the Serpent,</hi> then now: One great part
of which, is to ſtop your Ears againſt their
Wheedle, and malitious Inſinuations; or at leaſt,
to hear both Parties before you make a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>You know that His Majeſty hath given us Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
by His Declaration and Promiſes, therein to
Conſult with His <hi>Parliament,</hi> about means, to
make the ſame inviolable for the future: What
Objection againſt it, and Oppoſition to it, is made
by a Party of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> you are not
ignorant of? And how they repreſent the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as Tyrannical and Illegal, though the ſame
Power, and a greater, has been allowed by the
Canons of their Church; ſeveral of their Greateſt
and Learnedſt <hi>Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Doctors;</hi>
as may be ſeen in <hi>Vox Cleri pro Rege,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But herein His Majeſty hath acted as a true
<hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> and careful Maſter of the Flock,
by putting a Clog upon ſuch as have gored, and
ſtill would gore others, until he have a Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
to cut their Horns. By the <hi>Judicial Law,</hi>
the Maſter was to make good the Dammages done
by his <hi>Goring</hi> or <hi>Puſhing Cattle;</hi> and His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
knowing himſelf anſwerable to God for it,
if he ſuffered one party of His Subjects to ruine
another upon a Religious Score, in preventing it,
hath done nothing but what was incumbent upon
Him, as a Chriſtian, and as a King. I take it for
a ſure Maxim in <hi>Divinity,</hi> that we make our
ſelves guilty of the Evil which we have Power to
prevent if we do not; and by this Maxim, any
Chriſtian having Power, ought to have done for
the Matter, though not in the Manner, what His
Majeſty has done: And therefore, to oppoſe him
in ſo doing, is certainly <hi>Antichristian;</hi> becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
none but Ravening Beaſts, who Roar and
make a Noiſe, when the Prey is Reſcued out of
their Devouring Chaps. No wonder then, that
a certain ſort of men uſe all the Arts, that Wit or
Malice can invent, to fruſtrate ſo good a Deſign;
ſeeing it deſtroys their <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering
over the Conſciences of others, and their
Trade of making Merchandize of the Souls of
Men, and His Majeſty's Laws.</p>
            <p>Does not His Majeſty propound to throw the
Cudgels in the Fire, (with which the Church hath
beat out your Brains) and offers a legal Security a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all things of that kind, for time to come?
But the Church Propoſes only to lay them aſide,
(which if ſhe could do) yet ſhe may take them
up again when ſhe pleaſes, and then you have no
Defence againſt them: Which Propoſal then is
moſt to be truſted?</p>
            <p>Hath not the Church ſhamefully deceived you,
in promiſing (upon your deſiſting to Plead for
Continuance of the <hi>Declaration</hi> in 1672.) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Eaſe for you in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and afterwards,
inſtead of <hi>Rods,</hi> whipt you with <hi>Scorpions?</hi> Were
not their Pretences for your doing ſo then, the
ſame which they uſe to perſwade you now? And
have you ſeen any Reformation in them ſince?
Or, Did they ceaſe from Perſecution, till His
Majeſty ſtopped it?</p>
            <p>Did ever His preſent Majeſty break Promiſe
to you, or hath he not been kinder than you did
expect, or could poſſibly have been, had he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94945:3"/>
hearkened to the Suggeſtions of the Church againſt
you?</p>
            <p>Did ever the Church make a Canon, in your
favour, and hath not His Majeſty Emitted a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
for your Eaſe?</p>
            <p>Did ever the Church Reſcue you out of the
Hand of the Civil Magiſtrate? And hath not
His Majeſty Reſcued you out of the Hands of
the Church?</p>
            <p>Tender-hearted Mothers, uſe to plead in behalf
of their Children, when their Father is threatning;
and Reſcue them out of his Hands when he is
correcting: But inſtead of ſo doing, the Church
endeavoured your Ruine, and flees on His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Face for preventing it.</p>
            <p>Hath not His Majeſty given good Evidence,
that He is a compaſſionate Father, and the
Church Demonſtrated her ſelf an Unnatural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
            <p>Will you then believe the Reproaches of her,
from whom you never found Favour, and diſtruſt
the Promiſes of Him who hath ſhewed you ſo
much Love? Are you not ſenſible, how falſly
and maliciouſly they accuſed you to His Majeſty?
And will you believe them now, when they accuſe
His Majeſty to you? Was it not their End then,
to Exclude you from His Majeſty's Favour, and
is not the ſame Deſign now carried on?</p>
            <p>Ay, but ſays the Church, <hi>We were put upon
the Perſecution by the Court, We did not engage
in it voluntarily.</hi> Enquire of them, if King
<hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. put them upon Oppoſing His
Diſpenſation to Biſhop <hi>Hooper;</hi> and how they
will Reconcile that, and their Concurrence with
Him, in diſpoſing of the Crown by His Will,
which was, perhaps, the moſt Stupendious piece
of Arbitrary Power, ever aſſumed by a Sovereign;
and yet, they not only concurred with Him in it,
but put Him upon it, which makes it evident,
that they always joyned with the Prerogative in
its height, except when favourable to <hi>Diſſenters,</hi>
and then they oppoſed it. Enquire if King
<hi>Charles</hi> the II. put them upon oppoſing His ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Declarations for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> in
<hi>May</hi> and <hi>October, 1660, July 1661.</hi> and <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
1662.</hi> Repeated ſo often, that it may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
His Majeſty intended to fulfil the ſame,
if they had not hindred him; which yet appears
further, if you conſider His Words in Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
25. <hi>October 1660.</hi> That <hi>No man ſhall be
Diſquieted or called in Queſtion for Differences
of Opinion in Matters of Religion, which do
not diſturb the Peace of the Kingdom; And if
any have been Diſturbed in that kind, ſince our
Arrival here, it hath not Proceeded from any
D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rections of Ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Enquire at them further, who puts them upon
Oppoſing His preſent Majeſty's Declaration for
Liberty; And if they were ſo obedient to the
Court in Perſecuting, why do they not teſtifie
their Obedience now, when the Court Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
them to throw away the Inſtruments of
their Perſecution? And you will find, the caſe
is ſo plain, that we may reaſonably conclude,
that if His Majeſty was at any time diſpleaſed
with us, they ſtirred Him up to Perſecute, by
their Miſ-repreſentations, who accuſed us as Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal
and Seditious, and not fit to be Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
            <p>Do they not juſtifie their Rigour againſt us,
by Alledging the ſame to be a Retaliation for
what we did againſt them in the late Times?
Can any thing be more Diſingenuous? Will
they juſtifie what they condem? Did not they
begin with Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> though the King op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
it? And Perſecute their Brethren at <hi>Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
when there was no Court to put them upon
it? And continue the ſame in Queen <hi>Elizabeths,</hi>
King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the I. Time, till
they had ſo enraged the Nation, that they could
no longer bear it; and yet they would inſinuate,
that they were not the firſt Aggreſſors.</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible then, that you can be impoſed
upon by their Apologies, and pretences of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration?
Let them produce Inſtances. Yes,
they give you a famous one in their Apology,
of their Moderation towards the <hi>Papiſts</hi> after
Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Perſecution: But we are ſure, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Diſſenters found none of it; they made
cruel Laws againſt them, and put thoſe Laws in
Execution, even to Death it ſelf; they need not
tell us of their Moderation towards <hi>Papiſts;</hi> we
always told them of their Partiality towards them,
againſt whom they pretend now to be ſo zealous,
to have the Penal Laws continued; perhaps,
they have reſerved the Dregs of the Cup for
them; but they are like to be diſappointed if
that were their Deſign. But becauſe they know
we would not be ſuch Fools to joyn, in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
them againſt our ſelves, they tell us, <hi>It
is only to be a Curb upon the</hi> Papiſts, <hi>that they
deſire to have them continued;</hi> Credat Judaeus
Appella. Let their former Carriage witneſs the
Truth of this.</p>
            <p>Think with your ſelves, what a Mercy it is,
not to be under a neceſſity of complying with ſuch
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94945:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Worſhip as you thought, neither appointed by,
nor acceptable to the Divine Majeſty of God;
or elſe, endure all the Miſeries, that invective
and irreligious Men could affl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct you with. What
a Bleſſing is it not to be under an Obligation
of owning ſuch for your Miniſters, as were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon you, whom in your Conſcience you
did not believe called of Chriſt to that Work;
whoſe whole Practice from their Youth up, was
Eſtranged from Piety; whoſe Deſign in entring
the Sacred Function, was no other, than ſuch as
men have in entring upon an ordinary Trade,
to get a Livelihood; whoſe way of entring into
the Church, was by the Patrons Preſentation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
which you have complained as Unſcriptural;
he (as alas it happens too often) having no care
of his own Soul, and therefore, very unfit to chuſe
a Paſtor for the Souls of others; all that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
in it, being perhaps, to gratifie a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
Son, his own Chaplain; or oblidge a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
Friend, which you have always look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon, as not coming in by the Door, but
climbing up ſome other Way. The great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Scandalous and Ignorant Preachers, ſhows
alſo how remiſs they have been, who were intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Examine their Qualifications; that as to
often it happens, being the <hi>Province of Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Chaplains, who concert the Matter with the
Youngſters, over a Glaſs of Wine;</hi> and thus he
becomes a Miniſter to have a care of Souls, who
never took any of his own; and he muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
with Spiritual Affairs, when you would
not truſt with the over-ſight of your Temporal.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and many other, though not charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
upon all of the Church, yet are too well
known to be Spots in the Church, and ſtand in
need of Reformation. Can you then believe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Flatteries or Reproaches of ſuch a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of men, who ſo tenaciouſly adhere to theſe
things, which they confeſs to be no where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and yet perſecute others with the utmoſt
Severity for their Non-compliance?</p>
            <p>And have you forgot, how at the ſame time,
when the Flood of Perſecution overflowed you,
a Deluge of Impiety overflowed the Nation, and
few, or very faint endeavours uſed by the Church,
to oppoſe the ſame? No, <hi>Majus Opus Morebant,</hi>
they had a greater Work to do; they were ſo
taken up in Perſecuting thoſe of tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
that they had no leiſure to look after them,
who made Shipwrack of good Conſciences: They
were ſo buſie to diſperſe the Meetings of thoſe
who ſeriouſly ſought God, that they could not
Animadvert to thoſe that Blaſphemed the Name
of God; They were ſo taken up in ſearching for
Conventicles, that they could not puniſh the
Revels, in Taverns and Bawdy-Houſes: They
were ſo eager to hinder us from Worſhipping
God on the Sabbath, that they could not look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thoſe, who did ſhamefully Prophane that day:
They were ſo zealouſly employed in forcing Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Doctrines Commandments, and
Traditions of men, that they had no leiſure to
preſs Obedience to the Commands of God: And
yet theſe Men, at this time, would have themſelves
looked upon, as the only Champions of Religion:
<hi>But, O my Soul! Come not thou into theſe their
Secrets; unto their Aſſembly be not thou <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Curſed be their Anger, for it was fierce;
and their Wrath, for it was Cruel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do you think their preſent ſtrugling for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Penal Laws,</hi> under pretence of Religion,
can be ſincere, when you conſider the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many of them? Do you think their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Tenderneſs is ſincere, who refuſe to Read
the King's Declaration for Liberty to you; but
greedily ſwallowed down the Preſentment of
Grand Juries againſt you? Do you think that
they will conſent to Abrogate the <hi>Penal Laws</hi>
againſt you, which they have formerly ſaid, were
too eaſie and gentle for you? Upon what G<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound
are you now induced to believe them, who have
formerly entertained ſuch Obſervations of them,
<hi>viz.</hi> That ſuch as had moſt Zeal for the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
had leaſt for the Subſtance? Thoſe who
were moſt Zealous for Obſervation of Holy-days,
leaſt careful of keeping the Sabbath: Thoſe who
were moſt for Excommunicating Conſcientious
Diſſenters, were moſt for Embracing Unconſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
Livers: Thoſe who were eagreſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
others up to Satan, were the moſt uſual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokers
of his Name. In a word, Thoſe who
were moſt for obſerving the Commands of Men,
were leaſt for obſerving the Commands of God:
Thoſe who were the moſt Prophane, were the
moſt eager for putting the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
inſomuch, that it can be Inſtanced when,
and where thoſe Inſtruments of the Churches
Fury, being in ſearch for Diſſenters; and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
others by Miſtake, as ſoon as they heard
them ſwear, diſmiſſed them, with the Character
of an <hi>Honeſt Man,</hi> and no <hi>Phanatick;</hi> as if ſuch
Practices had been the <hi>Shibboleth</hi> of the Sons of
the Church: Then as you regard your Religion,
and would preſerve the Credit of the Proteſtant
Name, ſo much aſperſed by the Practice of ſuch;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94945:4"/>
ſay not a <hi>Confederacy</hi> to whom ſuch ſay a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy;
and joyn not with the People of thoſe
Abominations, to keep up thoſe <hi>Wicked Laws:</hi>
But liſten to the <hi>Voice of God's Diſpenſations,</hi>
which call upon you aloud to joyn Heartily with
thoſe that are reſolved to acquit themſelves, and
the Land, of this <hi>G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ILT;</hi> leſt you be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of theſe <hi>Sins,</hi> and of the <hi>Plagues</hi> juſtly
due for the ſame. Neglect not this favourable
Providence which God hath put in your Hands,
of ridding your ſelves from this Slavery; for a
long Practice of ſuch Courſes Unrepented of,
muſt needs Accelerate Divine Vengeance.</p>
            <p>The Terms upon which you may be delivered
from the Fury of thoſe Men, are very eaſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only a willingneſs to ſhake off your Bonds;
and that others may have a ſhare in the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
with your ſelves, which you cannot in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
honour; nor Gratitude, deny; it being
Conſonant to the Rule of your Great Maſter, <hi>to
Do as you would be done by;</hi> and due in Honour
and Thankfulneſs to His Majeſty, who ſo unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly
hath delivered you, who were Repreſented
to Him as His greateſt Enemies, out of the
<hi>Mouth of the Lion,</hi> and out of the <hi>Paw of the
Bear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ay but ſay you, <hi>The Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pbraids us with
concurring to procure a Liberty to Idolaters, who as
ſoon as they find themſelves in a Capacity, will Ruine
us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Of all People in the World, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the Church of <hi>England</hi> leaſt to make ſuch
Reflections, whoſe Votes brought the Popiſh Lord
into the Houſe of Peers, to Anſwer a Turn, which
now is made the great Danger they ſo labour to
poſſeſs the Nation with the fear of, if the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Teſt</hi> be taken off: And is it not at rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
for us to conclude, that the Popiſh Lords,
will be True to their Intereſt now, as they ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
they would be then, and conſequently Adhere
to ſuch Laws as ſhall be made to Secure themſelves
and others againſt the Violences of an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngratefnl
Church,</hi> who after they had done her ſuch Service,
threw them out again by their <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Have they not many times pronounced it
from their Pulpits, <hi>That they would rather join
with the Papiſts, than the Presbyterians?</hi> And
though there is not the leaſt Inclinations in either
of theſe to join with the other, except in what
concerns their common Safety; how can they for
ſhame, who have uſed ſuch Expreſſions, Upbraid
us with it?</p>
            <p>3. Whence comes this ſo ſudden and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Zeal in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> againſt the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe Symphony in Rituals,
and Exteriour Form of Worſhip, was made uſe
of by Secretary <hi>Waſlingham,</hi> to prevent Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Excommunication by the Pope; and
whoſe advances thither ward, have been obſervable
this many years, (though now their Irreconcilable
Intereſt makes them Halt and Clamour,) as long
ſince obſerved by Dr. <hi>Du Moulin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. How can they look upon the Ordination of
that Church, which they eſteem Idolatrous, as Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
and yet diſapprove of Presbyterian and others
Ordination? And in ſo doing (though they charge
others hotly as Schiſmaticks) make themſelves
ſuch from all the Reformed Churches.</p>
            <p>6. Why did they not put the Laws in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt them, when it was in their power?
Have they not thereby, according to their own
Principles incurred, at leaſt the Guilt of Idolatry?
How many Preſentments of their Grand Juries and
Orders from their Biſhops, to put the Laws in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
againſt them, can they produce? Or when
did they complain, that the Laws were too Gentle
and Eaſie for them, as they have done againſt
us?</p>
            <p>6. Why did they Perſecute us with more Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
and permit ſuch whom they accounted Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators,
and now by continuing thoſe <hi>Penal Laws</hi>
and <hi>Teſts,</hi> put us under a neceſſity to join with
them to ſecure our own and their Liberty; and at
the ſame time Reproach us for it, though they
pretend now to be for Moderation?</p>
            <p>7. Where do they find it Preſcribed by Chriſt or
the Apoſtles, to Puniſh any of a different Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as ſuch? Did ever our Saviour or his Apoſtles
require the help of Magiſtrates, to make <hi>Penal</hi> and
<hi>Sanguinary Laws,</hi> to force People to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Church? Or, did they leave any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
to do ſo, when the Magiſtrate ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Chriſtian? Was not their way of making
Proſelytes, by Preaching, and not Priſoning; Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and not Wounding; Curing, and not Killing;
Reaſoning, not Ruining; Argument, and not
Torment; his Command was, <hi>To take up the Croſs
and follow him;</hi> but not to lay it upon others
backs that would not ſtoop thereunto; 'tis our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to keep our ſelves from Idols, though we are
not to fall foul upon Idolators. The Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
that the Weapons of our Warfare are not
Carnal; but I an ſure <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have found the
<hi>Churches</hi> Weapons ſuch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94945:4"/>
8. Where do they find that ever Chriſt or his
Apoſtles made uſe of ſuch Inſtruments to preſs
People to their Communion, as they have done?
I do not remember any mention of Proctors, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritors,
and Informers; nor of Booted Apoſtles,
Armed with Weapons of Cruelty, as ſome of their
Brethren of the Clergy were; and who obtained
from the Magiſtrates, as <hi>Saul</hi> did from the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim,</hi>
Authority to <hi>hale Men, Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to Priſon, that would not conform to their
Church,</hi> which had no other effect, but to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the People in their Diſſent, who Argued thus:
<hi>Can that be the Church of Chriſt, which acts ſo
unlike Him; He commanded us to Love, Forbear,
and Forgive one another;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>By this ſhall
men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye Love one
another;</hi> and behold they Perſecute to Baniſhment,
Confiſcation of Goods, and Death it ſelf, for
Non-conformity, to ſuch things as they themſelves
grant he never commanded. Can theſe be the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours
of the Apoſtles, who declared the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
of their Warfare not to be Carnal? And lo,
<hi>they came againſt us, as againſt Thieves, with Swords
and Staves.</hi> Can theſe be Chriſtians, who find our
peaceable Aſſembling of our ſelves, for Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, to be Riots, and yet uſe no cenſure
againſt thoſe that are really ſuch? Can that be the
Church of Chriſt, which makes uſe of ſuch Anti-Chriſtian
Inſtruments, as Perjured Informers, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched,
Swearing Proctors and Apparitors? Surely,
if we may gueſs at their Deſign by their Practices,
they have a mind to drive us to Hell, not to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
for we cannot believe ſuch men will lead us
in a better way, than they walk in themſelves.
Thus do men diſcover their Nakedneſs, when poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſled
with that furious Spirit of Perſecuton, which
drives them headlong into ſuch abſurd Practices.</p>
            <p>As for the other part of the Objection, <hi>That
when the Romanists find themſelves in a Capacity,
they will Ruine us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is no probability that ever they
ſhould equal us for number, or in that reſpect,
be any ways capable of working our Ruine;
<hi>the very attempting whereof, by Violence, will In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
iſſue in their own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is as improbable, that ever they ſhould
be able to do the ſame by Law, except the preſent
<hi>Penal Laws</hi> remain in force, and then we know
who have been their Tools hitherto; even the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Struglers for the continuance of theſe Laws;
and are as likely to be their Tools in time to come,
to work our Ruine.</p>
            <p>3. We have his Majeſty's Wiſdom, and that
of a Parliament to rely on, for finding out expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
to ſecure us; and why the breach of ſuch
Laws, as ſhall be made for Eſtabliſhing <hi>Liberty of
Conſcience,</hi> may not be attended with, as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
or more fatal Conſequences to the Romaniſts,
as acting contrary to the preſent Laws, no man
can Divine; and certainly, if you chooſe ſuch men
for your Repreſentatives, as have any Conſcience
themſelves, they will take care that it ſhall not be
ſafe (if poſſible) for any party afterward to invade
the <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> to be Eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>For it is not to be ſuppoſed, as ſome maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſuggeſt by impertinent Queries, <hi>viz.</hi> That
ſuch Laws as ſhall be made for ſecuring <hi>Liberty of
Conſcience,</hi> will be without Penalties, which would
indeed make them not able to anſwer the End:
But the Wiſdom of the Nation is to be truſted to
Annex ſuch Penalties for enforcing them, that
whoever attempts to violate the ſame, though it
were even by Propoſitions in either Houſe of
Parliament, may thereby be Ruined: Which
doth ſufficiently anſwer the great Objection, <hi>That
if Penal Laws and Teſts were removed, the</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
<hi>would be under no Awe to reſtrain them
from ſuch Methods, as they think beſt, to make
theirs the National Religion;</hi> for that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do without invading the Liberty of others;
and conſequently, rendering themſelves Obnoxious
to the Penalties of the Law, and Reſentments of
all Proteſtants, who will be ſure to deal with them
in that caſe, as Enemies to Humane Concord.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, <hi>What avails Laws, ſo long as
His Majesty has a power to Diſpenſe with them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Argues as much, and more againſt
the preſent Laws, which are admired as an Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Bulwark, than againſt ſuch Laws as ſhall be
made by his Majeſty's Conſent, and Act of his own
Good Will; which for thoſe very reaſons, will be
more binding upon him, than thoſe of anothers
making; and conſequently, not the ſame reaſon
for diſpenſing with them; nor will it be ſo eaſie
to diſpence with the Breach of ſuch Laws, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
every ones Birth-right, as with the Breach of
ſuch as deprive them of the ſame; which is the
preſent caſe; the beſt at leaſt, if not greateſt part
of Proteſtants concurring with the one; but they
will all unanimouſly oppoſe the other; but that
which is yet more, there have been propoſals
Printed with Allowance, That His Majeſty reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all the other Rights of His Prerogative Invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
may Renounce the only Right of Diſpenſing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94945:5"/>
with this Law, or of Pardoning any Tranſgreſſor of
it in any caſe whatſoever. And the ſame hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been contradicted by the Court: The <hi>Third
Letter tending to demonſtrate the Security of this
Nation againſt Perſecution,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the next place Conſider, how often you have
poured out <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears</hi> before God, to
grant you a Liberty; and how you will be able
to anſwer to him, if you do not concur with this
Opportunity which he hath put in your Hands, of
having the ſame <hi>Eſtabliſh'd by Law:</hi> Do but
think, how your Brethren who have been Expoſed
to Impoveriſhment, Impriſonment, Baniſhment,
yea, Death it ſelf, for want of ſuch a Liberty,
would have valued it; yea, at what Rate you your
ſelves ſome years ago, would have purchaſed it,
when you could not, without manifeſt Hazzard to
your ſelves and Miniſters, meet together to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God according to your Conſcience; think on
it; how then you uſed to be interrupted in your
Worſhip, by Ruffianly Train-bands and others;
and how in the midſt of your Prayers, they would
pour out their horrid Oaths and Execrations, hale
you to Priſon, abuſe the Women, vent their Rage
againſt your very Pews, and carry themſelves like
ſo many <hi>Savages.</hi> Conſider how your Houſes uſed
to be Rifled, and your Goods Seized; your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
frightned, and made an Object of Gazing to
all the Neighbourhood, upon the Oath of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
beggarly Informer: And how in an Inſtant,
though in a Flouriſhing Condition, you were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to Beggary; having neither a Bed to lye
on, nor Bitt to put in your own Mouth, or thoſe
of your Tender Wife and Dear Children, all in
Tears about you: And all this for Nonconformity
to ſuch things, as your Perſecuters themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to be indifferent, and which you
reckoned abſolutely Unlawful: Do but think how
ſome have been treated on their Death-Bed, who
could not have the Comfort of Chriſtian Friends
to aſſiſt them with their Prayers and Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
yea, or to viſit them in a Neighbourly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
without having a Conventicle ſworn againſt
them, the Bed in hazzard of being pulled from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them; and being diſturbed by the Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of ungodly Men, when they were wreſtling with
the Pangs of Death. Yea, the Informing Trade
was grown to ſuch a height, that ſome <hi>Diſſenters</hi>
could not have the Reſpects paid them, due from
their own Children, when married into other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
but had Meetings ſworn againſt them; and
this is the Churches Moderation. Can you then
be perſwaded of the Sincerity of theſe men, who
have yet given no ſigns of their Repentance, but
rather juſtifie their Practices? All their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove their Moderation, are but ſuch
<hi>Sophiſms</hi> as his, that would undertake to prove
there was no ſuch thing as Motion, but was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
roundly by one in the Company, who roſe
up and walked before him: Do but conſult your
own Sences, and you will be ſufficiently able to
anſwer them, that you know the Inſtruments of
Cruelty are in their <hi>Habitations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the laſt place, conſider how little Peace you
will have to reflect upon it, if you loſe your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Liberty, and be Reduced to the former Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,
upon believing the <hi>LIES</hi> of a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
whom you could never hitherto credit; and
for denying a ſhare in the ſame Liberty to others,
ſo agreeable to the Practice of other Proteſtant
Countries; and Conſonant to the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
of <hi>Doing as you would be done to.</hi>
