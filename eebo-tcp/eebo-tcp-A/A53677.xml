            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Ensuing Discourse was the Subject and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of two Sermons Preached unto a Private
Congregation. The Author of them had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
or purpose ever to have made them Publick. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of many, who judged they might be of use unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
because they found them so unto themselves, gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
unto this Publication of them. Yet had they not so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
but that he judged it was neither unmeet for him,
nor unseasonable for others. <hi>In publico discrimine omnis
homo miles est;</hi> No man is to be forbidden to bring his
Bucket to help allay the flames of a raging Fire. And it is
the Pretence of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> to be the only Guide of
all Christians in Religion, which is here examined; a work which
a concurrence of all sorts of circumstances renders seasonable.
For as this Pretence is the sole Foundation of the whole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
with all the Power and secular Advantages that it hath
obtained unto it self; so it is that alone which gives counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and warranty unto the Factors and Agents of that
Church, to design and prepetrate such things as are destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of all that is praise-worthy or desireable among Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb facs="tcp:54104:3"/>
and unspeakably scandalous unto Christian Religion. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the sand or rubbish hereof, and the whole Fabrick will
dissolve of it self, and fall to the ground. This small Discourse
is an Attempt unto that end, whose success is humbly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
unto the care of God over his Church. If there seem
to be any severities of expression used towards some of the
<hi>Church of Rome,</hi> the Reader is to consider that hard
things cannot well be represented in soft and pliant words. And
if there be nothing of this nature found, but what hath the
appearance of severity, from the things themselves which are
expressed, there is no blameable excess. However the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
is one who heartily desires and prayes for the outward
Peace and Tranquility of all men in this world, whose Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
will allow them to live peaceably with others.</p>

            <head>THE
CHURCH of ROME
NO
SAFE GUIDE.</head>
            <p>THE Foundation of the small ensuing discourse,
shall be laid in a <hi>Position,</hi> wherein as I suppose,
Persons of all sorts who are concerned in the things
treated about, are agreed; namely, that it is <hi>the
Duty of every man who taketh care of his own eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to betake himself into some Guide or Conduct, that may
safely lead him unto the Knowledge of the Truth, and the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Christian Obedience.</hi> The Nature of Religion, the
State of our own Minds in this World, with the eternal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of a safe unerring Guidance in things Spiritual and
Supernatural, do require that the utmost of our Diligence
and Prudence, be used in the discharge of this Duty, in the
choice of this Guide. No man of himself is sufficient by his
<hi>own Reason al<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne</hi> to be his own Guide. They who <hi>thinking
themselves wise</hi> have attempted so to be, <hi>have waxed vain in
their Imaginations, and their foolish hearts have been darkned.
Rom. 1.</hi> 21. The warning and instruction given by <hi>Solomon,</hi>
do principally respect this case; <hi>He that trusteth in his own
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54104:4"/>
heart is a fool; but whoso walketh wisely shall be delivered, Prov.
28.</hi> 26. But the Knowledg of, and Adherence unto such a
<hi>Guide,</hi> are eminently necessary, when there are great <hi>Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi>
and <hi>Divisions</hi> amongst men about Religion; especially
if they are mannaged in waies and by means not only scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
unto Religion it self, but pernitious unto Humane Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
in their consequents. When men not only say and contend
that <hi>here is Christ, and lo there is Christ, Matth. 24.</hi> 23. but
also on the account of these differences ingage into waies and
practices, ruinous unto the souls of men, and destructive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all that is praise worthy in this World, those who are not
careful to chuse and adhere unto a faithful Guide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
are no less defective in Wisdom, than negligent in their
Duty.</p>
            <p>Were a man in a Wilderness where are a multitude of cross
paths, all pretending to lead unto an inhabited City, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he must go or perish; if he see men not only contending
some for one way, some for another, but <hi>killing</hi> and <hi>destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
one another, about the preference of the several waies
they esteem best and safest; he deserves to wander and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
if he refuse a Guide that is tendred unto him with suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
evidence of his Truth and Faithfulness. That there is
such a one ready in our present case shall be immedately
evinced.</p>
            <p>The <hi>differences in Religion</hi> that are at present among us,
are of two sorts. First, Such as comparatively are of <hi>small
moment,</hi> as unto the principal ends of the Life of God. The
measure of these differences is, that which way soever they
are determined in the minds of men, they neither over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the Foundation, nor obstruct the due exercise of Faith
and Love. For this is our great Duty, with respect unto
Doctrines in Religion, that we hold <hi>fast the form of sound
words, in Faith and Love, which is in Christ Jesus, 2 Tim.
1.</hi> 13. And if any of them are so small as that it cannot be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54104:4"/>
pretended that they overthrow the Foundations of Faith and
Love, yet if they hinder them in their operations and due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
according unto the Rule of the Gospel, they are <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious</hi>
unto the souls of them in whom they have that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
But such differences which comply with this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
tend unto nothing in themselves that is obstructive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Glory or Power of Religion, whatever they may be
pressed and wrested unto, by the Lusts, Prejudices, and
carnal Interests of men. For there is no ground to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from them, for <hi>severe thoughts</hi> concerning the state and
condition of them who so differ, as unto their Interest in
present Grace and future Glory. To live in a neglect of
Love, in all the effects and fruits of it towards such on any
pretences, to design their hurt and evil, is to live in open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
unto all the Rules of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Such <hi>severe thoughts</hi> are the principal causes and occasion
of all pernicious evils in Religion; especially those which are
most scandalous unto it; and most inconsistent with that
good of Mankind, which Christian Religion is designed to
promote. For things are come to that pass among the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Christians, that when once Persons begin to <hi>damn
others</hi> in their minds for their dissent from them, they judge
themselves at liberty, and count that it is their Duty, to do
them all the mischief they can in this World. They first
make themselves their <hi>Judges</hi> that they must go to Hell, and
then would be their <hi>Executioners,</hi> to send them thither as
fast as they can. Whether this be a Representation of <hi>Christ</hi>
or of the <hi>Devil,</hi> is not hard to determine. Sure I am, it is not
compliant with the advice given unto all Guides of the
Church of an attendance whereunto they must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
2 <hi>Tim. 2. 24, 25, 26. And the Servant of the Lord must
not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient;
In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves, if God perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54104:5"/>
Truth. And that they may recover themselves out of the snare
of the Devil, who are taken captive by him at his Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is that those who have a strong inclination to
oppress and destroy other men, which their Interest prompts
them unto, do endeavour to make every the least dissent
from themselves, on one pretence or other, by <hi>Sophistical</hi>
arguments and strained consequences, to be a fundamental er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and such as makes them incapable of Life eternal. But
no men can give a greater evidence of their disintrest in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, of their unacquaintedness with the vertues
and Powers of it, wherein the glories of it do consist, and
what is of real price with God, than those who are so mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Blessed be God, that Christ will not leave his seat of
Judgment unto such Persons, neither here nor hereafter.</p>
            <p>But such differences as those mentioned, will probably
continue among Christians, so long as they continue in
this World. For although all those among whom these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
are, do chuse the same Guide, yet they do not in
all things equally hear and understand his voice. Perfection
in Light and Knowledge are required unto a perfect agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in all the conceptions of our minds about spiritual
things. Wherefore it is reserved for Heaven where every
thing that is <hi>imperfect</hi> shall be done away. Here we have
different measures; We <hi>know but in part,</hi> and therefore <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy
in part, Rom. 13.</hi> 9. It is Love or Charity alone that
supplies this defect; and gives such an Harmony unto the
different parts of the Mystical Body of Christ, which is the
Church, as renders them all useful, and the whole beautiful,
1 <hi>Cor. 13. Col. 3.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>But these are not the differences which at present I intend.
There are those which in their Nature are of greater Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
such as are about the Fundamentals of Christian Faith,
Worship and Obedience; such as upon whose determination
the eternal welfare and misery of the souls of men do depend.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54104:5"/>
And not only so, but they are such also, which on that
wretched mannagement of Religious concerns that late ages
have embraced, have an influence into the Peace or Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of Humane Society, the Tranquility, the Liberty and
Lives of men. Yea they are by some promoted and pursued,
by all waies of fraud and violence, with that height of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
as is utterly destructive of all Religion. Many we
have who plead themselves to be <hi>Christians,</hi> which might
be allowed them, if they pleased themselves, would they
not do such things as Christian Religion abhorreth. But
this is the least part of their claim; they will also be the <hi>only
Christians;</hi> all others who differ from them, however false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so called, being only a drove of <hi>unbelievers,</hi> hasting unto
Hell. Now although this be intollerable presumption, yet
because they hurt none by it, but themselves, if they will
not be awakened from this pleasing dream, they may be
suffered to sleep on. But they rest not here; these <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
who <hi>only are so,</hi> and so alone know truly what is in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, will do such things under a pretence of it, will
perpetrate such execrable crimes, avowing them to be the
dictates and commands of that <hi>Religion,</hi> that if men were
not sure that their former pretences are presumptuously
false, it would be a sufficient warranty for them, whereon
to question the whole Truth of the Gospel. And these things
are done in the pursuit of these <hi>differences in Religion</hi> which
abound among us. Wherefore if we would not contribute
unto that intollerable scandal against the Gospel, that the
Religion it teacheth is pernicious to the peace of Mankind,
and all that is praise worthy in the World, which must be
accounted for; if we have any care about our own eternal
Salvation, we ought to use our utmost diligence to arrive
unto a safe conduct through all these difficulties.</p>
            <p>This being our present case, there being such differences
in, and divisions about Religion among us; the mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54104:6"/>
of them, being grown incurably scandalous and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
our enquiry is, what Guide or Conduct a <hi>man that
takes care of his own Salvation,</hi> that would know the Truth,
and have the benefit of it, that would please God here, and
come unto the eternal Enjoyment of him hereafter, ought
to betake himself, and firmly adhere unto, as that which
will safely lead and direct him unto all these ends. For if
the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch.</p>
            <p>Two things are pleaded to be this <hi>safe and infallible Guide;</hi>
to have that conduct committed unto them, which every
one who takes care of his Salvation is obliged to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto.</p>
            <p>The first is the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> She it is who at this
time, laies a most vehement claim to be the only Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
infallible Guide of all Christians, as unto their Faith,
Worship and Obedience. We enquire not after a <hi>ministerial
Guide</hi> and the benefit which we may receive thereby. This
they regard not, as that which leaves men the exercise of
their own understandings, and use of all Divine Aids and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances,
as unto the Information, Direction and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of their Minds in all that they are to believe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
in Religion. But such a Guidance as whereunto, by
vertue of its Authority and Infallibility we are entirely and
absolutely to resign our understandings and consciences, what
ever it leads us unto, is that which this Church claimeth,
and without which she is nothing, nor can stand one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This is that which those who plead the cause of that
Church at present, do wholly betake themselves unto the
promotion of, declining what lies in them, all other <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi>
and <hi>Controversies</hi> between them and us. Such a Guide,
they say, there must be of all Christians, and this Guide is
their Church. And they do wisely consult their own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
therein. For if they can once gain this point, all other
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54104:6"/>
things which they aim at, will follow of their own accord;
and they may satisfy the desires of their hearts on the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men.</p>
            <p>Wherefore this claim of theirs consists of these three parts,
or may be reduced unto these three Heads.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That they, and they alone,</hi> are the Church of Christ;
All others who are called Christians in the World, are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
and Schismaticks, who belong not unto it, nor have
any Interest in it. Howbeit if the description given us of
the Church of Christ in the Scripture be right and good, it is
almost impossible there should be any Society or combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men on a religious account, more unlike it than that
which is called the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> This therefore must be
taken upon their own credit, and vehement Affirmation, by
them who have a mind so to do.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That this Church which they alone are,</hi> is entrusted with
Authority over the souls and consciences of all Christians, and
all that would be so, to be their <hi>only Guide</hi> in all that they are
to know, believe and do in Religion; so that whoever gives
not themselves up unto their conduct, must perish eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.
It were no hard task to manifest that a supposition
hereof, is destructive unto the Nature of Evangelical Faith
and Obedience, as also of all the Directions and Precepts given
by Christ and his Apostles for the discharge of our Duty with
respect unto them. But this they must obtain, or the whole
present <hi>Popal</hi> Interest falls unto the ground. Yet neither
will a supposition that there is such a Church, secure them;
their own pretences to be this Church being openly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to the Scripture. Nor is the Power claimed herein
derived from the Apostles who professed themselves not to
<hi>be Lords of the Faith of Believers, 2 Cor. 1. 24. 1 Pet. 5.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>3. They plead that hereon, no more is required of any
man, who takes care of his Salvation; but that he <hi>give up
himself absolutely and entirely unto the conduct of their Church,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:54104:7"/>
believing what it proposeth, and that on this ground alone,
that it is proposed by it, and obeying all its commands;
whereby they seem to set this pretended Guide in <hi>the Temple
of God, shewing him that he is God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the claim of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> these are the
Principles whereinto it is resolved, which whether they have
any thing in them of Truth or Modesty, will immediately
be made to appear.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Holy Scripture with the Divine Aids and
assistances for the understanding thereof, which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
unto all that diligently seek him,</hi> is pleaded to be the
<hi>only Rule and Guide</hi> that men ought to betake themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
in case of those important differences in Religon, which
are under consideration And the plea on the behalf thereof
is reducible unto these five Heads.</p>
            <p>1. That this Scripture is a <hi>Divine supernatural Revelation</hi>
of God, his Mind and his Will. This Foundation is unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable,
and will never fail them that build upon it. Those
of the <hi>Roman Religion</hi> will propose ensnaring Questions about
it, unto them on whom they design. They will be asking
how they know the Scripture to be the Word of God, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
to disprove the evidences they produce to prove it so
to be. But this bold artifice is of no use in this case; for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
confess it so to be; only they prefer the Authority of
their Church testifying it so to be, as more safely to be rested
in and trusted unto, than that of God himself, which cannot
be unto the advantage of their cause, with any considerate
Persons.</p>
            <p>2. That it is a <hi>Divine Revelation of the whole Mind and
Will of God, as unto all things that are necessary unto his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and our Salvation.</hi> This it frequently testifieth of it self;
and on the former supposition of its being such a Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
its Testimony must be granted to be infallibly true.
Both these Assertions the <hi>Apostle</hi> expresly conjoyneth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:54104:7"/>
3. 15, 16, 17. Somewhat they except here in respect of their
<hi>unwritten Traditions,</hi> but dare not positively deny that the
Scripture is a sufficient Revelation of <hi>all things absolutely
necessary</hi> unto Salvation. Indeed to do so will leave no assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
unto any man that he can ever know what is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unto salvation. But they have a reserve whereunto they
betake themselves on a concession hereof; namely, that
whatever be contained in it, it <hi>cannot be understood,</hi> but as
the sense of it is declared by their Church. But this is a
bold unproved presumption, contrary unto the design of God
in giving us his Word, and the experience of all who have
been exercised in it.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Way, Manner and Method of this Revelation are
such as are suited unto Divine Wisdom and Goodness,</hi> whether
they please men or no. It is with reference unto these things
that they expatiate and enlarge themselves, in charging the
Scripture with obscurity, and unfitness thereon to be our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Rule and Guide. For the <hi>Bible,</hi> they say, is a Book com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of <hi>Histories, Prophecies, Songs, Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Epistles,</hi>
and is therefore unmeet for any such use or end. But these
things are of no consideration in our present case. It is thus
given out immediately by God himself; and therefore every
way answers Divine Wisdom and Goodness; whether men
are pleased with it or no, we are not at all concerned. He
who designed it for the instruction of the Church, alone
knows what was to be the <hi>Method</hi> of its composure unto
that end. And it hath been proved on another occasion,
that considering the state of the Church in its several Ages,
the nature of that Faith which is to be wrought and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by this Divine Revelation, with the manner of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
becoming the Authority of God; and the holy Scripture
could not have been given out unto us in any other Order
or Method, than that wherein it is disposed.</p>
            <p>4. On these suppositions, <hi>there neither is, nor can be more
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54104:8"/>
required of us in order unto our eternal salvation, but that we
understand aright, firmly believe, and yield obedience unto the
Revelation of the Mind and Will of God that is made therein.</hi>
The Assurance hereof is so evidently included in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Assertions, that it needs no confirmation. Every thought
unto the contrary, is so injurious unto the Wisdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Grace and Truth of God, so opposite unto all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Minds of men, on a supposition of Gods speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto them, that it ought to be rejected with detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>5. There are <hi>efficacious Aids promised, and assured means
appointed by God himself to help all that diligently seek him,
unto a certain infallible understanding of his Mind in the
Scripture,</hi> so far as the Knowledge of it is necessary unto our
Salvation. This also I have lately confirmed in a peculiar
discourse. These are the Heads whereunto the Plea for
the Guidance of the Scripture in all differences and divisions
about Religion, may be reduced.</p>
            <p>The case being thus plainly stated, the enquiry hereon is,
whether of these Guides, <hi>a man that takes care of his own
eternal Salvation,</hi> should betake himself, and firmly adhere
unto, to the end.</p>
            <p>In answer unto this Enquiry, I shall prove, that no wise
man who feareth God, and is careful of the eternal condition
of his own soul, <hi>can chuse the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>for this Guide,</hi>
foregoing the other of the Scripture, with the Divine Aids
promised and given for the understanding thereof.</p>
            <p>The Person of whom I speak I suppose to be a <hi>wise man;</hi>
that is, one who prefers things eternal unto those that are
temporal, so as not to be ensnared by earthly Interests and
Advantages, unto the forfeiture of his Interest in things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove;
and will be careful not to be imposed on by men
who design their own Advantage in what they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him unto. He who is otherwise minded is a fool.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54104:8"/>
He is also one that <hi>feareth God,</hi> and therefore is real and in
good earnest in Religion, as desiring to <hi>please him</hi> in all
things. For there are many who give the world no small
disturbance about religious concerns, who do on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
manifest that they have little or no regard unto God in
what they say or do. But in the Persons whom I address
unto, I suppose that they really take care above all other
things of the eternal salvation of their souls. And I shall not
deal with them by <hi>abstruse Arguments,</hi> nor by Testimonies
of men that may be bandied up and down, on the one side
and the other; but by such plain Reasonings as are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
unto the common understanding of all sober, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date,
rational Persons, who own the Principles of Christian
Religion, which have their force from the general usage of
mankind in things of an alike nature, the common natural
Principles of mens minds, where they are not vitiated and
depraved, with the experience of what they have found al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in any Duties of Religious Worship. Indeed if we
could but prevail with men to be perswaded that every man
must believe for <hi>himself,</hi> and obey for <hi>himself,</hi> and give an
account for <hi>himself,</hi> this difference would be at an end. For
the choice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Guide enquired
after, is nothing but the putting of the care of saving our
souls unto others, who will not be able to answer for us,
when our Trial shall come.</p>
            <p>And this subject in particular I have chosen at present to
insist upon for two Reasons.</p>
            <p>1. Because, as was before observed, those who at present
do plead the <hi>Interest of this Church</hi> among us, do decline
what they can all particular Controversies, and under various
notions betake themselves to this alone, about an <hi>Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Guide</hi> and Leader of all Christians, which they pretend
their Church to be. They do not in their projection for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes,
go to them and enter into Disputes about <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:54104:9"/>
the <hi>Sacrifice of the Mass, Adoration of Images,</hi>
or the like, no nor yet about the <hi>Popes Infallibility.</hi> But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
themselves to be greatly advantaged by the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in Religion that are among us, which usually they enlarge
upon without either truth or modesty, under a concealment
of greater differences among themselves, they insist only on
the necessity of such a <hi>Guide</hi> which they pretend <hi>their
Church alone</hi> to be. Hereby have they prevailed on many,
who on one account or other, do think themselves unmeet
any longer to take care of their own salvation. And when
once they have prevailed herein, there is nothing so horrid,
nothing so wicked, that they cannot impose on the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of their <hi>Proselytes.</hi> They will not now scruple or stick
at all, at those things, which they would have dreaded to have
thought of, whilst they had the care of themselves in any
measure upon them. Not one man of a thousand who sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
that he hath himself and his own soul in charge, that
he must give an account of and for himself, will venture on
those waies and practices which they will with great satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
rush into, under their conduct.</p>
            <p>2. Because of the strange waies they have lately taken, to
put this pretence into use and practice, and to <hi>take us all</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their conduct. Pretending unto the guidance of our souls
in the things of God, they have attempted to take us into
their power as unto our Lives, Liberties, Laws, and all other
our concernments in this world, which whosoever doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully,
forfeits all his own. And a sufficient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Indication it
is of what Guidance we were like to meet withal, when way
was to be made unto it, by Fire, Confusion, Blood, Massacres
and Sedition.</p>
            <p>Should there be a <hi>School</hi> erected, pretending unto an easie
certain way of teaching all Sciences, Divine and Humane,
should it pretend a <hi>Grant</hi> that nothing of this nature should
be taught or learned but in and by it; yet if I saw the posts
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54104:9"/>
of the house hung like Shambles with the limbs of slaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
person; if the ground about it be strewed with the bones
and ashes of men burned to death; here lying one strangled,
there another stabbed, a third poisoned; all for no other
cause, but either because they would not submit to the
teaching thereof, or would not learn things foolish and
wicked, I should avoid such a School and its Power so far
as I were able. But yet because there hath of late among us
a great accession been made really unto this Guidance by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
formerly professing the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> I shall a
little enquire into the Causes of it, or the Means whereby it
hath been brought about. And I shall not fear to say, that
as unto the most of them who have relinquished the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Religion, they are these that follow.</p>
            <p>1. A <hi>profound Ignorance</hi> of the Internal Powers of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
with an utter want of all experience of them in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
makes them an easie prey to seducers. Persons who
have never had any concernment in Religion, beyond the
out-side solemnity of it, with some notions and opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Doctrines of it, are easily <hi>tossed to and fro,</hi> from
one Religion unto another, or unto none at all, through the
<hi>cunning slights of men who lye in wait to deceive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When men have only a <hi>form of Godliness</hi> in the Profession
of the Truth, but know nothing of the <hi>Power of it,</hi> it is an
uncertain Accident whether they persevere in that Profession
or no. There are Internal Powers of true Religion which
are efficacious on the minds of men, to enlighten them to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
them, and give them liberty from the adverse Powers
of darkness, vanity and bondage unto sin. Where men have
experience of them in their own hearts, there and there alone,
if a vigorous impression unto the contrary do befall them,
will they be constant in the Profession of the Truth. The
success of our <hi>Roman Emissaries,</hi> is confined almost unto that
sort of Persons, who under the outward Profession of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54104:10"/>
               <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> have been totally ignorant of the vertue
and power of the Truth contained therein.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Wickedness of Life</hi> taking shelter in the Promises of
eternal security, which that Church with presumptuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
tenders unto all that will give up themselves unto
her conduct, though in the last moment of their lives, gains
them a multitude of <hi>Proselytes.</hi> This engine they apply unto
many when they are leaving the world, even unto such as
having lived in sinand ignorance, are ready to receive condign
punishment for their villanies, deceiving them of those few
minutes which might be improved in seeking after <hi>Evangelical</hi>
Faith and Repentance. But this is the least use they make of
it. There are in the world, among those that are called <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
Mighty men, Nobles, men of Dignity and Revenue,
who live in their sins, and are resolved so to do. Yet are
they not able by any means to secure their consciences from
troublesome fears of eternal miseries that will ensue on the
course wherein they are. By all crafty waies of access and
compliance, the <hi>Factors of this Church</hi> do insinuate themselves,
or by others are introduced into the acquaintance of this sort
of Persons. And the first thing they offer unto them, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
security of eternal salvation, if they will but relinquish
Heresie, wherein it is impossible they should ever be saved,
and betake themselves unto the conduct of the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> of the change of their lives, the Relinquishment of their
sins, of Repentance from dead works, of the Life of God, and
universal Obedience therein, there are no words between
them. Many of these persons who are resolved beforehand
rather to part with all the Religion in the world, than with one
of their lusts and sins, do readily embrace the <hi>composition</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.
For really that which is tendred unto them is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
between living in sin, and assured going unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which before they knew not that they could be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.
For however they shall live for the future, suppose in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54104:10"/>
the sins of adultery, fornication, prophane swearing, luxury,
drunkenness, or the like, the Church will take care that by
Confessions, Masses and Purgatory, they shall be undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
saved. At this door have entred great numbers of unclean
beasts unto the encrease of the Herd, who often prove the
most forward Zealots for the <hi>Catholick Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Secular Interests</hi> and advantages accommodated unto
all sorts of Persons, are another means of their prevalency.
There are no sorts of Persons from the highest to the lowest,
that come within their walk and compass, or unto whom
they can have access, with the least probability of success,
unto whom they have not in a readiness to propose some
<hi>secular advantages,</hi> suited unto their State, Condition, Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and Abilities. <hi>Great men</hi> shall have favour and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondencies
with Potentates abroad, besides a principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in that alteration in national affairs, which they doubt
not but they shall introduce. <hi>Schollers</hi> shall be used and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
at least when they have any eminency in abilities,
they shall not want steem and advancement. <hi>Mechanicks</hi>
shall be employed, and the poorest one way or other provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for. And for all sorts of discontented Persons, who may
be of any use unto their Interest, they have the refuge of
their <hi>Monasteries,</hi> for their entertainment. And is it any
wonder, if in this degenerate age, wherein the most of men
do openly and visibly declare a predominancy in their minds
and affections of things carnal and temporal, above those that
are spiritual and eternal, many be ensnared by these promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which either shall be made good unto them, or at least
are sufficient to keep them in expectation, untill they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
beyond recovery.</p>
            <p>4. M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny, it is to be feared, fall under the dreadful account
given of Gods Righteous dealings with those who obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, under the Profession of the Truth, 2 <hi>Thess.
2. 10, 11, 12. Because they received not the Love of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54104:11"/>
Truth that they might be saved, God shall send them strong De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions
that they should believe a lie, that they all might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damned
who believed not the Truth, but had pleasure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness.</hi>
This is that which we have more cause to
fear with respect unto this Nation, than all the Artifices of
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>Lastly; How powerful and prevalent <hi>the last voice</hi> of this
Church may prove I know not. The <hi>Motto</hi> of some poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
on their great Guns, is <hi>Vox Vltima Regum;</hi> the last
voice of Kings; that of this Church is fire and fagot; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I pray and hope that they shall never more be heard to
speak in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Allowing them these advantages, I shall now prove that</hi>
no wise or sober man, who takes care of his own Salvation, can
give up himself to the conduct of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his
choice of Religion, then when there are the most abounding contests
about the Truth, and the right way of its Profession, <hi>which is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
our present case.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my first reason I shall proceed no farther but to render
this pretended Guide <hi>suspected</hi> with all wise and sober men.
For it will be granted I suppose, that we ought throughly to
consider who or what that <hi>Guide</hi> is, whereunto we do abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
resign the disposal of all our spiritual concernments
without power of Revocation.</p>
            <p>If any men were to make such an absolute Trust of their
Lives, Estates aud Liberties into the hand of another man
or of other men, putting them all absolutely out of their own
Power, certainly they would think it their Wisdom and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
to consider aright how and what they are, unto whom
they do so fully and absolutely resign themselves, and all that
they have. And if they have any just suspicion of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
or Faithfulness, or that they seek themselves or their
own advantage in taking this <hi>Trust</hi> upon them, they will not
easily be induced to resign up their all unto them. Yea the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54104:11"/>
more earnest they are to perswade them, the more will they
suspect that there is <hi>Knavery</hi> in the cause. How much more
carefull ought we to be in the chusing a <hi>Guide</hi> into whose
power and disposal we must resign all the eternal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our souls; which all men do, who absolutely give
give up the conduct of themselves unto the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
in all matters of Religion. For notwithstanding all their pleas
of a sure and safe <hi>bank</hi> for the consciences of men, there are
great presumptions that they will <hi>break at last,</hi> and leave them
who have entrusted them unto eternal beggary.</p>
            <p>I shall give but one <hi>Reason</hi> which renders this pretended
Guide so <hi>justly suspected,</hi> as that no wise man can commit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
thereunto in things of this importance.</p>
            <p>And this is the <hi>prodigious worldly secular advantages</hi> which
the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath made unto it self by this pretence of
being the only Guide of all Christians in matters of Religion.
For this pretence is the sole foundation of the whole Papacy;
which when the sand of it is removed, must fall to the
ground. And we may consider both what they have obtained
by it, and how they use their Acquisition. For (1.) By ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of this pretence alone, they have erected their <hi>Popedom,</hi>
obtained <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Soveraignties,</hi> possessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of the principal <hi>Revenues</hi> of most Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi>
have heaped up <hi>huge Treasures</hi> of wealth, wherewith they
maintain innumerable Persons who have nothing to do, but
by all Arts to promote their Interest, especially that nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
society which is grown at this day the pest and terror
of the world. These things are evident in other Nations, they
were so formerly in this; and in all the Zeal which of late
they have pretended for the conversion, as they call it, of this
Nation, it is legibly written in all the parts of their design,
and the whole mannagement of it, that it was <hi>Power, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
Wealth</hi> and <hi>Revenue</hi> unto themselves that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
this Place, that Dignity, and the other Revenue, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54104:12"/>
the carnally sweet Dominion over the consciences of all sorts
of Persons were in their eye.</p>
            <p>2. We may consider what <hi>use they make</hi> of these secular
Advantages and Revenues which they have obtained meerly
by vertue of this pretence. And it may be said with modesty,
that these things were never forced to be wickedly service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto the lusts of men, among the Heathens themselves,
more than they are and have been among all sorts of men,
in the Church of <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Ambition, Avarice, Pride, Luxury,
Sensuality, Cruelty, are the Deities that they sacrifice the
spoils of the souls and consciences of men unto. There is
no sort of wickedness, not the highest and most provoking,
not the most vile and sordid that Humane Nature is capable
of, but multiplied instances may be given of the perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, by the Advantage which they make of this
pretence.</p>
            <p>This consideration I say is sufficient unto all wise men to
render this <hi>pretended Guide</hi> justly suspected; and to bring
the vagabond unto the strictest and severest examination that
the Law and Word of God doth direct unto in such cases.</p>
            <p>1. It is so on the account of <hi>Reason</hi> and common usage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men in cases of an alike nature. If it be notoriously
known and evident, that any sort of persons, whatever else
they seem to be or act, do make great and unaccountable
advantages unto themselves by any Trusts that are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto them, pretending nothing in the mean time but
the good of them who so entrust them; a wise man will not
absolutely give up the disposal of himself and all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
unto such persons. Yea when men are more than
ordinarily urgent to have such Trusts committed unto them,
we do ordinarily enquire what is their interest in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of care and trouble that makes them so earnest. And if
we find that they have made their own <hi>Advantages</hi> on all
such occasions, we shall not be too forward to give up unto
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54104:12"/>
them all that we have; especially if the resignation of our
selves and our concerns desired by them, be such as we shall
never more have the disposal of any thing in our own power,
nor shall they be <hi>accountable</hi> for any thing they do thereon.
It may be you will say, those who desire this great Trust to
be reposed in them, are in all other things of Vertue and
Piety, most eminent above others. But what if by various
waies and means they discover themselves to be for the most
part of the very worst of men. It will assuredly be said, that
such a kind of Trust as that mentioned, would be ridiculous,
and was never made by any wise man; fools and mad men
being only meet to be confined unto it.</p>
            <p>Yet such is the Trust that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> requireth
that we should commit unto her, and that in affaires of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
greater importance than all other earthly concerns.
For she would have us <hi>absolutely</hi> resign up our souls and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
with all our eternal Interests, unto her Conduct and
Guidance, without any reservation for the use our own Light,
Reason, Knowledge or Faith, &amp; without power of Revocation
on pain of damnation. In the mean time it is evident and
notorious, that by vertue of this <hi>Pretence,</hi> she hath erected
the Popedom, obtained Principalities and Dominion, endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her self with the principal Revenues of the Nations,
and erected a Supremacy over Kings and Kingdoms to be
disposed of at their pleasure. Is it not the Duty of a wise
man when any of these Persons are importunate with him
to forsake the Scripture, and his own understanding, with all
the experience which ever he had of the Power of Religion,
and to give up himself absolutely unto their conduct; to
enquire what is the <hi>Interest of these men</hi> in these things
which makes them thus importunate.</p>
            <p>And if this appear openly to be an encrease or confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their secular advantages, he will say that this is a
Trust fit only for them to make, whom Darkness, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54104:13"/>
the love of Sin, and a vitious conversation have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
spiritual fools and bedlams, that can in nothing guide
themselves. Especially he will do so, when he shall find
that these high pretenders to be the <hi>only Guides</hi> of the souls
and consciences of other men, do for the most part walk in
paths themselves that go down to the Chambers of Death.
That they are so far from giving examples of Christian Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Humility, Self-denial, Faith, Love or real Holiness,
from giving a just Representation of Christ in the Image of
God on themselves, as that in many great, notable, prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
instances they represent the Devil, with all his Malice,
Cruelty and Blood, unto the World.</p>
            <p>2. There is that which doth hereon, yet farther increase a
just suspicion of this pretended Guide. And this is the <hi>way
of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> and of his Apostles under him and
after him, unto whom that Conduct of our souls which the
Pope and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do now lay claim unto, was
really committed by God even the Father. It is known that
our Lord Jesus Christ himself, though in his Divine Person he
was the Soveraign Possessor of Heaven and Earth, yet in that
<hi>Ministry</hi> wherein he took the Guidance of mens souls, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
nothing, possesse nothing beyond food and raiment,
nor made the least outward Advantage by any good that he
did, or by any miracles that he wrought. This state in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
belonged unto his <hi>Humiliation,</hi> and was a part of his
sufferings. But withal it was chosen by himself for this end,
to convince and satisfie the souls of men, that he designed
nothing in all his Instruction and Guidance of them, but the
Glory of God in their eternal welfare; gaining nothing
unto himself but reproaches, persecution, and the Cross. This
he did as knowing that there was that Glory, Beauty, Power
and Usefulness in the Truth wherein he instructed men, that
nothing was outwardly needful to give it an effectual
entrance into their minds, but only to deliver them from
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54104:13"/>
               <hi>prejudices,</hi> which all self advantages made by him would
have given unto them. The <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> who have
since pretended unto the same conduct of mens minds in
Religion, which was entrusted originally with him <hi>whom the
Father sealed,</hi> knowing that what they had to teach of their
own, and to lead men into, had no Glory, Beauty, Evidence,
nor Use in it self, have wisely betaken themselves unto the
waies of fraud and force, to impose their Doctrine on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of men, with this bait and allurement, that what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and advantage they make unto themselves, by the conduct
which they have assumed, others according to their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shall be sharers therein.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Holy Apostles</hi> succeeded unto the Personal Ministry
of our Lord Jesus Christ, as unto this conduct of the souls
of men. Such Power was committed unto them, by him,
who sent them <hi>even as the Father sent him;</hi> such Assurance
was there in their conduct, through Infallible Inspiration, and
the presence of the Holy Ghost with them in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
manner, as that all men were bound to give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto their Conduct and Guidance. Howbeit they
judged that there was no Duty more incumbent on them,
than to make it evident unto all the world, that they neither
sought nor would accept of any temporal Advantages unto
themselves by the Trust reposed in them; but were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that their portion in this world should lye in all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
and calamities of it. And this they willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto, that all men might he encouraged to trust
them in their everlasting affairs, when they saw what loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
they were by it in this World, without desire, hope, or
expectation of any better condition.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> laies claim to the very same Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
over, and conduct of the consciences of men in Religion,
as were committed unto Jesus Christ and his Apostles. It
is as safe, as they pretend, for a man to cast off the Authority
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54104:14"/>
and Institutions of Christ himself, as to dissent from those of
the <hi>Pope.</hi> But what in the mean time meaneth this blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Sheep and lowing of the Oxen; whence is it that
they have mannaged the pretence hereof, to the gaining of
Power, Dominion, Wealth and Revenues unto themselves,
beyond that of the greatest Kings and Princes in this World?
Let others do as they shall think fit, I shall never commit the
conduct of my soul unto them, who for ought I know would
never look after me, nor any other, were it not for the
advantage they make by it unto the service of their earthly
desires.</p>
            <p>It may be said, that <hi>other Churches</hi> and Persons do make
advantages unto themselves by that conduct of the souls of
men which they lay claim unto. And if this be sufficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such <hi>Guides</hi> suspected, we shall scatter the Churches, and
leave none to guide them. I answer, it doth no way fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
For the Rules, Measures, and outward Allowances for
and in the name of their Labour and Guidance unto the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the Gospel, are in general so stated in the Scripture,
as that men cannot mistake therein unto their prejudice.
But we are not at all concerned in what Advantages men
make unto themselves hereby; provided that the conduct
they pretend unto, be such as is accompanied with no <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over our Faith,</hi> but is proposed only as an <hi>help</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
Whilst men require not an absolute Resignment of our
souls and consciences unto them, but leave us unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
libert of our own minds, to judge upon and receive
what they propose unto us; to examine and try all that they
instruct us in, which we may reject or refuse, according as it
evidenceth it self to be good or evil unto us; there is no great
danger in our conduct.</p>
            <p>This I say is sufficient to render this <hi>pretended Guide</hi> which
with so much vehement importunity would impose it self up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, to be so <hi>justly suspected,</hi> unto all men not forsaken as well
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54104:14"/>
of common Reason, as of all due Reverence unto the Word
of God, as that they will not readily embrace it.</p>
            <p>2. As what hath been spoken is sufficient to render this
<hi>pretended Guide suspected</hi> with all sober and considerate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
so there are cogent reasons, why it ought to be <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
rejected,</hi> by all who take care of their own eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
The cause peculiarly under consideration is stated on
a double supposition.</p>
            <p>1. That there are such <hi>differences</hi> in and about Religion
among us, as wherein the eternal Salvation of the Souls of
men are immediately concerned. For some of them consist
in Opinions, Principles and Practises, pernicious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
unto Salvation, as each side doth acknowledge and
contend. And it is meet the cause at present should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
stated on this supposition, because those of the <hi>Roman
Church</hi> design their great advantage from it.</p>
            <p>2. That in this case we ought diligently to apply our selves
unto some <hi>safe Guide</hi> which may lead and conduct us in the
right way, wherein we may glorify God, and obtain eternal
Blessedness unto our own souls. This also is not only allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them, but <hi>fiercely contended for,</hi> as a Foundation of
their whole cause. Wherefore to determin our Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in our enquiry on these suppositions, we may consider
the things that follow.</p>
            <p>1. The first Supposition is <hi>plainly stated in the Scripture.</hi>
It is plainly affirmed therein that such things were then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
in the Church, that they would fall out in after ages,
and encrease towards the End &amp; Consummation of all things.
See to this purpose, <hi>Acts 20. 29, 30. 1 Tim. 4. 1, 2, 3. 2 Tim.
4. 3, 4. 2 Pet. 2. 1, 3. 1 John 4. 1, 2,</hi> 3. all in compliance
with the holy warnings and predictions of our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
himself unto the same purpose, <hi>Matth. 24 4, 5, 11, 23,
24, 25,</hi> 26. In all these places and many other, the Cause
as stated in our supposition is expresly foretold, with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54104:15"/>
effects of Opinions and Heresies, overthrowing the
Foundation of Faith, and destroying the souls of men. In this
cause is a certain Guide necessary in a peculiar manner.</p>
            <p>2. In <hi>no one place,</hi> either in express words, or by direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
are Believers or the Disciples of Christ, directed
in this case to betake themselves unto such a Guidance of the
<hi>Church of Rome.</hi> They are not so in any one place where
these Divisions are foretold, where properly such directions
should be expected or no where; nor yet in any other place
whatever. Any one Divine Testimony unto this purpose,
giving this Direction on that supposition, shall for ever deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
this Controversie.</p>
            <p>Shall we think that the Lord Jesus Christ, foreknowing,
foretelling, and warning all his Disciples of such a dangerous
state and condition, as from which they cannot escape or be
delivered, without a <hi>Guide</hi> that will safely lead and conduct
them, if there were but <hi>one</hi> such Guide prepared and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him, should no where in any Divine Revelation direct
them thereunto? Doth a supposition hereof truly represent
unto us his love, care and compassion towards the Church?
Can any thing more injurious unto his Wisdom, Faithfulness
and Honour, be once imagined? It is impossible therefore
that any man in the case supposed, should betake himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the sole conduct of the <hi>Pope or Church of Rome,</hi> without
casting contempt on him and his Authority. But,</p>
            <p>3. Yet there is farther Evidence of his Mind herein, in that
we are expresly in this case directed unto <hi>another Guide,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any mention of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> which is utterly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of this pretence. For (1.) All Believers are commanded
themselves to examine and try all false Teachers, Prophets
and Spirits that are not of God, Doctrines subverting the Faith,
and endangering the souls of men; which is utterly inconsistent
with that absolute universal Resignation of themselves unto
the Guidance of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is claimed by it.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54104:15"/>
See 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 1, 2,</hi> 3. (2. They are directed unto the Way, Means
and Rule whereby they must make this Trial, and come unto
the final determination in their own minds, <hi>Isa. 8. 20. 2 Pet. 1.
v. 19. 2 Tim. 3. 15, 16,</hi> 17. And this also is diametrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
unto that Resignation of themselves unto the <hi>Church of
Rome,</hi> which it requireth of them. (3.) They have a <hi>Guide</hi>
promised unto them, to give them an understanding of the
Rule in the discharge of this Duty, and to enable them to
make a right and safe Determination thereon, <hi>Joh 16. 13. 1 Joh.
2 26,</hi> 27. These things are consistent with a <hi>Ministerial Guide,</hi>
such as is found in all true Churches, wherein none pretend
to be Lords of our Faith, but only helpers of our Joy. But
with a Supreme Authoritative Guide requiring an absolute
Resignation of our understandings and consciences unto it
self, they are altogether inconsistent.</p>
            <p>This is the substance of our case, and this is the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of it given us by the Holy Ghost. Diversities and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in Principles, Opinions and Practices in Religion are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
unto as great an height as they can beat, at this day
in the World. Teachers <hi>speaking perverse things; departures
from the Faith, giving heed to seducing Spirits and Doctrines of
Devils; Teachers not enduring sound Doctrine; turning away
mens Ears from the Truth, and turning them unto Fables; false
Teachers, bringing in damnable Heresies, denying the Lord
that bought them, many following their pernicious waies; Spirits
of false Prophets going out in the World, the Spirit of Antichrist.</hi>
These things I say are all supposed and foretold in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
In this case and state of things, that we be not seduced,
that our souls be not ruined, we are commanded our selves
to try and examine all those who teach such things, whether
they be of God or no; and by the Scripture we are to try
them if we intend not to be deceived and undone for ever.
Unto the right understanding hereof a sure and faithful Guide
is promised unto us, to lead us unto all Truth; so that no
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54104:16"/>
concernment of Religion is more plainly stated, and as unto
our Duty, more expresly determined in the Scripture than
this is.</p>
            <p>It is so in a peculiar manner, in the <hi>first Epistle of John the
Apostle.</hi> Before the end of his daies, Divisions, Errors, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
began to abound in Christian Religion. This he fully
testifieth, <hi>Chap. 4. 1, 2, 3,</hi> 4. And <hi>Epist. the 2.</hi> 7. According unto
his Duty he writes unto Believers to warn them of their
danger, with reference unto them that <hi>seduced them,</hi> or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
so to do, <hi>chap. 2.</hi> 26. And he writes unto this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
unto <hi>Fathers, young Men and Children,</hi> or professed Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
of all sorts, degrees and endowments, <hi>ver. 12,</hi> 13. and
this not because <hi>they did not know the Truth, but because they
did know it,</hi> and had experience of its Power, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. But
in all the Directions he gives them for the discharge of their
Duty, so as that they might escape the dangers they were
exposed unto; there is not any <hi>one word,</hi> any intimation that
they should betake themselves unto the Guidance of this or
that, or any Church, much less that which is called the
<hi>Church of Rome.</hi> But the summe of his Direction is, that
they should rely on the <hi>Vnction</hi> they had received from the
Holy One, or the Aids and Supplies of the Spirit of God, to
understand the Scripture in the Examination and Trial they
were to make of all these things, <hi>chap. 2. ver. 20,</hi> 27.</p>
            <p>But to preserve their Interest, they tell us that these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
and Promises are given unto the <hi>Church,</hi> and not unto
individual Believers; as though the Church were any thing
materially, but individual Believers, and formally but a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of them into a sacred Order for their edification.
<hi>Man was not made for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath was made
for man.</hi> Believers were not made for the Church, but the
Church is made for Believers; and is of no use, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto their edification. And to deny all individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to be the first object of all Gospel Precepts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54104:16"/>
Churches in what sense soever you take them, being
so only as they are directive of their Faith and Obedience, is
to exempt their consciences from the Authority of Christ, to
turn them into beasts, and to overthrow the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Let men now who <hi>take care of their own eternal Salvation,</hi>
place themselves in their Thoughts in that condition, which
the present case and their own circumstances do place them in.
The World, the Place where they live, the People whereunto
they do belong, are filled with different Apprehensions, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
Opinions and Practices in and about Religion. Some
of these, as those between the <hi>Papists</hi> and the <hi>Protestants,</hi> have
immediate influence into their eternal condition of Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Misery, as both parties contend. Dreadful disorders
and confusions have followed, and are like to follow these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
even in this World. They will in this case find, that
it highly concerns them to take care that they be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and thereby ruined eternally, as multitudes are; that
they be not high-minded, but fear. A <hi>Guide</hi> is that which
they are to look after, that may carry them safely through all
these difficulties and dangers. Two immediately offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto them, tendring the utmost assurance in these
things, which the nature of man is capable of in this world.
The one is the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> which requires no
more of them, but a blind submission unto its Guidance; a
way I confess to extricate themselves, and to deliver them
from all care about their own souls, easie and facile, if safe.
The other is the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> with the promised Aids of
the Spirit of God, to lead us unto the understanding of it, and
the Truth contained in it. But in this way it is required of
men, that they make use of their own Reason, Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Judgment, Diligence, with fervent Prayer for Divine
Assistance.</p>
            <p>The present Question is, Whether of these two Guides
such Persons ought to betake themselves unto? I am on the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54104:17"/>
consideration of one directive Reason only, others shall be
afterwards spoken unto. And this is, that the Scripture,
which all acknowledge to be the Word of God, to speak in his
Name, expresly supposing this case, and all the circumstances
of it before laid down, doth thereon, frequently direct and
command us, to make use of this latter Guide, if we desire to
be saved; and doth no where, no not once, on a supposition
of this case, send us unto the Guidance of the Church or Pope
of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other Church whatever. Wherefore for men
to suffer themselves to be inveagled, their souls to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and their Faith overthrown by a few captious <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phystical</hi>
Reasonings of men of perverse minds, pursuing their
own secular Interest; to turn aside from the commandments
of our Lord Jesus Christ and his Apostles, in so plain, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and indisputable a case and Duty, is such a folly in it
self, such an impiety against God, such a contempt of the
Lord Christ, his Wisdom, Authority and Care, as must be
eternally accounted for.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The things for the most part which this <hi>pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Guide</hi> proposeth unto, and imposeth on the Consciences,
Faith, and Practice of them who give up themselves unto its
conduct, are so unreasonable, so contrary unto the common
sense of Christians, and the very first notions of the minds of
men any way enlightened with the Doctrine of the Gospel;
so directly opposite unto the design of God in the Revelation
of himself unto us, and his commands concerning our Faith
and Obedience; that it is a thing astonishable, how they should
attain an access unto them who have any sense of these
things. But when once men have their <hi>ey<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s bored out,</hi> as they
do it for themselves in the Resignation they make of their
understandings and consciences unto the conduct of this
Church, they must <hi>grind</hi> whatever is brought unto them. I
shall briefly instance in some few things of this sort.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>keeping of the Scripture from their daily and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54104:17"/>
use.</hi> I speak not directly unto them who being brought
up from their infancy in that Church, know nothing of the
Scripture, but that the Bible is an obscure dangerous Book
unto all Lay-men, which <hi>Hereticks</hi> make use of unto their
advantage. Such Persons can be contented to want it, or be
without it, all their lives; especially seeing it is full of Light
and Principles inconsistent with their carnal Lusts and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.
But I speak of such who many of them like <hi>Timothy</hi>
have known the Scriptures from Children; and having been
conversant in them, have had some experience of their Power.</p>
            <p>Unto such as these come Persons in the name and on the
behalf of this <hi>pretended Guide.</hi> And a compass of plausible
words they will use, fit to distract and amuse weak and unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
minds. But the plain sense of what they say in this case
is; <hi>cast away this Bible, this Book; it doth but perplex you
and disturb your minds with things that are above you, which
you cannot understand,</hi> and is therefore an occasion of almost
all the pernicious errors that are in the World Will not any
such Person be ready to say; hath God given this Book,
this alone, as the only Revelation of his Mind and Will unto
us, as the Guide and Rule whereby we may come unto the
eternal Enjoyment of him, which you dare not directly deny?
hath he commanded me to Read, Study, Meditate, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
in it continually? have I found the benefit, of the
Light, counsel and consolation administred by it in my own
soul; and shall I now forsake it, cast it away, to betake my
self unto <hi>your Guidance</hi> and direction? shall I forsake God,
and Christ, and the Holy Spirit, all the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
who daily speak unto me in and by this word, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with you? The very <hi>horror</hi> of the Proposal is enough
to secure the minds of any who have the least spark of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Light or Grace, from a compliance with it? Wherefore
whether it be reasonable to leave the Word of God, which
is full of Light, shining like the Sun in the Firmament, to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54104:18"/>
follow the glimmerings of this wandring <hi>Meteor,</hi> which arose
out of an horrible pit, and there will end, is left unto their
consideration who take care of the eternal salvation of their
own souls.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Sol<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mn Worship of God</hi> by the Guides of the <hi>Church
in a Tongue and Language which the people do not understand,
is another of their Proposals.</hi> This they are bound to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unto on pain of damnation. But how any thing can
be more contrary unto the common sense of them who
know what it is to <hi>pray in a due manner,</hi> no man can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
As unto them who do not, yet is it not hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them, where they are not obstinate on other preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,
how irrational this Proposal is, how inconsistent
with that <hi>reasonable service</hi> that God requireth of us.
Others will say, that they find hinderances and difficulties
enough from, and in this Duty, from the weakness of their
Faith, and instability of their Minds, the suggestions of
Satan, with diversions from outward objects; if you
add thereunto that they <hi>shall not understand a word</hi> of what
is spoken in Prayer, and they know well enough they
shall never pray at all. And the Truth is, did we not know
whence they took occasion for this strange contrivance so
contrary to the nature of all Religion; and what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
they make of it unto themselves, it could never be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
admired, how such a sensless Imagination should
befall their Minds. I do not design to shew how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
it is to Scripture Precepts and Examples, to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of all the Saints under the Old Testament, and the
New, with that of the Primitive Churches, and on all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
what an abominable Sacriledge it is, so to rob the
Church of its chiefest Treasure; it hath been done by
others sufficiently. I only give it as an instance how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet
this <hi>pretended Church</hi> is to be such a Guide, as
whereunto we are to make an absolute Resignation of our
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54104:18"/>
understandings and consciences in all concerns of Religion.
And there is nothing that can make them, who have any
regard unto their own souls, to reject its Guidance with
more detestation. Shall they accept them for their Guide
in Religion, who under pain of damnation confine them in
all the publick Worship of the Church, unto the use of a
Language that they do not understand? That instead of
praying with their understandings, they must be content
with a dumb shew, with postures and gestures, with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
and Pictures, the antick actings of a Priest, and a noise
of words, whose sense they know not at al? If a man
would seek for an Infallible Guide to Hell, it is hard to
find one more likely and better qualified unto that purpose
than is this <hi>Church of Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. There is at the same instant proposed unto us by this
<hi>Guide,</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Transu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stantiation,</hi> with the Sacrifice
of the Mass thereon depending. This they say we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
at least avow that we do believe on pain of eternal and
temporal destruction also. But herein they require of us,
that on the meer credit of their conduct, we must renounce
the use of our senses, the exercise of our <hi>Reason,</hi> and
actings of Faith on Divine Revelations, all things whereby
we are either <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Christians,</hi> that we may become blind
Idolaters. But they who pretending to be our Guides in
Religion, do thereon impose this monstrous Imagination
on our credulity, with the Idolatrous Practice wherein it
issues, had need give us better security of their Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,
than the Angels in Heaven can do. For if an
<hi>Angel from Heaven</hi> should preach this Doctrine unto us,
we may safely esteem him accursed, <hi>Gal. 1.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>4. The last thing I shall instance in of this kind is, the
<hi>Adoration or Worship of Images.</hi> God saies concerning it
expresly, <hi>Thou shalt not make unto thy self any graven Images,
thou shalt not bow dow to them, nor worship them.</hi> They say
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54104:19"/>
contrary; <hi>Thou shalt make unto thy self graven Images,
thou shalt bow down to them and adore them.</hi> And in their
use they make them the <hi>stage plaies</hi> in Religion, wherewith
the minds of ignorant unstable Persons are allured and sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into all manner of superstitious practices, and turned
off from the simplicity of the Gospel. For being once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
on the credit of their Guide, that the making, use,
and Adoration of them are lawfull, there is enough in the
carnal minds of men, to make them dote, and even be
mad upon them. Wherefore no less service is done unto
the interest of sin, and the Kindom of Satan hereby, than if
they should have taken off all sense of the Authority of
God from the consciences of men, in the Prohibition of
those things which their sensual lusts are most prone unto.
Could they have dissolved the obligation of the commands
of God, against Adultery, or Stealing, and left men unto
the guidance of their own lusts and inclinations, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
what abominable excesses the generality of men would
run into. Neither do the lusts of the mind engage persons
with less fierceness into the pursuit of their objects, than
do those of the flesh. And thence the disannulling of this
command of God, hath been an inlet unto all abominable
Idolatry. But herein they will not allow those who give
up themselves unto their conduct, once to consider the
direct <hi>contradiction</hi> that is between Gods commands and
theirs; but believe they must what their Church believes,
and practise accordingly; which is the most intollerable
Tyranny over the souls of men, that ever was attempted.
Only they will tell us of <hi>Latria.</hi> and <hi>Dulia,</hi> and <hi>Hyperdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
of <hi>Religious Worship that is direct or reductive, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient
or terminated on this or that object,</hi> and after a maze
of the like insignificant Terms, the conclusion is positive,
<hi>You shall worship graven Images.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:54104:19"/>
There are also sundry other things wherein they do or
would impose on the credulity of men, in open contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
unto their <hi>Sense, Reason,</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> as well
as unto all evidence of Truth from the Light and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the Scripture; which are somewhat of another
Nature than those foregoing. I shall only mention some
of them. As (1.) They would have us believe, that <hi>we
cannot believe the Scripture to be the Word of God, but
upon the Testimony and Authority of their Church</hi> All the
evidence that a man is capable of in his own mind, that
he doth so believe it; all that can be given in ordering
our lives according unto it, as the Word of God; the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Peace which multitudes of all sorts have in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
all their interest in things eternal into the Faith of it;
the sufferings and martyrdomes which many have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
in the confirmation of it; the uncontroulable pleas that
are made of the sufficiency of the <hi>Motives</hi> whereon we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it so to be, are nothing with them; but we must say,
we cannot believe the Scripture to be the Word of God, but
only on the Testimony and Authority of their Church; and
therein both give our selves the lye, as unto what we know
and are assured of, and judge millions to Hell, who have lived
and died in the Faith of it, without any respect unto that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
or Authority. (2.) They will <hi>have us to believe, what
they do not indeed believe themselves:</hi> As for instance, <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by our own works.</hi> For practically many of them do
for this end trust unto Absolutions, Masses, the Sacraments,
and Sacramentals of the Church, with a reserve for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of it in Purgatory; which are not our own works;
and some of the wisest of them do betake themselves at last
to the <hi>only Mercy and Grace of God.</hi> So would they have us
to ven<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure our souls on that, whereon they will not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
their own. (3.) <hi>Papal Personal Infallibility</hi> was once a
principal Article of their Creed, and the generality of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54104:20"/>
do receive it from them, with no less firm assent, than
they do unto that of Christ himself. But among themselves
they have so multiplied their wrangling Disputes about it, as
makes it evident, that they believe it only so far as holds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
with their Interest, and is subservient thereunto, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
not at all. Their Disputes of a Difference between the
<hi>Court of Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> of the Pope in his Chair
and out of it, in the use of help and advice of others, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this, in a General Council and without it, in a particular
Council and without it; in matter of Right and of Fact; and the
like; make it evident that they know not in what sense to
believe it, and so indeed believe it not at all. And whereas
they do themselves confess that some of their <hi>Popes</hi> have been
of the worst of men, yea monsters for luxury, uncleanness
and violence, that which they require of us, is not only hard
and unreasonable, but impossible for any sober man to grant;
namely, that we believe such Persons to have been infallible
in the Declaration of all Divine Heavenly Mysteries; so as
that we ought to acquiesce in their Declaration of them.
(4.) They would have us believe that the same Body of
Christ which was once <hi>in the fulness</hi> of time, <hi>made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
by the Power of God, is every day <hi>made of a wafer,</hi>
by the Power of a Priest. And what indignities are hereby
cast on his Person, hath been sufficiently demonstrated.</p>
            <p>These are some of the <hi>Proposals</hi> which this pretended
Guide makes unto all them who give up themselves unto its
conduct, to be believed with a suitable practice on the pain of
eternal damnation. But yet evident it is, that they are all of
them contrary unto the common Sense, Reason and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of all Christians, all that believe the Gospel, as well as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contradictory unto the Scripture and Example of the
Primitive Church. It is therefore left unto the Judgment of all
sober Persons, such as are not yet made drunk with the Cup
of their Abominations to determine whether any thing, but
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54104:20"/>
either profound Ignorance and spiritual Darkness, or love of
Sin, with a desire to live securely therein, or secular Interests,
or an hardening Judgment for the abuse of the Truth, or a
concurrence of all them, can prevail with men to make an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
absolute Resignation of their souls, and all their eternal
concernments unto the conduct of this <hi>pretended Guide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Way</hi> for the attaining the Knowledge of the
Truth proposed by this Guide, is opposite unto the Way and
Means prescribed by God himself unto that end. It is so whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we respect the <hi>internal Qualifications</hi> of our minds, or the
<hi>Duties</hi> that he prescribeth, or the <hi>Aid</hi> that he promiseth
thereunto. For as unto the first, he requireth that those
who would learn the Truth, ought to be <hi>meek,</hi> and <hi>lowly,</hi> and
humble, for such alone he will teach, <hi>Psal. 25. 8, 9, 14. Joh. 6.</hi> 45.
and if we are not taught of God, we learn nothing as we
ought, or not unto any purpose; that they cast out all <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
and superfluity of naughtiness,</hi> that so they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the ingrafted Word with meekness, <hi>Jam. 1.</hi> 21. Without
these things, they may be alwaies learning, but shall never
come unto the Knowledge of the Truth. And as unto Means
and Duties, two things he enjoyns and indispensibly requires
of us in order unto this end. (1.) That we <hi>study the Word</hi>
continually; that we meditate upon it, and place our delight
in it, <hi>Joh. 1. 8. Deut. 6. 7. Psal. 1. 2. Isa. 8. 20. Joh. 5. 30. 2 Tim.
3. 15, 16, 17. Psal. 119. 18. Joh. 16. 13. 1 Joh. 2.</hi> 20. (2.) Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
and diligent Prayer, that we may be lead into, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in the Truth, that we may be enabled to receive it,
and hold it fast against Temptations and Oppositions. For our
Aid and Assistance herein, he commands us to wait for it,
and expect the <hi>Spirit of Wisd<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m and Revelation,</hi> to open our
eyes, to bring us unto the full Assurance of Understanding,
or to lead us into all Truth. Of these things, of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of them unto the due Knowledge of the Truth, we hear
nothing from this <hi>pretended Guide.</hi> She knows well enough
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54104:21"/>
that to put the Minds of men into these Waies, and the use
of these Means, whereby they may be taught of God, and
<hi>learn the Truth as it is in Jesus,</hi> is to loose them from her
self for ever. Howbeit they are the only Waies and Means
prescribed and blessed of God unto this end, with those other
especial Duties which belong unto them.</p>
            <p>They will say, it may be, that they do instruct their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
in these things, and press them withal unto higher Acts
of Devotion and Mortification than others do. But there are
two things which deprive them of any advantage by this
pretence. For (1.) We see and know of what sort for the
most part their Converts are. I shall not give that character
of them in words, which generally they give of themselves
in their works; for I have nothing to do with the Persons
of men. And I should rejoyce to see them give a better evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of being instructed in these things, than as yet they
have done. But (2.) Whatever of this nature they propose
and prescribe unto them, it is not unto this end, that they
may learn and know the Truth. They require no more of
any hereunto, but that on their sophistical and frivolous
pretences, he give up himself unto their Guidance, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himself unto the Authority of the <hi>Pope.</hi> For hereby he
formally becomes a member of the Catholick Church, whose
Faith, whether he know it or no, immediately becomes his;
and for particulars he must wait for the Priests information,
as occasion shall require.</p>
            <p>This is I confess their great advantage in this World. The
way they propose to attain the Knowledge of the Truth, is
easy, consistent with the lusts of men, exposed equally to the
wise and foolish, to the sober and intemperate, puts men out
of all doubts, giving them all the quiet assurance which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
and falsehood can communicate.</p>
            <p>The way of God unto the same end is difficult unto flesh
and blood, destructive unto the lusts of the flesh &amp; of the mind,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54104:21"/>
requiring Diligence, Humility and Watchfulness in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Grace all our Daies, which things few are pleased
withal. Yet is this Way of God so suited unto the Nature of
Religion, so becoming the importance of this Duty, so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
not only unto the attainment of the Knowledge of Truth,
but unto all the ends of it in the Life of God; is so necessary on
the account of the Infinite Greatness and Holiness of God,
with the Nature of Divine Revelations, as that no man, who
is not blinded with prejudices and corrupt Affections, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
it, to embrace the other.</p>
            <p>There are other things yet, if it be possible, of an higher A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination,
to deter all sober Persons from touching with
this Guide, than those already insisted on. And such they are,
as the present contrivances and practices of our adversaries,
do unavoidably compel us to plead in this cause, and are in
themselves sufficient for ever to divest that Church of this
<hi>great and gainful pretence,</hi> of being the only Guide of all men in
Religion. For,</p>
            <p>Fifthly; Consider what it is, wherein they instruct many
of them who betake themselves unto their Conduct and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
I mean of the Agents for and in the name of the <hi>Church
of Rome.</hi> The first thing which they labour to fix on their
mindes and consciences, is absolute Obedience unto their <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Guides,</hi> with a blind belief of what they propose unto
them. And this they prevail on them unto, by assuming a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Authority unto themselves. And the first is that of <hi>forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them all their sins,</hi> though against the light of Nature, and
of their own consciences, which they confess unto them; and
this confession they are obliged unto under pain of Damnation.
Some things indeed they do require of them, in order unto a
participation of Priestly absolution. But they are all in the
Power of the Priest to prescribe, decline, or accept; which
latter they will not be uneasy unto, when it conduceth unto
their advantage. The issue is, that in this pardon of their sins,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54104:22"/>
the souls of men may as safely acquiesce, as if they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
pardoned by Christ himself. And if they have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for the advantage of the <hi>Catholick Cause,</hi> to put them on
things that are openly sinful, as Murder and Sedition, either by
vertue of the Direction, Guidance and Commands of the
Priests, they loose their Nature and become no sins at all, or
they are so <hi>assured of pardon,</hi> as puts them in their consciences,
into as good a state and condition as if they had not sinned.
And (2.) They assume unto themselves an Authority to grant
especial Priviledges and Rewards in Heaven and Earth, to the
doing of what t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ey command or require, whatever it be. As
unto the Earth, so many Prayers, so many Masses shall be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
unto their advantage; and in some cases <hi>Canoninozation</hi>
with all the glorious Priviledges of it. And as unto Heaven
what they so do, shall have such a proportion of merit, as shall
exalt them unto the second, third, or fourth place of preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and honour therein, among all the Holy Martyrs. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
what Power and Dominion over the consciences of
their Proselytes, they obtain by these means, with other artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the like Nanture. Hence many of them know of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dependance on any as unto present Peace, and eternal Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness,
than that on the Priests alone.</p>
            <p>Woful Practices do follow on these Principles. For the
minds of men being thus prepared, they dispose of them unto
such occasions or services for the Interest of the <hi>Catholick
Cause,</hi> as their own Nature, Inclinations, the fierceness or
softness of their tempers, their outward Greatness, Power and
Wealth, or their Straights, Wants and Necessities, render them
meet unto For now they are ready for such things, which if
they had not relinquished the care and charge of their own
souls, if they had not absolute<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y resigned them unto others;
they would never have entertained a thought of, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
and abhorrency. Poor deluded creatures, who could
sufficiently bewail their condition, but that for the most part
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54104:22"/>
through the Love of sin and the wages of it, they chuse these
delusions. Some now shall fire Cities; some shall murther
innocent Persons; some shall assassinate Kings and Potentates;
some shall creep into houses and lead captive silly women, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with sins, lead about with divers lusts; and some shall
prostitute themselves unto the carnal Lusts and Pleasures of
others; all as they judge conducing unto the <hi>Catholick Cause</hi>
and their own Intrest therein. These are they who must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
not only for the blood of them that are murdered, but
of their murderers also. I heartily wish these things were not
so; that they never had been so; but being so, it is well that
they are known so to be; and that they are written in such
legible characters in most Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> especially in this
wherein we live, as that he who runs may read them. I shall
not descend unto particular Instances; every ones mind and
thoughts will suggest them unto them; or they may learn
them in <hi>Westminster Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be said, that on a supposition that these things are
so, yet this is the crime of but a <hi>few,</hi> it may be of a few <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites;</hi>
which others, especially the Church, is not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in. They are but a <hi>few</hi> who teach and instruct their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
unto such purposes; but a <hi>few</hi> that are possessed with
those Maxims and Principles which lead unto these Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Notwithstanding their miscarriages, the Church it self
may be a Safe Guide unto the souls of men.</p>
            <p>I answer two things; (1.) That those who have these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
who teach these Practices, are all of them appointed
unto their Office and Work, imposed on the consciences of
men as their only Guides, by the <hi>Authority of the Church</hi> it
self. No Caution is given by it against them; no Rule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
whereby they may know them; but they come all
armed with the Authority of the Church, and as such are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by their credulous followers. The whole therefore of
what they do, may justly be ascribed unto the Church it self.
(2.) It may be made to appear, that for about an hundred and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54104:23"/>
fifty years past, no Plot, no Design hath been conceived or
perpetrated, wherein Kings, Princes, private Persons were
to be murdered or destroyed, wherein Nations were to be
embroyled in blood and confusion, in order unto the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Catholick Cause,</hi> but the <hi>Church it self</hi> was either
the Contriver or Approver of it. Who approved of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the two Kings in <hi>France,</hi> one after another? of the
<hi>Massacre</hi> there of an hundred thousand Protestants? who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
and blessed all preparations for the murder of <hi>Queen
Elizabth;</hi> with the unjust Invasion of the Nation in 88? who
blessed and protected what in them lay the <hi>horrible Massacre
of Ireland;</hi> with the slaughters that have been made in other
places on the same Principles? was it a few <hi>Jesuites</hi> only?
was it not the Church it self in its Head the <hi>Pope,</hi> and its
Horns the <hi>Cardinals</hi> at <hi>Rome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore although it seem good unto <hi>this Church</hi> to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
unto it self the sole Conduct of the souls of all men in
the matters of Religion, which hath thrived in its hands unto
an <hi>incredible Grandeur,</hi> in Dominion, Power and Wealth;
yet other men of an ordinary wisdom and capacity, who are
not yet taken alive by them at their pleasure, will be ready
to judge (especially now the Cave of <hi>Cacus</hi> is opened) that it
is necessary for them to take more care of their own souls.</p>
            <p>Some will say, that all these things, Principles and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
are <hi>separable</hi> from their Religion, and that they will
take sufficient heed unto themselves, that they give admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
unto none of them, especially such as are against the
Light of Nature, and the known Rules of common Honesty.
Both the <hi>Goodness</hi> of their own natural temper, and the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Morality,</hi> which they will never part withal, will
give them and others security herein.</p>
            <p>God forbid I should ever charge any Persons with any
thing that is <hi>Criminal,</hi> whereof they are not, or may not be
easily convicted. Those who make these Professions shall pass
with me at the rate and upon the credit of their Professions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:54104:23"/>
As shall all men in this World, untill they contradict and
disprove themselves by their Actions. But even such Persons
had need be very careful that they are not deceived herein.
The Resignation which they are to make of themselves and
their Consciences unto the conduct of this Church, doth
quite change both their <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Rule;</hi> for it includes a
Renunciation of all Principles and Perswasions in things Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Moral, that do or may in the least interfere with
that Conduct. It is true, that neither that Church nor any
else, can change the Nature of things Moral in themselves; for
although they may call Good, Evil, and Evil, Good; Light,
Darkness, and Darkness, Light; yet they cannot make that
which is Good, Evil; nor that which is Evil, Good; but
they may make a <hi>false Representation</hi> of the one and other
unto the minds of men. Hence what was Evil unto them
antecedently unto this Resignation of themselves, as the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Cities, the Murther of Innocent Persons, the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of Governments and Nations for their own Ends,
shall be imposed on them by this pretended <hi>Infallible Guide,</hi>
as things Good and Meritorious with reference unto their
<hi>Catholick</hi> Ends. These are the two most pernicious Divices
in all their Superstition. 1. That the Consciences of men
are exempted and taken off from an <hi>Immediate Dependance</hi>
on and <hi>Subjection</hi> unto the Authority of Christ, and put in
immediate Subjection unto the <hi>Priests;</hi> seeing he neither
promiseth any thing unto them, nor commands any thing
but by the Church. 2. That their Commands, because they
are theirs, do regulate their Consciences even as unto Moral
Good or Evil. Nor is it safe for these men to trust too much
unto the <hi>Goodness of their own Natures,</hi> nor it may be unto
others, who are concerned in what they shall do. For as it
is the Glory of the Doctrine and Grace of the Gospel, to
change the <hi>Wolf, the Lion, and the Leopard, Isa. 11. 6, 7, 8,</hi> 9.
Persons of the Fiercest and most Violent Inclinations, unto
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54104:24"/>
quiet Associates of <hi>Lambs and Children;</hi> so it is to be feared
from many instances, that by Vertue of their Conduct, they
can change appearing <hi>Sheep</hi> at least, as unto their natural
Tempers, into that which is Violent, Bloody, and Poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</p>
            <p>6. Under pretence of being this Guide, and to impose
their Pretensions thereunto on the Minds and Consciences of
men, this Church <hi>hath filled most Nations of Europe with
Blood and Slaughter;</hi> making horrible Devastations of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Persons, both fearing God and living Peaceably
in the World. Ten times more Blood of Christians hath
been shed by them unto this End, than was shed in all the
Primitive Pagan Persecutions. All that Dissent from them
may say,
<q>Quae Regio in terris nostri non plena cruoris?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Is there any Nation in <hi>Europe</hi> that is not filled with our
Bloud? The Last Day alone can discover the Blood that
hath been shed secretly or with little noise by the <hi>Inquisition,</hi>
in the <hi>Spanish,</hi> and some of the <hi>Italian</hi> Territories. <hi>England,
France, Germany, Flanders, Holland, Ireland,</hi> can speak
for themselves, in the Cruelties which unto this End have
been executed in them. The sole Reason of all this Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Violence, hath been, that men would not submit their
Souls and Consciences unto that Absolute Power over them
and Conduct of them, which their Church claimeth unto it
self.</p>
            <p>And it is most Probable that their <hi>Absolute Conduct</hi> is of
the same Nature with the Ways and Means whereby they do
Attempt it, or have Obtained it. When men by Force and
Fraud, Blood and Slaughters, do endeavour to impose their
<hi>Rule</hi> upon us, we are not to expect but that the <hi>Rule</hi> will
be answerable unto the Means that are used for the Attaining
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54104:24"/>
it. As in the first Planting and Propagation of Christian
Religion, the Way and Means of them were <hi>Spiritual Light,</hi>
and the evident Exercise of all Graces, especially Meekness,
Humility, Patience in Sufferings and Contempt of the World.
Hereon men had just Grounds to Believe and Expect, that
the <hi>Conduct</hi> which they were Invited and Called unto, under
the rule of Christ, would be of the same Nature, Meek,
Holy, Just and Good; whereof by Experience they found
full Assurance. So where the Rule of our Souls and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
is attempted and carried on by Violence, Blood,
Cruelty, and Desolation of Nations, we have just Ground
to believe, that if those who use them do prevail therein,
their Leading and Rule will be of the same Nature.</p>
            <p>It is but Reasonable therefore for any man before he make
choice of this Guide, to ask of himself or others, these few
Questions. Is there any thing in the Gospel which gives
countenance unto this way of imposing a Guide in <hi>Religion</hi>
on the Minds and Consciences of men? Was there any thing
like it in the <hi>Practices</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, his Apostles,
or the Primitive Churches? Doth this way make a just
<hi>Representation</hi> of the Spirit, the Meekness, the Holiness, the
Love, the Patience of our Lord Jesus Christ? Is it consistent
with the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Doctrine of the Gospel, the Religion
taught therein, as unto its Nature and Ends, concerning our
Deportment in this World, and our Tendency unto another?
Can any man think without <hi>Horror,</hi> that our Lord Jesus
Christ should be the Authour of this way; that he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
that all men should be Starved, or Hanged, or Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or otherwise Slaughtered, who would not Submit unto
this Doctrine or Rule of this or any Church, as some of the
worst of men shall please to state them? Is not this that which
among other things gives us Assurance, that the Doctrine
and Superstition of <hi>Mahomet</hi> were from Hell, from the <hi>Old
Murderer;</hi> in that it is a prime Dictate of them, that those
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54104:25"/>
who will not Submit unto them are to be destroyed with
Fire and Sword? By that time a man hath a little weighed
these Enquiries, with such other of the same Nature that
may be added unto them: if he be not forsaken of all sense
of the Glory of Christ, of the Honour of the Gospel, of
the Reputation of Christian Religion, and all care of the
Salvation of his own Soul, he will make a long stand before
he give up himself Absolutely unto the Conduct of this
Church.</p>
            <p>7. I cannot but mention in the next place, that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is commonly pleaded, I shall but mention. And this
is, that many <hi>important Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which this pretended Guide would impose upon us, are
evidently suited unto the Carnal Interests and Lusts of them
who have the Conduct of it. Such are <hi>Purgatory, Papal
Pardons, Sacrifices for the Dead, Auricular Confession,</hi> with
<hi>Priestly Absolution</hi> thereon; Many have already declared
how the Notion and Superstition of these things, did both
raise and do maintain their Revenues; and are otherwise
made use of to make Provision for the Flesh to fulfill it in
the Lusts thereof. And there lyeth no Encouragement here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to ingage Wise men to give up themselves unto its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
But,</p>
            <p>8. Considerate men will be afraid of that conduct under
which Christian Religion hath <hi>lost all its native Beauty, Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
spiritual Glory</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> How are these things repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
unto us in the Gospel? How were they exemplified
unto us in the lives of the Apostles and of all the sincere pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
converts; The Church was through them, <hi>a new
Heaven and a new Earth, wherein dwelt Righteousness.</hi> The
whole of Religion as it was at first professed, was nothing
but a Representation of the Wisdom, Truth, Holiness, Love
and Compassion of Christ; an evident and glorious means
to recover mankind from its Apostacy from God, and to re-introduce
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54104:25"/>
his Image on the Soules of men; a blessed way
continually to exercise the Power of Love, Goodness, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Bounty, Zeal, and Delight in God; a Testimony gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto the Truth, Reality and substance of things spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
invisible and eternal, with their preference above all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things. Under <hi>their conduct</hi> is this Beauty, this Glory of
Christian Religion lost and defaced. Wee may say with the
Prophet of old; <hi>how is the faithfull City become an Harlot,
Righteousness lodged in it but now Murderers. Isa. 1.</hi> 21. The
Church is the <hi>Temple of God;</hi> could we have looked into it
of old, wee might by faith have seen <hi>Christ sitting on his
Throne,</hi> the train of his Light, Holiness, Love and grace fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the whole Temple. Look into it under their conduct,
and there is the dreadful Appearance of the <hi>Lawless Person,
the man of sin,</hi> sitting in the Temple of God, shewing himself
to be God, to our Horror and Amazement. Look into the
Primitive Assemblyes of Christians, 2. <hi>Cor. 3. 8, 9,</hi> 10. you
shall see Meekness, Humility, and the glorious Ministration of
the Spirit in outward Simplicity. Look into those of this
Guide, and you shall see them like the <hi>House of Micah, Judg.
17.</hi> 5. an <hi>House of Gods,</hi> with <hi>Molten Images, graven Images,
Ephods and Teraphims,</hi> multiplyed Instruments of Superstition
and Idolatry. Look on their Conversation of old in the
World; and it was <hi>humble, peaceable, useful,</hi> profitable unto
Mankind, with a contempt of earthly things in comparison
of those that are eternal. But under the conduct of this
Guide; Ambition, Pride, Sensuality and profaness, have
covered the nations of its Communion; In all things have
they lost and defaced the native Beauty and Glory of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion. It will be of no advantage unto any, volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to come in into a participation in this woefull Apostacy.</p>
            <p>9. The <hi>Insupportable Yoke</hi> that this Guide puts <hi>on Kings</hi>
and <hi>Soveraign Princes,</hi> on pretence of its divine Right of an
universal Guidance of them and all their Subjects, deserves
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54104:26"/>
the Consideration of them that are concerned, before they
give up themselves unto it. It is true that by and since the
<hi>Reformation,</hi> as this Power of these men who call themselves
<hi>this Guide,</hi> hath been utterly cast of by many; So in those
places where on other accounts they maintain their Interest,
it hath been greatly weakened and impared. Hence those of
the greatest Power in the Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> have had little
regard unto their Authority unless it be used unto their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
and Advantage. But their Principles are still the same
as they were; their Pretence of Divine Right the same that
it was, and their desires after the exercise of it unto their
own ends, not at all abated. Could they once again enthrone
themselves in the consciences of Kings themselves and all their
Subjects; Could they destroy the Ballance of a contrary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trest;
could they take away the Reserves of Reliefs against
their encroachments, by engaging the Assistance of Subjects
against their Princes, of one Prince against another, as in
former dayes; there is no reason to think but that they
would return unto their <hi>former usurpations</hi> and insolency.
And wise men, yea Princes themselves, may be deceived, if
they take their measures of the <hi>nature of the Papacy,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto Civil Government, from its present deportment and
Attempts, though bad enough. Take away the perplexities
and Difficulties they are cast into, through the Rejection of
their Authority by so many nations, and by the divided In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trests
of Kings and Potentates thereon; <hi>heal their deadly
wound,</hi> and restore them unto a <hi>Catholick</hi> Power over the
consciences of all sorts of men, by the destruction of them by
whom it is opposed, and it will quickly appear with another
aspect on the world, another manner of influence on the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
and Governments of Kingdoms and Nations then
now it doth. But the consideration hereof belongs principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto them, who are not wont to be unconcerned in the
Preservation of their just Authority. Yet if occasion require
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54104:26"/>
it, a demonstration shall be given of the necessary and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
consequences of the Readmission of the <hi>Papal Power,</hi>
in any of the Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> who have cast it out; and
that with respect unto the Governours and Governments of
them.</p>
            <p>Among many other considerations, which offer themselves
unto the same Purpose, and which shall be produced, if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is given; I shall add one more and close this Discourse;
And this is, that the <hi>foundation of all the Religious worship,</hi>
which this Guide directs unto, whence all other parts of it do
proceed, and whereon they do depend, consists of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of one of the principle Articles of the Christian faith.
And this is, that <hi>our Lord Jesus hath by one offering, for ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
them that are sanctified;</hi> as it is expressed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle;
<hi>Heb. 10.</hi> 14. In direct opposition hereunto, the
Ground and Reason of their <hi>Mass</hi> and the Sacrifice therein,
which is the Life, Soul, Centor, and Foundation of all their
Religious worship, lyes in this, <hi>that there is a Necessity that
Christ be offered often,</hi> yea every day, in places innumerable,
without which, they say, the Church can neither be <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
or perfected.</hi> Such a Guide is this Church, as that it lays
the foundation of all its sacred worship in the overthrow
of the principal foundation of the Christian faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God in his appointed time, will put an end unto all these
extravagancies, excesses and distractions in his Church;</hi> when
Violence shall be no more heard in her Land, Wasting nor Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction
within her Borders, when she shall call her Walls Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and her Gates Praise.</p>
