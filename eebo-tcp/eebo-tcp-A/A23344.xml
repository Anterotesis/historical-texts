            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>But to turne againe to examples in Scripture, becauſe vpon the trueth thereof we builde our beleefe: <hi>Lucifer,</hi> through pride was thrown out of Heauen, <hi>Adam</hi> through pride, was thruſt out of Paradiſe, the tower of <hi>Babel</hi> was thereby ouerthrowne, <hi>Goliah</hi> the Phyliſtian was thereby ſlaine, <hi>Aman</hi> was hanged, <hi>Nichanor</hi> kylled: And to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Hiſtorie whereof I intreate, <hi>Antiochus</hi> for his pride was ſo plagued, that his bowelles by Gods iuſt iudgements rotted, yea, and from thence iſſued woormes in ſuch aboundaunce, that the ſmell of his carcaſe was to euerie man annoyaunce. <hi>Herode</hi> aduauncing himſelfe in his royall eſtate, would for his glorie be eſtéemed a God, but the power of the Lord ſuppreſſed his pride, that the ſtincking woormes conſumed his carcaſe.

            <p>This ſimple man, heard attentiuelie this ſugred tale, not conſidering, that in ſmotheſt ſtreames, is moſt daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous wading, in ſhalloweſt waters, moſt perillous ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and in greateſt places, moſt hurtfull ſléeping: the Bée carrieth honny in her mouth, and a ſting in her tayle, the Sirens ſing ſwéetly, but theyr ſong is the Saylers ſorrow. So this flattering Knight, though in his ſpéeche appeared an outward ſhowe of trueth, yet was it but the hooke to catch this ſéelie fiſhe with all, to the ende that his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might come to the poſſeſſion of his wealth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may liken the ſimplicitie of ſuch men (that caſt not the diſprofite of eche cauſe, as well as the commoditie) to the follie of the fiſhe <hi>Sargus,</hi> whereof <hi>Aelianus</hi> ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Aelia. in li. 11. cap. 19. de nat. ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</note> which ſo vehementlie loueth the Goate, that the fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man when he purpoſeth to take her, putteth on a Goates ſkin ouer his head with hornes, prepareth his nettes, the Sunne ſhining at his backe, and diſpearſeth in the Sea: Wheate ſodden in porrage, made with Goates fleſhe, the
<pb facs="tcp:13027:12"/>
ſauour thereof when the Fiſhe perceyueth, ſhe draweth nie, delighting in the ſight of the fained Goate, and ſo is taken in the nette to her owne annoyaunce: euen ſo, theſe men delighted in the ſhaddowe of outward trueth, are deceiued with ſubſtaunce of inward deceits.</p>
            <p>Thus this olde man, truſting to the glorious wordes of this wilie Fisher, was caught in the nette of vaine beléefe, that ſuch eaſe and contentation ſhould redounds to his deſyre, as ſhould cauſe the ſmall courſe of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lyfe, to be ſpent, in fulneſſe of all delyght, and therefore (though lothe to depart from that hee firmelie loued) yet perſwaded thereto, by the profeſſed fréendes of this glorious Gentleman, was induced to condiſcend to theyr deſires.</p>
            <p>The marriage daye therefore appointed, the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof were ſhortlie accompliſhed. The Sonne and the Daughter the firſt yéere, miniſtred to the neceſſitie of theyr aged Parentes, plentie of all thinges: the ſecond more ſparinglie: but the thirde moſt vnſhamefaſtlie: the fowrth yéere, through the ſuggeſtions of his Wife, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for his wofull Parents, a lyttle lodging, oppoſite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſtatelie building, where he might yéeld vnto them, a bare ſcantling of neceſſary ſuſtenaunce.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe odious children, as time increaſed, beganne to immitate the nature of the <hi>Pellicanes</hi> younglings, who after theyr mother hath brought them vppe to ſome byg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, beginne to ſtrike and pecke her in the face, for which ſhe being vexed, in her furie kylleth them, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward being ſorie therefore, ſhe pearceth her ſides with her boyſterous beake, tyll the warme blood iſſuing from her breaſt, renueth her younglinges to newneſſe of life: In which ſimilitude, is comprehended the entyre affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a mother to her children, and the ſmall requitall of children to theyr Parentes.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:13027:12"/>This aged and vnfortunate Father, with his croaked olde Wife, ſuffered in this ſtate no lyttle néede and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, yea, ſcarſelie durſt they ſet foote within the doores of theyr vngodlie Sonne: but commaunded thoſe things, yea, and requeſted the ſame, which they could not want, from the handes of a houſehold ſeruant. O myſerable ſeruitude, nay, O vntollerable ſlauerie, that he which had aucthoritie to commaund the ſonne, was now at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a ſeruaunt.</p>
            <p>In this caſe, theſe two croked Creatures, paſſed a great part of theyr toyleſome time, vntyll, it fortuned the aged Mother, out of her cottage windowe, eſpied one daye, in the houſe of her Sonne, meate ſpitted, and layde to the fyre, ready to be roaſted: the ſight whereof, procured vnto her ſome hope of better fare, then accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable vſe did yéelde vnto her. But ſéeing that delaye of eyther ſending for her, or to her, did driue her in doubt of the leaſt parte thereof, ſhée came vnto her aged huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande, the onelie copartner of all her gréefe, ſaying vnto him.</p>

            <p>The olde man hearing theſe wordes of his fréendlie Wife, leauing his aged lymmes vppon his ſtaffe, haſted to the houſe of his vnnaturall childe, hoping to finde that fare, that his hungerie heart did wiſhe.</p>
            <p>But this wretched and accurſſed childe, hauing intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his Fathers approche, cauſed the meate to be

            <p>Which when the ſéelie ſimple man perceyued, how fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate he was of his longed hope, diſſembling the matter, he preſentlie returned to his former abode, whoſe ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart, I referre to the milde conſideration, of euerie lenious and gentle Parent, that haue felt the diſcourteſie of ſuch baſtards and vnnaturall ſlips: which degenerate from the vertue of theyr auncient roote, from whence they tooke theyr off-ſppring.</p>
            <p>Sée héere the nature of a dunghill byrd, once matched in alyaunce with the noble Eagle: beholde the nature of this crabtrée ſlippe, being once grafted into the daintie Pearetrée ſtocke.

            <p>Good father (quoth the other) the good I haue got, and the lucky hap I haue had ſince my comming, I ſhall in time to come (I hope) make knowne vnto you, in the meane while, I am to yéeld you moſt harty thanks, that being a ſtranger altogether in theſe parts, you haue notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding deined to proffer me ſuch courteſie, as greater can I not find amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g my beſt acquaintaunce, and as for your fare, were it neuer ſo ſimple, if I ſhould miſlike the ſame, procéeding from a franke and willing heart, I might be counted an yl gueſt, that would eſtéeme more of the meat then the man or more of your fare then of your faithfull hart, I account the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling good, that is not daungerous, and the chéere great that is willingly beſtowed.</p>
            <p>Gentleman (ſayth the olde man) the good behauiour and
<pb facs="tcp:13027:23"/>
courtesse that I ſée apparaunt in your outward habite, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me to iudge therby, the maners of your inward mind, and therefore your none acquaintaunce, is quitted by your modeſt demeanor, for vertue maketh a ſtraunger vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wiſe man a familliar, neyther haue I euer ſéene that young man héeretofore, vnto whome mine eye, vppon ſo ſmall acquaintaunce, hath drawne my heart more néerer, and therefore I &amp; my poore cottage are to vſe at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, tarry your time, and depart at your leyſure.</p>
            <p>Thus taried this youth in the houſe of this olde man, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the outward pouertie of the Father, and the inward vertue of the Daughter, no leſſe muſing at the one, then meruailing at the other: but eſpeciallie, the Virgins godly gouernement, her modeſt manners, her words placed with wiſedome, her lookes without luſte, and her déedes ruled by diſcreſion, ſo that it ſéemed vnto him, that her life was a lampe to the lende, a lantorne to the looſe, and a light to the laciuious, gouerned by grace, ruled by reaſon, and bridled with the bytte of Gods holy word, wherein he ſawe her ſo continually occupied, that her whole delight ſéemde to be placed in the meditation thereof.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the old father marking the godly life of this young man, noting his courteous ieſture, his wiſdome, his humility, his ſobriety, his ſpéeches familiarly ſpoken, yet wiſely placed, his minde ſtored with myrth, yet vſed with modeſty, his contentiue minde, his patient ſufferaunce, his earneſt praiers for his Father, though he might haue grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at his vnkindneſſe. And knowing his Father, his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fréendes, yet more regarding his vertue, then his fortune, or any part of his hoped wealth, was wunne vnto ſuch an inward affection towardes him, as he ſtudied howe to bring that to paſſe, which the young man did moſt ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie deſyre.</p>
            <p>Noting alſo, the honeſt and mutuall fréendſhip, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and faithfull loue, that daylie increaſed in the minds of theſe two younglings, he thought that match could not be made a miſſe, where loue was the beginning, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb facs="tcp:13027:23"/>
was the ende, and therefore breaking one day the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto his daughter, was deſyrous to know the affections of her minde, at which he aimed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſpoſitions of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſhe whome ſimplicity had nouriſhed with the milke of truth, hauing her face ſtained with the vermillion of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, with bluſhing countenaunce reuealed that loue, which her outward ieſtures could not conceale, deſiring therin the conſent of her fathers mind, from whoſe body ſhe had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſubſtaunce of her being, ſhewing him that ſhe was more drawn to loue him by the view of vertue, then any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection dimmed with the vaile of vanitie, requeſting him, that as he had béene a Father of her body, in giuing to her thoſe thinges neceſſarie for her vſe, ſo he would be alſo a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor of her life, in not denying her him wheron her ioies did reſt: which the good olde man did as willingly graunt, as ſhe did heartely deſire, perſwading her that as ſhe had béen a comfortable ſtaffe to ſtaye vp the weight of his aged lymmes, ſo he would be a carefull father in prouiding her a mate agréeable to her minde, as ſoone as tyme would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the accompliſhment of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the old father eſpying an apt occaſion to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his promiſe, brake with the young man in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of this match, requeſting of him to know, how he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the rude demeanor of his daughter, and for as much as he had moued the queſtion of mariage vnto her, of which ſhe had certified him at large, was deſyrous to know what he ſawe in her, that ſhould drawe him to lyking of ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéemelie a choiſe, perſwading him, that if he ſhot at wealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſtéede thereof he ſhould finde want, for as much as his ſtate could yéeld no ſupplie to his neceſſitie, but if he aimed at vertue, he thought her able to bring him a ſufficent dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in that his ſtudy had béene, to make her therewith ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie endued.</p>
            <p>The young man replied vnto him, that he gaped neither after gold nor goods, for as much as he ſaw by ſufficient ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearaunce, that there was no ſuch gaine to be gaſed after, within the compaſſe of his cottage, but that he had found
<pb facs="tcp:13027:24"/>
already an ineſtimable treaſure, in an obſcure corner, the poſſeſſion wherof, if it pleaſed him he might quietlie enioy, he acknowledged himſelfe ritcher then <hi>Creſſus,</hi> and his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce more then all the golden ſandes of <hi>Pactolus,</hi> or the ſiluer ſtreames of <hi>Ganges,</hi> more happier in his conqueſt then <hi>Alexander,</hi> and farre more more fortunate then <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This good old man (eſpying the vertuous end of this yong mans deſyre, and ſeeing that vertue was the onely marke whereat he did Jeuell the ſhotte of his affections) could not any longer diſſemble his hidden ſtate, neither the good will that he bare to his vertuous minde, &amp; therefore taking him apart into a priuie corner of his cottage, he ſhewed him a huge ſumme of gold &amp; ſiluer, not gathered by his care (who was rather addicted to contemplation, then to heaping of treaſure,) but bequeathed by the death of her Vncle, a man of great ſubſtaunce, who noting the hope of her vertuous heart, that ſhined foorth in the image of her face, deliuered to her Father to kéepe for her vſe, a homelie coffer in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhowe, farced within full of gold and ſiluer, all which (for ſo much as he ſaw, he deſired not wealth, but wiſdome, nor the body of his daughter, but her minde) he gaue him, calling vnto him his onely child, and ioyning theyr handes with the frée conſent of theyr ioyful hearts, he bleſſed them, praying God, that as vertue was the beginning of theyr loue, ſo it might be the ende of the ſame, that they might liue together héere in all godlineſſe and felicitie, and ende theyr dayes in peace and tranquilitie, that ſuch iſſue might ſpring of their ſéede, as might be the common wealths com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, to theyr comfort and Gods glorie.</p>
            <p>Thus liued they together in all honeſtie, godlineſſe, and quietneſſe, breaking all brawles with humilitie, &amp; quieting euerie diſcorde by loue, the one not being proude through rule, the other not checking her huſband for wealth, looke what he lyked, ſhe loued, looke what he loathed, ſhe luſted not after, in pleaſure ſhe would be his partner, in ſorrowe his companion, her honeſt myrth was his mellody, and her
<pb facs="tcp:13027:24"/>
fréendly hart his harmony, in health his delight, and in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, his Phiſitian, and in bréefe, the piller of his life, and the onely patterne of a vertuous wife.</p>
            <p>O how many wiues haue we in our Citie, that follow not the example of this Damſell, but rather runne with maine ſtrength the contrary way, whoſe liues if they were noted, would rather deſerue a ſharpe inuectiue, then a plauſible prayſe, againſt whome I will not inueigh, leaſt I might be rather vniuſtlie accuſed of ſome of enuie, then thought to write of iudgement and experience. I will therfore ſtrike ſayle in ſuch a tempeſt, rather then ſtriuing with contrarie windes, runne againſt the rockes of womens venemous tongues, and ſo put in perill the ſhip of my ſafetie, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this only example ſufficient to encourage the good, and to gaule the wicked, the one burning with the praiſe of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the other bluſhing at the want thereof.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, let all Maidens learne by this Virgins ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, how to weare out theyr golden time of virginitie, not by ſpending the ſame in wantonneſſe, wildneſſe, l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and libertie, but in ſhamefaſtneſſe, diſcréetneſſe, chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſobrietie, which as <hi>Valerius</hi> ſayth, is, <hi>Custos caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, <hi>The preſeruer of chaſtitie.</hi>
               </hi> Moreouer, let them be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, not coueting by wordes rather to be ſéene, &amp; ſo to ſhew their eloquence, then by ſhamefaſtneſſe to declare theyr ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſilence, as a number doo in theſe daies, who make their tongues ſwéete inſtruments, to delight the eares of trifling talkers, &amp; count it a great gaine to floriſh in glorious ſpeech, ſo that if nature had made them for that vſe, I thinke ſome of them would prooue gallaunt Orators to pleade, and as ſutle Sophiſters to deceyue.</p>
            <p>Let them learne alſo to kéepe theyr féete from gadding, and to exerciſe themſelues at home in vertuous dooing, of which, the one will blotte theyr good name with infamie, but the other adorne theyr life with glorie.</p>
            <p>This Maidens modeſty may be theyr myrror, and her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment a glaſſe for theyr behauior, how to conſume their time in godlineſſe and praier, and to bridle theyr looſe affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:13027:25"/>
from vicious demeanor, whoſe example if they immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, they ſhall finde more faithfull louers of theyr vertue, then fooliſhe doters on theyr beautie, more ſuters for theyr honeſtie, then lykers of theyr braucrie: and aboue all, they ſhall be ſure that God will prouide them ſuch huſbands, as ſhall be truſty louers, and honeſt lyuers.</p>
            <p>But for ſo much as I promiſed in the <hi>Exordium</hi> of this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie, to ſet downe ſomewhat, whereby the vnſkilful youth may be warned, how to make a right choiſe in the choſing of a Wife, or hauing choſen, how theyr life may be ſpent in quietnes, I wil bréefly performe it, and ſo drawe to an end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> perſwadeth him that will marrie, to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider<note place="margin">Super. Math.</note> whether the Parentes be both good, or both euill, or whether the one be good, and the other euill: if they be both good, then may he ſafely make choiſe of her, if both euill, then to refuſe her: if the one be good, &amp; the other euill, then may he be doubtfull what to doo: yet if the Father be good, and the mother diſhoneſt, vnquiet, or without gouernment, he ought rather to feare, then contrariwiſe: and the reaſon is, becauſe Maidens haue béene more accuſtomed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaunt with theyr Mothers, then with theyr Fathers: and therfore more inclined to follow their manners, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon roſe the prouerbe, <hi>Qualis mater talis filia, <hi>Such a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, ſuch a daughter.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>But eſpecially let him beware that intendeth to marrie, that theſe things concurre and méete together, namely, that in theyr ſtates there be an equallitie, for where there is no equallitie of condition, there can be no quietneſſe of life, for as much as two contraries are neuer found in one ſubiect, nor one hart in two contrarie fortunes, for wealth in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man without wiſdome, &amp; pouertie in a man without great gouernement, doo neuer make vp a quiet marriage.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, let there be a lykeneſſe in theyr manners, and a vnitie in theyr mindes, leaſt if there affections be vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, they become ſeperable: for where there is no likeneſſe in manners, there can be no ſoundneſſe in fréendſhippe: where is no ſoundnes in fréendſhip, there is no faithfulnes
<pb facs="tcp:13027:25"/>
in loue: where is no faithfulnes in loue, there may be no quietnes of lyfe, and where the lyfe is vnquiet, there is the lyfe but a death, and the mariage a myſerie.</p>
            <p>But aboue all, ſéeing that <hi>Natura nihil ſolitarium amat,</hi> And that thoſe that haue not the gift of continencie muſt marrie, (albeit that in marriage are many diſcommodities, yet of euils the leaſt is to be choſen, <hi>For better it is to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, then to burne in fleſhlie deſires:</hi>) let euery wiſe man haue a ſpeciall regard therefore, that her Parentes be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, ſhe vertuous, and therewithall Religious, ſéeing that the lacke of Religion is the want of good lyfe, and the open gappe to all vngodlineſſe, and ſurely, this lacke of foreſight in choyſe, leadeth many a man to yll chaunce, making the whole lyfe vnſauerie, that elſe might be ſpent in ſwéete and pleaſaunt quietneſſe, and ended in myrth, ioye and happineſſe.</p>
            <p>In breefe therefore, good education is better in a Maiden then ritches, albeit I will not diſſwade any man from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, ſo it be not wholie reſpected: for I deny not, but that wealth &amp; wiſdome may be coupled, and vertue and ritches conioyned, that there may be as much vice in néedy pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as pride in gliſtering ritches, for <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> had a wife, who although ſhe were poore, yet was ſhe proude, po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical &amp; péeuiſh: yet is a poore Maiden vertuous, better then a ritch that is vicious, and pouertie with glorie, is better then ritches with infamy.</p>
            <p>But now to vſe <hi>Apostrophe,</hi> to thoſe that are married, as in the choyſe of a wife, there is to be vſed diſcretion, ſo muſt thou gouerne her by mildneſſe and wiſedome, auſteritie of wordes, muſt be mingled with gentleneſſe of ſpéech: feare muſt in her be turned into loue, and bitterneſſe in thée, into ſwéetneſſe of behauiour, ſeeing that ſhe was not made of the head nor the foote, but of the ryb and ſide of man, which ſheweth, that as ſhe may not be a myſtreſſe, ſo muſt ſhe be no maide, as no ſoueraigne, ſo no ſeruaunt, but an equall companion, and a freendly fellow, to participate with thee of euery fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13027:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>With this mildneſſe of gouernement, muſt be matched, ſecrecie of chaſtiſement, that euery fault be not openly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, nor euery offence publique detected, euery light fault muſt not be found, nor euerie infirmity ſharply noted, for as a diſcord in muſicke, being a harſhe and vnpleaſaunt ſtroke of mixed ſoundes, ſharpe and flat, is unpleaſaunt to the tuneable eare: So the publique diſagréeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of cooples, being an vnſauerie noyſe of iarring wordes, is gréeuous to the honeſt godly minde, therefore if any occaſion of offence fal out, (as it cannot chuſe but euen among the beſt, it may ſometimes happen, for, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicuique dedit vitium natura crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>To euerie one that liues, hath nature giuen a fault,</hi>
               </hi>) there ought to be great cyrcumſpection, that it be not onely reprooued, leaſt a ſmall offence vnwiſely handled, bréede a gaule in the minde, and a gréefe in the heart.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, accuſtome thy ſelfe to fréendlineſſe in ſpéeche, and louingnes in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, to honeſty of life, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe of manners, that going before in gouernement of life, ſhe may follow in obedience of behauior, let thy life be a lantorne to light her, and a guide to leade her, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of vertue, and a patterne of honeſt demeanor, that ſhe beholding thy vertue, may immitate thée in euery god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly action. Theſe notes duely obſerued, will profite thée in ſingleneſſe, and eaſe thée in wedlocke, make thy whole life delightfull, and thy death ioyfull, that departing from the ſhaddowe of this ſhort life, a good conſcience may accompany thée to the life eternall, and a good name remayne for thy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall memorie. Amen.</p>
