         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

OR THE
CASE
OF A
Limited Toleration,
Stated according to the present Exigence
of Affairs in
CHURCH and STATE.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>Nihil Violentum Durat.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>SInce our present Condition more, than ever, Requires our
being Strong, &amp; of a Peice within our Selves; for (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
Domestique misunderstandings) have we not power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Neighbours Hovering over us, and perhaps Watching
the Opportunities, which our Weakness and Divisions may give
them? And since our want of Union, &amp; Intestine Animositys chiefly
Result from our different Judgements in Religion, and from the
several Consequences thereof, I hope, I shall not mistake my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in offering my thoughts to those, who are the Proper Judges,
concerning that so much debated Question of Punishing or Toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
Non-Conformists.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95893:2"/>
On this Subject my Endeavour shall be to speak plainly, like
a good English man, without any Byas of prejudice, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to the Persons concern'd; and, whereas many Persons of
great Authority may perhaps be of a different Judgement from
mine, in the Point, I am to handle, I beg the favour of my
Reader to beleive, that nothing but the Interest of my Country
could have Engaged me in a Question of this Nature, in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to so considerable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Party, of whose Abilitles I have
a very true and just Veneration.</p>
            <p>In the first Place, it must be allow'd, that cold it be effected, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
were more to be desi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, in order to the lasting Happiness of
this Nation, than a Conformity of all Minds, under the same Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
and Worship in Religion; That so, as our Bodys, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Actions are govern'd by the same Temporal Laws, our Souls
and our Opinions (though in Matters relating to the World) might
also be united under one, and the same Ecclesiasticall Discipline, and
were <hi>England</hi> at present under that happy Condition of Spiritual V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
I should think it rational and seasonable by the Rigour of
Law<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, to preserve it in such a State of Tranquillity, by suppressing
all Upstart Innovators, &amp; frighting the People from the dangerous
affectation of Novelty.</p>
            <p>But since we enjoy this Universal Harmony only in our Wishes,
(diversity of Opinions in Matters of Religious Worship having held
so long a possession in the Minds of the People) &amp; since the Cockle
is so generally spred, and mingled with the Corn; that 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wholly to root up one without apparent Danger of destroying
the other, I think it behoves us to take our Measures according to the
present State, and Juncture, of our Affairs, and choose that expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
which is best for us, and withal is attainable by us in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance,
we now are in, not that, which (although best in its
self) is not possible for us to attain.</p>
            <p>And here (I conceive) lyes the Root of their Mistakes, who have
lately with so much Zeal opposed a Toleration: They tell us what
should be, not what may be done; and deliver many Truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Beauty and Expediency of a General Vniformity; but
their Discourse seems cut out, and made to fit an <hi>Vtopian</hi> Kingdom,
not <hi>England</hi> in its present Condition.</p>
            <p>For according to true Policy &amp; Reason we ought either wholly to
Root out all Dissenters, or else so to Tolerate them, that they may
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95893:2"/>
live at ease and contentedness amongst us; whereby they may become,
if not of the Church, at least sound Members of the Common Wealth.</p>
            <p>Let the Opposers of a Toleration shew us a safe and ready way to
rid the Nation of all Non-conformists, though I confess I am no
Friend to Force and Violence, especially in Matters of Conscience,
yet I should not obstruct any Cause, that would certainly produce,
so happy an effect: But, if this be impossible for them to do, and if
the Method by them prescrib'd, and made use of, serves only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperate,
not to carry of the peccant Humour, I must conclude, that
the good of the Nation is either not rightly understood, or not justly
pursued by them.</p>
            <p>For what can be more Pernicious to the Safety of any Kingdom
than to have within it self so great a Body, as all the Dissenters in
England make, continually exasperated by Penaltys and invaded by
a legall kind of Hostility; who, thus made Enemys by the Law,
must by a Natural Consequence be still watching Occasions of easing
and unburthening themselves? What is this but to Nourish and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in our Bowels the Seeds of a Civil War, that want nothing but
an Opportunity (which for Mischief too frequently presents it self)
to Break forth in a consuming Flame?</p>
            <p>Perhaps you will say, that a wholsome Violence may Cure their
Obstinacy, and Reduce them to Obedience, and in time make them
less Numerous, and so less Dangerous.</p>
            <p>I answear, That Compulsion may bring many Hypocrites, but no
real Converts into our Church: For Conscience is of so Spiritual a
Nature, that outward Force can have no Influence, nor Dominion
over it: We cannot Over-rule it in our selves, much less in others.
At home in our own Breasts interest cannot Bribe it, to Judge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of our own proper Actions, than according to that Light of
Nature, or Grace, which God has bestowed upon it: And, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be granted in the Case of Non-conformists that their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is Erroneous, yet, as such it can never be Rectified by Fear,
and Force, but only by Conviction of Judgment.</p>
            <p>Hence it may be inferred, that nothing does more Efficatiously
dispose and prepare the Minds of Men for Treason and Rebellion,
than by Force to make them Act against their Conscience in matters
of Religion: For they who have once overcome the Remorse of
their God (which is the Case of all such Compliers without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of Judgment) shall never stick at Breach of Faith with Prince
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95893:3"/>
or Magistrate, when ever the like Motives of Interest or Fear shall
prompt them to it: Whoever therefore shall design to Reduce so
great a Multitude of differing Judgments to an Uniformity of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
by the way of Rigour and Infliction of paenalties, can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
expect no better Success, than to fill the Church with Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
and the State with Subjects, train'd up, and principled for
Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Of this Truth we have an Illustrious Example recorded by <hi>Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
(Cap. 7. Hist. Trip.) Constatius</hi> Father to <hi>Constantine</hi> the
<hi>Great,</hi> having many Christian Souldiers under his Command (him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
being a <hi>Gentile</hi>) resolved to make Trial of their Temper, and
find out amongst them, who were fit or unfit for Trust, and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Accordingly calling them together, he declared that all such
as would Sacrifice to his Gods, should continue in his Service, but
that the Refusers should forthwith be Casheerd, and might thank his
Clemency, that he proceeded no farther against them. Hereupon
when some Obeyed the General, and some their Conscience; those
who prefer'd Religion to their Interest, he immediately took into
Favour, and Office; and the Temporizing Conformists he Excluded
from all Employment; presuming (says our Authour) that such
could never be Loyal to Man, who so lightly had forsaken their
God.</p>
            <p>From what has been said, We may draw this Conclusion, that
where Infliction of paenaltys prevails in order to an exterior Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
in such to their Errour of Judgment it adds Hypocrisie,
whereby they become worse Christians and Subjects, than before;
and where it does not so prevail, it lays the Foundation of a Civil
War, by daily Exasperating so great a part of the Nation, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
begins it, by continually Invading (though under Colour of
Law) the Liberties and Goods of our fellow Subjects.</p>
            <p>If it be Replyed, that although (being Prosecuted by the
Law) they may be irritated, and dispos'd for mischief, yet (being
Tolerated) they will encreas in Strength, and by Consequence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas
our Danger.</p>
            <p>I answear that how great a Paradox soever it may seem at first sight,
yet most true it is, that (taking the whole Body together of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters,
who are equally concerned in the Prosecution) they are far
more dangerous and powerfull to do Mischief, when Prosecuted than
when Tolerated: For when they are all in a suffering Condition they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95893:3"/>
are united together in one Common Cause and Concern of easing
themselves from the pressure they are under; and (being so different
in their other Principles) this is the only point they can eenter in,
and Knit together into a Body, and the only Band that binds them
up in a Bundle. But when they are Indulged, and left Free, (the
Cement of a joynt Interest being taken away) they will naturally,
and necessarily fall in sunder, and remain as divided in point of Faction
and party, as they are in tenets and principles.</p>
            <p>Of this we have a fresh and convincing Example in the late Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
for before the War, when all Sectaries and Nonconformists
lived under the Curb and penaltys of the Law, and high Commission
Court, they were all embodyed together as Fellow Sufferers in the
Common Cause, and appeared to the World but as one Sect, and
were generally known only by the Common Name of Puritans: And
to what Power and Strength they grew by this union, was too fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known by the Famous Mischiefs they did. But afterwards (having
shaken off their Fetters, and clapt them on their Masters) when
they were at ease and prosperity, then did each Sect apart begin to set
up its own Colours; and the Distinctions of the Presbyterians, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents,
and Quakers, grew visible to the World by their Divisions
and Quarrels amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>And I desire it may be observ'd that Monarchy and the Church
were pull'd down by them at that time, when by a preceding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
they had been united together; and that the Church and
Monarchy were then again restored when by Liberty and Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
those very Sects were fallen from one another and each had rankt
it self in its own Canton, and Division.</p>
            <p>But now it remains to be considered whither these Dissenters and
Nonconformists in Religion, are any ways capable of being made
Loyal and faithful to the Government.</p>
            <p>I think there is but one certain Rule to resolve this, and all Cases
of a like Nature: First allowing them to have common Sense, it will
evidently follow that if we can make it their Interest to be good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
they will not fail of being so, whoever shall assign any Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but this, for the Peoples Allegiance, do (in my Opinion) but
play with the Wind, and pay us with Words. I know, that <hi>No
Bishop no King</hi> has past for a Fundamental Maxime with some, and
that English Loyalty cannot consist but in the Church of England, as
it is now establisht: And I suppose they go chiefly upon this Ground,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95893:4"/>
that true Allegiance must proceed from a rectified Conscience, and a
rectified Conscience from true Religion.</p>
            <p>But I must begg their leave to dissent from them in this Particular.</p>
            <p>All Men I confess, should be obedient to their Lawful Governours
for Conscience sake, but all Men are not as they should be.</p>
            <p>Man-kind in general is constantly true to nothing, but their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
how much that over rules Conscience in all Religions, is but
too visible in the World. Yet I am far from denying, but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
may be found, who by the ty of Conscience only are sufficiently
withheld from the enormous Crime of Rebellion: But since no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Person can tell (all pretending to it) who these are, and since
every good Security must be apparent and visible; I think in <hi>Foro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>externo</hi>
we ought to exclude Conscience, or rather the pretense of it
(which is all we can know of it in another) from being a sufficient
warrantly of Allegiance.</p>
            <p>To retourn therfore from this Digression to my former Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
let Men be never so Differing in Matters of Religion, certain it
is they will all agree in this point of being Constant and true to their
own Interest: And therefore the great Art and <unclear>secret</unclear> of Government
is to make it the Peoples Interest to be True and Faithful to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis apparent that if all these Dissenters in Religion who at
present lye under the Lash of the Law, were so far indulged, that
they might live with Security of their Estates and Liberty of their
Persons amongst us, and peacably enjoy their Conscience in their
own way of Religious Worship, it would be clearly their Interest to
be obedient unto, and maintain that Government, under which
they are so Protected: For none are so Dull, but must understand,
that when they are in a quiet enjoyment of their livelihoods, if Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
and War should come upon them, they must needs (at least
the Major part of them) be greater Loosers, than Gainers; So that
the Publick Peace will now become their private Interest.</p>
            <p>And this is the only Basis and Foundation, on which all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can firmly be Establisht.</p>
            <p>They who imagine that Vnity of Religion is absolutely necessary
to Vnity of Interest, must needs fancy to themselves such an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Charm, in the Peoples meeting together on Sundays in the
Church, that they cannot fall out all the Week after: But we find by
sad Experience that Persons of the same Religion (Witness the Wars
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95893:4"/>
between <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>) Quarrel no less
fiercely, than others, who are most distant in their Principles of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:
And they are Strangers in the Affairs of the World, who have
not learnt, that Interest and not Religion, makes all the great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitys,
and amitys both Publick and Private.</p>
            <p>Our Neighbours of <hi>Holland,</hi> who are very Competent Judges in
Matters relating to Publick Advantage, and Self-preservation, by
their practice sufficiently shew the Conscistency, and expedience of
Tolerating different Religions under the same Government: <hi>France</hi>
affords us the like Presedent; And I fear, till we follow their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in <hi>England</hi> too, I fear we shall not arrive to that Plenty, and
Power, which both those States at present enjoy. For Nature hath
so placed this Island, that whenever we are Masters at Sea, we are
Umpires of this part of the World; so that we must always Rise
or Fall in Plenty, and Power, as we encrease or decay in Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,
and Navigation. Now upon a just Calculation twil appear,
that the Sea-fareing Men, and the Trading Part of the Nation, dos
in a great measure consist of Non-conformists; and that much of the
Wealth and Stock of the Kingdom, is lodged in their Hands, who
have no great Devotion for the present Liturgy, &amp; Hierachy of
the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore we need go no farther to find out the cause of that
general Damp upon Traffique and Commerce, than the Strictness
of our Laws upon that Sort of People; by which some of them
are Disabled, and others Discouraged from Employing their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
and their Stock for Carrying on the Trade of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But whilst upon these Motives, I plead for a Toleration of Non-Conformists;
thereby I intend no more, than a bare Exemption
from Penalties, with a Liberty of Exercising their Religion under
such competent Restrictions, as shall be judged Necessary, both
to Secure the Publique from a Riot, and Sedition, and to put a
Difference between their Conventions, and the Religious Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of the Church, Established by Law.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I think it necessary, that they should be Excluded
from Offices, and places of eminent Trust, both Civil, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical:
Because, should they be Admitted to an Equality of
Power, and Authority in the Kingdom, their Oppression, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
endeavour to Advance their own Ways in Religion, might
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95893:5"/>
Tempt them to push forwards, and Struggle for the Right-hand of
Fellowship; So as the Peace of the Nation might be Endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered.</p>
            <p>I should here have closed up this discourse, did I not find that many
Reverend Members of the Clergy, have been lately great Opposers
of a Toleration; which leads me to Consider, whither the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of it be prejudicial to the Safety and Interest of the
Church.</p>
            <p>If we call to mind by what means True Religion was first Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
&amp; Propagated in the World, we shall find that Force, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion,
had no hand in the Work: Both the Precepts, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of our Great Master, and his Disciples, are directly Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to it: For my part, I think, that Humane prudence, as well
as Christian piety, Obliges their Successors to follow the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of reclaiming Dissenters <hi>by Gentleness, and meek Exhortations,</hi>
according to the Direction of St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For since the chief Designe and most incumbent Duty of the
Church is to Convert Misbelievers, and to bring back into the
Fold those who have straied Away; there is nothing so Necessary
and Conducing to this Work, as to procure in the Minds of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
a good Opinion, and esteem of the Charity and Paternal
Care of those, who undertake to Instruct them in the Right
Way.</p>
            <p>This was the Method of our Saviour himself, who began his
great Business of Converting Mankind, by first Obliging the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with Temporal Blessings, that so he might Win them to Spiritual
Happiness; for this Reason he Miraculously Fed so many Thousands
in the Desert, and so often Cured their Bodily Infirmitys, in order
to the Healing, and Nourishing their Souls: But the Infliction of
Corporal punishment or pecuniary Mul<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts, is so far from producing
this effect of Love, and Esteem in their Minds, whom we are to
make our Proselytes, that it constantly begets an Aversion, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
in the Punished against the Authors and Promoters of
this punishment, so that Churchmen must either necessarily give
over the design of Converting Dissenters (which is a principal part
of their Function) or the practice of Abetting the Infliction of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
upon them.</p>
            <p>If Excommunication (which is a Seclusion from joyning with
the Congregation in Religious Worship) be the proper, and just
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95893:5"/>
Punishment of Error in Religion, according to all the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Rules, and Practice of Christianity, is it not strangely
preposterous, that these Dissenters instead of being shut out,
should be <hi>violently forc't into</hi> the Church, and (even during
their Non-Conformity of Judgment) be compelled to a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
in Divine Worship with the Faithful by all those sharp pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltys,
which the Law inflicts upon Recusancy? Instead of the
<hi>Gospel Rule,</hi> which Commands us to avoid their company; we set
up a Law of our own, which injoyns our meeting together even in
the House of God; whereby the partys compelled Act no less
against their Conscience, than the Compellers against the plain Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Scripture. Methinks in this Case the Example of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ought to be our Rule, Who in person Whipt out of the Temple
those, who came thither upon the Score of Interest, and nor of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but always used the most Benign and Gentle means imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to Win people into the Church.</p>
            <p>What can be more contrary to the Honour, and Dignity of
True Religion, than that it should appear to stand in need of
Force to draw Men to it? We shew a mistrust of it's Verity,
when we dare not leave Men the liberty of their Judgement and
Conscience in imbracing it. Is not this that very Thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
formerly we have so often reproacht our Adversaryes? and
have we not other lawful Advantages enough over all Dissenters,
and Sects without calling in the <hi>Brachium Saeculare</hi> to Confute
our Opponents, and using means much more, becoming a preaching
Collonel of <hi>Cromwels</hi> Army, than a Prelate of the Church of
<hi>England?</hi> Have we not Truth on our Side, the only Invincible
Champion of Religion? Are we not <hi>Establisht</hi> by the <hi>Law of the
Land,</hi> whereas others will at most be only <hi>Suffered?</hi> Are not all
Ecclesiastical Promotions in our Power, and Occupation? So that
having the strongest Motives on our side both Temporal and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
to bring Men fairly to us, why should we keep up a <hi>Spanish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition</hi>
of Force and Violence, and so discredit and Weaken our
Cause, whilst mistakingly we endeavour by undue means to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
it.</p>
            <p>Let the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> meet in their Halls, the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> in their
Barns, the <hi>Papists</hi> in their Garrets; shall the Church of <hi>England</hi>
Assembled in her Cathedralls, fear the Competition of Rivals every
way so inferiour to her in force of Arguments, and Reason, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95893:6"/>
Decency, and Gravity, and in the Credit of Publick Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
It would Argue not only want of Courage, but even Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Faith, and Reason too, should we be Jealous, that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
granted to those Sects, of having Publick Meetings would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish
the number of the Orthodox in our Religious Assemblys; for
as all contrarys are best set off, &amp; distinguisht, when together expos'd
to Publick View, we may Presume, that nothing would more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageously
fill our Churches, and Empty their Conventicles, than a
Liberty given them to appear in a full Light; that so all Eyes might
Judge of the Difference between Order, and Confusion, and between
the Decency of our rational Worship, Modeld according to the best
Patterns of sound Antiquity, and the Homeliness and clownish man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their Addresses to Heaven, form'd out of their own Fancy by
a Cynicall kind of Pride, which Scorns the Direction of their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Guides.</p>
            <p>Let us not therefore give them that only Advantage they have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us, which is of suffering for their Religion; for if we look into
Scripture, we shall find that Persecution in the Sufferers, is one of the
most conspicuous Marks of Truth, and in the Inflicters of Error;
as most evidently appears in the Example of that great Apostle Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> than whom before his Conversion, none more Zealous, and
fierce in the Prosecution of Christians, and after his Conversion,
none more Compassionate, and Charitable, towards his dissenting
Brethren the <hi>Iews.</hi>
