            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But the deepe affection I haue, wishing the good of all the Faithfull: And chiefely the praysing, &amp; magnifying of the mercy of Almighty God, hath ouercome all difficillities. I confes my too-too much insufficiencie to attempt to shew mine owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in matters of so great consequence, and of so high a nature. yet I hope the gratiousnes of
<pb facs="tcp:8882:7"/>
your mindes will answere the goodnes of my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and that you will rather blame the want of Art, then want of heart. A further motiue that sets forward mine attempts in this busines, was the due consideration of afflictions, and whence they came, I wayed that God may finde sufficient cause in all men (because all men are sinners) yet doth he worke in his punishments, by a geometricall &amp; not an Arithmetic<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll proportion: laying vppon the strong, the heauier burthen, and on the weake the lighter, and on no man more then he can well beare, I considered the end wherefore the Lord did the same. And I found that they were for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, not distructions, and that he doth often try vs by the crosse to make vs true to his crowne. And from this, by reflection, looking backe to my selfe, who haue had a wofull, large, and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of imprisonment, troubles, crosses, sicknes, and afflictions, and haue past euen the Alphabet of Calamities, to make good vse of them, and to lenifie my griefe, I composed thiese swanlike songs. And because <hi>Bonum quod Communius eo melius,</hi> &amp; euery good guift is of it selfe difusine I thought it the dutie of brotherly loue to make common to all that was comfortable to me, being assured that my rudenes, and rashnes in thiese my willing laboures, can not spot or staine the richnes of beautie and Gods most pretioas and blessed workes: on which I haue endeuoured to imploy my meane capacity in this mine exercise, where the foundation of building is good, the fault is in the Artificer, if the worke want vniformitie, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondencie.
<pb facs="tcp:8882:7"/>
For his erring in proportions can no way impeach, or derogate from the true sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and sound ground worke, of a sure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A little or smale spring from the first head cannot stop the curraunts of great floods, or the maine waues of the Ocean Sea. These Cantons are but drops taken out of the fountaines of <hi>Israell,</hi> though the booke be but as a wooden dish, it will serue the poore mans turne to drinke in, &amp; quench his thirst. The rest I leaue to the flowing streames of the graue Diuines, as fragant flowers out of a pleasant garden, being grosely gathered, and vnorderly placed, yet retaine their beautie, and sauour, and the fault in vnorderly placeing is to be found not in the flowers, but in the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer: lay the fault of any errour herein to the man, the manner and meeter, no to the matter, In loue is no labour, therefore my labour is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and yet wy labour exceedes my learning, &amp; my will my skill Paynting is fit for ragged wales, not for fine Marble. And often times smoth filed tongues are ioyned to defiled hearts: God knowes, towards him my soules sinceritie, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you mine hearts integritie. If thou art curious, be curteous, and doe not discourage: if learned though thou seest the fault be many, let thy louo be more: In all giue God glory, to whom be all glory for euer, and euer, Amen.</p>
