            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS above-named Mr. <hi>Lowes</hi> Parſon of <hi>Branſon</hi> in <hi>Suffolke,</hi> (being araigned there for witch-craft,) confeſſed that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched a Ship neere <hi>Harwidge,</hi> ſo that with the extreame tempeſteous Seas raiſed by bluſterous windes the ſaid Ship was caſt away, wherein were many paſſengers, who were by this meanes ſwallowed up by the mercileſſe waves, further he confeſſed that he had done many other moſt hanous, wicked, and accurſed acts, by the help of ſix Jmpes which he had that frequented him daily. This Mr. <hi>Lowes</hi> preached about threeſcore ſermons after he had made his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent with the Devill, and had a teat on the crowne of his head, and two under his tongue: and there is none that maketh a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Devill but hath from him a private marke.</p>
            <p>Alſo <hi>Thomas Evererd</hi> a Cooper, and <hi>Mary</hi> his wife, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imployed in a Brewhouſe at <hi>Halſworth</hi> in the County of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> freely confeſſed that they had bewitched Beere in that Brewhouſe: and that the odiouſneſſe of the infectious ſtinke of it was ſuch &amp; ſo intollerable that by the noyſomneſſe of the ſmel or taſt many people dyed. And they further ſaid that many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113196:3"/>
miſchiefes they had perpetrated and acted by their witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts and damnable Sorceries, and that they alſo had their Jmpes to whom they gave ſuck.</p>
            <p>One old woman confeſſed that ſhe had beene a Witch the ſpace of above fifty yeares, in which time ſhe alſo confeſt that ſhe had done many very wicked things in bewitching Cattell, Corne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. but above all that ſhe had bewitched ſeven perſons of one family to death to wit, a man together with his wife and five childrens and that alſo ſhe had her Jmpes which came to her in ſeverall ſhapes.</p>
            <p>Another of the women Witches conſeſſed that ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched a child to death, and that ſhe had beene a Witch above five and twenty yeares, in which time ſhe had bewitched great ſtore of Cattle ſo that the owners of them were much impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and hindred both by the death of them ſometimes; and ſometimes by the unſerviceableneſſe of them. And alſo ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that ſhe uſually bewitched ſtanding corne, whereby there came great loſſes to the owners thereof, for that they could reape no profit, nor the benefit of there long, hard, and by her made, fruitleſſe labours: beſides ſhe confeſſed that ſhe had committed many other ſuch like evill deeds to the hinderance of many.</p>
            <p>Theſe and all the reſt confeſſed that cruell malice and he bred envie was their chiefe delight, continually a long time before they made their Covenant with the Devill, who alſo did often and ſundry times and in ſeverall ſhapes appeare to them, before they entered into Covenant with him that they might be made Witches.</p>
            <p>Further alſo theſe with all the reſt being ſearched as they were taken, were found by the ſearchers to have Teats or Dugs which their Jmpes uſed to ſuck ſo often as they came to them. And that ſome of them had ſuch Teates or Dugs under their armes, ſome under their tongue, ſome in the roofe of their mouth, ſome on the crown of the head ſome amongſt their toes, ſome in their fundament, and divers other places: their Teats were but little, ſome of them are ſhaped like a thunderbolt. Theſe ſeverall teats or dugs their ſeverall Jmpes uſed to ſuck who came to them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sometimes in the ſhape of Mice, ſometimes in the ſhape of Kitens, ſometimes in the ſhape of Snayles, and other-while in,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113196:3"/>
the ſhape of Snakes, Hornets, Waſpes, and divers other ſhapes.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe are 120. more ſuſpected Witches in priſon, at St. <hi>Edmunds-bury,</hi> who had all their Tryall now: but that the Judge and Juſtices were compelled to adjourne the ſaid Seſſions till another time by reaſon of the neere aproaching of the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers. And of thoſe Witches ſome have confeſſed that they have had carnall copulation with the Devill, one of which ſaid that ſhe had (before her husband dyed) conceived twice by him, but as ſoone as ſhe was delivered of them they run away in moſt horrid long and ugly ſhapes.</p>
            <p>And theſe confeſſed that they have bewitched divers Men, Women, and Children to death, as alſo, Horſes, Oxen, Cowes, Sheep Swine, and other ſort of Cattell, as likewiſe Corne, Herbes, and plants &amp;c. and have raiſed great and very tempeſtious windes and ſtormes, to the overthrowing and ſubuerting of Houſes, Stables, Barnes, Stacks of Corne, and Hay with Trees, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Another of theſe Witches by her owne confeſſion affirmed that ſhe owing a grudg to a Gentleman and his wife in <hi>Suffolke,</hi> having no occaſion (but that they ſeemed diſcontented at her comming often to their houſe, and wiſhing her to forbeare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming) and onely for this cauſe ſhe ſent one of her Jmpes in the likeneſſe of a little black ſmoth Dog to play with their Boy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very young and their onely child But the child at firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to play with it, but it comming often, at the length the Child made much of it till at laſt the Jmpe brought the child to a water ſide, and there drowned the ſaid child to the great grief of the parents.</p>
            <p>Amongſt thoſe remaining yet in priſon there is one Witch they ſay to be burned, who ſeemeth to be very penitent for her former lewd and abominable indevours, and acts, and deſires to have Petitions put up to divers godly Miniſters that they would be pleaſed to pray in their ſeverall Congregations that her ſaid Jmpes may have no further power, to do any more ſuch like hurt, neither by Sea nor Land, as they have divers times formerly done, to the deſtruction, loſſe, or utter undoing of many ſundry good and honeſt people,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THere are in the County of</hi> Suffolke <hi>foure ſearchers appointed for the finding of them out, two men ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and two women ſearchers, the men are to ſearch thoſe men who are ſuſpected to be Witches, and the women ſearchers likewiſe are to ſearch thoſe women that are ſuppoſed to be Witches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And alſo their maner is, in what Town ſoever in the ſaid County of</hi> Suffolke, <hi>there be any perſon or perſons ſuſpected to bewitch or Witches, thither they ſend for two or all of the ſaid ſearchers, who take the partie or parties ſo ſuſpected into a Roome &amp; ſtrip him, her, or them, starke naked, and on whom the ſearchers find any teats or dugs, that partie or parties, the ſaid ſearchers ſet upon a ſtoole or ſtooles, in the midst of the Roome, ſo that the feete of him, her, or them, may not touch the ground.
