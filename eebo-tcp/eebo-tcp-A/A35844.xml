            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To all the faithful and suffering Members, in all Holes, Prisons and Gaoles,
for the Word of God, and Testimony of Jesus Christ, with
the rest of the Faithfull, wherever scattered upon the
face of the earth.</head>
            <p>DEar Brethren and Sisters, hear the word of the Lord God: Thus saith the Lord, though you now drink
the cup of adversity, and eat the bread of affliction, and are trampled upon, as though you were not
worthy to live upon the earth; yet, notwithstanding all the fury of Men, you are resolved in the strength
of my Spirit for ever to be deprived of the sweet enjoyment of Wife, Husband, tender Children, Parents,
all outward possessions, liberty and life, before you deny the testimony of my Name before the Sons of Men: Oh!
you dear and tender Children, who love not your lives unto death this day, that you may finish a good testimony
for the glory of my Name, saith the Lord God; Lift up your heads in the light of my Covenant, and believe in
my Name, for I am near unto you, saith the mighty God of safety; and let not any weight or burdens lie upon you,
for I will be more then Husband to Wife, and more then Wife to Husband, or Parents to Children, or Children
to Parents; yea, I will be the Husband of the Widow, and a Father of the Children who are deprived of their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Parents for my Name sake: I will enlarge your borders in the life of my Righteousnesse: you that suffer in true
innocency will I refresh with the depth of my mercy yea, I will guard you with the Angels of my presence, and all
that devise mischief against you shall be confounded before the glory of my power, with which I will keep and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
you in the word of my patience, and safety in my presence, saith the Lord God: Therefore you dear Children
who drink the deepest in sufferings, think it not hard, for it is my purpose unto you all that hath not any eye to self,
but alone seeks my glory in all ye doe; I will make you more and more honourable in the glory of my life, and
double my blessings upon you and yours; for I have beholden your integrity, and my bowels are mightily moved
with compassion towards you; therefore am I arisen for your sakes this day, to declare unto you, my suffering peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that not a hair of your heads shall perish, neither shall you be deteined in Prisons and desolate holes any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then I have determined shall be for your eternal good, and the praise and glory of my Name for ever: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in my life stand faithfull in resistance of every evil thought, or what ever would cause you to murmure, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
any thing, but what you know will advance my praise: And all be subject to the measure of my light and life,
and let not any seek a preheminence or esteem amongst men, neither let self-striving, nor self-serving have power in
any, but in true humility, love and meeknesse watch one over another, and let the strong take the weak by the
hand, that you may all gently, in meeknesse, love and holy fear, dread my Name, and serve one another, that your
love may be manifested unto me (saith the Lord your God) and one unto another, in the naked simplicitie of your
spirits; then will I make my dwelling with you, and my dreadfull glorious presence, you shall all feel mighty in you
and amongst you, moving you in the exercise of my Spirit, to the renown of my Name, and comfort of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and I will crown you with heavenly blessings, and the glory of my powerfull life, and you shall praise my
Name for ever, that ever I made you my Iewels, and counted you worthy to suffer for the testimony of my Name:
for I will go before you through all the waters and floods of affliction, and I will appear with you before all the
Councils of the sons of men, and my saving power shall compasse you about in the hot furnace of the fiery afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
Therefore trust in my Name, ye my dear Children, and cast all your care upon me; and if any of you seal
your testimony in the word of my patience with your blood, I will take care of your tender Wives, Children or
Parents, for whom your soules have been poured out unto me for their good. Therefore hear my word which is
sounded unto you from the throne of my grace and eternall glory; rejoyce not too much in Spirits being made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
but throw down all your Crowns, that there be not a self-seeking, self serving Spirit in the Family of my people,
but all feel the birth immortall, raised up in the resurrection of my life in you all, which truly makes Self of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
So that all loftinesse be laid low, and haughtinesse in every one truly bowed down, that I the Lord God in
you all, may be loved, obeyed and exalted, who is taking, and will take to me my great power to exalt the meek
upon the earth, and reign over all the pride of the Children of men; that so my Sons may be brought from far, and
my Daughters from the ends of the earth, in the sight of all people, whom I will make to confesse in subjection to
my power, that you are the beloved people of the most high God, and the righteous Seed whom the Lord hath
blessed, and no weapon formed against you shall prosper but come to nought, which will be hastned for your
comfort, and certainly perform'd according to what is here declared, to your eternall joy; and you shall assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</p>
            <p>The word of the Lord, as before expressed, came upon me in the Common Gaol in Warwick, the 13th. of
the first Moneth 1664. which constrained to be given forth from the Spirit of the Lord, through
your Brother and Companion in tribulation and Kingdome of patience in the Lord Iesus.</p>
