            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>His Majeſtyes Royall Declaration, and Proteſtation to all his Loving Subjects in England.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a wonder that We ſo juſt, ſo pious, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull in our words and intentions ſhould not be believed in all our Declarations and Proteſtations: certainly it is impiety to be ſo full of infidelity towards the words of a King, ſome whereof we have here drawne out of our own ſeverall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that all the world may ſee Our faire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, of our ſelf and the juſt end of all Our actions, and how unjuſtly both have been interpreted. Firſt concerning Our being affected to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, We proteſt in the word of a King, and call the ſearcher of all hearts to record, that We intend not the alteration of the true profeſſed and eſtabliſhed Proteſtant Religion, the Lawes of the Kingdome, the know<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e libertie of the Subject, the right and juſt Priviledges of Parliament. Of the Lawes his Majeſty ſaith thus: A new power hath been aſſumed to interpret and declare Lawes without Us, by extempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry votes, tending to a pure arbitrary power: Ordinances, and Orders were preſſed upon the people as Lawes, and their obedience required to them. His Majeſty ſaith further, We doe beleeve, and accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to all the world, that the malignity of this deſigne (as dangerous to the Lawes of this Kingdome, the power of the ſame, and the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all Our good Subjects, as to Our ſelf, and Our juſt Prerogative) hath proceeded from the ſubtill informations and evill Counſells of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious turbulent Spirits, diſaffected to Gods true Religion, and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Profeſſours thereof, Our Honour and ſafety, and the publick peace and proſperity of our people. His Majeſty addeth further: But how fautly ſoever others are, we ſhall (with Gods aſſiſtance) endeavour to diſcharge Our duty in the uprightneſſe of heart. The King goes on further in declaring his own candor and uprightneſſe, together with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts offered unto Him, ſaying thus they endeavour to turn this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into a new <hi>Eutopia</hi> of Religion, and therefore We are reſolved to change none of Our truſty Officers, till they appear to have behaved themſelves otherwiſe then they ought to have done, and bee evicted
<pb facs="tcp:42716:3"/>
by legall proceedings to have done ſo. We were ever willing that Our Parliament ſhould debate, reſolve, and tranſact ſuch matters as are now proper for them, and we heartily wiſh that the courſe of Law be no wayes diverted, much leſſe diſturbed. Moreover we call God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that as for our Subjects ſakes all rights are veſted in Us, ſo for their ſakes as well as for Our own, we are reſolved not to quit them, nor to ſubvert (though in a Parliamentary way) the ancient, juſt conſtitution of the Government of this Kingdome, nor to make Our ſelf of a King of <hi>England,</hi> a Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> and this of a Kingdome, a Republick. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Kings Majeſty ſaith further, <hi>Nolumus leges Angliae mutari,</hi> We promiſe that We will be as carefull of preſerving the Lawes in what doth concern Our ſubjects, as in what moſt concerns our ſelf, for We profeſſe to believe that the preſervation of every Law concerns Us. We have by many of Our meſſages to you by Our voluntary promiſe to you, ſo ſolemnly made never to pardon any popiſh Prieſt by Our ſtrict Proclamation which lately publiſhed in this point, ſufficiently expreſſed Our zeal herein. We wil alſo with conſtancy maintain (while We live) The Proteſtant Religion in its purity and glory, not onely againſt all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions of Popery, but alſo from the irreverence of Schiſmaticks, and Separatiſts, wherewith this Kingdome of late, and Our City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> abounds, to the great diſhonour and hazzard, both of Church and State. To conclude, We conjure you, and all men to reſt ſatisfied with the truth of Our profeſſions and the reality of Our intentions. And then We ſhall receive much more in the hope of a full &amp; conſtant happines of our people in the true Religion, and under the protection of the ſame by a bleſſed union between Us and Our Parliament, &amp; ſo much deſired by Us, then in any increaſe of Our own Revenue, which beyond former grants of Our Subjects when moſt wealthy, could by our Parliament be ſettled upon Us. Thus We in all our Proteſtations and Meſſages deſire the good of the Kingdome, before Our own private intereſt.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty ſaith further, We profeſſe before and declare to all the world, that we alwayes have and did abhorre all ſuch deſignes, but that all Our endeavous (according to Our many Profeſſions) did and ſhall ever tend to the firm and conſtant ſettlement of the true Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the juſt Priviledges of Parliament, the Liberty of the Subject, the Lawes, Peace and proſperity of this Kingdome.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:42716:3"/>
            <head>In a Letter from His Majeſty to both Houſes of Parliament, the concluſion you may reade thus.</head>
            <p>If all theſe preſent diſtractions (which ſo apparently threaten the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of this Kingdome) do not (by the bleſſing of almighty God) end in a happy and bleſſed accommodation, his Majeſty will then be ready to call heaven and earth, God and man to witneſſe, that it hath not failed on his part.</p>
            <p>I am confident that you expect not I ſhould give a ſpeedy anſwer to this ſtrange and unexpected Declaration, that in the diſtraction of this Kingdome, you ſhould think this way of addreſſe more convenient, then that propoſed by my meſſage the 20 of January laſt to both hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: as concerning the grounds of your feares and jealouſies, I will take time to anſwer particularly, and doubt not but I ſhall do it to the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the whole world. God in his good time will diſcover the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets and bottomes of all plots and treaſons; and then I ſhall ſtand right in the eyes of my people. God ſo deale with me and mine, as all my thoughts and intentions are upright, for the maintenance of the true Proteſtant profeſſion, and for the obſervation, and preſervation of the Lawes of this Land, and I hope God will bleſſe and aſſiſt thoſe Lawes for my preſervation.</p>
            <p>When we duly weigh the diſhonour which will perpetually lie upon this Kingdome, if full and ſpeedy relief be not diſpatched, We could not, nor cannot think of a better way to diſcharge Our duty to Almighty God, for the defence of the true Proteſtant Profeſſion, or to manifeſt Our affection to Our three Kingdomes, then by ingaging Our Perſon in this Expedition, as many of Our royall Progenitours have done even in Forraigne parts, upon cauſes of leſſe importance and piety, with great honour to themſelves, and advantage to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>For the danger of Our Perſon, We conceive it neceſſary and Worthy of a King, to adventure his life to preſerve his Kingdome, neither can it be imagined, that We will fit ſtill, and ſuffer Our Kingdome to be loſt,
<pb facs="tcp:42716:4"/>
and Our good Proteſtant Subjects to be maſſacred, without expoſing Our Perſon to the utmoſt hazzard for their reliefe and preſervation.</p>
            <p>God, in his good time, We hope, will ſo informe the hearts of all Our good Subjects, that We ſhall recover from the miſchiefe and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of this diſtemper, on whoſe good pleaſure We will wait with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and humility.</p>
            <p>For the bringing up of the Army to London, as we have heretofore (by no other direction then the teſtimony of a good conſcience) called God to witneſſe we never had or knew of any ſuch reſolution; ſo upon the view of the Depoſitions now publiſhed with that Declaration, it is not evident to Us, there was ever ſuch a deſigne, unleſſe very looſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe or argument be inſtance enough of ſuch a deſigne.</p>
            <p>And if no better effects then loſſe of time, and hindrance of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like affaires have beene found by Our Anſwers and Replies, let all good men judge, by whoſe default, and whoſe want of duty ſuch effects have beene.</p>
            <p>And We call Almighty God to witneſſe, all Our complaints and jealouſies, which have never been cauſeleſſe, nor of Our Houſes of Parliament, but of ſome few ſchiſmaticall, factious, and ambitious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: Our deniall of the <hi>Militia,</hi> Our abſenting Our Selfe from London, have beene the effects of an upright and faithfull affection to Our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Subjects, that We may be able, through all the inconveniences We are compelled to wraſtle with, at laſt to reſtore their Religion, Lawes, and Liberties unto them.</p>
            <p>Wee deſire Our actions may no longer proſper, or have a bleſſing from God upon them and Us, then they ſhall be directed to the glory of God in the maintenance of the true Proteſtant profeſſion, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the property and liberty of the ſubjects in the obſervation of the Lawes, and the maintenance of the Rights and Freedome of Parliament, in the allowance and protection of all their juſt priviledges.</p>
            <p>We would have you to be aſſured, that We never intended the leaſt neglect unto you in any former Summons of the county, Our love, as well as Our protection, extending to all Our Subjects; but as you are a great body, time and conveniency muſt be obſerved in your aſſembling.</p>
            <p>That you may know the generall reaſons of Our being here, you

            <p>As for Our owne zeale to the Proteſtant profeſſion, we refer all the world to Our daily exerciſe of, and Our Declarations concerning it, and execution of the Laws againſt the Papiſts, ſo likewiſe We cannot but declare Our Selfe moſt heartily ſorry to finde ſuch Separatiſts and Schiſmaticks, who preſume againſt Law, to foment new doctrines and diſciplines, to the diſturbance of Church and State. For the Law, it being the common inheritance of Our people, We ſhall never inforce any Prerogative of Ours beyond it, but ſubmit Our Selfe to it, and give you and all Our Subjects the fulleſt latitude of it, both for the liberty of your perſons, and the propriety of your eſtates, and for an inviolable confidence and aſſurance hereof, as We take God (the ſearcher of all hearts) to witneſſe Our reall intention herein, ſo We ſhall no longer deſire you to ſtand for the defence of Our Perſon, Honour, and juſt Prerogatives, then We ſhall maintaine the Lawes of the Land, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of your perſons, and propriety of your goods.</p>
            <p>For the reſort of Papiſts to the Court, His Majeſties great care for the prevention thereof, is notoriouſly knowne, that when he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed two or three of his Guard were of that Religion, he gave ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall direction, with expreſſions of his diſpleaſure, that they ſhould bee immediately diſcharged, and provided, that no perſon ſhould attend on him under that relation, but ſuch as tooke the oath of Allegiance and Supremacie.</p>
