            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Answer, to a Pamphlet, intituled
The Lord George Digbyes Apologie
for himselfe.</head>
            <p>MEeting with a Pamphlet, intituled the
Lord <hi>George Digbies</hi> Apologie for
himselfe; and being well acquainted
with the excellent gifts and naturall
indowments of the man, I could not
choose but with a great deale of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
venter on the perusall of the
said Pamphlet, which indeed began
with so much modesty and harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse,
that I did begin to entertaine a very good opinion
of the rest; but therein the said Lord plaid his master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
of craft, to make his sufferings, as it were, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
to that Discourse; so to beguile the mindes of the
vulgar Readers, and allure them to commiserate his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
by the displaying and protesting his innocency,
and consequently his injuries: and surely so subject is
mans nature, especially the wavering multitudes, to pity
misfortunes, even in the most desperate malefactors,
whom before in their wishes they had devoted to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
deaths and torments; that when they evidently see
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111445:3"/>
them suffer, they are very apt to compassionate their
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>. So I believe it is with this young Lord, who having
 with his faire andspecious Apologie, as the ancient
used (even their capitall offenders) <hi>provare ad populam</hi> appealed to the peoples censure, hee ho<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es) hee
shall by the winning and imploring language of his said Apologie, intice and perswade them to an absolute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of his innocence, nothing being more uncertaine then
the mindes and votes of that giddie and blatant beast, the
multitude.</p>
            <p>But to judicious and discerning eyes, who weigh every
circumstance by judgement, not passion, this his Apologe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
discourse will rather appeare an absolute accusation
then a disingagement of him from his crimes, that goodly
and verdant grasse being not of heigth enough to hide the
swelling and invenomed Serpent that lurks under it, which
in spight of my Lords fained modestie will breake out and
declare the rankour of his heart towards the good of the
Common-wealth, and the proceedings of the honourable
the High Court of Parliament of which hee sayes, hee
was once a Member, and demeaned himselfe with that
free and just deportment for the good and advancement
of the publique affaires, that hee had gained a very good
opinion whilest hee was in the lower House, still asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating
himselfe with such of the said House, as were
most forward in the Common-wealths cause. That he did
all this, is confessed: For men can never gaine any thing
by detracting from an enemy; and that hee did proceed
with much zeale and diligence in that which befitted him
in the publique affaires; in especiall, about the trienniall
Parliament, and the businesse of my Lord of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>fford,</hi>
against whom hee declaimed with much judgement and
discretion, but afterwards in that very businesse which
with so much acrimony and and courage he had pursued,
to wit, the att<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inder of the said Earle, he fell off, even
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111445:3"/>
against his owne conscience, being then touched with
that first some of the Angells, ambition, which makes men
like poysoned Rats, who, when they have once swallowed
the pleasing bane, rest not untill they drinke, and then
can rest much lesse, untill they burst with it: For about
this time, divers of those subtill Malignants, taking spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
notice of the growing vertues and admirable abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of that young L<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rd, thought it advantagious for their
purpose, by drawing him with the line of honour to their
purpose, to withdraw him from the service of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
which he had so couragiously undertaken; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
intimating to his Majesty his abilities, hee was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
by writ called out of the lower House, where he
was by election a Burgesse, into the upper House, where
by that new creation hee was to sit as a Baron and a
Peere of the Realme. Besides, as himselfe confesses in his
Apologie, there was notice taken, and advisement given
him by a friend, that hee was lost in the opinion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
by his frequenting the Court; and indeed, hee was
so, for then the young mans nature being wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the perswasions and promises of those subtile Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants,
and puft up by their manifesting his immense de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
and hopes of a signall and sudden preferment, hee
then turned recreant to his former vertue and care of the
Common-wealth, declining it, in regard of his private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
and profit; and then, to the wonder of all, and
griefe of most good men, hee fell off from his opinion
in that case of which hee had formerly beene so great
a patron, and then made that infamous and unhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Speech, so much detested of all true lovers of the
Common-wealth, which by order from the honourable
the high Court of PARLIAMENT was publikely
burned by the common Hang-man; a Speech indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
no better destiny, then to be sacrificed by the fire
to oblivion; and neither the finenesse of my Lord <hi>Digbyes</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:111445:4"/>
wit, nor the comptnesse of his phrase, can by both their
endevours excise that Speech of absolute apostasie to
his former integrity; nor incite to believe that so many
honourable and wise men as were then resident in the
House of Commons, would have condemned that Speech
to so much infamy, and proscribed the Author incapable
of honour and office in the common-wealth, had it not
beene stuft with unpardonable and apparent abuses, both
to the honour and utility of the State; and therefore to
no reasonable man can my Lords Vindication of that
Speech appeare valid. But not to insist too long upon
this Article, let us descend to the examination of that
which declared him a professed enemy to the State,
namely, the businesse at <hi>Kingston,</hi> whither he protests hee
onely went by his Majesties command, to deliver a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to some Souldiers and Cavaliers, not with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
or act of hostility, or rankour against the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Let us but rightly consider the men with whom
he went to treat, and out of that will appeare my Lords
equivocation at least, if not absolute falshood in this point:
First, these forty men hee talkes of, were at least eight
score, all of them of the Commanders that were in the
Northerne expedition, men for the most part of as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
soules as fortunes; and that these men were
drawne thither, either by the Lord <hi>Digby's</hi> perswasions,
or some others of his stampe and condition, is evident, in
that the said Commanders were destined as a leife guard
to his Majesty, into whose head my Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> and
such other Malignants, had subtilly instilled feares and
jealousies of his sacred persons securitie, against which no
man would ever be so audacious as to have a thought
of harme; and so got his Majestie to entertaine those
Cavaliers, being indeed aptly to be resembled to those
desperate <hi>Gladiators</hi> among the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas my Lord excuses himselfe, or at least
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111445:4"/>
thinks hee does so, of all these machinations and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
by alledging hee is not of his Majesties Councell;
grant it, yet having his Majesties eare as well as Master
<hi>Porter</hi> and the rest of his Cabinet-councellors, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ine
his Lordship might give as dangerous advices as
the most perverse Malignant among them: Vertuous men,
when they once decline to vice, are of all others the
most vicious: as among the <hi>Turkes</hi> none are so deadly
and desperate enemies to the <hi>Christians</hi> as <hi>Christian Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negadoes;</hi>
and whereas my Lord sayes, if hee had been
of the Councell he could have detected divers, who said
the King was not worthy to live, and words of the like
barbarous and disloyall consequence; why did not his
Lordship declare and appeach those persons, that they
might have beene given up to the Lawes punishment,
which certainly the honourable the High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
would have seene with all severity inflicted on
them. And though his Lordship does so much stomack
his being called and declared Traytor to the King; if he
had committed nothing else, cerrainly this concealment
so long of the author of such words is safficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him of Treason; but if actually to levie warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Kings people, be Treason against the King, as
my Lord apparently did at <hi>Kingston,</hi> then is my Lord
<hi>Digby</hi> guilty of Treason, not otherwise; if to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and abetter of ill counsells to the King, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and destructive to the peace of the Kingdome, as
is evident my Lord is, by his intercepted Letters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hee required his Majesty to withdraw to some place
of strength and safety from this Parliament, be to be a
Traytor, then is my Lord so, otherwise innocent. And for
his Lordships withdrawing by the Kings licence out of his
discontents into <hi>Holland,</hi> in hope that tract of time might
reconcile him to the good opinion of the people, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
the memory of his disgraces; the falshood of this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111445:5"/>
pretension is more apparent them any of the former; and
that my Lord went over meerely as an agent  to promote
and advance the distractions betweene his Majesty and
his Parliament, by procuring forraigne ayds, which by
his owne Letters is testified against him, that hee ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
both in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and in other parts; as
also by the information of sundry Merchants of good cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
from thence, my Lord desiring to have himselfe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
unto by the name of Baron of <hi>Sherburne.</hi> Next from
whence came all those supplies of ammunition and armes
to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> but from my Lord <hi>Digby</hi> and his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices.
Finally, there is nothing in all my Lords well-penned
Apologie, that is worthy any judicious mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
or pity, unlesse they may in Christian charity grieve
that so many rare<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and excellent parts as are in the man,
should be so mis-imployed: for past question by this that
is here set downe in answer to his said Apologie, it is
manifested perspicuously how ill a title my Lord can lay
to innocence, and how evidently malicious guilt hath
beene contiguated with all his actions, since his revolt
from his duty to his mother the Common-wealth, from
whom hee can deserve no better a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> stile then that which
