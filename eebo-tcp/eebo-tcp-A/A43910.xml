            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>INto the Kinrick of Bealm,</l>
            <l>There winn'd a Lord of that Realm:</l>
            <l>He was the greatest of renown,</l>
            <l>Except the King that wore the Crown.</l>
            <l>His name was Earl Diges,</l>
            <l>And his Lady Dame Biges:</l>
            <l>And his Daugh'er Winliane,</l>
            <l>Husband would she never have nane,</l>
            <l>Neither for gold nor yet for good,</l>
            <l>Nor yet for highness of his blood,</l>
            <l>But only he that through swords dint,</l>
            <l>That ever wan and never tint.</l>
            <l>Als there was men in that Kinrick,</l>
            <l>Many one, but very few sik,</l>
            <l>They sought far off her for to fang,</l>
            <l>And she was maiden wonder lang.</l>
            <l>Her Father had a noble rout</l>
            <l>Of bold Knights strong and stout:</l>
            <l>But in that Court there was a Knight,</l>
            <l>An hardy man both good and wight,</l>
            <l>They called him Sir Eger,</l>
            <l>And he was but a Batcheler:</l>
            <l>His eldest brother was livand,</l>
            <l>And brooked all his fathers land,</l>
            <l>Yet was he courteously taught,</l>
            <l>And he sought battels far, and fought,</l>
            <l>And conquered the honour,</l>
            <l>With weapons and with armour:</l>
            <l>Both in battels and in fight:</l>
            <l>While on a time that she him heght,</l>
            <l>And she granted him her good-will,</l>
            <l>Her Father assented soon theretill,</l>

            <l>Then soon after great din heard I:</l>
            <l>Of bony birds in a herbeir,</l>
            <l>That of love sang with voice so clear,</l>
            <l>With diverse notes against the day,</l>
            <l>She came to me without delay,</l>
            <l>And brought me drink into an horn,</l>
            <l>And since the day that I was born,</l>
            <l>Such a good drink I never got,</l>
            <l>When I had drunk she could me hap,</l>
            <l>Within a day she came again,</l>
            <l>Of all my gear she made me plain.</l>
            <l>The drink that she gave me was green,</l>
            <l>Into my wounds it might be seen.</l>
            <l>The blood was fled when it was there,</l>
            <l>And all was sound before was sair.</l>
            <l>The bloody tents away she drew,</l>
            <l>And tented me again with new:</l>
            <l>The tents that in my wounds yeed,</l>
            <l>Trust ye well they were no threed.</l>
            <l>They were neither lake nor line,</l>
            <l>Of silk they were both good and fine,</l>
            <l>The mistenting of my wounds,</l>
            <l>Cost that Lady twenty pounds.</l>
            <l>Withoutten spice, salves or gries,</l>
            <l>And other things that did me ease:</l>
            <l>My linnen cloths were washed clean,</l>
            <l>The blood in them might not be seen.</l>
            <l>A sark of silk that was full dear,</l>
            <l>She put on me which I have here:</l>
            <l>And syne put on mine own abone,</l>
            <l>And all my clothing she hath undone,</l>

            <l>Of mine habreke I had great dreed,</l>

            <l>But it was as sicker and sound,</l>
            <l>As never weapon had wrought me wound.</l>

            <l>An horse of theirs then by him stood,</l>

            <l>Sir Grahame was nothing of his kin,</l>

            <l>But it was more then dayes three,</l>
            <l>Ere his own love came him to see,</l>
            <l>And when she came, she was but drie,</l>

            <l>UUhen she came to the chamber within,</l>
            <l>Little company made to him,</l>
            <l>Sir Eger might not one word speak,</l>
            <l>Sir Grahame before the bed could sit,</l>
            <l>And to sir Grahame said she than,</l>
            <l>Sir, how doth your sore wounded man,</l>
            <l>Or how hath he sped in his fare.</l>
            <l>Said, not so well as mister were:</l>
            <l>So is it hapned as you may see.</l>
            <l>Not one forethinkes so much as ye.</l>
            <l>The Lady said, so have I feel,</l>

            <l>And better sped in his journey.</l>
            <l>Sir Eger asked where he lay.</l>

            <l>I rede you be of counsel clean,</l>
            <l>Ye will not cose, Sir, as I ween.</l>
            <l>I think your love be in no weer,</l>
            <l>Therefore I rede you make good chear.</l>
            <l>Sir Eger said, My chear well is,</l>
            <l>But even as I may with this,</l>
            <l>As before when better hath been,</l>
            <l>I will not mend suppose I mean.</l>
            <l>Then said the Lady, Certes nay,</l>
            <l>It mends not though ye do sway,</l>
            <l>Fortune will not then from you wend,</l>
            <l>Nor yet from me though I should send:</l>
            <l>But for follie to set at wit,</l>
            <l>And so I must then do with it.</l>
            <l>She no more tidings did refrain,</l>
            <l>But bounded to her chamber again.</l>
            <l>Then Sir Grahame stood before the door,</l>
            <l>And held the Lady on the floor,</l>
            <l>A little while right by the hand:</l>
            <l>Then by his fellow could he stand,</l>
            <l>And said to him right courteouslie,</l>
            <l>Sir, This the Lady telleth me,</l>
            <l>What makes her biding to delay,</l>

            <l>She was forbidden by the leech,</l>
            <l>And also by her fathers speech,</l>
            <l>And the first night that ye came home,</l>
            <l>So great a sorrow hath she tane,</l>
            <l>That she hath been as sick as ye,</l>
            <l>And thus his fellow comfort he</l>
            <l>Eleven weeks, as I heard say,</l>
            <l>Sir Eger there in leeching lay,</l>

            <l>Her drieness and als here strange fare.</l>
            <l>Sir Grahame then said to sir Eger,</l>

            <l>Nor yet in presence come him to:</l>
            <l>And on this wise, as with sir Grahame,</l>

            <l>And then told him a fern-years tale,</l>
            <l>And this while thus he wrought all hale,</l>

            <l>Then after that upon a day,</l>
            <l>He thought the Lady to assay:</l>

            <l>Into a chamber where she stood:</l>

            <l>Belonging both to you and me.</l>
            <l>She said, say on, what ever it be.</l>
            <l>Yonder is your Knight sir Eger,</l>

            <l>Sir Grahame, ye wot this many day,</l>

            <l>I would have none for no kin thing,</l>
            <l>Neither for riches nor renown,</l>

            <l>How ever he did, such was his hap:</l>
            <l>I bade him let his journey be,</l>
            <l>Make not this travel all for me:</l>
            <l>I said, such field he may come in,</l>
            <l>Was as able to tine or win.</l>
            <l>I strake the nail upon the head,</l>
            <l>All that he wan ye may soon sead:</l>
            <l>For trust ye me right well, Sir Grahame,</l>
            <l>I wist the matter all sensyne:</l>
            <l>For the first night that he came home,</l>
            <l>I heard your words every eachone,</l>
            <l>Under your chamber window stood,</l>
            <l>And heard your carping ill and good:</l>
            <l>I will not bid him for to bide,</l>
            <l>Nor yet him counsel for to ride,</l>
            <l>Neither consent I will thereto.</l>
            <l>Of his wedding I have no do.</l>
            <l>Sir Grahame he said, I trow he will,</l>
            <l>But little seeking make you till:</l>
            <l>And he tels in his coming hame,</l>
            <l>That he hath sped a bettter name,</l>

            <l>This he did say into bourding,</l>

            <l>Yet sadly in his heart he thought,</l>

            <l>Bodies they made both black and bla,</l>
            <l>Like wood lyons so fought they twa.</l>
            <l>What for fighting and blood he bled,</l>
            <l>Gray-steel was never so hard bested.</l>

            <l>Gray-steel was grieved at that word,</l>

            <l>That came to me in so good time.</l>

            <l>Upon Gray-steel for to be spent.</l>
            <l>For he was large of lyre and bone,</l>

            <l>She said, Ye Knight of aventure,</l>
            <l>In preass think on your paramour.</l>

            <l>The Earl bethought him on a thing,</l>

            <l>In armes that was both fresh and fine,</l>
            <l>Was brought to dead upon a bear,</l>

            <l>Sir Alistoun that gentle knight,</l>

            <l>That was both might, and als manlie,</l>

            <l>He might have been an Emperour,</l>
            <l>He had an hoast in governing,</l>
            <l>But Gray-steel had such chance given,</l>
            <l>In world was never none so good,</l>
            <l>Had strength that yet against him stood:</l>
            <l>When that came to the Earls thought,</l>
            <l>He left this play, and held it nought:</l>
            <l>And in the chamber walkt a space,</l>
            <l>In came the Lady fair of face,</l>
            <l>With laughing mouth and lovesome chear,</l>
            <l>He said, Welcome, my daughter dear,</l>

            <l>That hath tane many wrongous wed.</l>
            <l>The Earl asked, Who did the deed?</l>
            <l>The Lady said, so God me speed,</l>
            <l>It is a quarter of a year,</l>
            <l>Sen that time that a knight came here,</l>
            <l>Right sore wounded with sword and knife,</l>
            <l>Scantly was left in him his life:</l>
            <l>Yet I perceived by his affeer,</l>
            <l>He was a ventrous Knight of weer:</l>
            <l>And he had met with sir Gray-steel,</l>
            <l>As many did, and he might feel.</l>
            <l>When I had seen that of the knight,</l>
            <l>I held him in my bower all night,</l>
            <l>Dispoyled him of all his gear,</l>
            <l>Then the most wound that did him dear,</l>
            <l>My stones of vertue stemd the blood,</l>
            <l>I made him salve both fine and good,</l>
            <l>They softed him, and made him sleep,</l>
            <l>And laid him down, and could him keep,</l>
            <l>And in the dawning of the day,</l>
            <l>He bowned him, and made his way.</l>
            <l>Fra that he would no longer bide,</l>
            <l>Another salve to him I made,</l>
            <l>That lasted him a day or two,</l>
            <l>A sark of silk I gave him to:</l>
            <l>It is a quarter of a year,</l>
            <l>Sen time that the knight came here.</l>
            <l>I heard him say that came him fro,</l>
            <l>That he might neither ride nor go.</l>
            <l>The Earl said to the Lady bright,</l>
            <l>When heard ye tidings of the knight?</l>
            <l>From him the streen there came another,</l>
            <l>And he is the samine Knights brother,</l>
            <l>Came raiking to me where I stood,</l>
            <l>And brought me tidings fair and good:</l>
            <l>Then hastily he shew to me,</l>
            <l>Beads of Gold and broches three:</l>
            <l>The sark that I gave to the knight,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:109884:28"/>And twenty pounds of pennies bright.</l>
            <l>Then he said gladly, If I might,</l>
            <l>I would be quanted with the knight.</l>
            <l>And courteously he asked tythance,</l>
            <l>If that of him I had quantance:</l>
            <l>And when I asked after the Knight,</l>
            <l>He said to me, by Marie bright,</l>
            <l>He lyes at home into my bed,</l>
            <l>Right as I were with sickness led.</l>
            <l>Kept in secret and quietly,</l>
            <l>And I am come in this country,</l>
            <l>To see if he will be my brother,</l>
            <l>Send him one wed for another:</l>
            <l>And will he not, by heavens King,</l>
            <l>There shal men carp of our meeting:</l>
            <l>And I have credance of the knight,</l>
            <l>And held him in my bower all night:</l>
            <l>And in the dawning of the day,</l>
            <l>He bowned him to his journey,</l>
            <l>And right now is he come again,</l>
            <l>And brought me word the knight is slain.</l>
            <l>And that made me this time come here,</l>

            <l>Now make your quantance with the knight,</l>

            <l>The Earl he would no longer stand,</l>
            <l>But took the Countess by the hand.</l>
            <l>The Lady was as white as Swan,</l>
            <l>Before them to the bower is gang:</l>
            <l>The knight before the Chimney stood,</l>

            <l>He took his helm into his hand,</l>
            <l>Hailsed the Earl right reverand:</l>
            <l>The Lady brought the shield to see,</l>
            <l>The Earl then kneeled on his knee,</l>
            <l>Thanking the God of heavens King,</l>
            <l>And to the knight attour all thing,</l>

            <l>The Lady made the knight a syne,</l>
            <l>The knight kneeled full courteouslie,</l>
            <l>And said, then Lord, this young Lady,</l>
            <l>I will now ask her for my wage,</l>
            <l>And have her into marriage:</l>
            <l>The Countess said, Me thinks it right,</l>
            <l>To give the maiden to the knight,</l>
            <l>For his worship and his bountie,</l>
            <l>Give him the maid for honestte.</l>
            <l>The Earl said, If her own consent</l>

            <l>Then needs not any mo witness,</l>
            <l>None but the Earl and the Countess,</l>

            <l>The Earl he would no longer stand,</l>
            <l>But took his helm in his right hand,</l>
            <l>Then he shewed it into the hall,</l>
            <l>Into the Court amongst them all.</l>
            <l>And they did know it wonder well,</l>
            <l>To be the helm of sir Gray-steel,</l>
            <l>Keeped the Forest and the Green,</l>
            <l>And many times did it maintain.</l>
            <l>A knight asked, Who hath him slain?</l>

            <l>The burgess said, it shal be done,</l>

            <l>When they had eaten, they drew the cleas,</l>
            <l>The clarks they stood, and said the grace:</l>
            <l>Then brought they water to the Knight,</l>

            <l>Sir Grahame when he saw the West-land,</l>

            <l>Then said the burgess to the knight,</l>

            <l>He lighted down and left his steed,</l>
            <l>And to her on his feet he yeed,</l>
            <l>And hailsed her right reverentlie,</l>
            <l>And he knew not the Earl was by,</l>
            <l>And that perceived well sir Grahame.</l>
            <l>To sir Eger he past that time,</l>
            <l>While I be quick, or yet be dead,</l>

            <l>Bishops, Abbots, both Munk and Frier.</l>
            <l>There was then at his lighting down,</l>

            <l>Sir Eger lov'd him by the lave,</l>
