            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Not to have yielded to your desires had been uncivility; and though I am sensible of the weakness of the Discourse, yet to pleasure you, I have resolv'd to deny my self in that thing we call Credit and Reputation; the rather because in this Sermon I have prov'd it to be <hi>Vanity.</hi> The Text was of your Daughters choosing; whether she regarded the sound more than the sense, I will not enquire; but as the different sentiments of Divines about this passage, have allow'd it a place in the Catalogue of the sublimer mysteries of the Gospel; So if I had had more time to view and correct my Comment, it might have come abroad more polish'd, and fitted more to the palate of the Age. What nicer men would have made the Scene of curious Speculations, I have endeavour'd to make as practical as I can, being sensible that our work is to <hi>convert</hi> Souls, not to <hi>paint</hi> them. In an Age so loose as ours, so full of Vanity and Sin, we had need be very serious and earnest with men to come away from these

Idols, to serve the Living God, and as this shall be my sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere endeavour, while the Great Master of my Life is pleas'd to continue me in the station I am in; So if I can contribute any thing, either to your Ladyships, or your Relations Spiritual Advantage and Edification, it will be no small Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to</p>

As this Epistle hath occasion'd more differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in the World, than any other Book of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: So we seem to want some heavenly Interpreter, more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> than St. <hi>Peter's</hi> pretended Successor at <hi>Rome,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them; and yet I cannot deny, but that by Prayer, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, and assiduous reading, and laying aside partiality, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and superstitious reverence to our education, and by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the scope and drift of the Writer, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances he then was in, and the controversies that vex'd the Church in that age; the mind of the Holy Ghost, though not in every particular, yet in most things may be known to our comfort and satisfaction.</p>
            <p>In this Chapter the Apostle partly <hi>directs</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and partly <hi>comforts</hi> them, shews them their <hi>duty,</hi> and their <hi>cordial;</hi> lets them see how they must be qualified, if they claim an interest in Christ Jesus, and how much God is concern'd in the midst of all their afflictions, and persecutions.</p>
            <p>In his directions which reach from the 1. to the 16. <hi>v.</hi> he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints them, That if they lay hold on the love and favour, and merits of Christ Jesus, they must mind spiritual things more than temporal, change their bvass, and the spirit of God must be predominant in their souls, govern their inward man, make all their passions stoop, and all their desires bow to his command.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99893:4"/>In his comforts he is ever stately and magnificent, and doth as it were empty Heaven, to bring the Blessed <hi>Trinity,</hi> and all the treasures of that Glory down into their souls, and having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Heavens glory, the reward of all troubled and weary souls; he knows not how to be large and copious enough upon so rich, so illustrious a Subject: And therefore by way of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopopoea</hi> or Figure, whereby we ascribe actions and postures of rational Creatures to things either inanimate, or sensitive, he brings in the whole Creation longing for that glory, as if the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse sympathiz'd with all the suffering servants of God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them breath'd after that splendid manifestation of God's power, and majesty, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>For the earnest expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God;</hi> and because the more curious among the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, he writes to, might ask how Creatures corruptible and vain come to pant after that glorious day, he in my Text lets them know that it is the great Commander of Heaven and Earth, that hath so ordered it, and intends to bring Light out of that Darkness, and make that vanity they are subject to, subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to their future perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the Creature was made subject unto vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him, who subjected it unto the same in hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words we find, 1. A peremptory assertion of a signal change made in the Creature. <hi>The Creature was made subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vanity.</hi> 2. The manner of this change, or rather the cause of it. <hi>Not willingly, but by reason of him, who subjected it unto the same.</hi> 3. Something which qualifies and mitigates that change, or vanity. <hi>It is subjected in hope, and</hi> of these in order.</p>
            <p>I. A signal change made in the Creature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Creature was made subject unto vanity.</hi> There is hardly any word in Holy Writ, that Expositors have toiled more to find out the meaning of, than that of <hi>Creature</hi> in the Text. Not to mention, that some by it have understood Mankind in general, others the Christian World, others the Blessed Angels, who minister unto those that shall be heirs of Salvation; some eminent men of late have undertaken to make out, that the Apostle
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99893:4"/>
means the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> which were to be brought over to the Christian Faith. But if we admit of this sense, it must follow, that the Apostle in the foregoing Verse, where he begins to speak of the <hi>Creature,</hi> falls abruptly upon a new subject, which seems altogether improbable, that verse being joyn'd by the particle <hi>FOR</hi> to <hi>v.</hi> 18. in which we have him comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the afflicted Christian with that glory, which ere long should be revealed in him, and then immediately it follows, <hi>the earnest expectation of the Creature,</hi> &amp;c. So that what is said <hi>v.</hi> 19. and in my Text, must have relation to the same subject he had spoke of <hi>v.</hi> 18. and if by the Creature we understand all creatures in this visible World, in a word, Heaven and Earth, and the things that are therein, the coherence is elegant, and the sense perfect, easie, and natural; and it is an argument, <hi>à minori ad majus,</hi> from the less to the greater: If the whole Creation hopes to be delivered from her bondage and oppression, you may with far greater reason both look for a happy deliverance and comfort your selves with the thoughts of it.</p>
            <p>And indeed, he will soon be convinced, that <hi>the Creature was made subject unto vanity,</hi> that shall observe how much its gloss, and beauty decay'd after the fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> how the Earth, that before was a stranger to all noxious herbs and plants, brought forth <hi>Thistles and thorns</hi> now; how her former fertility was lost in a dismal barrenness, and the ground that before required no labour, would yield little now, but what Men forced and squee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed out of it by the sweat of their brows; how the Blessing that enrich'd and adorn'd it before, exspir'd into a Curse; and Nature, which before knew no poison, no enmity to Man, degenerated now into Hostility, and from a friend became a foe; how her former lovely face is all disfigured with spots and freckles now, and that which was all <hi>charm</hi> to a rational soul before, is now become an object, which few wise men, indeed none but fools delight in; how the Heavens which before dispens'd their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly influences to Man, and seem'd to be proud of the employment, soon after became Gods <hi>Arsenal,</hi> from whence he sometimes fetches water to <hi>drown,</hi> as he did the first World, sometimes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99893:5"/>
fire to <hi>consume,</hi> as he did <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorra,</hi> sometimes hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones to <hi>kill,</hi> as he did the <hi>Amorites,</hi> sometimes winds to <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> as he did <hi>Job</hi>'s houses; how the Creatures which were commission'd only to seed, and cherish man, are now very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily made use of to punish him, and they that before served him for the noblest uses in his integrity, at the best do now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him in his misery; how the Creatures, which before did reverently observe and bow to him, do now as often seize on him, as if Nature were inverted, and they had got the dominion over him, whose primitive right it was to have dominion over every living thing that moves upon the Earth; and how many things, which before might have made him truly happy, serve only now to make him an object of scorn to God and his holy Angels. So much of this change.</p>
            <p>II. The manner of the change, or rather the cause of it. <hi>Not willingly, but by reason of him that subjected it unto the same.</hi> Men and the Apostate Angels indeed were made subject to vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with their own consent, and their own wilfulness lost them that glory they once enjoy'd; but the other creatures in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner against their will, because it was not for any fault of their own, but for Man's sin that God doomed them to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their vanity; <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be the Earth for thy sake</hi> (saith God to <hi>Adam</hi>) <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17. And that no man may think it strange that the curse of God should light on things innocent and incapable of sinning, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that God in punishing the <hi>creatures</hi> with their <hi>vanity,</hi> punished Man himself for whose use and service chiefly they were created; as a Magistrate that confiscates the offenders goods, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts Justice on the offender, and puts him in mind of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror he hath committed, and of the injury he hath done to the publick: So that he that hath subjected the Creature unto vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is God, by whose just sentence it came to pass, that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures all glorious before, became sutable to Man's corrupt and miserable condition, and were permittied to be stings and thorns in his side, and so far from yielding true content and satisfaction, that they ordinarily lead to trouble and vexation of spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:99893:5"/>I will not here enlarge upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, nor shew you what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, what pride, what contumacy, what ingratitude, what want of love, what Apostacy may be discover'd in it. We may be confident, God had reason for what he did, and that he saw the <hi>crimson dye</hi> of the transgression, which made him issue out this order, that upon this Great Princes fall, the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should go into Mourning.</p>
            <p>III. That which in a great measure qualifies and mitigates this Vanity, the Creature hath been suffer'd to sink into, is this; That it is <hi>subjected in hope.</hi> God hath as it were endow'd the Creatures our eyes behold with hopes of their restitution to their pristine beauty, usefulness and glory; <hi>For according to his promise we look for new Heavens and a new Earth, wherein dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth righteousness, the old Heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the Elements shall melt with fervent heat; the old Earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burnt up,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. 13. Thus the Creature will one day undergo a kind of Glorification and participate of the splendor which shall encircle all righteous and sanctified souls; and as Gold in the fire is refin'd, it's dross purged away and comes out more splendid than it was before: So the World that now lies under corruption, purified by that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fire, will put on a face more pleasant and beautiful than now it hath; and let no man scoff at this assertion under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that the Earth at that time will be of no use, for good men will be in Heaven, and the wicked in Hell, and consequently the Earth will have no need of Renovation; for can any man be so irrational as to think that there is no use of the Creature, but what consists in eating and drinking and sensual pleasure? And though I will not say with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who favours the <hi>Millenary</hi> opinion,<note place="margin">Tertuli. lib. 3. adv. Marc.</note> that the new Heavens and the new Earth will be <hi>in compensatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem eorum, quae in seculo vel despeximus, vel amisimus,</hi> to make amends for what we have either lost or despis'd in this World; yet how are we sure that the glorified Saints shall be so confined to that place we strictly call Heaven, as not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend upon this glorified Earth, which for ought we know will be fill'd with God's glory in a manner as much as Heaven, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99893:6"/>
will together with Heaven, make one great Theatre of bliss and happiness? And who knows but these triumphant Saints, as at that time they'll know things perfectly, and see through a glass no more, are to read the wisdom, and goodness, and bounty of the Great Creator in the several Creatures that shall adorn that new World? And this is that <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Thus far the sense of the words, which sense I do the rather pitch upon, because both Ancient and Modern Divines, some few only excepted, agree in't. And now what subject of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course can be fitter for this present occasion, than <hi>THE VANITY OF THE CREATURE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can we see a curious Fabrick here all broke to pieces, and a Creature that was made a little lower than the Angels, cut off before half her race was run, and tumbling down as she was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Hill, and forbear crying out with <hi>Solomon, Vanity of vanities, all is vanity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are few men that pretend either to sense or reason, but will freely acknowledg the vanity of all sublunary Objects, and yet to see them dote on things, which by their own confession are fickle, inconstant, and unsatisfactory; to see them hug this Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,

            <p>The application of these passages is easie enough, and who sees not that sensual pleasure is that <hi>Panther</hi> and that <hi>Dragon,</hi> that in the end destroys the fond man, that is either delighted with its <hi>smell,</hi> or with its glorious <hi>outside.</hi> And here I remember what the noble <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, Pleasure (he means that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which Lust and Luxury affords) is a Brute, but not a Savage one; It tears indeed like a wild one, but doth not seem to be so; Did it appearin its proper colours, it would be shun'd as Bears and Leons; and there would be no difficulty in catching and killing of it; but coming in the habit of a friend, it doth both hurt and cheat, murthers by adulation, and while it pretends to give <hi>liberty,</hi> makes a <hi>prisoner</hi> of the man; and enslaves him to a Prodigy, the man doth not so much <hi>buy</hi> Pleasure as <hi>sell</hi> himself to it; and his reason is turn'd out into <hi>exile;</hi> and he is banish'd from <hi>himself,</hi> for it makes him venture upon the basest, most childish, most sneaking, and most impertinent actions, things below a man, and below those excellent faculties he is endow'd withal, and like some <hi>ill natured Physician,</hi> gives a pleasant Potion and cures him for the present, keeps up his spirits, and supports him, that he may abuse his body more, and venture upon new diseases.</p>

It's pleasant to read how one of their Kings being by some <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor</hi>

The King migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily incens'd at the insolence, immediately drew his Sword to kill him, to whom the Gentleman <hi>wittily</hi> replied: <hi>Either upon the drinking of this Liquor, I am immortal, or I am not; If I am, then in vain do you attempt to kill me; if I am not, you have</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:99893:10"/>
               <hi>reason to thank me because I have deliver'd you from a cheat.</hi> Which answer pacified the King, and made him commend his friends prudence and fidelity.</p>
            <p>Yet, it seems, so bewitching a thing is this desire of Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here on Earth in that kind of men, that this very King not long after that modest reprehension of his friend, attempted the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility afresh, and commanded a House to be built of all sorts of fragrant and odoriferous Trees, as <hi>Cedar, Cypress, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire,</hi> &amp;c. The scent whereof perfumed the Air for two or three miles together. In this large and splendid Palace, was placed an ample <hi>Bason,</hi> togather the soft Dew that fell, in which dew, <hi>pearls</hi> were every day dissolv'd, and from this rich draught the unwise King promised himself no less than Eternity on this side Heaven; But his death which soon after follow'd, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the folly of the attempt, and discover'd the vanity of the King, and of his <hi>life</hi> together.</p>
            <p>Where men live in contempt of a better World, no marvel if they magnifie this <hi>present life</hi> and wish for the <hi>longevity</hi> of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and would be glad if they might arrive to the age of <hi>Methuselah,</hi> but these are sickly desires which their blind appetite causes, desires as <hi>vain</hi> as the life they praise, for in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that, what do they commend but misery and calamity! and he that protracts his age to some hundreds of years, doth but protract it to labour and sorrow. Who can express the innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able disasters, discontents, and vexations life is subject and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd unto?

Here an injury we receive, torments us; There a loss we sustain, afflicts us. Here our endeavours are cross'd; there our expectations disappointed.

How should he continue sound long that hath so many enemies within, and without him, to shatter his earthly Tabernacle into dust and atoms? Nothing for ought I see deceives the unwary sinner more than his state of health, this tempts him to offer violence to his nature, and run out into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies, and because he feels no distemper for the present, he flatters himself with a perpetual freedom from it, goes on in his <hi>debauches,</hi> and while he pleases himself, that his nature is made of <hi>iron,</hi> he finds, when it is too late, that it is weaker than <hi>clay,</hi> and thus precipitates himself into perpetual groans; one would think he is <hi>weary</hi> of his health, and <hi>tired</hi> with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing so long without a change; one would think he hath his health given him for no other use, but to shorten it, and that he finds pleasure in having it <hi>checkered</hi> with diseases.</p>

They have ransacked Nature for restoratives, forced Metals into Spirits, dissolved Minerals into Antidotes, distill'd Herbs and Plants into a quintessence; pounded Pearls into Powder, used themselves to such a diet, eaten their meat by weight, avoided the coldness of the air, shun'd those dishes that might tempt them to a surfeit. But alas! in despite of all their care, maugre all the preventing Medicines they have used, how hath a distemper they neither feared, nor dreamed of, seiz'd on their limbs, and deliver'd them up to the <hi>King of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> and unexpectedly sent them to their <hi>long home,</hi> from whence there is no returning?</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99893:12"/>
can give an immortal spirit true and solid satisfaction. See how he views these <hi>lively images</hi> of himself, as if he had eyes for no other use but to look on them, and how his soul seems to be bound up with theirs! But while his sparkling eyes convey, and shoot all their rays on these Darlings of his affections, grim death, unmannerly as it is, a stranger to respect of persons, steps in, marrs all his triumphs, and snatches the Fondlings out of his hands.</p>
            <p>How have I seen a tender Mother carry her Babe in her arms, feed him with her breasts, dandle him in her lap, and embrace the comely boy with a love as strong as death, and which many waters cannot quench! she breeds him up, watches his steps, her eyes are over him, and like the Angels of God, she preserves him in all his ways, and with his age her affection grows, and she is concern'd for his welfare, she studies how to advance him, plots how to make him great, rejoyces to hear her Neighbours speak in commendations of him: And now the Lad being grown up, and understanding what the tenderness of a Mother means, the Mother justly expects some returns answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the mighty expressions of her love: but we see too often that when all these pains are taken, and all this industry and care is bestow'd, and the kind Mother hopes that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his love to her will be <hi>good measure press'd, and shaken together, and running over;</hi> behold the inhumane wretch, Viper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, preys upon the bowels that did feed and nourish him, grows surly to her that bare him, and it is not all her <hi>fire</hi> that can kindle any reciprocal <hi>flames</hi> in his breast; and thus he that was expected to have been her greatest <hi>comfort,</hi> proves her <hi>scourge,</hi> and the <hi>Staff</hi> that in her old age was to <hi>support</hi> her, turns into a <hi>Serpent</hi> to <hi>hiss</hi> at her, and to <hi>sting</hi> her. He whom she look'd upon as her <hi>glory,</hi> becomes her <hi>shame;</hi> and he whom once she did <hi>rejoyce</hi> in, brings her down with sorrow into her grave. And this it's like <hi>Eve</hi> had experienc'd in her eldest Son <hi>Cain,</hi> and therefore when <hi>Abel</hi> was born she call'd him <hi>vanity,</hi> for that's the true import of the name, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 2.</p>

               <hi>Augustus</hi> at last is forced to put that Daughter from his sight whom formerly he look'd upon with a favourable eye, and her lewdness makes him hate that name which once he delighted in. <hi>Absolom,</hi> formerly his Fathers Darling, at last invades his Crown and Scepter, and the indulgent Prince lives to see that Son he doted on, attempt his life, and defile his Bed. And suppose the kind Son with <hi>Coriolanus</hi> doth that for his Mother, which neither the Peoples <hi>tears,</hi> nor the Senators <hi>prayers</hi> could effect, and with <hi>Cotta</hi> rescues his Father from death, yet the losses,<note place="margin">Vid.

And thus these <hi>certain cares</hi> and <hi>uncertain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> by the instability and mutability of their condition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim to the world, that they are but Vanity.</p>
            <p>And having thus with as much brevity as the subject would bear, led you to a prospect of the vanity, the creature is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in, I must not dismiss you without some practical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.</p>
            <p>We see how necessary Illumination of Gods holy Spirit is in matters of Religion; without it the generality of men <hi>Ixion.</hi> like, embrace a Cloud for <hi>Juno,</hi> and are so far from seeing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the creature, that they do securely build <hi>Tabernacles</hi> here, and make the creature their highest and their chiefest good, which was only intended for <hi>stairs</hi> to raise them into contemplation of the glory, and goodness, and power of their Maker. This irradiation from above, the consequent of earnest prayers, clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the mind, dispels the clouds and mists that are upon it, teaches the Soul to examine the inside of things, as well as the outside, and by that means to discover the cheat, if there be any in the alluring object; and where this day-spring doth not visit the mind, men must necessarily continue in ignorance and folly, and call darkness light, and light darkness, and count that gold which is nothing but guilded brass, and look upon that as satisfactory to their souls, which indeed leavs them empty and destitute of proper food. It's for want of these beams, which he may be blessed withal, if he will but open the door, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99893:13"/>
let them in. It's for want of admitting these heavenly beams, I say, that the Drunkard, the Lascivious, the Proud, the Glutton laughs at the Preacher discoursing of vanity, because he sees not with our eyes, and his intellect is not so clear as ours; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thinks that <hi>vanity</hi> a fable: and how should he perceive it, whose eyes of understanding are not enlightned into contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation and observation of the nature, quality, imperfection, and insufficiency of all sublunary objects: So that we may speak our spirits away into the Air, and read all <hi>Solomon's Ecclesiastes</hi> to him, and we do but talk to him as we do to a blind man of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, he hears our notions, but like <hi>empty notions</hi> they go in at one ear, and out at another.</p>
            <p>Vanity, saith the Sinner! I know nothing that's more solid, more pleasing, or more charming, than those Riches, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Pleasures, and the other comforts you <hi>brand</hi> with an odious name. These are things I can grasp and feel, and I know the satisfaction they will afford, my eyes see how happy these things make the men that can creep out of dust, and advance themselves above the common Level; I have not seen that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Eternity you speak of, nor was I ever wrapt up with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> into Paradise; I never took a view of those spiritual Crowns and Scepters, you talk of. Shall I leave a certain satisfaction for I know not what? for a thing uncertain and out of sight? These outward conveniences I see must help me in distress; and if I hope for ease and content, it must arise from these. It's not a Notion I can feed upon; and I may starve if I have nothing but your spiritual food to rely on. It's the World, as you call it, that must refresh, maintain, and feed me: And it's but reason it should have my choisest thoughts and affections: And do you charge that with Vanity, which alone deserves my industry and care?</p>
            <p>And doest thou talk like a man of reason, Sinner? If a Beast could speak, would not this be his language? Hath God given thee no higher faculties? Hath not he endow'd thee with nobler desires? Are these o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99893:14"/>
a soul capable of grasping a God, and dost thou run into the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of an Idol? Thy soul wants an Everlasting object; and are these the things that will endure for ever? Thy soul must have an all-sufficient Being in her arms! and are these <hi>Butterflies,</hi> that perish in the handling, fit to ingross thy affections? Thy Soul must have an Anchor that can give it rest, and will these thorns and bryars do it? Thy Soul must have an individual companion that will never leave it nor forsake it, and will these deceitful props stand by it at the great Tribunal? Thy Soul must have a friend that must conduct it to Everlasting Mansions, and will these miserable comforters, that shake hands with it at the brink of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, serve for guides?</p>
            <p>Rouse, rouse thy slumbering Soul, vain Man, and let not thine eyes be always shut. Thy blindness is not incurable; if thou wilt not stand in thine own light, thou maist see through all these shadows, and burst these entanglements. There is certainly Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the Creature, and God will discover it to thee, if thou wilt but call upon him with the same earnestness that blind <hi>Bartimaeus</hi> used to Christ Jesus. God is pleased with the cry of him that longs to be deliver'd from his misery. O the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful difference that is betwixt an illuminated and darkned under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing! One <hi>pities</hi> the Creature, the other <hi>admires</hi> it; one looks upon it with <hi>tears</hi> in his eyes, the others heart <hi>leaps</hi> at the sight of it for <hi>joy;</hi> one <hi>uses</hi> it soberly, the other <hi>gluts</hi> himself with it; one sees so much of its weakness as <hi>drives</hi> him from this barren Wilderness to make his nest among the stars of Heaven, the other so <hi>adores</hi> its beauty that he can be contented to sweat and toil, and labour in its service for ever; one <hi>salutes</hi> it as a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the other <hi>embraces</hi> it as a wife; one <hi>looks</hi> beyond it, the other <hi>sixes</hi> his eyes upon it as if he were in an ecstasie.</p>
            <p>So great a difference doth Illumination make; and indeed without it, you must needs continue strangers to God's designs and your own duty; you walk in the dark and see not how the Devil imposes upon you, how your Lusts cheat you, and how the World cozens you, how far you run from Heaven, and how near the burning Lake you come; you run on blindly upon Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99893:14"/>
and delude your selves with a few formalities of Religion, you know not how the case stands betwixt God and your own souls, and cannot avoid falling into errors; you prepare for end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less sorrows, and make way for bitter, though vain lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at last: <hi>O that I had known in my day what belonged unto my peace! but it was hid from mine eyes:</hi> You delay your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, because you know not the great importance of it, and make light of that which, were your eyes but open'd, would make you tremble to think what pains you have taken to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure your own ruine.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Men, Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> If you do believe that the Creature is subject to Vanity, let me intreat you to act like men, that do believe it. Let your faith be known by your works, and let's but see you live like persons that do despise this Vanity and seek a better World. When the primitive Christians (O happy, O blessed times!) gave out that they look'd upon this World as vain and transitory, their enemies saw that they were in good earnest when they said so, for they saw them forget what was behind them, and press towards the mark for the high prize of God's calling in Christ Jesus. They saw it, and thought them mad. They saw how they fled from the satisfactions of this World into flames, as if those were the <hi>fiery chariots,</hi> they were proud to <hi>ride</hi> to Heaven in.</p>
            <p>Their faith lay not in talking, and as they believed the Creature to be subject to vanity, so they raised their thoughts from Earth to Heaven, and lived as much above the World as mortality would give them leave. They made no more of the honors and preferments of this life, when inconsistent with God's honor and a good conscience, than they did of glasses and rattles, and the Prince that offered them riches to be enamour'd with Vanity as much as he, was repuls'd this <hi>Heroick answer;</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer these things to Children, and not to Christians.</p>
            <p>They made their houses <hi>Oratories,</hi> and their dwelling-places were but so many Churches, where you might hear the praises of God resounding day and night. The husband-man that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd his Plough, fancied himself in Heaven, and sung Psalms
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99893:15"/>
as cheerfully as if he had been placed in the Quire of Angels: The injuries they suffer'd for the testimony of Jesus, they smiled at, and they that had an incorruptible Crown to look after, just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought it below them to be concern'd at the slanders and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of a poor envious World; as if Heaven had been the Countrey from which they had been banish'd, and which they hoped they should be shortly restored unto, they made all the provision they could for it, secured the riches of another World, and bestowed a great part of their goods on Christ's distressed members, because they knew they should find them again after a few years in Heaven: They believ'd Christ's promises, and looking upon him as the Son of God, they had as great a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that they should be recompenced in the Resurrection of the just, as if they had the reward already in their hands.</p>
            <p>They could keep a calm and serene mind under the wars and tumults of this world; and while men raged about them, they fed upon peace of conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost. They used the World as if they used it not, and one might see that they had practically learnt the great Lesson, <hi>You cannot serve God and Mammon.</hi> This Earth they looked upon as a <hi>desert,</hi> and their perpetual wishes were, <hi>When shall we come to appear before God in Sion!</hi> The great things of this World, which their Heathen neighbours magnified, they made light of; and well might they renounce the glories of this Earth, when they were assured from the Word of God that they had a greater inheritance laid up for them in God's Paradise. They regarded not the censures of their carnal friends and relations, and were contented to be made a spectacle to the World, and to Ange's, and to Men. They rejoyced when they could express their love to Christ, and were troubled when the World made any encroachment upon their affections. They denied themselves in all superfluities, that they might have the more to give to pious uses; nay, would not allow themselves conveniencies, that they might be in a better capacity to cloath the Naked. They stooped to the meanest offices, and were not ashamed to converse with men of the lowest rank, as with Brethren. They laid aside their <hi>grandeur,</hi> to obey
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99893:15"/>
the precepts of the Gospel, and would not suffer any outward respects to take them off from a close adherence to God's will. They would visit Hospitals, and with their own hands dress meat for them that lay upon the bed of Languishing. This World seem'd so contemptible to them, that they prayed day and night to be deliver'd from it; and it might be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said of them, that the World was <hi>crucified</hi> unto them, and they unto the World; And thus they despis'd the <hi>vanity</hi> of these sublunary objects, and by despising, <hi>believ'd</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Disparage not your great immortal Souls, Beloved Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; they are capable of another happiness than this World can afford; and when God hath provided for them Angels food, and bread of Heaven, why should you feed them with trash and husks to impoverish and weaken them for ever?</p>
            <p>Arise <hi>Christians,</hi> and depart, for here is not your Rest. Advance into yonder regions of Bliss, and live there where you may hope to live for ever. Let the World be your Slave, and God your only Master. Let it not be said that your Souls are subject to Vanity as well as your Bodies, and do something to convince the World that you dare to have your conversation in Heaven. The Creature was made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto Vanity, on purpose that you might flee away from it, and breath after a more solid good. Will you do less than Pagans? Will you fall short of Men that never heard the Gospel? Will you sink beneath those that never had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other light but what the glimmering Candle of Nature gave them? Can you see <hi>Philosophers</hi> contemn this Vanity, and dare you be in love with it? Shall a <hi>Diogenes,</hi> to shew how little these things, which sensual men admire, ought to be valued, take as much delight in his <hi>Tub,</hi> as <hi>Xerxes</hi> in his <hi>Babylon,</hi> and in <hi>dry bread,</hi> as much as <hi>Smindyrides</hi> in his <hi>sauces;</hi> in ordinary <hi>spring-water,</hi> as much as <hi>Cambyses</hi> in his <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher fountains;</hi> in common <hi>Sun-shine,</hi> as much as <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> in his <hi>purple;</hi> in his <hi>staff,</hi> as much as <hi>Alexander</hi> in his <hi>Spear;</hi> and in his <hi>Mallet,</hi> as much as <hi>Craesus</hi> in his <hi>treasures?</hi> Shall a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99893:16"/>
Pagan look on these outward glories as unworthy of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and will you suffer yours to be entangled with them? Shall a <hi>Plato,</hi> a <hi>Socrates,</hi> an <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> a <hi>Spartan,</hi> look upon these outward things as dross and dung, trample them under his feet, look upon them between anger and scorn, and think it below a Creature made after the image of God, to dote on Earth, and dust; and can you that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have <hi>learn'd Christ,</hi> and pretend to be followers of the humble self-denying <hi>Jesus,</hi> come behind Heathens, whom you call Blind and Wretched? Will not they be your Judges one day? Will not their temperance and abstinence condemn your greediness after these perishable objects? Will not they shame you, that did more by the <hi>strength of nature,</hi> than you with all the <hi>encouragements of the Holy Ghost?</hi> Will not this aggravate your neglect, and change your <hi>Rods</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scorpions?</hi> Will not this make your furnace hotter? Will not this fill your faces with greater confusion? Will God let your unprofitableness under the richest means of grace go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd? And doth the clearest manifestation of Heaven add no weight to your guilt and stubborness? If you turn the grace of God into wantonness, will God play with it, do you think, as you do?

Remember, Brother, and apply thy heart to him, who only intended this World for our Inn. Let not thy life be united to this bitter sweet, for it hath drawn in many; first jested with them, and then butchered them. If thy Soul can but come away from her prison, pure and undefiled, and reach the Mark, it's no great matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou diest on a Throne, or on a Dung-hill.</hi>

            <p>O Christians, delude not your own souls, God is resolved they shall be withdrawn from this world while you live here, or they shall never arrive to the inheritance of the Saints in light: God is resolved they shall be loosened from this Earth,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99893:16"/>
even in the midst of your strength, and health, and plenty, and liberty, or they shall never ascend his <hi>Holy Hill.</hi> Away then with those fond conceits that glue your hearts to things below. Let God be the great and dear object of your souls. Let the rivers of your delight run all into that <hi>Ocean.</hi> For him spend your strength, your labour, and your care. Make room for him in your hearts, and whatever hath had supremacy or priority there, pull it down, and shew it the ruler it must for the time to come obey. Breath after another Country where true and lasting pleasures are, where the presence of God makes hearts chearful, and ravishes souls for ever; where the society of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels gives content, and endless bliss shuts out all imperfection and vanity; and as they say of <hi>Boleslaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> that he used to wear his Fathers Picture in his bosom, and whenever he was to do any thing of moment, he pull'd out the Picture, lookt upon it, and begg'd of God that he might do nothing unworthy of so great, so good, so wise a Father: so you, let the <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip</hi> of that celestial Country hang always before your eyes, and whatever you are doing, whether you are rising or sitting down, whether you are walking or standing, whether you are travelling or conversing with men, still look upon that <hi>Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture,</hi> and let this be your resolution to do nothing unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that Heaven you are aiming at.</p>
            <p>And then when you come to die, and no friend, no relation, no acquaintance, no riches, no honours, no children can give you ease; this remembrance, that your mind hath been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to extricate it self from the <hi>vanity of the creature,</hi> and that you have lived like persons, that have indeed looked<note place="margin">

O Grave where is thy victory! But thanks be to God, that gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. <hi>The Creature is made subject unto vanity;</hi> but what shall we say to those, that subject the creature to greater vanity than
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99893:17"/>
ever it was condemn'd to. The Idolater, that melts his <hi>Gold,</hi> and makes a <hi>God</hi> of it, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Wilderness, breaks down the limits of that vanity, outdoes <hi>Adam</hi> that was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of it; nay, goes beyond the <hi>Judg,</hi> that doom'd that Gold to corruption. The Creatures labour under vanity enough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot serve us in that innocence and integrity we once stood in, but to abuse them, now they are under a state of misery, and to force them to serve us in our sins, is a bondage which will bear witness against the daring sinner in that day, when God shall judg the secrets of mens hearts by the Gospel of Jesus. Sinner, that wine thou abusest to besot thy understanding <hi>suffers violence</hi> from thee; thou dost <hi>ravish</hi> it serve thy lusts, and it groans as it were under thy oppression, and thou makest it vainer than Heaven ever made it. God made it serviceable to thy infirmity, and intended it as a remedy against the weakness of thy nature; but when thou swallowest it to destroy thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to throw down the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that which must guide thy actions, and shed discretion into thy speeches and converse; forcest it to make thee a beast, and leave nothing in thee but the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal part, indeed scarce to leave thee sense and appetite; thou dost offer greater insolence to it than <hi>Amnon</hi> did to <hi>Thamar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Surely every man is vanity,</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 11. But he that tempts his neighbour to run with him into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of riot, Makes him worse than vanity; the Adulterer and Fornicator, that is restless till he hath caressed his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, as he calls her, to consent to his folly; The ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion that solicits his associates to be lewd and prophane with him: such persons make the creature so vain, that a devout soul cannot but stand amazed at the enterprize: vain indeed, for they double and treble its misery; and he that entices his friend into sin, makes him besides his vanity a <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Devil.</hi> The man before this sin was born to trouble as the <hi>sparks fly upward,</hi> but the sin he is drawn into makes his burden greater, increases his load, and makes his <hi>pound</hi> of vanity, a <hi>talent,</hi> and as if his weakness and frailty here on earth were too little, sinks him into <hi>Hell,</hi> and as if the curse of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99893:17"/>
God of old were too light a punishment, makes him obnoxious to Gods everlasting malediction.</p>
            <p>And such men must necessarily be of the first form in the Devils Kingdom; for these make Devils, help to increase the number of the <hi>Fiends,</hi> and are <hi>Familiars,</hi> that make men sinck with them into endless torments.</p>
            <p>The Covetous, who confines his money to his Chest, and makes that lie still in his Coffers, which like <hi>blood</hi> should have its <hi>circulation,</hi> and as it is given him from <hi>Heaven,</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Heaven</hi> again by way of <hi>charity,</hi> and doing good, seems to be angry with God for giving that Creature so <hi>small a touch</hi> of vanity; and therefore as if God had not made it frail enough, makes himself Gods Officer, renders the <hi>Dye</hi> deeper, <hi>drowns</hi> it in misery, and inflicts vanity upon it with a witness, and Gods little finger he makes heavier than his loyns, for he <hi>wants</hi> in the midst of <hi>plenty,</hi> and is <hi>indigent,</hi> while he knows not how to consume that which he hath already: and this vanity increases if extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and oppression joyn with it, and tempt hm to wade through Orphans tears, and Widows blood, through the necessities of the Fatherless, and through the cries and lamentations of the needy, to make his heap much greater; and certainly, if the Creature is to be purged from its <hi>vanity by fire,</hi> it's but reason his body should be the fewel, who hath loaded the Creature with so much vanity and misery, and against Gods will and order too. His stripes will be iustly doubled, for his sin was so, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be punished, both for his <hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>disobedience.</hi> The Scripture excludes such men from the Kingdom of Heaven, and good reason, for they are so given to vanity, that they would attempt to make Gods <hi>Joys</hi> and <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> so.</p>
            <p>IV. In the <hi>vanity of the Creature,</hi> let us behold our own, and whenever we take a view of the decay of terrestrial glories, and see day <hi>die</hi> into night, and Summer into Winter, one hour, one moment into another, and herbs and plants shed their blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms, let us reflect upon our own death and departure hence. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> were in the right, when they defined <hi>Philosophy</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi> to be a <hi>Meditation of death.</hi> He that is frequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99893:18"/>
in such meditations, embitters his sensual delights, crushes his fondness of the world, dares not live in those sins which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men allow themselves in, and takes the readiest way to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come himself; for how should he be enamoured with earth that looks upon himself as leaving of it! and what delight can he take in the laughter of fools, or in jovial company, that expects every hour to be summon'd to the Bar of Christ! how should he set his heart upon his <hi>Farm</hi> and <hi>Oxen,</hi> that looks every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be call'd to give an account of his Stewardship, and knows not how soon the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Angels Trumpet</hi> will sound, and the Judg of Quick and Dead awaken the world with his thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring voice, <hi>Arise ye dead, and come to judgment.</hi> This even the Heathens were so sensible of, that the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as every man knows, had a <hi>Sceleton,</hi> or Death's head set on amidst their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est dainties, and at their greatest Feasts, to check vain mirth, and to put their Guests in mind, what they were shortly to come to. This made the Patriarchs of old dig their Sepulchers in their Gardens, while their glory was yet fresh in them, that neither the pleasure of a Garden, nor their business might take them off from a continual contemplation of mortality. This made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers order their Winding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>sheet to be carried before them; others command their Servants to call to them every night they went to bed, <hi>That their life was spent;</hi> for their going to sleep they looked upon to be but a kind of going to their Graves.</p>
            <p>And indeed he that thus thinks of death, cannot be surprized when it comes, for it is but what he look'd for, and when it knocks at his Chamber door he can let it in, and embrace it as a welcome Messenger with <hi>Simeon, Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. In the <hi>vanity of the Creature,</hi> let us take notice of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousness of sin, and it's large demeri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when God for mans sin hath subjected the Creature unto van<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y, it shews what an abhorrency he hath from sinful actions, and how displeased he is with transgression of his Laws, in that he confines not the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to Man alone, but extends it to the Creatures, or to his Servants too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:99893:18"/>To the generality of men sin seems but an inconsiderable thing, and they fancy God to be altogether such a one as themselves; they will not believe that sin hath that poison in it, which all true penitents find, nor that there is that Hell in it, when ever the Conscience awakes, which <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> found. They apprehend God childishly merciful, and because he knows their frame forsooth, that they are frail and weak, he cannot be angry with them for not observing his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions. They make him a Being without justice, and though they could wish he would revenge their quarrel, whenever they receive any signal affront of their neighbours, yet they would not have him revenge their ingratitude to him, and because they would not have him angry with them, therefore they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he will not; and from their loose behaviour infer his good nature, and please themselves with thinking that he will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look their wilful errors, because their nature abhors every thing that looks like pain and torment.</p>
            <p>But these fancies, Sinner, are so far from extenuating, that they but aggravate thy folly. Alas! it is not thy unwillingness to suffer that will allay Gods wrath, nor thy tenderness to thy self that will make him express less hatred and indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee. If unwillingness to endure pain were a sufficient bar to justice, what Malefactor would be put to death? and if this plea will not serve on Earth, sure I am it will be insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant in the Court of Heaven; and as light as sin seems now, there will a time come when it will be weightier than <hi>Rocks</hi> and <hi>Mountains.</hi> Though thou losest the sense of it, yet God doth not forget the dishonour done unto him by it; and when the monstrous load sunk the Son of God, and pressed him that was infinite into a sweat of blood, and made the immortal die: think what a pressure it will be for thy impenitent soul (for from such Christ hath not taken away Gods anger) when the whole burden shall be thrown upon thee at the Revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</p>
            <p>VI. Doth the whole Creation hope to be deliver'd from her bondage? Then lift up your heads, ye <hi>mourners of Sion,</hi> and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99893:19"/>
learn to imitate the Creature in its hope. Doth the Creation as it were support it self with this hope from sinking into its primitive <hi>Chaos,</hi> and cannot this hope of your everlasting deliverance keep your hearts from fainting under the darkest providence? <hi>Behold the Husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the Earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and the latter rain, Jac.</hi> 5. 7. You sow in tears now, the day will come when you shall reap in joy! It's but a little while, and he that shall come, will come: The hope of a Kingdom keeps a captive Prince from murmuring, and should not the hopes of that Kingdom which fades not away, <hi>bear</hi> up your spirits against despair? Have you fought the good fight so long, and will you give over now? Are you within reach of the Crown, and will you lay down your weapons? Are you within sight of the Haven, and will you suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer shipwrack? Behold that Jesus, who was dead and is alive, and is the King of the Princes of the Earth, is hastening to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue; you'll see him ere long coming in the clouds of Heaven, and all his holy Angels with him, your afflictions then will all be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into Eternal Freedom, your waters of <hi>Marah</hi> into rivers of delight, which make glad the City of God, your prison into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect liberty, your Lions Den into a Palace, your fiery Furnace into the light of God's countenance, your Dungeon into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, your poverty into plenty, your sickness into Eternal health, your losses into solid possessions, your shackles into kisses, your setters into the kindest embraces, your bryars into glory, your thorns into a Crown.</p>
            <p>O joyful day, when this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality, and your rags be changed into splendid robes! Who would not suffer a while to enter into that rest! Who would be afraid of being destitute, tormented, afflicted, when these storms are all to expire into Eternal Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine! <hi>The Spirit and the Bride, say, Come; and let him that hears, say, Come; Even so, Come Lord Jesus!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus led you from the <hi>Creature</hi> to the <hi>Creator,</hi> I must crave leave to lead you back again from the <hi>Creator</hi> to the <hi>Creature,</hi> viz. To the party deceased. And here I could wish
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99893:19"/>
I were able to give you that account of her Life and deportment, which in all probability you expect upon this occasion; But when I shall have told you, that it was not my happiness to be acquainted with her before she died, you'll soon pardon my silence in her Commendations; And yet I dare not be so injurious to her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, as to conceal the Character, which those that knew her intimately, were pleased to give of her. Her Piety it seems was great and early, and her Soul <hi>big</hi> with Devotion in an Age which is exposed to the greatest Temptations. What <hi>Solomon</hi> learn'd by sad experience in his latter years, she practised in the days of her youth; and the fear of God which he found to be the only true happiness, when he had run through all the risks of sin, she embraced before she had tasted any of the Worlds pleasures. She no sooner came to years of discretion, but she saw that her greatest interest lay in loving God, and understood that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member her Creator, before the evil days do come, was the greatest prudence and policy. As young as she was, her eyes were fix'd upon a better World, and it was hard to say which had her greatest care, God's glory, or her own Salvation. Her affection to Goodness appear'd in her, when Vice begins to flourish in other persons, and she began to shoot out buds of Grace, when others look upon't as a piece of necessity to run out into Sin and Vanity. The Word of God was the food, her Soul delighted in, and she thought no provision comparable to the Bread of Life, which feeds men into Eternal content and satisfaction. She had learn'd, that God was one that did hear Prayers, and to address her self to him, was not the least part of her employment. In these tender years she was already arriv'd to that knowledg, which Philosophers former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attained not unto, till they were grown aged, and was become Mistress of the greatest vertues at a time, when others are apt to laugh at strictness and severity as a mellancholy humor. She had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready learn'd to scorn reproaches for Righteousness sake, and did clearly apprehend that her greatest glory must be Religion and God's favour. At those years when others hardly know what Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven means, she had already felt it in her Soul, and she could guess at what Angels did above by her praising and magnifying the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99893:20"/>
beauty and bounty of her Maker. The fruits of the Spirit which are not seen in others before fifty, appeared in her at eighteen, and the joys of the Holy Ghost, which are not counted <hi>modish</hi> till fourscore, became familiar to her, as soon as her reason began to exert it self into action. She had already practised to lay up her treasure in Heaven, and as if she had foreknown her death, she made preparation for it at a time, when others make provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof.</p>
            <p>What would this Plant have come to, if it had grown up to its full height and stature, and how glorious would this Tree have been, if it had been permitted to spread its branches like the <hi>Cedars</hi> in <hi>Lebanon.</hi> She that did already, like <hi>Aarons rod,</hi> bud and blossom, and bear fruit; how rich would the fruit have been, if it had been warm'd some years longer by the Sun of Righteousness! But the flower was too costly for this valley of tears, and the soil here below too course for this curious Plant to thrive in; God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cropt it to transplant it into Paradise, and withdrew it from the eyes of men, because it was a fitter spectacle for Angels.</p>
