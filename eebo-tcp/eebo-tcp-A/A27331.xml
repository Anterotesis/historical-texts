            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>e not only a Wit above that, of most of your Sex; but a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Affability Extreamly Charming, and Engaging beyond Measure, and perhaps there are few to be found like you, that are so Eminent for Hospitallity, and a Ready and Generous Assistance to the distress'd and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent, which are Quallities that carry much more of Divinity with them, then a Puritanicall outward Zeal for Virtue and Religion.</p>
            <p>Our Author, Madam, who was so true a Judge of Wit, was (no doubt of it) satisfyed in the Patroness she had pitcht upon: If ever she had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for a Wit and Sense like yours 'tis now, to Defend this (one of the last of her Works) from the Malice of her Enemies, and the ill Nature of the Critticks, who have had Ingratitude enough not to Consider the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligations they had to her when Living; but to do those Gentlemen Justice, 'tis not (altogether) to be Imputed to their Critticism, that the Play had not that Success which it deserv'd, and was expected by her Friends; The main fault ought to lye on those who had the management of it. Had our Authour been alive she would have Committed it to the Flames rather than have suffer'd it to have been Acted with such Omissions as was made, and on which the Foundation of the Play Depended: For Example, they thought fit to leave out a Whole Scene of the <hi>Virginian Court of Judicature,</hi> which was a lively resemblance of that Country-Justice; and on which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended a great part of the Plot, and wherein were many unusuall and very Naturall J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>sts which would at least have made some sort of People laugh: In another Part of the Play is Omitted the appearance of the Ghost of the <hi>Indian King,</hi> Kill'd by <hi>Bacon,</hi> and tho' the like may have been Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in other Plays, yet I never heard or found but that the sight was very agreeable to an Audience, and very Awfull: besi des the Apparition of the Ghost was necessary, for it was that which struck a Terror

in the Queen, and fright'ned her from heark'ning to the Love of <hi>Bacon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it a horrid thing to receive the Caresses and Embraces of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Murderer: And Lastly, many of the Parts being false Cast, and given to those whose Tallants and Genius's suited not our Authors Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: These, Madam, are some of the Reasons that this Play was unsuccess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and the best Play that ever was writ must prove so: if it have the Fate to be Murder'd like this.</p>
            <p>However, Madam, I can't but believe you will find an hours diversion in the reading, and will meet with not only Wit, but true Comedy, (tho' low,) by reason many of the Characters are such only as our <hi>Newgate</hi> afforded, being Criminals Transported.</p>
            <p>This Play, Madam, being left in my hands by the Author to Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Publick, I thought my self oblig'd to say thus much in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and that it was also a Duty upon me to choose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
