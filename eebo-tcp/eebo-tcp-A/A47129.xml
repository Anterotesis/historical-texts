            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The Cauſeleſs Ground of Surmiſes, Jealouſies and unjuſt Offences removed, in a full clearing of faithful</hi> Friends, <hi>and a ſober vindication of my Innocency, and the</hi> Friends <hi>concerned with me; in relation to the late Religious Differences and Breaches among ſome of the People called</hi> QUAKERS <hi>in</hi> America.</head>
            <p>I <hi>Tenderly intreat and deſire that none apply, or conſtrue any Words contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe following, Lines, as intended by me in way of Reflection, Blame or Charge, againſt either the Body of Friends in general, or any particular Meeting, or Meetings of Friends in particular, or againſt any ſingular, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friend or Friends whatſoever; being only a full Clearing of Faithful Friends, and a ſober Vindication of my Innocency, and Chriſtian Testimony, freely recommended to the tender Conſciences of ſuch as may read them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Find weighty Concern upon me to publiſh this following <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to ſilence and remove theſe evil Surmiſes, Jealouſies and unjuſt Offences taken both againſt many faithful <hi>Friends</hi> in general, and <hi>Me</hi> in particular, upon the Miſconſtructions, and Miſapplications that ſome have made of ſome Paſſages in my late Printed Books.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place I cannot but greatly blame them, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed diverſe of my late Books, with other Titles than the Titles firſt given them, as <hi>An account of the Diviſions among the Quakers in</hi> Penſilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, <hi>A further Account of the Diviſions among the Quakers in</hi> Penſilvania: And to a ſmall Treatiſe of mine concerning the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> this new Title is given, <hi>The Chriſtian Quaker, or</hi> George Kieth<hi>'s eyes opened,</hi> as if the Name <hi>Chriſtian Quaker</hi> were peculiar to me and ſome few others cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers</hi>; or as if I had been formerly Blind till of late days, both which I diſown, for whatever I have delivered in any of my late Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Books, touching either <hi>the Reſurrection of the Dead,</hi> or any other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtian Doctrine; it hath been my Faith ever ſince I came among the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> which is upwards of thirty Years paſt,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52475:2"/>
and it is my charitable ſincere Perſuaſion, that the worthy Name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> doth truly belong to very many of that People as well as unto me, having an experimental Proof, through intimate converſation, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent verbal Communication with many of them, that they are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in the Chriſtian Faith, and whoſe Life and Converſation doth Seal unto the ſincerity of their Chriſtian Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>And whereas it hath been ſaid, that I have Printed ſeveral Books againſt the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> charging them with holding and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more damnable Hereſies and Doctrines of Devils, than any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Profeſſion would tollerate, I anſwer, a great ſearch having been made by many into all my Printed Books, it hath not been found; and I ſay, it is not to be found, that any where in all my Books I have charged the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> either in general, or in the plurality, with any ſuch thing. And by a Manuſcript given forth by ſome of them that ſo charged me, it is made apparent, that I charged but a few, and theſe few did not at moſt exceed thirteen when I did ſo charge them. And that my innocency may appear in this Matter, I need but recite ſome of the printed Paſſages in my late Books, where I am ſo far from charging the People call'd <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, or the Body of them, that I purpoſely, and with great care and induſtry have cleared them; ſee for this in the Book call'd <hi>Some Reaſons and Cauſes of the late Separation, pag.</hi> 17. <hi>l.</hi> 14. where I ſay, <hi>That we remain in dear unity with the Body of our faithful Friends, all of them, in all parts of the World,</hi> and p. 23. <hi>l.</hi> 13. of the ſame Book, <hi>We declare we are one with our faithful Brethren, in all parts of the World, both in Spirit, Doctrine and Practice of true Chriſtianity: And we faithfully believe that our Faith in all things doth well agree to all our faithfull Brethren everywhere, and is the real, ſound and upright Faith, as it hath been received, not only by ancient Chriſtians in all Ages of the World, but alſo by the most ſound, ancient, and preſent Friends of Truth, called in ſcorn</hi> Quakers. Divers other Paſſages of the like nature might be cited out of my late Books, but these may ſuffice at preſent, and it is greatly to be noticed, that notwithſtanding the objections and ſevere Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ſome have made againſt my late Books, as being hurtful to Truth and Friends of it, and giving advantage and ſtrength to Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of Truth; Yet after great ſearch into my Books, and a ſtrict Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of them, by ſome that have ſo complained, there is not any Line or Sentence in any of them, that they have made to appear to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any untruth or falſhood in them, either in matter of Doctrine or Fact: And as I have told them, and anſwered divers times, Generals prove nothing, it is not enough to ſay <hi>my Books have done hurt,</hi> unleſs they can inſtance particular Untruths or Falſhoods in them of Doctrine or matter of Fact, which they have not done. I have alſo deſired them
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52475:2"/>
who have ſo charged me, to diſtinguiſh betwixt a proper and accidental Cauſe of an effect; as even ſome of them have been put ſo to diſtinguiſh, with reſpect to ſome of their own Writings, an evil uſe being made of them, by ſome ill minded men. I have granted that ſome of my late Books might have been an improper and accidental cauſe of Hurt and Grief to Friends, and of ſtrengthening Adverſaries, but unleſs it can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that they are the proper and direct <hi>Cauſe of ſuch Effects,</hi> which hath not been proved, it doth not follow, that they are to be blamed; for as they might have been the improper and accidental Cauſe of Grief to ſome, ſo as can well be proved, they have been of great ſervice to many, yea to Hundreds of <hi>Friends,</hi> which they have acknowledge: and have ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified their great ſatisfaction and joy, that God had raiſed me up, and ſome others with me, <hi>to appear in a zealous, plain and clear teſtimony to thoſe great Truths of Chriſtianity, plainly aſſerted in my late Books,</hi> and in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe vile and groſs Errours boldly aſſerted by ſome, that went under the ſame outward denomination: And as this hath had a Service to many ſincere hearted Friends of the ſame profeſſion with us, who have bleſſed God, on our behalf, for his giving us Zeal and Courage to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in ſuch a publick Teſtimony to theſe great Truths of Chriſt that had been as it were buried in ſilence by ſome, and oppoſed by others; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving and raiſing up of which, God was pleaſed to ſhow me in a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Viſion, and that he would make me an Inſtrument thereof, with ſome others concerned, for which, and for all his other great Mercies, I deſire for ever to praiſe him, ſo it hath had a great Service to many of almoſt all other <hi>Profeſſions</hi> who had been jealous of us, and did frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſe us in general, <hi>as being unſound, touching theſe great Truths of the Chriſtian Doctrine and Faith, who are now in great meaſure ſatisfied,</hi> and on that account their Love and Charity is the more extended towards us, which I am well perſwaded will, by the <hi>Bleſſing of God,</hi> be made a means to many of them to bring them nearer to us, and to open their <hi>Hearts</hi> to <hi>receive our Teſtimony,</hi> in what we have from God, to declare unto them for their good: And many of all ſorts that frequent our Meetings, of other Profeſſions, are well affected with our Teſtimony, to the inward appearance of God and Chriſt, together with the holy Spirit in Mens hearts, wh<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

But if any ſhould go about to cover, cloak or excuſe theſe Errours, or any Guilty of them, and neglect to paſs a due cenſure upon them, after due notice given them, they are in ſo far chargeable with them. And therefore, that I and others joined with me in our late Printed Teſtimonies, might be clear of the Guilt of theſe Errours, and of ſuch as did hold them, we did find our ſelves weightily concerned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in ſuch a publick Teſtimony, to the Honour of <hi>God</hi> and his dear Son <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and the peace of our Conſciences, and alſo to the clearing of <hi>faithful Friends</hi> every where, and for the credit of our Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was our ſincere intention to remove all offences and Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-Blocks out of the way, as we have plainly declared in our Printed Treatiſe, called <hi>

But it is ſtrange to us, that our faithful and zealous witneſſing for the <hi>Truth,</hi> and againſt Errour, ſhould be conſtrued to be to the reproach of Truth and Friends of it: doth one contrary produce naturally another, or doth Truth produce Errour? if nay, no more can our zealous Teſtimony to Truth, produce the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reproach upon Truth and the Friends of it; or rather, is it not more apparent, that to paſs by in ſilence, without any cenſure or publick Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, groſs and vile Errours (ſome of which not only no Proteſtant Profeſſion would tollerate, but even the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would not tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate, but publickly Judge and Condemn) doth bring a Reproach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Truth and Friends thereof, and doth open the Mouths of Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to reproach us, as being guilty of cloaking ſuch groſs Errours amongſt us, for if we are guilty of blame for expoſing theſe mens groſs Errours (after due Goſpel order uſed towards them, as hath been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved out of our late Printed Books, and great endeavours uſed to reclaim them, convince them, and better inform them, which they have rejected, and notwithſtanding their Scripture Confeſſions ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in their Errours, as I have made appear out of their own Papers and Manuſcripts, ſigned with their own hands, ſince their pretended <hi>Scripture Confeſſion,</hi>) what is the Conſequence that many will make from this, but that to paſs by in ſilence, cover and cloak ſuch vile and groſs Errours among us, and to leſſen and extenuate them, with the ſmooth names of Weakneſs, is eſteemed a Virtue by us, but let it be far from us, to give any ſuch occaſion of Argument againſt us.

And if that particular Meeting or Aſſembly that they belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, paſs no due cenſure againſt them, the Errours and defaults of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars are juſtly imputed to the particular <hi>Meeting</hi> or <hi>Aſſembly</hi> they belong unto, as we have largely proved both from <hi>Scripture</hi> and large Citations out of <hi>R.

            <p>Next as to the Separation (which ſome charge the blame of upon us, and lay at my door, and them joined with me, in our zealous <hi>Chriſtian Teſtimony for theſe great Truths of Chriſtianity, and againſt the oppoſite Errours</hi>) as ſetting up <hi>Separate Meetings</hi> in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> or any where elſe in <hi>America.</hi> It hath not been proved againſt us by any ſufficient Evidence, nor can it be proved that either we <hi>began it,</hi> or <hi>continued it</hi>; for the firſt <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Meeting at Philadelphia, we began it not,</hi> but they of the other ſide, as I have made to appear before many Witneſſes: And there was no other <hi>Separation</hi> or <hi>Separate Meetings</hi> amongſt us any where in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> or elſewhere, until I, and they concerned with me in our <hi>Chriſtian Teſtimony</hi> were denyed and diſowned by them of the other ſide, by <hi>a publick Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given out againſt us,</hi> and me in particular, ſigned by twenty eight Men, called <hi>Miniſters</hi> and that without all Conviction or Tryal: And after this I and other Friends of the Miniſtry joined with me, proffering <hi>to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our Gift among them,</hi> were univerſally rejected, and diſowned by a Party in theſe parts, which many <hi>Friends</hi> ſeeing and noticing did oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion them to own us and our <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> and thus the breach happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in many <hi>Meetings.</hi> But had we made the <hi>Separation,</hi> we had been warranted ſo to do both by <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>the expreſs Doctrine of R.B. his Book above mentioned,</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi> 33, 49, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which I refer, and to the particular large Citations quoted, and Obſervations thereupon in the Printed Treatiſe, called <hi>Some Reaſons and Cauſes of the late Separation.</hi> and it had been but reaſonable and convenient for ſuch as have ſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively blamed me and them concerned with me, both <hi>for the Printing and the Separation to have anſwered our Reaſons from Scripture, and R. Barclays Book in our Vindication, and to have ſhown the Invalidity of them, and alſo to have given us plain Reaſons and Proofs from Scripture, whereby to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> convince us of Sin, and that we were not acted in Gods Wiſdom and Counſel therein,</hi> which they have not yet done, and until they ſo do, we muſt crave leave to differ in our Judgment from them in this particular Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though we deſire to remain in <hi>Love and Charity towards them,</hi> and in <hi>unity with the Faithful in the main every where</hi>; for they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us by ſtronger and better <hi>Arguments,</hi> than to ſay, <hi>It is their clear and general Senſe.</hi> (But we do well know it is not the <hi>General Senſe of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52475:4"/>
Friends to blame us</hi>) for we are well perſwaded, that no <hi>Divine Senſe ever will or can contradict, or condemn what plain Scripture Precepts and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies do juſtify,</hi> as in the preſent Caſe we have, as alſo the <hi>Example of our ancient Friends,</hi> who have Printed againſt leſſer Errours in others, who differed from them, and have alſo <hi>Separated from them,</hi> though thereby <hi>Papiſts</hi> have been gratified, and Gloried over all <hi>Proteſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions</hi> in general, and have ſtrengthened themſelves thereby, as much as any have againſt us by our late Printed Books, and have ſaid, <hi>Lo how Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, ſince they have left the Mother Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>have gone into endleſs Separations, and expoſe one another, and contend againſt one another, ſeeking to deſtroy one another by their endleſs Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and thereby concluding, that neither their Printing againſt others Errours, nor the <hi>Separation of one from another,</hi> or from the <hi>Church of Rome, <hi>is of God,</hi>
               </hi> or is acted in the Wiſdom and Conſel of God, as ſome do ſo Argue againſt us. But if they know how to anſwer the <hi>Papiſts Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in this Caſe againſt themſelves, they may know how to anſwer the like Arguments againſt us.</p>
            <p>And as concerning <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> we greatly value it, to wit, <hi>that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity that is built on Truth and Righteouſneſs</hi> (without which <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> is but an empty name and an Idol,) and when we are agreed in the main, ſo as to be one in the principal things of <hi>Faith and Doctrine,</hi> and feel the Spirit of Life and Love in Chriſt Jeſus to knit our hearts together, A difference of Judgement in leſſer Matters ſhould not break out Unity, and without breach of Unity we ought to bear and receive the Word of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> or reproof that any have from the Spirit of Truth to deliver unto us, without gainſaying, ſtrife or alienation of mind.</p>
            <p>As to the Charge of ſome concerning <hi>Falſhood</hi> of Doctrine, or innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Doctrine brought in by me or others joined with me; they who have ſo charged us, being moſtly convinced of their raſhneſs, proceeding from their own Ignorance and miſtakes, I ſhall not need to ſay any thing for our Vindication<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the more judicious and underſtanding among us, both of the Miniſtry and others, being generally ſatisfied with the <hi>Manner of Doctrine held forth by me,</hi> either in my late Printed Books, or publick Aſſemblies of the People called <hi>Quakers.</hi> And as to the charge of my impoſing a Faith upon my Brethren in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> or elſewhere, in my own Terms, I have ſufficiently cleared my Innocency in that reſpect, and none have yet ſufficiently proved it againſt me, nor ever will be able ſo to do. I know no Terms of mine, that I ever uſed in Faith and Doctrine, I am no Inventor of any new Words, or Terms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well ſatisfied with <hi>the ſound Words</hi> uſed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and other Words and Terms uſed (in the ſavory Life and Spirit of Chriſt in Harmony with the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi>) by all ſound Chriſtians in all Ages in General
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52475:5"/>
and faithful Friends of the ſame Profeſſion with me in particular. And as for that called <hi>An account of our ſincere Faith,</hi> writ by me, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> by the general conſent and requeſt of <hi>Friends</hi> joined with me, in theſe <hi>American</hi> parts; received by the general conſent of ſome <hi>Meetings</hi> of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> there, and by the general conſent of that called <hi>our Yearly Meeting,</hi> held at <hi>Burrlington</hi> 7<hi>th</hi> of Month 7: 1692. I ſay, I never impoſed that Form of Confeſſion, on any there, or elſewhere in the World, but am fully ſatisfied, that if any here, or there ſee not fit to declare their <hi>Faith,</hi> in that form of Words as there declared, they may exerciſe their <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> to uſe any other terms or words, that the Spirit of Truth furniſheth them withal, or giveth them liberty to make uſe of out of <hi>the Holy Scriptures,</hi> for the <hi>Faith</hi> may be one and the ſame received and confeſſed by many thouſands, and yet not the ſame Forms and Words uſed by them all, but all theſe Words and Forms will have the ſame ſenſe and ſignification, and be of the ſame importance, if the Faith be one, and the Spirit be one in them all. But that ſome Principles and Doctrines, and Points of Faith are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be agreed upon, together with the practices neceſſarily depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereupon, and to be owned, profeſſed and declared by us, to be as it were, the <hi>Terms that draw us together, and the Bond by which we be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>come centred into one Body and Fellowſhip, and diſtinguiſhed from others,</hi> yet not this ſo the Bond, but that we have a more inward and inviſible, to wit, the Life of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is the expreſs <hi>Doctrine and Teſtimony</hi> of R. <hi>Barclay</hi> his Book above mentioned, <hi>pag.</hi> 48. And whether <hi>Friends</hi> do not make ſome Principles and Doctrines of Faith, yea, and leſſer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, (called by ſome, <hi>The form of Truth,</hi>) as plain Language and plain habit, refuſing to <hi>Salute with the Hat and Knee,</hi> and ſome <hi>Matters belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Church Diſcipline,</hi> as <hi>Mens and Womens Meetings, Terms of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> I appeal to all intelligent <hi>Friends.</hi> And how it is that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt neceſſary <hi>Articles of the Chriſtian Faith,</hi> profeſſed and owned by us, and declared to be neceſſary to be owned, profeſſed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by us, (as that <hi>
                  <hi>Faith in the Man Chriſt as he dyed for our Sins and roſe again,</hi> is neceſſary to our Chriſtianity, Regeneration, Sanctification, Juſtification, and Eternal Salvation,</hi> as well as to believe <hi>the Inward Appearance of God and Chriſt,</hi> by his <hi>Grace, Light, Life and Spirit in our Hearts,</hi> and that therefore none is a true and perfect Chriſtian in kind and Nature, without this Faith, and that we muſt not place our whole Salvation upon any Light, Gift or Grace within us, ſo as to ſay it is ſufficient to Salvation, without any thing elſe, as ſome have ſaid, thereby to exclude <hi>the Man Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> in whom the fulneſs of Grace and Truth dwelleth, and of whoſe fulneſs we receive,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52475:5"/>
and Grace for Grace, even every new and freſh Supply and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of more Grace, with many other the greateſt and moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <hi>Articles of the Chriſtian Faith,</hi>) muſt be called Impoſition, and refuſed to be Terms of our <hi>Communion,</hi> and yet far leſs Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, (as theſe abovementioned, of Plain Language, Habit, Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mens and Womens Meetings) muſt be made ſuch Terms of Communion, ſo as to exclude them by ſuch a ſevere Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, as not to own them to be in Unity with us, and yet allow them to be in Unity with us, that may differ from us in great and weighty Matters of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> for ought we know, if they have but the Policy to conceal their unbelief, or if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it as ſome have done, to call it but a Weakneſs, whereas to deny or oppoſe the other leſſer things abovementioned, is not reckoned by many a Weakneſs, but ſuch a Matter as for which a Man is Worthy to be denyed, for my part, I ſee not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of theſe things, and ſo I Judge, nor do many more. And whereas ſome have charged me with Impoſition, for modeſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting a Paper, called <hi>Goſpel Order and Diſcipline improved,</hi> &amp;c. ſome years ago, to the Yearly Meeting at <hi>Burlington in Weſt Jerſey,</hi> delivered only by way of Propoſition and Query, being read in the hearing of many Witneſſes very lately) I ſee not why any ſhould call it an Impoſition, which is only propoſed by way of Query, and was never urged or preſſed by me at any time; but the Paper it ſelf is ſo fair and innocent, and ſo free of any thing that looks like Impoſition, that ſeveral Friends that have ſeen and heard it read, are well affected with it, and do wiſh that Friends might find it convenient to practice the things therein mentioned, they being generally agreeable to <hi>Scripture,</hi> and well Warranted by either General or Particular Precepts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be called Impoſition. And whereas ſome through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and ſhortneſs of underſtanding, have blamed ſome of the ten Articles or Heads of Doctrine, having this Title, ſome of our Principles to which if ye agree (lately read before many Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but no ways contradicted) I have in readineſs to Print a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of <hi>Testimonies</hi> out of <hi>Friends Printed Books,</hi> to prove every one of theſe ten Articles, (as well as I have elſewhere proved them out of the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi>) divers of which have been ſo much oppoſed by ſome, and queſtioned by others; and ſeing there hath
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52475:6"/>
been of late ſo much querying about Principles by ſome. Is it not high time that by the general Conſent, Advice and approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moſt judicious, wiſe and underſtanding of Friends now alive, all the moſt neceſſary Principles and Doctrines of our Faith, both common and peculiar, ſhould be publiſhed and made known, for the great good, Service and benefit of Men in General, as well as for the Good of Us and our Poſterity in particular; that in our univerſal and harmonious Teſtimony both with the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and with ſound Chriſtians in all <hi>Ages,</hi> and with one another, the Poſterity that is to come after us and our Children that are grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, may have the benefit thereof, and thereby have occaſion to bleſs God on our behalf. And alſo, that whatever weak and unſound or unjuſtifiable Expreſſions, Sayings or Paſſages are to be found in any Books among us that have happened through humane weakneſs, or inadvertency, that are offenſive and ſtumbling to other Profeſſions, and hurtful to the Weak among our ſelves may be Noted, Corrected and amended, without partiality and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Perſons, and in ſo doing we ſhall not only ſhow our Love to <hi>Truth,</hi> but alſo to thoſe Men, not by cloaking, but by amending what is amiſs in them, which is the beſt way of cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, (as God covereth us when he amendeth and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth us) after the worthy Example of them that have been the Succeſſors of thoſe called Fathers in the Church, ſince the Apoſtles dayes, who having highly eſteemed and loved them for their Works ſake, yet have corrected their Errours impartially, having in ſo doing imitated the Example of Bleſſed <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> who <hi>taking a Garment went backward and covered their Fathers Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as concerning the Advice given me by ſome to retract the bitter or ſevere Language that I have given to ſome of my oppoſers, in ſome of the late Printed Books, which advice they gave with telling me, and many others, that I have confeſſed my human Imperfections and Paſſions: to this I anſwer, ſome who have ſo adviſed me, ſhould give me their good Example, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting their much more bitter Language, and more hard and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Names they have given to ſome who have differed from them in leſs Matters. But why do they not give the ſame advice to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52475:6"/>
my Oppoſers, who have far exceeded me, as appeareth by their three Judgements, and other their Papers and Manuſcripts againſt me. As alſo, why do they adviſe me to call in my Printed Books, and yet give them of the other ſide no advice to call in their falſe Judgements given out againſt me, without all Conviction, Hearing or Tryal. However let them particularly tell me what the hard Words are, that I have given to any that I cannot prove to be due unto them, and I ſhall yield to their Advice. And as to my confeſſing my <hi>Humane Imperfections,</hi> it is not well ſo to glory over me, and thereby to leſſen my Reputation and Chriſtian Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony among <hi>Friends,</hi> while they are ſilent wholly of ſome of their own far greater Imperfections and paſſionate behaviour uſed towards me, before many Witneſſes. I Judge it is more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and a greater Argument of a Mans grouth towards Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to achnowledge his ſinful Infirmities in the ſight of God or men, and to be humbled under the ſenſe of them, than like the proud <hi>Phariſee</hi> to juſtifie ones ſelf, when he may be, and is really guilty of greater Evils. But as I have again and again ſaid unto them, <hi>For my inward Defects and Infirmities I am only accountable unto God, whoſe tender Mercies and Forgiveneſs for Christs ſake, I have hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſought and obtained, and have a firm Faith and Hope in due time to overcome them all, and be made more than a Conquerour through him that hath loved me, but to Men I am only accountable for my Words and Deeds</hi>; and as I have not acknowleged unto any (nor ſeen juſt cauſe ſo to do) ſo they have not proved me guilty of either Words or Deeds, that the Truth condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in relation to theſe Matters, whereof ſome have accuſed me; and it is not well to miſconſtrue my ſincere and Godly Zeal, in my boldly and ſharply reproving groſs and vile Errours, as well as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Practices, and to call it paſſion, ſinful anger and wrath, but it is a ſmall thing for me to be Judged of Men, ſeeing he that Judgeth me is the Lord, whoſe Peace, Love, Favour and Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to the main I enjoy, to my <hi>unſpeakable comfort,</hi> ſtrength and ſupporting, who knoweth the Righteouſneſs of my Cauſe, and the ſincerity of my heart, whatever humane Weakneſſes have atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me, which are greater and more in ſome that do ſo accuſe me, though they have neither the ſincerity nor humility to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52475:7"/>And laſtly as to that adviſe given me by ſo me to labour to make up the bleach that is already made among them called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> in theſe <hi>American</hi> parts, I hope I ſhall endeavour it, but it can never effectually be done but in Truths Way, and on Truths Terms; and they who ſo adviſe me ſhould adviſe and admoniſh them of the other ſide, that they call in the many falſe Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments given out againſt me, from divers Provinces in <hi>America,</hi> without all Hearing, Tryal or Conviction, and particularly that of the 28 falſe Judges from <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> which is the rotten Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis and Foundation of all the reſt, and which was given out againſt me, without all Hearing, Conviction or Tryal; and alſo they ſhould adviſe them to give out a Teſtimony, aknowleging their Errour, firſt in giving out a Proclamation againſt me, ſigned by <hi>S.J.</hi> and others of their Miniſtry and Elders, which they cauſed to be cry'd againſt me, by the Common Cryer at the Market place in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> without all Conviction or Tryal, contrary to the Fundamental Laws of all Nations, to the danger of my Life, as well as of my Reputation, wherein they charge me with Words in a Printed Sheet called <hi>an Appeal having a tendency to Sedition, and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the peace and ſubverſion of the (then) preſent Government in Penſilvania,</hi> (but I produced a Certificate ſigned by the deputy Governour and Conſul of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> clearing me of all theſe Charges, and amply declaring my Innocency, and Peaceable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards the Government, and them in Authority at that time, which was Solemnly read before many Witneſſes of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that gave great content) and all this only for aſſerting, or rather Querying concerning the Inconſiſtency of the late Practices of ſome of them, with the profeſſed Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the People called in ſcorn <hi>Quakers</hi> in theſe parts, as did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently appear, when ſolemnly read before many Witneſſes, with my anſwer to the ſaid Proclamation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in Fining <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Budd</hi> and me, each of us Five Pounds a piece, for Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>S.J.</hi> his pride, in our juſt Defence in anſwer to his falſe defamatory Judgment againſt us, ſaying concerning him, that <hi>He was too high and Imperious both in Friends Meetings and Wordly Courts,</hi> and of <hi>His being an Ignorant, Preſumptuous and Inſolent Man,</hi> which laſt Words did no wiſe reſpect his Magiſtracy, but

his being a <hi>Minister,</hi> and by profeſſion, one called a <hi>Quaker,</hi> which I do declare we did Conſcientiouſly, and have ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved to be true, and is but too well known to be true a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Neighbourhood in that part of the World, and which he did moſt palpably diſcover (when going out of the Court, where we were Fined for reproving his Pride) in the <hi>high Street,</hi> to the obſervation and hearing of divers honeſt perſons that have atteſted it, ſtretching out his hand, he ſaid to ſome of our Friends that were expoſtulating the caſe with him, <hi>If I draw forth my hand, I will not pull it in again until I have quelled you all</hi>; as alſo for his Committing to Priſon two Friends of truth, for uttering or publiſhing the ſaid Printed Sheet, called <hi>An Appeal</hi>; now if this be not impartially cenſured and judged, and that he, without giving any publick Teſtimony of his Repentance, and owning his Iniquity in theſe matters, be permitted or allowed to Preach and Pray in Meetings, after ſolemn Complaint hath been made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in an orderly way; what will the People in <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſay, who have formerly Perſecuted our Friends there; and what will others ſay, that have freſh in Memory the frequent Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries and Complaints of Friends againſt Perſecution in former days; and how oft have many Friends both in Print and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reproved the Pride, and Imperious behaviour of Magiſtrates in former days, and yet we find not, that the Magiſtrates have Perſecuted any, by Fining or Impriſoning them for ſo ſaying or Printing, nor do we find it in any Law, either in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi>; that it is Penal to call a Juſtice of Peace, <hi>High</hi> or <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> eſpecially when he is not in the exerciſe of his Office, and when our Complaint hath been made in an orderly way, againſt the ſaid <hi>S.J.</hi> and the Record of the Court produced and read in their hearing, and ſigned with the Clarks own hand, the verity of which <hi>S.J.</hi> denied not; why ſhould any put it off with ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Legality or Illegality of theſe Proceedings, according to Men, it appeareth not proper for them to meddle with; but ſince they have greatly medled with the illegality, and arbitrary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of other Courts, againſt the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

of the Proceedings of that Court in <hi>Penſilvania</hi>; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>S.J.</hi> being perſonally preſent before them when complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt. If it be ſaid, what they did, they did by a Law, as that Law has not been, nor can be produced, ſo it will be ſaid, that they in <hi>New-England</hi> had a Law when they put our Friends to Death, and the Jews ſaid, they had a Law, when they put our Bleſſed Saviour to Death. But if they do not think it proper to meddle with the illegality of theſe Proceedings as to Men why do they not at leaſt meddle with the illegality of it, as to God, and Truth and Righteouſneſs, to remove the Scandal and offence out of the Minds and Conſciences of Many tender Friends that are greatly wounded and ſcandaliſed to hear <hi>S.J.</hi> Preach and Pray in the Meetings of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and to be Countenanced and allowed ſo to do, without his having given the leaſt evidence of his Repentance for thoſe Evils; whereas for much leſſer matters men have been diſowned, and a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Writ given out, and Recorded againſt them, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in order to make up the Breach in <hi>America,</hi> and to prevent any hurt here, they ought to paſs an expreſs Cenſure and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon all and every one of theſe groſs and vile Errors that I have proved divers of them guilty of in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> by Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, and Papers ſigned with their own hands, and to procure the perſons guilty of theſe Errors, to Condemn them, otherwiſe not to own them as Friends and Brethren. And whereas ſome ſay, wherein <hi>G.

I Anſwer, And ſo I hope I do, towards them, and all Men who have wronged me; yet doth, or can my ſo doing clear <hi>S.J.</hi> (and his Brethren) who have ſo apparently Injured me without his and their Repentance? And if this be the Method and way to anſwer all the Complaints of Injur'd and Oppreſſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who cry and complain againſt the Injuries and Oppreſſions done to them, and lay it before Meetings, appointed for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Church Diſcipline, who profeſs to hear and judg impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in all caſes of Complaint, to tell them, they muſt exerciſe a Spirit of Forgiveneſs towards them, whom they apprehend to have wronged them, without requiring the perſons that have done
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52475:8"/>
the wrong, to clear themſelves by ſome Teſtimony of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; then why is it, that in all other, or moſt caſes of leſs Importance, they require them that are Guilty, to Write Papers of Condemnation, that they may be Recorded for the clearing the Truth; yea, what need of any Meetings for Diſcipline at all, if this method and way take place, to tell them that are wronged, they muſt exerciſe a Spirit of forgiveneſs towards ſuch who have wronged them, without either giving due Judgment againſt the Guilty, or requiring them to Judg themſelves for the ſame, or if they give any Judgment againſt them, yet in ſuch a manner, as without any publick Teſtimony of their Repentance, to allow and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance them as Brethren, and in unity with them.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould any repreſent me as the provoker, and them as the provoked? Where as the plain Contrary is true, that the Provocation began on their ſide, and what I ſaid of <hi>Samuel Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi> or any of them, was in defence of my Chriſtian Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Innocency.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Declare my real and ſincere Intention to remain in unity with all faithful friends and Brethren every where, and to continue to meet with them, and to exerciſe my gift of Miniſtry among them, as God ſhall be pleaſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me in a Spirit of Love and Peace, ſo long as I can have the free Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of my gift among them, without interruption or diſturbance, as it is not my purpoſe, nor hath it been my way, nor I hope ſhall it be, to uſe any interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diſturbance towards any, but to behave my ſelf orderly and peaceably to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all; and I would have none to entertain Jealouſies and evil thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me, as if I did deſign any breach among faithful friends, having ſo long

laboured for <hi>30</hi> years paſt in the work of the Miniſtry, by preaching and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and God having bleſt my Labours with great ſucceſs, in being an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the bringing many into the bleſſed unity and fellowſhip with his Spirit, and one with another in the ſame, and my Love remaining intire towards many, and their Love ſo remaining towards me; why ſhould any be jealous over me, as if I did intend a breach among the faithful, or to ſcatter what I have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring with many brethren, in much labour of mind and body, and great ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, to gather; or to deſtroy what I have by the Grace and help of God been building up: I earneſtly requeſt and beſeech all faithful friends and brethren e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, who have had any former true knowledg of me in the truth, and more especially thoſe who have received any spiritual profiting and edification, and Conſolation by my Miniſtry and Teſtimony, or Writings to have Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, and keep in that Love that thinks no evil; for I have had great, and ſtill have ſo great an interest, room and place, in the Chriſtian Love and Eſteem of many Friends and Brethren, by my Chriſtian Testimony, and innocent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Converſation, and ſpiritual Fellowſhip with them, in the Life and Spirit of Truth, that I cannot be ſo eaſily ſeparated from them, as ſome may ſuggest, and I hope I never ſhall, whatever ſome may ſurmiſe to the contrary; but as I neither intend, nor deſire any breach among faithful Friends, ſo I freely declare, I greatly deſire and hope for a greater degree of Reformation to take place among us in general, and for a greater growth and increaſe in Grace, and in Knowledg and in Holineſs, than is yet attained to by us; and it is my belief, and hope with earneſt expectations, and deſires, and frequent Prayer and Supplication unto God, that he will be pleaſed more and more to refine us, to make us every way a more Pure People to himſelf, and to ſeparate and purge out from among us, the many Impurities and Imperfections that cleave to many of us, as well as the many hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrites, &amp; otherwiſe unqualified perſons that are among us, that the many ſtumbling blocks and offences that are in the way of many, that hinder them from receiving our Teſtimony, and joyning with us in the ſame, may be removed, being firmly perſuaded in a ſincere Faith, that the Lord is about to make a ſhort and ſpeedy work in the Earth, even to refine all profeſſions on Earth, and to gather out of them all a pure and holy ſeed, and people to himſelf. <hi>Amen.</hi>
