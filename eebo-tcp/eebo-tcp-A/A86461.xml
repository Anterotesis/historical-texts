         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> who landed at <hi>Dover</hi> 
               <date>Friday, <hi>May</hi> the 25.</date> to the moſt unſpeakable joy of his SUBJECTS</head>
            <l>HEav'n at the Laſt hath heard my Prayers I ſtand</l>
            <l>Full of fair Hopes to kiſs my Princes hand,</l>
            <l>And need no flames that may new Heats in fuſe</l>
            <l>Zeal can create a Verſe without a Muſe,</l>
            <l>The wounds I have receiv'd, the yeers I've ſpent</l>
            <l>The Months Iv'e told in long Impriſonment,</l>
            <l>I look on now with Joy, who would not be</l>
            <l>One day in Chains to be for ever free,</l>
            <l>My Prayers are heard, the King himſelf is come</l>
            <l>The Grace, and Glory of all Chriſtendome,</l>
            <l>'Tis he repairs our Breaches, and reſtores</l>
            <l>The Land to ſafety, and doth heal our ſores,</l>
            <l>'Tis he that ſtroaks our Griefs, and wipes our eyes,</l>
            <l>Sets us in order, and doth make us wiſe,</l>
            <l>For ne're was Nation ſo before miſled</l>
            <l>To court the Tayl, and make the Rump their Head,</l>
            <l>Where are the Saints now that would fayn be known</l>
            <l>To have no other Holydays by their own:</l>
            <l>Where are our cruel Regicids and all</l>
            <l>That petulant Crew, we <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> call,</l>
            <l>Whoſe wild Religion and whoſe zeal doth Border,</l>
            <l>On Faction, Ruine, Falſhood, and Diſorder,</l>
            <l>Whoſe Goſpel ſpeaks it is too hard a thing,</l>
            <l>To honour God, and to obey the King,</l>
            <l>And from their Bibles do expunge that Text</l>
            <l>As too obliging, or too much perplext;</l>
            <l>The day is now at hand that will declare</l>
            <l>What men of Conſcience, and what Saints they are,</l>
            <l>Who ſtill purſue (oh moſt inhumane wrongs)</l>
            <l>The Lords anoynted with their threatning tongues,</l>
            <l>As if the Father ſlain, they had not done</l>
            <l>Enough, unleſs they Maſſacred the Son,</l>
            <l>This to prevent, the King himſelf draws nigh</l>
            <l>Full of his Cauſe, his Eye with Majeſty,</l>
            <l>His Brow with thunders arm'd, and on each hand</l>
            <l>The Youth of Heav'n in files unnumberd ſtand,</l>
            <l>His glorious Guard, for to the world be't known</l>
            <l>That Heav'n is pleaſd to make this Cauſe his own,</l>
            <l>For who the King affront, the like would do</l>
            <l>To th' King of Kings could they come at him too;</l>
            <l>Now as the Sun when his abſented light</l>
            <l>Approacheth neerer Day doth ſmile out right</l>
            <l>And the thick vapours of the night do fly</l>
            <l>In guilty Tumults from his ſearching Eye;</l>
            <l>So now the King in perſon hath begun</l>
            <l>To ſhow himſelf like the Meridian Sun</l>
            <l>To ſhine in all his Glories, and diſpence</l>
            <l>Throughout the Land his powerfull Influence</l>
            <l>The clouds of bold Rebellion, the falſe light</l>
            <l>Of falſer zeal, and Meteors of the Night,</l>
            <l>The ſullen Vapours, and the Miſts that made</l>
            <l>A great Confuſion in ſo great a ſhade,</l>
            <l>Shall waſt before him, as he comes our States</l>
            <l>Extreams to temper, for it pleas'd the Fates,</l>
            <l>Though others travaild in the work, yet none</l>
            <l>Shall heal our Griefs but who our hearts did own,</l>
            <l>Nor ſhall the North regain their antient worth</l>
            <l>But by that Monarch whom the North brought forth:</l>
            <l>And Fame no ſooner to our ears did bring</l>
            <l>The welcome ſtory of our landed King,</l>
            <l>But all the Lords and Gentry of the Land</l>
            <l>Made haſt to waite upon his high Command,</l>
            <l>So full their trayn, ſo gallant their Array</l>
            <l>As if their ſplendor would outſhine the day,</l>
            <l>Who all as ſoon as they the King diſplayd</l>
            <l>Who can imagine what a ſhout was made,</l>
            <l>The glittering of their cloaths outvy'd the Suns</l>
            <l>Hats in the Ayr flew up, Guns roard to Guns,</l>
            <l>And Trumpets deafned Trumpets, who would have thought</l>
