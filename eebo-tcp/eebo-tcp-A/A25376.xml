            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Hereupon our Virgin lead us down again by the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtaires from the Scaffold, and ſo we again made our reverence towards<note place="margin">Diſceſſus ab hoc actu.</note> the Curtain.

I indeed cauſed my Page to conduct me (together with my Companion) up and <hi>down</hi> the Caſtle, of which walk it will never repent me<note place="margin">Autoris.</note> as long as I have a day to live. For beſides many other glorious Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Royal <hi>Sepulcher</hi> was alſo ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, by which I learned more than is extant in <hi>all Books.</hi> There in the ſame place ſtands alſo the glorious <hi>Phaenix</hi> (of which two years ſince I<note place="margin">Libellus de Phaenice.</note> publiſhed a particular ſmall diſcourſe) And am reſolved (in caſe this my nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhall prove uſeful) to ſet forth ſeveral and peculiar Treatiſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Lyon, Eagle, Griffon, Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> and other like, together with their Draughts and Inſcriptions.

About this time the Curious <hi>Fountains,</hi> Mines, and all kind of Art-Shops, were alſo ſhown us, of which there was none but ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all our Arts, though they ſhould all be melted into one Maſs.

In brief, there was nothing there but Art and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maenity. Now after we had each to other related our employment ſince
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60767:42"/>
noon (howbeit, not a word was ſpoken of the Library and Monuments) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already merry with the Wine, the Virgin began thus: My Lords, I<note place="margin">The Lady Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouler.</note> have a great contention with one of my Siſters: In our Chamber we have an <hi>Eagle,</hi> Now we cheriſh him with ſuch<note place="margin">Perplexed Speeches, or intricate Queſtions.</note> diligence, that each of us is diſirous to be the beſt beloved, and upon that ſcore have many a Squabble. On a day we concluded to go both together to him, and toward whom he ſhould ſhew himſelf moſt friendly, hers ſhould he properly be; this we did, and I (as commonly) bare in my hand a branch of Lawrel, but my Siſter had none. Now as ſoon as he eſpyed us both, he immediately gave my Siſter another branch which he had in his Beak, and offered at mine, which I gave him. Now each of us hereupon imagined her ſelf to be beſt beloved of him; which way am I to reſolve my ſelf? This modeſt propoſal of the Virgin pleaſed us all mighty well, and each one would gladly have heard the Solution, but in as much as they all looked upon me, and deſired to have the beginning

Now when they had afterwards diſcovered the buſineſs to me, I knew not how to reſolve my ſelf, and have hitherto let it reſt in this manner, until I may find ſome good advice herein. The Virgin wondered at it, and well obſerved where about I was, whereupon ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, well then let us both be quit; and then deſired the ſolution from the reſt.

The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Man travelled into all Countries to find ſuch a Man as might perform this, till at length he lite upon a little old Man that promiſed to do it for him, in caſe he would aſſure him of half his Eſtate; which he having conſented to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:60767:44"/>
the other was as good as his word. Whereupon he invited the foreſaid Lady home to his Garden, where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to her expectation ſhe found all things green, pleaſant and warm, and withal remembring her promiſe, ſhe only requeſted that ſhe might once more return to her Lord, to whom with Signs and Tears ſhe bewailed her lamentable condition: But for as much as he ſufficiently perceived her faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he diſpatched her back to her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, who had ſo dearly purchaſed her, that ſhe might give him Satisfaction.

It goes well there, replyed the ſeventh, where a man hath<note place="margin">8.</note> his choice, but with me the caſe is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; in my youth I loved a fair and vertuous Virgin from the bottom of my Heart, and ſhe me in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: howbeit becauſe of her Friends denyal we could not come together in wedlock: Whereupon ſhe was married to another, yet an honeſt and diſcreet Perſon, who maintained her honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and with affection, until ſhe came into the paines of Child-birth, which went ſo hard with her that all thought ſhe had been dead, ſo with much ſtate, and great mourning ſhe was interred. Now I thought with my ſelf, during
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60767:45"/>
her Life thou couldſt have no part in this Woman, but yet now dead as ſhe is thou mayſt embrace and Kiſs her ſufficiently; whereupon I took my Servant with me, who dug her up by Night; Now having opened the Coſſin and locked her in my Arms, and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about her Heart, I found ſtill ſome little motion in it, which increaſed more and more from my warmth, till at laſt I perceived that ſhe was indeed ſtill alive; wherefore I quietly bare her home, and after I had warmed her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Body with a coſtly Bath of Herbs, I committed her to my Mother until ſhe brought forth a fair Son, whom (as the Mother) I cauſed faithfully to be nurſed. After two days (ſhe being then in a mighty amazement) I diſcovered to her all the forepaſſed affair, requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her that for the time to come ſhe would live with me as a Wife, againſt which ſhe thus excepted, in caſe it ſhould be grievous to her Husband who had well and honourably maintained her. But if it could otherwiſe be, ſhe was the preſent obliged in love to one as well as the other. Now after two Months (being then to make a Journey
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60767:45"/>
elſewhere) I invited her Husband as a Gueſt, and amongſt other things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, whether if his deceaſed Wife ſhould come home again, he could be content to receive her, and he affirming it with Tears and Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, at length I brought him his Wife together with his Son, and an account of all the fore-paſſed buſineſs, intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ratifie with his conſent my fore-purpoſed eſpouſals. After a long diſpute he could not beat me from my right, but was fain to leave me the Wife. But ſtill the conteſt was about the Son. Here the Virgin interrupted him, and ſaid, It makes me wonder how you could double the afflicted Mans grief. How, anſwered he, was I not then concerned? Upon this there aroſe a diſpute amongſt us, yet the moſt part affirmed that he had done but right. Nay, ſaid he, I freely returned him both his Wife and Son. Now tell me (my Lords) was my honeſty, or this Man's joy the greater? Theſe words had ſo mightily cheared the Virgin that (as if it had been for the ſake of theſe two) ſhe cauſed a health to go round. After which the reſt of the propoſals
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60767:46"/>
wont on ſomewhat perplexedly, ſo that I could not retain them all, yet this comes to my mind, that one ſaid, that a few years before he had<note place="margin">6.</note> ſeen a Phyſitian, who bought a parcel of Wood againſt Winter, with which he warmed himſelf all Winter long; but as ſoon as the Spring returned he ſold the very ſame Wood again, and ſo had the uſe of it for nothing; Here muſt needs be skill, ſaid the Virgin, but the time is now paſt. Yea, replyed my Companion, who ever underſtands not how to reſolve all the Riddles, may give each Man notice of it by a proper Meſſenger, I conceive he will not be denied. At this time they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſay Grace, and we aroſe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Table, rather ſatisfied and merry than glutted; and it were to be wiſhed that all <hi>Invitations</hi> and Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were thus to be kept. Having now taken ſome few turns up and down the Hall again, the Virgin asked us whether<note place="margin">The Lady Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain virg. Lucif.

Yes, ſaid one, noble and vertuous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; whereupon ſhe privately diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Page, and yet in the mean time proceeded in diſcourſe with us. In

therefore permitted it ſo to be; but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when we thought we had very well mingled our ſelves, the Virgins never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs were ſo ſubtil, that each one knew her ſtation before-hand: The Virgin began to reckon, the ſeventh next her was again a Virgin, the third ſeventh a Virgin likewiſe, and this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo long till (to our amazement) all the <hi>Virgins</hi> came forth, and <hi>none of</hi> us was hit; Thus we poor pittiful Wretches remained ſtanding alone, and were moreover forced to ſuffer our ſelves to be <hi>jeared</hi> too, and confeſs we were very handſomly couzened.

The unknown Queen, who was Yeſterday with us, went foremoſt, with a ſmall and coſtly Coronet, apparrelled in <hi>white</hi> Sattin, ſhe carried nothing but a ſmall Crucifix which was made of a Pearl, and this very day wrought between the young King and his Bride. After her went the ſix fore-mentioned Virgins in two ranks, who carried the King's Jewels belonging to the little Altar: next to theſe came the three Kings.

He had on a ſmall round black Hat, with a little black pointed Feather, which he cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly put off to us, thereby to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his favour towards us.

But the little Cheſt was to lie in the reiddle. Herewith were my Companions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for they imagined no other but that the Dead Corps were there.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60767:70"/>
loitering about <hi>Venus;</hi> Bed, for <hi>Cupid</hi> can by no means brook it. After ſome Hours, having in friendly diſcourſes made a good way, we came within Ken of the Tower of <hi>Olympus,</hi> wherefore the Virgin commanded by the diſcharge of ſome Pieces to give the ſignal of our approach, which was alſo done; And immediately we eſpyed a great <hi>white</hi> Flag thruſt out, and a ſmall gilded<note place="margin">Turris Olymps.</note> Pinnace ſent forth to meet us. Now as ſoon as this was come to us, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in it a very ancient man, the Warden of the Tower, with certain<note place="margin">Cuſtos</note> Guards cloathed in <hi>white,</hi> of whom we were Friendly received, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the Tower. This Tower was Situated upon an <hi>Iſland</hi> exactly <hi>ſquare,</hi> which was invironed with a <hi>Wall</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Structure.</note> ſo firm and thick, that I my ſelf coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted two hundred and <hi>ſixty</hi> paſſes over.<note place="margin">Dies.</note> On the other ſide of the wall was a fine Meadow with certain little Gardens, in which grew ſtrange, and to me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, Fruits; and then again an inner Wall round about the Tower. The Tower of it ſelf was juſt as if <hi>ſeven round Towers</hi> had been built one by another, yet the middlemoſt was
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60767:71"/>
ſomewhat the higher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and within they all entred one into another, and had ſeven Storys one above another. Being thus come to the Gates of the Tower, we were led a little aſide on the Wall, that ſo, as I well obſerved, the Coffins might be brought into the Tower with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our taking notice; of this the reſt knew nothing. This being done, we were conducted into the Tower at the<note place="margin">1.

And truly our Virgin was ſo buſie with us, and ſo full of her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, that ſhe knew how to give each of us employment enough, ſo that in this Iſland we were fain to be meer <hi>drudges, till</hi> we had atcheived all that was neceſſary for the reſtoring of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed Bodies.

For my part I was not very much troubled with ſleep, and therefore walked out into the Garden, and at length came as for as the Wall; and becauſe the Heaven was at that time very clear, I could well<note place="margin">Autor Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatur cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomno.</note> drive away the time in contemplating the <hi>Stars;</hi> By chance I came to a great pair of Stone-Stairs, which led up to the top of the Wall. And becauſe the Moon ſhone very bright, I was ſo much the more confident, and went up, and looked too a little upon the Sea, which was now exceeding calm; and thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good opportunity to conſider bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Aſtronomy, I found that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Night there would happen ſuch a conjunction of the Planets, the like to which was not otherwiſe ſuddenly to be obſerved.

This made me ſomewhat affraid; for as ſoon as the Flames had ſetled themſelves, the Winds aroſe, and began to make the Sea very Tempeſtuous. The Moon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was Covered with clouds, and my joy ended with ſuch fear, that I had ſcarce time enough to hit upon the Stairs again, and betake my ſelf again to the Tower. Now whether the Flames tarried any longer, or paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way again, I cannot ſay: For in this obſcurity I durſt no more venture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: So I laid me down upon my Mattreſs, and there being beſides in the <hi>Laboratory</hi> a pleaſant and gently purling Fountain, I fell a Sleep ſo much the ſooner.

Some imagined that they were not put to death, but that others were beheaded in their ſtead. We having now talked together a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty while. in comes the Old Man to us, and firſt ſaluting us, looks about him to ſee if all things were ready, and the proceſſes enough done.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60767:73"/>
thus. My Dear Sons, one of theſe three things muſt each of you this day conſtantly bear about with him. Now it is free for you either to make a choice of one of them, or to caſt lots about it. We replied, we would chooſe. Nay; ſaid he, let it rather go by lot.

Mean time the Muſitians went their vvay, and vve walked up and down in the Room; and truly the Room was ſomade, that we<note place="margin">Deliciae in Conclavi</note> had opportunity enough to paſs away our time: There was, for Images, Paintings, Clock-works, Organs, Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fountains, and the like, nothing forgotten.

At length the Virgin commanded to ſhut up the Looking-Glaſſes again, and to make faſt the Windovvs, and ſo let the Globe cool again a little; and this vvas done about ſeven of the Clock. Wherefore vve thought good, ſince vve might novv have leiſure a little to refreſh our ſelves vvith a Breakfaſt: This Treatment again vvas right Philoſophical, and vve<note place="margin">Prandium Philoſoph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60767:77"/>
hope of the future joy (vvith vvhich the Virgin continually comforted us) made us ſo jocond that vve regarded not any pains, or inconvenience. And this I can truly ſay too concerning my Companions of high quality, that their minds never ran after their <hi>Kitchin or Table,</hi> but their pleaſure vvas only to attend upon this adventurous Phiſick, and hence to contemplate the Creator's Wiſdom and Omnipotency. After vve had taken our Refection, we again ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled our ſelves to work, for the Globe was ſufficiently cooled; which with toil and labour we vvere to lift off the Chain and ſet upon the Floor. Now the diſpute was how to get the Globe in funder, for we were commanded to divide the ſame in the midſt. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion was that a ſharp pointed Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond would beſt do it. Now when we<note place="margin">Reſolutio Globe.</note> had thus opened the Globe, there was nothing of <hi>redneſs</hi> more to be ſeen, but a lovely great ſnovv-vvhite Egg: It moſt mightily rejoyced us, that this was ſo vvell brought to paſs.

But the Virgin made it preſently be carried<note place="margin">Ovum can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didum.</note> forth, and departed her ſelf too from us again, and (as all vvays) locked the Door to. But vvhat ſhe did abroad vvith the Egg, or vvhether it vvere ſome vvay privately handled, I knovv not, neither do I believe it.

Then he ſued in the moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, that upon peril of Body and Life he might be permitted to be preſent at this Nights ſupper, he was in good hopes to ſpye out the very Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor, and obtain his wiſhed freedom.

ſharp for me, and I could well have endured never to have ſeen it. Now I was caſting in my mind whether he might perchance be helped through my wiſh, ſo I asked the King, whether he might not be releaſed ſome other way? No, replyed the King, becauſe there is a ſpecial conſideration in the buſineſs. However, for this Night, we may well gratifie him in his deſire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo he ſent one forth to fetch him in.
