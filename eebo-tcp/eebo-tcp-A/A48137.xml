            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

our Infantry, even to ſuch a degree of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantneſſe, as may crown every common ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier with the honour of a Commander. But the left Wing of our Horſe being charged by the Kings right Wing, was ſuddainly put to flight, ſo that the right Wing in which your Son was placed, did the beſt ſervice for the Cheualty. Where your Sonne is (or any of the reſt of my Lords Guard) I know not, I hope they are ſafe, becauſe upon diligent enquiry, I yet hear no hurt of any of them. However; if you have conſecrated a Son to ſo Noble a Service, I doubt not but you will endeavour to bear it cheerfully, if you ſhould hear that he is either ſlain or wounded. We have loſt none of our Commanders (as we can yet underſtand) except Colonell <hi>Charles Eſſex,</hi> and Sir <hi>James Ramſey,</hi> who is either kild or taken; Wee have taken Priſoners from the Kings ſide, the Lord of <hi>Lindſey</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Field, with his Son Colonel <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſor,</hi> who was Commander of the Kings Guard and Standard, which likewiſe we have taken: As alſo Colonell <hi>Lunsfords,</hi> who are now both at <hi>Wirwick</hi> Caſtle, we did beat the enemy out of the Field, and gained four pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Ordnance.

Colonell <hi>Vavaſor</hi> aſſures us, that the King himſelf for ſome time was in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, wee hear no certainty yet concerning Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> ſome ſay he is ſlain. A few of our Waggons were burned and plundered by the Enemy, who wheeled about into our Rere, but our Muſquetiers played bravely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in the mean time, and recovered our Waggons again, and ſixe pieces of Ordnance which we had loſt, our Enemy had the wind more with them, but we had more of the Hill, we had but twelve Regiments in the Field, about fifty troops of Horſe (I think) at the moſt, and ſome 2.

And our Noble Lords, as the L. <hi>Wharton, Willoughty of Parham, Roberts, &amp;c.</hi> did as brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
