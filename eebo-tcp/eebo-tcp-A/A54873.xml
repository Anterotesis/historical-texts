            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE following Sermon, which was compos'd in a little time, and when a great many other things of importance lay on my hands, had never been expos'd to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick view, had not You more than once preſs'd it upon me, from the Affection I bore to your deceaſed Husband, my very worthy and moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Friend; whoſe Name will

be ever dear to me. But tho I am conſcious it has many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, yet being deſign'd to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate his Memory, I thought my ſelf bound by the Laws of Friendſhip, as well as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of Duty, to inſcribe it to Your Name, from whom I have receiv'd the moſt libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and undeſerv'd Favours. And tho it may in ſome ſort renew your Sorrows, yet I hope, with the Bleſſing of God, it will tend to reſtrain 'em from exceſs.</p>

            <p>He has run his Chriſtian Race, and receiv'd his unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Crown: he has paſs'd through an ill-natur'd World with an unſpotted Name; for Envy it ſelf could not ſtain his Character.</p>
            <p>May his Virtues live in his Childrens Memory, and his Example in their Lives: May all the tender Branches of your hopeful Family become Plants of Renown; may they tread in their Father's ſteps, and ſerve their Father's God:

               <q>
                  <p>But I would not have you to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, Brethren, concerning them which are aſleep, that ye ſorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</p>
                  <p>For if we believe that Jeſus died and roſe again, even ſo them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him.</p>

            <p>THE melancholy Air that ſits on every Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the ſad So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities that attend our meeting at this time, give ſufficient inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of what I am come about: I need not tell you that 'tis to preach a Funeral Sermon, and whoſe Death has given me the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful occaſion; for the deceaſed

Gentleman's Worth was ſo well known, and the want of him is ſo much felt, that the Court, the City, and the Church of God are not a little ſenſible who 'tis that is raviſh'd from 'em.</p>
            <p>This ſudden and ſurprizing Providence repreſents the frailty of Human Nature, and the neceſſity of an early and conſtant Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">

Lord, how vain a thing is Man! how little is he to be accounted of, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Breath is in his Noſtrils, and may be ſtopt by a thouſand Accidents, and his Soul let out at the leaſt pore of his Body.</p>
            <p>Yet ſo great is the Stupidity that has ſeiz'd on the World, that moſt People are for putting the evil day far from 'em, as only fit to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45330:5"/>
be thought on by the ſick and the aged; tho they know not what a day may bring forth, and tho they cannot but be inform'd by the Records of the Grave that there are more drop into it in their full ſtrength, while their <hi>Bones are</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 21. 24.</note> 
               <hi>moiſtned with Marrow,</hi> than there are that arrive to a good old Age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make their Bed in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Indeed there are none ſo wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſceptical as to deny, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe that they are mortal, or that ſeriouſly think they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go to the Houſe appointed for all living: yet the generality of the World live as if they were never to die; and I confeſs of the two, it ſeems to me a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Madneſs and Folly to think we ſhall die and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it, than to imagine we are immortal, and ſo uncapable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45330:6"/>
of dying. So that upon the whole a Man cannot give a better Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of true Wiſdom than by making his Preparation for Death the great buſineſs of his Life; for Death we are ſure will come, but at what time we know not, therefore 'tis the moſt reaſonable thing in the World that we ſhould be always ready.</p>
            <p>I little thought that he who was worſhipping of God in this place this day month, would ſo ſoon have ſunk down to the Duſt of Death; and indeed God only knows which of us ſhall take the next turn to the Sepulchre. I know 'tis impoſſible to mention this, but there will be a very ſtrong Emotion in moſt Minds; to calm which a recourſe to my Text is the moſt proper Remedy that I know of.</p>
            <p>For I would not have you to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Brethren, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45330:6"/>
'Tis not improbable but that the Death of ſome Perſons in the <hi>Theſſalonian</hi> Church might occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on St. <hi>Paul</hi> to addreſs himſelf to the Survivors (as in the words of the Text) that he might arm 'em againſt the fears of Death, and moderate their exceſſive mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Dead. In the words I obſerve theſe three Parts.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Apoſtle's extraordinary care to inform the <hi>Theſſalonian</hi> Chriſtians concerning the ſtate of their dead Friends: <hi>But I would not have you to be ignorant, Brethren, concerning them that are aſleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. A Diſſwaſive from immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Sorrow upon the Death of thoſe that are pious; <hi>That ye ſorrow not even as others that have no hope.</hi>

            <p n="3">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45330:7"/>
III. The Arguments the Apoſtle uſes to prevent exceſſive mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the dead in Chriſt. The firſt is taken from the nature of their Death, 'tis deſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſoft Character of a Sleep. The ſecond is fetch'd from what ſhall follow this Sleep, they ſhall be awaken'd in the morning of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>thoſe that ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him;</hi> which the Apoſtle not only aſſerts, but proves: <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus died and roſe again, q. d.</hi> If there be any ſolid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for our believing the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, then we have an infallible aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the revival of all that die united to him: <hi>Thoſe that ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:45330:7"/>
I ſhall briefly treat of theſe three General Heads, and then make ſome Application ſutable to my Text, and the ſolemn and ſad oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of diſcourſing from it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle's extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry care to inform the <hi>Theſſalonian</hi> Chriſtians concerning the ſtate of their deceaſed Friends. <hi>But I would not have you to be ignorant, Brethren, concerning them which are aſleep.</hi> Theſe words ſeem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that the Apoſtle apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded divers of theſe Chriſtians to be under ſome miſtakes with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their dead Friends: And 'tis thought that their Perſecutors had ſhock'd 'em in their Faith about the Reſurrection of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. For we know that the Greek Philoſophers, as well as the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> did explode and ridicule this great Doctrine,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45330:8"/>
which they perform'd with ſo much art and ſubtilty, that ſome Members of the Primitive Church doubted, whilſt others affirm'd there was no Reſurrection. And this ſeems to be the occaſion of their exceſſive Sorrow, they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their dead Friends not only as remov'd out of the World, but as loſt for ever (as to their Bodies at leaſt.) And their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, that they might increaſe their Infidelity and their Sorrow at the ſame time, when they put the Chriſtians to death for the Cauſe of Chriſt, did it in ſuch ways as might have the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at leaſt of deſtroying and annihilating the Matter that compos'd their Bodies: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times committing 'em to the Flames, and ſcattering their Aſhes in the Air and in Rivers, that their ſurviving Friends might
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45330:8"/>
conclude it was impoſſible they ſhould ever riſe again: At other times they were devour'd by wild Beaſts, or elſe thrown as a Prey to the Fiſh of the Sea; and all this to ſuppreſs the belief of the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>Now whether theſe Enemies to the Chriſtian Doctrine did ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin by theſe methods to annihilate the Matter of the Human Body, or ſo to ſcatter or confound theſe Particles of Duſt, as to render it impoſſible for God to recollect and range 'em in their due place and order, ſo as to compoſe the ſame Human Body, 'tis equally abſurd. The former is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philoſophical, for 'tis impoſſible by any method in the World to annihilate Matter: indeed its form may be deſtroy'd, and it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a variety of new Figures, it may be differently modified ten
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45330:9"/>
thouſand times, but cannot be annihilated by the Arts of any Creature under Heaven. With reſpect to the latter, 'tis impious and atheiſtical, for it ſuppoſes a defect either in the Knowledg or Power of God, or both; which is as vain as to ſay, there is no God: for we cannot frame a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Idea of a Deity, without conceiving him clothed with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Perfection, and as poſſeſſing of 'em infinitely. So that allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is ſuch a Being as God, that is Omniſcient and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, 'tis as rational to believe he can recollect theſe diſperſed Atoms again, as unite 'em in their firſt Production: for all things are poſſible to God, who can, if he pleaſe, impreſs a kind of natural force upon the diſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Parts, and cauſe 'em to move to one another, as readily as the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45330:9"/>
filings of Iron to a Loadſtone, tho mingled with millions of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Sand.</p>
            <p>The infinite Knowledg, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the irreſiſtible Power of God, anſwers all Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Reſurrection of the Body; the ſame Being having plighted his Faithfulneſs for this Event, promiſing that the Dead ſhall be raiſed. And this is one great Doctrine which St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Text aims to ſet in a clear and certain light, that the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> who ſeem'd to be ſhaken, might be confirm'd in their belief of this important Article of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Creed: <hi>Brethren, I would not have you to be ignorant concerning them that are aſleep—for them that ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him: q. d.</hi> 'tis true, your Friends are fallen aſleep, but 'tis not an eternal one, for they ſhall be awaken'd
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45330:10"/>
from it; they are dead, but they ſhall revive and riſe again; for God our Saviour ſhall bring them with him, when he comes in the Clouds of Heaven. Here I might make ſeveral very profitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon the Apoſtle's care to correct and remove the Miſtakes thoſe Chriſtians had imbibed to whom he wrote, but my time will not ſuffer me to ſtay upon this Head. I proceed therefore to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. General, which is a diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive from immoderate Sorrow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of thoſe that are pious. <hi>I would not have you to be ignorant, Brethren, concerning them which are aſleep, that ye ſorrow not even as others that have no hope.</hi> The deſign of theſe words is very obvious, <hi>viz.</hi> to temper our Grief, to regulate and bound our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45330:10"/>
for thoſe religious Friends that are ſnatch'd from us by Death. St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not diſſwade from all kind of mourning, but from that which is exceſſive; a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Sorrow is due to the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our deceaſed Friends.</p>
            <p>And we find ſome, whoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters ſhine brighteſt in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Hiſtory, under a Cloud of Sorrow, when their Relations have been remov'd by Death; yet 'tis no where that I know of charg'd upon 'em as a Crime that they wept for the Dead. <hi>Abraham,</hi> who has an honourable mention among the Old Teſtament-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies for his great Self-denial, as well as the ſtrength of his Faith, in being ready to offer up his only Son at the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, yet gave a vent to his Grief, and pour'd out a flood of Tears when <hi>Sarah</hi> the delight of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45330:11"/>
his Eyes was taken away with a<note place="margin">Gen. 23. 2.</note> ſtroke: <hi>and</hi> Abraham <hi>came to mourn for</hi> Sarah, <hi>and wept for her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Job 1. 7.</note> And <hi>Job,</hi> that mirror of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Probity, that had none like him in the Earth, as God himſelf teſtifies to Satan, yet, as<note place="margin">Ver. 20.</note> we read, <hi>rent his Mantle, ſhav'd his Head, fell upon his face to the ground,</hi> when he heard of the death of his Children; theſe were the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies then in uſe as the ſigns of a deep mourning: yet we are<note place="margin">Ver. 21.</note> told, <hi>that in all this he ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſhly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that Inſtance which is beſt ſuted to my purpoſe, and free even from the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of a Crime, is that of our bleſſed Saviour, who tho never guilty of the leaſt Exceſs, yet joins with the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for <hi>Lazarus;</hi> for when he ſaw <hi>Mary,</hi> and thoſe that attended
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45330:11"/>
her, weeping for her dead Brother, the Text ſays, <hi>he groaned in the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 11. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Spirit, and was troubled;</hi> but when he came nearer to the Grave, his Grief flow'd out at his Eyes, for the bleſſed Jeſus is ſaid to have<note place="margin">Ver. 34.</note> 
               <hi>wept.</hi> Now whatever might be the occaſion of his Grief, whether his love to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> or the <hi>Jews</hi> Infidelity, or any other reaſon, 'tis plain that thoſe that ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Grave took it in the firſt ſenſe, therefore they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cry out, <hi>Behold how he loved him</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ver. 36.</note>.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee from the brighteſt Examples in Scripture, that a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Sorrow for the dead is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable. Moreover, let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that the contrary Carriage under the loſs of our Friends would look like a Contempt of the Divine Hand; for as we are not to faint under the Rebukes, ſo we are not to deſpiſe the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45330:12"/>
Chaſtening of the Lord. The<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3. 4.</note> wiſe Man tells us that there is a time to mourn and a time to weep, as well as for other things; certainly it cannot be an unfit ſeaſon to weep, when God takes away our pious Friends, that have been eminently uſeful, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Bleſſings to a Nation. And 'tis obſervable how the Prophet complains of the groſs Stupidity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were inſenſible under the ſigns of the Divine Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure;<note place="margin">Iſa. 57. 1.</note> 
               <hi>The righteous periſheth, and no man layeth it to heart.</hi> And we find alſo that 'tis threatened as a<note place="margin">Jer. 22. 18.</note> Judgment when any die without being lamented; yea, 'tis ſaid to<note place="margin">Job 27. 13, 14, 15.</note> be the <hi>Portion of the wicked from God, and the Heritage of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor, that they are cut off, and their Widows ſhall not weep.</hi> So that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole 'tis very evident that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in my Text has no deſign,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45330:12"/>
in his Diſſwaſive from immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Sorrow, to recommend the Stoical Apathy; for the Rules of the Chriſtian Inſtitution have no tendency to eradicate our Paſſions, but to correct and govern 'em.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but remark, that what has been ſaid caſts no favourable Aſpect on the Doctrine of the Stoick Philoſophers, which teaches that Men are to ſtifle all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Affections both of Joy and Sorrow; that no outward Emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould move the Affection of Joy; and that a Perſon ſhould be as eaſy and as free from the paſſion of Grief in a violent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſm of the Gout or Stone, as if he were in perfect health in the midſt of the moſt raviſhing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. 'Tis reported of <hi>Poſſido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> a Stoick Philoſopher, who paſſed a great part of his Life under very acute Diſeaſes, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45330:13"/>
being viſited by <hi>Pompey</hi> at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> he entertain'd him with a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Diſcourſe; and when his Pains were the moſt ſharp and violent, he chid 'em in ſuch Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as this:<note n="*" place="bottom">Nil agis, dolor; quanquam ſis moleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, nunquam te eſſe confitebor malum.</note> 
               <hi>In vain doſt thou aſſault me, Pain; tho thou art trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom, thou ſhalt never force me to confeſs thou art evil.</hi> Indeed could the pomp of words abate our painful Senſations, there would be ſome ſhew of reaſon in this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher's method; but ſince the contrary is evident by univerſal Experience, 'twas an inſtance of great Pride, and the moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Folly. And 'tis worth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking, that the greateſt Maſters in this Philoſophy, when they fell into ſharp Adverſity, ſuddenly ſunk into ſuch deep Deſpair and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45330:13"/>
Impatience, that they laid violent hands upon themſelves. I need only name <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> the moſt eminent among 'em, who (as one obſerves) <q>profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be wiſe in their Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, became Fools in Practice, and were confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all their Philoſophy, when they ſhould have made uſe of it.</q> Which brings to my mind a Paſſage I have read of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who was not a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to the Stoick Philoſophy; who tells us that at the death of his dear Friend <hi>Annaeus Serenus,</hi> he<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 63. Inter exempla eorum fui quos dolor vicit.</note> was found of the number of thoſe whom Grief overcame. Upon which one remarks; <q>That Nature was too ſtrong for his Philoſophy, tho at other
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45330:14"/>
times none outbraves the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of Life, or the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Death at a higher rate, as if they had not the leaſt power to move his wiſe Man.</q> So that upon the whole we ſee the inſufficiency of Philoſophick Axioms to ſupport a Mind over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with Sorrow; but that which Philoſophy has vainly attempted, Divine Revelation has fully compleated and finiſh'd, as will be evident when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Arguments St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſes in the Text to diſſwade from mourning as thoſe that have no hope.</p>
            <p>But before I touch upon them, I muſt be a little more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in this other matter. I have already told you what kind of Sorrow for the dead the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indulges; but that which is without hope, you ſee our Text
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45330:14"/>
condemns. Now our mourning may fall under this Character;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> When 'tis exceſſive in the meaſure and degree.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the length and continuance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> When 'tis exceſſive in the meaſure and degree, as it may be deem'd,</p>
            <p n="1">1. When our Sorrows are ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in impatient Murmurs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent Reflections upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Divine Providence; as if when our Friends are taken from our Society, God had done an unjuſt, an unmerciful, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Act. This is very criminal, for hereby we affront him in his moral Perfections, and ſeem to diſpute with him about the Rights of his Godhead, forgetting that he is our abſolute Soveraign,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45330:15"/>
and has an original and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienable Right in us and ours. For as it was merely an Act of his choice to give us a Being, all his ſubſequent Bounties can have no other Original than his own good pleaſure. And ſince he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows his Favours upon us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our merit, he may juſtly when he pleaſes recal 'em with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our leave; for his fundamental right in us and our Friends, skreens him from the leaſt ſhadow of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, when by Death he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves them from us. So that if while we are mourning for our deceas'd Friends, we permit our Paſſions to mutiny ſo as to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any unbecoming Reflections on the Skilfulneſs of the Divine Hand, 'tis a ſtrong evidence that our Sorrows are too exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>

and deep ſadneſs. If the Mind be greatly penſive, and thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a convulſive Agony, and do long continue ſo, ſadneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order will appear in the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; for the Laws of Union betwixt Body and Soul are ſo ſtrict, that 'tis impoſſible for the Faculties of the Mind to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd, but the Organs of the Body will be ſenſible of it, and ſuffer by it. For as any injury done to the Body occaſions pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Senſations in the Mind, ſo a violent hurry of the Powers and Paſſions of the Soul will ſoon abate the ſtrength of the Body, which while it declines and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes, increaſes the diſorder of the Spirit, ſo that by an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Sympathy they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come partners in each others Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and mutually hinder the performance of holy Duties, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45330:17"/>
the exerciſe of Faith, Hope, and Patience: for the mutiny of our Paſſions ſends up ſuch Vapours as thicken into a Cloud, which ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Underſtanding, do ſo confound the Apprehenſion, both with regard to the actings of theſe Graces, and the Objects upon which they are to terminate, that they are like a muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is unſtrung, and ſo unfit for uſe. Indeed there is no time more proper for the acting our ſuffering Graces than a day of gloom and thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But alas! this cannot be perform'd while the Mind is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Confuſion and Horror, and the animal Spirits exhauſted by continual ſighing: Therefore when we give ſo large a vent to our Sorrows, as to impair the health of our Bodies, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede the exerciſe of our Graces,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45330:18"/>
we ſorrow like thoſe that have no hope.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When our Grief for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Friends is greater than for thoſe Sins which might be the occaſion of God's removing 'em ſo ſuddenly from us. There is hardly any afflictive Providence but is properly a Reproof and Correction for Sin. Now if the ſmart of our Afflictions gives a deeper accent to our Sorrow than the guilt of our Sins; if we are more griev'd for the loſs of our Friend than for the viſible tokens of the Divine Anger, then our mourning is criminal. Indeed that Perſon muſt be very Stoical that can bear the loſs of an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Friend, without dropping a few Tears, and ſending ſome Sighs after him; but he is no leſs to blame, that can conceive a greater Sorrow in his Soul for the loſs of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45330:18"/>
an outward Comfort, than for Sin the ſad cauſe of God's ſnatching it from him. Moreover, 'tis a certain ſign that God was not valu'd by ſuch a one as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, all-comprehending Good, if any temporal loſs does more afflict his Soul than the Sins that occaſion'd it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We ſorrow as thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope for our departed Friends, when our Grief is more pungent and afflictive for the loſs of them, than for God's withdrawing his gracious and quickning Preſence, and hiding his Face from us in an angry Cloud. The Smiles of God are better, and more to be valued than the beſt Life of any Creature; therefore to be leſs concern'd when he frowns upon our Souls, than when he removes from us the Comforts of Life, does not only diſcover the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45330:19"/>
exceſs of our Grief, but the defect of our Judgment, in ſetting a higher value on a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Creature than an everliving God. But I haſten to the ſecond Head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They may be ſaid to ſorrow as thoſe without hope, that exceed in the continuance of their Sorrows, rejecting all ſolid grounds of Comfort, as did ſeveral whoſe Names are inrol'd in ſacred Story; I'll inſtance in a few. Good old<note place="margin">Gen. 37. 34, 35.</note> 
               <hi>Jacob,</hi> upon the apprehenſion of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s death, <hi>rends his Clothes, puts Sackcloth upon his Loins, and mourn'd for his Son many days:</hi> his Paſſion ſo got the ſtart of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he refus'd to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and reſolv'd to mourn till he died, abandoning himſelf to<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 15.</note> the moſt deſperate Sorrow. And thus <hi>Rachel</hi> is deſcrib'd by the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45330:19"/>
Prophet, as <hi>weeping for her Children, and refuſing to be comforted, becauſe they were not.</hi> And <hi>Rizpah</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued<note place="margin">2 Sam. 21. 10.</note> by the dead Bodies of her Sons, and would not willingly be remov'd from 'em. And there are not a few Chriſtians who are too apt to ſlide into theſe Exceſſes upon the death of their near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, as if all their Happineſs was vaniſh'd and gone, when the delight of their Eyes is ſunk into a Grave out of their ſight: which immoderate Sorrow is a continu'd Reflection on the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, as if a God of infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and immenſe Goodneſs were uncapable of making up the loſs of a mutable mortal Creature.</p>
            <p>Moreover, let me remark that the invincible Patience, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Submiſſion of ſome Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens under the moſt afflicting Providences, condemn the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45330:20"/>
of thoſe Chriſtians who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly mourn for their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Friends, and refuſe to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. I'll mention but one in the room of ſeveral, and 'tis that of <hi>Stilpon</hi> the Philoſopher, who when the City where he liv'd was reduc'd to Aſhes, and his Wife and Children buried in the common Ruins, himſelf eſcaping alone from the Fire, being ask'd whether he had loſt any thing? replied,<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <hi>All my Treaſure's with me, Juſtice, Virtue, Temperance, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and this inviolable Principle, not to eſteem any thing as my proper Good that can be raviſh'd from me.</hi> An Inſtance that very much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids thoſe Chriſtians that are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45330:20"/>
intemperate either in the degree or duration of their Grief. Some time is neceſſary and decent for our funeral Sorrows; but to walk ſoftly all our days in deep mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and anguiſh of Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Friends are taken from us, and made more happy than ever they were with us, is to grieve like ſtupid <hi>Jews,</hi> or hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Heathens, both which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe the Reſurrection of Chriſt, which is the Foundation, Model, and Pledg of ours.</p>
            <p>Therefore that this Diſſwaſive of the Apoſtle may make a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Impreſſion upon our Minds, let us now conſider the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he uſes to inforce it, which is the</p>

            <p>And under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our Lord uſes this Phraſe upon the death of one whom he lov'd, <hi>Our Friend</hi> Lazarus <hi>ſleepeth.</hi>

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:45330:22"/>
Our Souls are of an immortal nature, they neither die nor ſleep, but immediately upon the death<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 7.</note> of our Bodies <hi>return to God that gave 'em,</hi> and are fix'd in a ſtate of Happineſs or Miſery. Had not the Apoſtle believ'd this, we cannot imagine that he would have eſteem'd Death to be gain to him; or that he would have been in any ſtrait to determine and fix his choice, for preſent Death or longer Life: for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would have been much more eligible, if he had believ'd that his Soul at death would have been as inſenſible and unactive as his Body; and no doubt but he would rather have deſir'd to continue in this World, where he had enjoy'd Communion with Chriſt, and often ſeen him by a ſteddy eye of Faith, than to be hurried out of it by Death, and render'd utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45330:22"/>
incapable of any enjoyment of his Redeemer till the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. But 'tis yet more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from another Expreſſion of our Apoſtle, that he was very far from the Opinion, or rather Dream of the Soul's ſleeping with the Body till the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: His words are theſe. <hi>We</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 8.</note> 
               <hi>are confident, I ſay, and willing rather to be abſent from the Body, and to be preſent with the Lord. q. d.</hi> We have good courage, and are well arm'd againſt the fears of Death, being well aſſur'd that we ſhall have upon our Diſſolution an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate admittance into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our glorified Lord; for the Apoſtle ſuppoſes not only that the Soul is capable of exiſting while ſeparated from the Body, and of exerciſing her Faculties and Powers in ſuch a ſtate, but that ſo ſoon as ſhe leaves the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45330:23"/>
ſhe ſhall enter into the preſence of Chriſt, and behold his Glory.</p>
            <p>But I paſs on, and ſhall briefly repreſent the force of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's Arguments againſt immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Sorrow for the dead.</p>
            <p>The firſt of which is taken from the nature of their Death who die in the Lord, 'tis deſcrib'd by the ſoft Character of <hi>a Sleep;</hi> which, as you have heard, refers only to the Body. Now the death of the Righteous may be thus ſet forth on the following accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Body is then eaſed of all its Pains, and freed from all Fatigue and Toil to which it was expos'd while ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with the Soul: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Death is compar'd to Sleep, ſo the Grave is compar'd<note place="margin">Iſa. 57. 2.</note> to a Bed, where the righteous are ſaid to reſt. In this Life the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45330:23"/>
beſt of Men are frequently made uneaſy by acute Diſtempers and corroding Pains; and Death is frequently ſought for, becauſe Life is a burden. You that have frequently viſited the Chambers of the ſick, cannot ſurely have forgotten the ſighs of thoſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners who have groan'd upon Beds of Down, as if every part of their Bodies had been violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extended on a Rack. It would be endleſs to reckon up the vaſt number of Diſeaſes that affect the Children of God in this World: for being tainted with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Sin, as well as the vileſt of the People, they may expect the ſame Diſtempers; and tho they tarry here but a few days, they are ordinarily full of trouble, and if their Bodies are not often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd, yet thro the Malice of Enemies, and the Miſeries and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45330:24"/>
Unkindneſſes of their Friends, they are frequently made to bow towards the Grave before they drop into it. For indeed the beſt of our earthly Comforts have their hidden ſtings, but they ſhall give us no more pain and uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs after we are fallen aſleep in<note place="margin">Job 3. 17, 18.</note> Jeſus. <hi>For in the Grave the wicked ceaſe from troubling; there the weary be at reſt: there the Priſoners reſt together, they hear not the voice of the Oppreſſor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In Sleep no labour is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the Body; ſo when Believers are overtaken with a mortal ſlumber, Chriſt expects no Service from their Bodies. While the Soul continues united to the Body, we are oblig'd to yield the Members of the one as well as the Faculties of the other<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 13.</note> as <hi>Inſtruments of Righteouſneſs unto God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but in a ſtate of ſeparation
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45330:24"/>
there is expected neither Service nor Suffering from the Body. So that while we continue on the Stage of this World, the Advice of the wiſe Man is very proper: <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9. 10.</note> 
               <hi>it with thy might; for there is no Work, nor Device, nor Knowledg, nor Wiſdom in the Grave whither thou goeſt.</hi> All our vital and animal Operations ſhall ceaſe when our Spirits return to God, and our Bodies are reduc'd to Duſt. The one is fix'd in an unalterable ſtate of Happineſs or Miſery, and the other put into an incapacity for Action.</p>
            <p>A middle place betwixt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell for departed Spirits is a groundleſs Imagination; for it could not be ſaid with truth, that ſuch as die in the Lord <hi>reſt from</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 13.</note> 
               <hi>their Labours,</hi> if they were to paſs into a refining Fire, equally tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45330:25"/>
in degree, but not in duration with that of Hell, as thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faction aſſert. Therefore let us rather attend to the words of our Lord, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low<note place="margin">Joh. 9. 4.</note> his Example; <hi>I muſt work the Works of him that ſent me, while it is day; the night cometh when no Man can work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Death to the Righteous is diſarm'd of its ſting, and being alter'd in its nature it may ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſet forth by the notion of Sleep. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 56.</note> 
               <hi>the ſting of Death is Sin, and the ſtrength of Sin is the Law.</hi> Death receives its deſtroying Power from Sin, and Sin from the Law; Sin being a Tranſgreſſion of the Law, which diſcovers its odious nature, and denounces Damnation for it. But Death approaches Believers without its ſting, Chriſt having yielded an indefective Obedience
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45330:25"/>
to the Law, and ſuffer'd the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it in the room and ſtead of Believers. Hence ſays the Apoſtle; <hi>There is therefore now no condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> 
               <hi>to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus. Chriſt hath redeem'd 'em from the Curſe</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>of the Law, being made a Curſe for 'em.</hi> And the Apoſtle repreſents Believers as triumphing over Death in ſuch terms as theſe; <hi>O Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 55, 57.</note> 
               <hi>where is thy Victory?—Thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt has remov'd the ſcandal of Death by dying, and perfum'd the Grave by lying in it, and paſſing through it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Death of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous is compar'd to a Sleep, on the account of what ſhall follow thereupon: for as men do awake after Sleep, ſo they ſhall revive after Death, as we are aſſur'd
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45330:26"/>
by a very remarkable Prophecy<note place="margin">Hoſ. 13. 14.</note> and Promiſe; <hi>I will ranſom them from the Power of the Grave, I will redeem them from Death: O Death, I will be thy Plagues; O Grave, I will be thy Deſtruction: repentance ſhall be hid from mine eyes.</hi> In which words we muſt conſider the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet as perſonating of Chriſt, and uttering the Triumphs of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Conqueror: which contain a glorious Promiſe to all the Elect of a Victory over Death, which ſhall be partially accompliſh'd at the time of their Diſſolution, but finally conſummated in the day of the Reſurrection: <hi>for Death hath not ſuch a power over the living, nor the Grave over the dead, as Chriſt hath over both, to deſtroy the one, and ſwallow up the other in victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe ſeveral things laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, compoſe a very ſolid Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to diſſwade from immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45330:26"/>
ſorrow for thoſe that ſleep in Jeſus. But this leads to the</p>
            <p>Second Argument which the Apoſtle urges upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which is drawn from the great advantage that ſhall follow the death of the Righteous: <hi>ſuch as ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which either ſuppoſes or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys theſe ſeveral things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt, who is God-man, will make his ſecond appearance or coming at the end of the world. I underſtand God in my Text perſonally for the Son. <hi>To them that look for him</hi> (ſays the<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 28.</note> Author to the <hi>Hebrews) ſhall he appear the ſecond time without Sin unto Salvation.</hi> There is a double coming of Chriſt mentioned in Scripture; the firſt in the Form of a Servant, the ſecond with all the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45330:27"/>
Glory of an Incarnate God; at his firſt coming he was deſpiſed and rejected of Men, but at his<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 9, 10, 11.</note> ſecond <hi>every knee ſhall bow to him, of things in Heaven, of things on Earth, and things under the Earth; and every Tongue confeſs that he is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</hi> At his firſt coming he conceal'd his Glory by the Veil of his Fleſh; but at his ſecond he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to manifeſt and diſplay it in the moſt bright and majeſtick manner. At his firſt coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this World he was entertain'd in a Stable, and when he went out of it he expir'd upon an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Tree; but when he comes again, he will appear in the Clouds ſeated on <hi>a great white Throne,</hi> the Emblem of his unſpotted Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and regal Authority. At his firſt coming he was reproach'd and deſpis'd of the People, but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45330:27"/>
when he comes a ſecond time, his Enemies ſhall be ſtruck with a defenceleſs ſilence. And tho ſome may be ready to ſay, our Lord delays his coming, becauſe he has been conceal'd from their ſight for ſeveral Ages by the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Heaven, yet know it will not be long e're he that ſhall come will come, and will not tarry; the Curtains ſhall ſhortly be drawn, and the Scenes of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall open; 'tis as certain that he will come as if the Event was paſt, or as if we now ſaw the Heavens open, and he moving towards us in the Chariot of a bright Cloud. But, Lord, what will his Enemies do in the great Day of his Wrath! how will they bear the lightning of his Eyes, the ſmoke of his Breath, the thunder of his Voice, the weight of his Arm, and the terrors of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45330:28"/>
his Wrath, who have deſpiſed his Grace, blaſphem'd his Perſon, and ſpurn'd at the ſounding Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of his Love?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It implies the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their Bodies who ſleep in Jeſus. Chriſt cannot bring them with him in the Clouds of Heaven, unleſs he firſt fetch 'em from the bowels of the Earth, and the bottom of the Sea; for at the ſound of the laſt Trump, all the Elements ſhall give up their Dead. Believers ſhall not always continue under the power of Death, but ſhall be reviv'd incorruptible and immortal. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to Reaſon, not improv'd by the ſupernatural Light of Divine Revelation, it ſeems an<note place="margin">Acts 26. 8.</note> incredible thing that God ſhould raiſe the Dead. <hi>Pliny</hi> reciting thoſe things which he thought not to be in the Power of God,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45330:28"/>
mentions theſe two, <hi>Mortales aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate donare, aut revocare defunctos, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. And tho there are various things in Nature which are ſhadows of the Reſurrection, yet I am inclined to think they would never have convinc'd us of it, had not the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd it to us. The Earth has been repreſented as a kind of Grave or Sepulchre to the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table World; where (as one<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſal.</note> obſerves) the vital Powers are ſealed up and ſtifled all the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and yet at Spring are actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, expand and ſend forth a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Verdure. So a grain of Corn is not quicken'd except it rot and die: Our ſleep every night is the Image of Death, and our awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the morning a ſhadow of the Reſurrection. Now altho from theſe circular Revolutions of Nature, a probable Argument
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45330:29"/>
for the Reſurrection may be drawn; yet thoſe that are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and concluding, are only to be fetch'd from the Fountain of Truth, <hi>The ſure Word of Prophecy.</hi> And if it ſhould be ſaid, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Heathens believ'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Body; that may be accounted for two ways, either Tradition might hand it down from <hi>Noah,</hi> or they might gain light in this Doctrine by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with the Writings of the <hi>Old Teſtament:</hi> for I think nothing is more evident, than that a great many Heathen Authors have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed the brighter Notions that adorn their Books, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, as ſeveral Learned Men have abundantly prov'd. So that I ſay, the only infallible aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance we have of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body, is founded on Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:45330:29"/>
It will therefore be neceſſary that I recite a few paſſages of Scripture before I proceed. The firſt I ſhall mention is the words of <hi>Job: I know that my Redeemer</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 19. 25, 26.</note> 
               <hi>liveth; and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the Earth. And tho after my skin worms deſtroy this Body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God; whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and my eyes ſhall behold, and not another, tho my reins be conſumed within me.</hi> Which Text, tho by ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a providential Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, yet I think not without ſome force upon it: for I cannot ſee any neceſſity of taking it in a figurative and improper ſenſe. I am ſure that St. <hi>Clement,</hi> who was not only contemporary with St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, but his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and Fellow-labourer, in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> cites this Text to prove the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45330:30"/>
of the Body, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it in a literal proper ſenſe. But that paſſage which is yet more plain and full, is the words of our Bleſſed Saviour:<note place="margin">John 5. 28, 29.</note> 
               <hi>Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the Graves ſhall hear his Voice, and ſhall come forth; they that have done good, unto the Reſurrection of Life; and they that have done evil, to the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Damnation.</hi> Which Text is ſo expreſſive of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body, that it needs no Comment. It alſo proves that the very ſame Body that fell by Death, ſhall ariſe again; for if it be not the very ſame Body which was laid in the Grave that is call'd forth by Chriſt's powerful Voice, 'tis not properly a Reſurrection, but a new Production of the ſame ſpecifick Being. But when I ſpeak of the Reſurrection of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45330:30"/>
               <hi>Body,</hi> I aſſert that there ſhall not only be rais'd the ſame ſpecifical, but the ſame numerical <hi>Body;</hi> not only the ſame <hi>Body</hi> for kind, but for ſubſtance: not that I affirm that every individual Particle that compos'd the <hi>Body</hi> when it died, ſhall be rais'd up again, but ſo much of the Matter that made up the neceſſary conſtituent parts of it. Now of what is neceſſary, I think an ingenious Modern gives a very probable account; his words are theſe: <q>By neceſſary<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> Parts, <hi>ſays he,</hi> I mean thoſe which remain after the utmoſt degree of Maceration, without which the <hi>Body</hi> would not be integral, but imperfect. And theſe are chiefly the Bones, the Skin, the Nerves, the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, the Ligaments, and the ſubſtance of the ſeveral Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. As long as theſe and all
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45330:31"/>
that are neceſſary to Life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, the <hi>Body</hi> is truly whole, tho never ſo much macerated.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But before I go off from this Head, I would make a remark upon one Phraſe, which is within the compaſs of my Text, and I think proves the Identity of the dying and riſing <hi>Body;</hi> and that is Death's being ſet forth by Sleep, which would be very improper, if the very <hi>Bodies</hi> that ſleep in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and are dead, ſhould not be awaken'd and reviv'd in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>There is but one thing more I ſhall ſtay to mention, farther to ſupport this important Article, and 'tis the inſtance given by the Apoſtle of thoſe that ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live at Chriſt's ſecond coming:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 51.</note> he tells us, <hi>they ſhall not all ſleep, but they ſhall all be chang'd.</hi> Now this Change muſt refer to the qualities
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45330:31"/>
of their <hi>Bodies,</hi> not to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of 'em: we cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that by being chang'd, he means that the whole ſubſtance of their <hi>Bodies</hi> ſhould be annihilated, and that they ſhall have quite new <hi>Bodies</hi> form'd out of other matter. Moreover let me obſerve, that ſhould thoſe very <hi>Bodies</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, and new ones united to thoſe Souls, the deſtruction of the <hi>Body</hi> and the breach of the union would be Death; whereas the Apoſtle aſſerts <hi>all ſhall not die.</hi> So that upon the whole I argue thus: That if thoſe Perſons that are found alive at Chriſt's ſecond coming ſhall retain their old <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> only with new Qualities, then thoſe that are rais'd from the Dead ſhall have the ſame <hi>Bodies</hi> which were formerly join'd to their Souls, only with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of new Qualities. For
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45330:32"/>
what reaſon can any man aſſign, that the Saints that ſhall be alive when Chriſt ſhall come to judg the World, ſhould be caught up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air with their old <hi>Bodies</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ennobled and refin'd, and thoſe that died ſhould have <hi>Bodies</hi> intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly new, and ſuch as were never united to their Souls before, ſuch as never were the Inſtruments ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſinning, or ſerving of God?</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle do's not barely tell us of the Saints being brought with God our Saviour at his appearing and Kingdom, which implys their Reſurrection, but he ſhews that their Reſurrection de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our Bleſſed Saviour: for ſays he, <hi>If we believe that Jeſus dy'd and roſe again, even ſo them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:45330:32"/>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Upon his death: <hi>for thrô death Chriſt hath deſtroy'd him that had the power of Death, that is the Devil.</hi> When men were doom'd to death for the breach of the Law, Chriſt changed conditions with 'em, and offer'd up his <hi>precious</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Blood</hi> as a Ranſom to God for 'em; ſo that our Saviour was victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in dying, and conquer'd as he expir'd on the infamous Tree. He bruis'd the head of the old Serpent, and ſilenc'd the <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's</hi> of a broken Law, when in the ſharpeſt Agony, and amidſt a thouſand torments, he bowed his head and gave up the Ghoſt. I confeſs that his own Exaltation and Triumphs began with his Reſurrection; but if there had not been an infinite ſatisfying Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in his Death, he had been ſo faſt fetter'd with the bonds of Death, that he could never have burſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45330:33"/>
'em: but having offer'd a Sacrifice of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour to God, which was of infinite worth and conſideration, the pains of death<note place="margin">Acts 2. 24.</note> were loos'd, for 'twas impoſſible he ſhould be held by 'em: naturally impoſſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe of his irreſiſtible Power as God; legally impoſſible, becauſe he had paid the full De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Law and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our Reſurrection from the Grave depends on the Reſurrection of Chriſt. Chriſt's Reſurrection from the dead proves that ours is not only poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but infallibly certain. And this St. <hi>Paul</hi> reaſons upon in a very convincing manner: <hi>Now if</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt be preach'd that he roſe from the dead, how ſay ſome among you, that there is no Reſurrection of the dead? q. d.</hi> How can any deny either the poſſibility or certainty of the Reſurrection of the <hi>Body,</hi> ſince
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45330:33"/>
Chriſt has evidenced both by his own Reſurrection from the Dead? Chriſt has remov'd both the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and natural impoſſibility of our revival after death, the one by his abundant Merit, and the other by his own triumphant Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: for having taken away the guilt of our Sins which is the cauſe of Death, Death which is the conſequent of Sin ſhall be deſtroy'd and ſwallow'd up in victory. And our Lord declares, <hi>That he is the Reſurrection and the</hi>

The Apoſtle alſo aſſures us, that <hi>tho they are ſown natural, they ſhall be rais'd ſpiritual Bodies; i. e.</hi> the Matter of 'em ſhall be exalted and improv'd to an extraordinary degree of fineneſs: for Matter is properly enough ſaid to be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual when 'tis much refin'd. And how great a difference may we obſerve in material things; for inſtance, betwixt the animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the Brain, and the groſſer parts of the Body; betwixt a lump of Clay, and the refin'd matter of the Air; betwixt the Earth and the Sun that ſhines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, yet all material Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45330:35"/>
from which we may collect what Chriſt can do to exalt and refine our bodies in the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. But farther, they may be called Spiritual, in that they will be much better fitted to ſerve our Spirits than they are now. Here our Bodies are oftentimes a clog and a hindrance to us; but in the Reſurrection they ſhall be like Wings to our Souls, or to uſe the Phraſe of the Antients, <hi>They ſhall be as a Celeſtial Chariot to the Soul;</hi> they ſhall neither be the cauſe of our ignorance, nor of our ſinning, as they are now; they ſhall not hinder, but rather help forward our Devotions. In a word, they ſhall never ſuffer nor die more, for they ſhall be rais'd immortal and incorruptible; the one reſpects a deliverance from Death, the other a freedom from Diſeaſes: ſo that Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibility
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45330:36"/>
is an addition to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of immortal Creatures; for if Perſons ſhould never die, yet if they were often diſeaſed, their happineſs would be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat: but the rais'd Bodies of the Saints ſhall never know any more ſorrow, ſickneſs, or death; it ſhall not be in the power of any Creature to diſorder the curious Contexture of the rais'd Bodys.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Saints being brought with Chriſt at his ſecond coming, does not only ſuppoſe their Reſurrection, but that with their rais'd Bodys they ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend up into the Air. And ſo much the Apoſtle aſſerts a little<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 15, 17.</note> after my Text; <hi>For this we ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you by the Word of the Lord, that</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:45330:36"/>
               <hi>we which are alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord, ſhall not prevent them which are aſleep.—For we ſhall be caught up together with them in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air: and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord.</hi> Whether thoſe that are rais'd from the dead, and thoſe that ſhall be chang'd who never died, ſhall be caught up into the Air by the immediate attractive Power of Chriſt, or by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Angels, I will not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but that they ſhall aſcend in order to their coming with him, is beyond all diſpute: and probably their Bodies may be ſo refin'd, that they may be capable of treading Air, and mounting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as eaſily as they now move upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Being brought with Chriſt at his ſecond coming, ſhall be to illuſtrate the Glory of our
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45330:37"/>
incarnate God, and to advance the happineſs of his redeemed ones. They ſhall attend their Lord's Triumph, and make up a part of his magnificent Retinue: for as he ſhall come <hi>to be admir'd</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:45330:37"/>
I proceed now to make ſome improvement of what I have ſaid. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This Doctrine that I have deliver'd, diſcovers to us the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Chriſtian Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Life and Immortality is brought to light by the Goſpel.</hi> All that has been ſaid by Heathen Poets and Philoſophers concerning a Future State, was but obſcure Conjecture to the ſhining Revelation of the Goſpel. They underſtood not that the ſting of Death was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd by the ſufferings of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, or that the Body ſhould be rais'd with a tranſcendent Luſtre and Dignity, to receive a Reward with the Soul. Yea, under the Moſaick Oeconomy, a future State was but obſcurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd; but under the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, we have a moſt charming Landskip of Heaven,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45330:38"/>
and the way to obtain it is ſet in the moſt clear and certain light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Doctrine may be improv'd to guard good men againſt the ſlaviſh fears of Death. Why ſhould the Righteous be afraid to repoſe upon a bed of duſt? Death is but a ſleep, from which we ſhall be awaken'd in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Reſurrection; and Chriſt, as you have heard, hath diſarm'd Death of its Sting, and alter'd it in its very nature to the Righteous. I confeſs, I do not wonder that the wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane are afraid of Death, for they know it puts a period to their Pleaſures, and begins their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; it ſnatches them from the joys of Life, and fixes 'em under the agonies of the ſecond Death. So that ſome not only fear Death it ſelf, but the very name of it is terrible: which occaſion'd a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45330:38"/>
Prince that I have read of, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the mention of it in all his Court. Yea ſo enſlav'd are ſome by the fear of Death, that they conceive an abhorrence at the ſight of a Coffin, the dreſs of Mourners, and the ſolemnities of a Funeral; which (as one ſays) are only the Outguards that make up the Retinue of the King of Terrors.</p>
            <p>'Tis reported of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who had often encounter'd the numerous Armies of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Monarchs, and deſpis'd the terror of Battels, yet when he was ſeiz'd with a mortal Diſeaſe in <hi>Babylon,</hi> he was ſo afraid of Death, that his Court was fill'd with Diviners and Victims, and all the little arts of Superſtition were us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to preſerve his Life. And indeed all men have juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear Death, who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45330:39"/>
but a gloomy proſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, the terrible apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of an angry God, and a tormenting <hi>Tophet.</hi> But ſuch whoſe guilt is remov'd by the Blood of Chriſt, and their Souls renew'd and cleans'd by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, have no reaſon to fear Death, for it approaches 'em without a ſting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From the Doctrine I have eſtabliſh'd, we learn of what neceſſity it is to be united to Chriſt; for 'tis only ſuch that ſhall have part in the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, over whom the ſecond Death ſhall have no power; 'tis only ſuch as die in the Lord, <hi>i. e.</hi> united to Chriſt by the Spirit and Faith, that are ſaid to ſleep in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and that God our Saviour will bring with him. I know that ſome men think themſelves <hi>very witty,</hi> when they ridicule the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45330:39"/>
Doctrine of Union with Chriſt; but I am ſure they are <hi>very miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> if we may take the word of an Apoſtle for it, who ſays, <hi>that if any</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> Now none but ſuch as belong to Chriſt ſhall attend his Triumph at the laſt day, and reign with him in his immoveable Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> How great are our Obligations to our Redeemer, who hath alter'd the very nature of Death by dying in our ſtead, and given us aſſurance of our Reſurrection by his own riſing from the dead. O the heights, the depths, the lengths, the breadths of the Love of God in Chriſt Jeſus! O, ſhall not our Hearts burn with a grateful flame! and ſhall not his unexampled Love render him exceeding precious to our Souls, and cauſe us to ſtrike up
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45330:40"/>
with the Church Triumphant,<note place="margin">Rev. 5. 12,</note> 
               <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain to receive Power, and Riches, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Bleſſing, for ever and ever!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> How little reaſon have thoſe that are united to Chriſt, to deſire any long tarry in this World, which is a ſink of Sin and Sorrow, a place of gloomineſs and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; where we conſtantly ſuffer, and are always in danger of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Moreover, while here, we are kept from our Inheritance and our Father's Houſe: Therefore it better becomes a true Member of Chriſt's Myſtical Body, to deſire rather <hi>to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> How great is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the death of a Believer and that of an Infidel.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi>
               </note> 
               <q>They may both fall by the ſame diſeaſes, and their Duſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45330:40"/>
be mingled in the ſame Pit; but their immortal part will be everlaſtingly divided: There is a great Gulf fixed between the Spirits in Priſon, and the Souls in Paradiſe.</q> We read that when the rich Man died, <hi>in Hell be lift up his Eyes, being in Torments;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 16. 22, 23.</note> but when the religious Beggar left this World, he <hi>was carried by Angels into</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Boſom.</hi> An impenitent Sinner at death loſes the very Shadows that he courted for Happineſs; but the Saint heightens his Felicity into Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Mark the perfect Man, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 37.</note> 
               <hi>the upright; for the end of that Man is peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If ſuch as ſleep in Jeſus God will bring with him, then let us not ſorrow like thoſe without hope when God removes our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Friends by death, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch whom we have good
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45330:41"/>
ground to believe are fallen aſleep in Jeſus, as bleſſed be God we have of that excellent and worthy Gentleman Mr. <hi>ABBOTT,</hi> whoſe Death has given the ſad occaſion to this Diſcourſe: And is he dead? Well, but his Name lives, and will be freſh and fragrant to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. And I cannot do Juſtice to his Memory, without taking notice of thoſe Graces and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that eminently ſhin'd in his Converſation and Conduct; for <hi>the Memory of the juſt ſhall be bleſſed, and the righteous ſhall be had in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not now to give the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of one that dwelt in a ſhade, but of one whoſe publick Imploys expos'd him to a continual view, ſo that I doubt not of a crowd of Witneſſes to atteſt the truth of what I ſhall ſay. I confeſs, to collect all that was excellent and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45330:41"/>
imitable in the deceas'd Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is too big a task for ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful a Perſon as I am, who can but lay the dead Colours of his Character, and muſt leave the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſtrokes to more artful Hands, to Men of better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of greater compaſs of Thought, and exactneſs of Stile. I muſt own I am at a loſs where to begin, and what part of his excellent Character I ſhall inſiſt upon; but I think his Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God may properly enough be ſpoken of in the firſt place.</p>
            <p>He began very early to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, devoted to Heaven the flouriſhing bloom of his Youth, the firſt and beſt of his time; he had well ſtudied and digeſted the great Articles of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, and had right Notions of the Perſon and Mediatory Work of Chriſt, which had a mighty
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45330:42"/>
influence into his whole Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; for tho he liv'd in a crowd and hurry of buſineſs, yet he loſt not his Religion in the midſt of it, but kept cloſe to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publick Duties of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip.</p>
            <p>With what ſeriouſneſs and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence did he attend on Sermons, and what Pains did he take in the writing and repeating of 'em? which was the more extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe his publick Imploys engag'd him in writing even to toil and fatigue.</p>
            <p>He was not a Gentleman that affected Singularity, or pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to more Purity than other Chriſtians; but there was a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive gracefulneſs that attended his acts of Piety and Devotion, which he manag'd without Pomp or Noiſe: this was an evidence of his great Humility, a Grace
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45330:42"/>
very conſpicuous in him, as ſome of the pooreſt in this place cannot but have obſerv'd, to whom he carried it as if they had been his Equals, which added a mighty luſtre to the reſt of his Virtues.</p>
            <p>His Zeal for ſpreading the great Truths of the Goſpel was ſtrong and regular, bright and flaming; for notwithſtanding his many ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Avocations, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem time to adviſe and aſſiſt in the promotion of ſubſtantial God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
            <p>His Sincerity was very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and viſible, for he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd always with great freedom, ſimplicity and plainneſs in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; he deteſted all Reſerves and Diſguiſes, 'twas too mean for him to appear in Maſquerade, tho Alamode: Integrity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd him from the meanneſs of Flattery, and he preſerv'd his
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45330:43"/>
Integrity amidſt a thouſand Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>He was a true <hi>Nathanael,</hi> who by the Grace of God (abating the common frailtys of human Life) might be ſaid to <hi>keep himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted from the World;</hi> for he acted like <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the Court of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> only with this difference, that he had not learn'd to ſwear by his Life.</p>
            <p>In his Family he was very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary, gave great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the beginnings of Piety, but deeply reſented the negligence of Servants or Children that ſhould abſent themſelves from Family-worſhip.</p>
            <p>The Company he moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, was ſuch where he might either do good, or receive it; and indeed I may ſay, that (like the Maſter he ſerv'd) <hi>he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout doing good;</hi> for as he ſought
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45330:43"/>
out Objects to exerciſe his Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon, ſo he would thank his particular Friends when they told him of any that were deſerving of his Alms, and would as chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully relieve 'em in the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and noble manner. He was never deaf to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Poor and Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor blind to the Marks of their Poverty; neither did he ſhut his Heart, his Purſe, or his Door againſt 'em: he did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh 'em well, and give them ſoft language, but afforded 'em ſolid Supplys. He was truly that liberal Man whom <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, that deviſeth liberal things: For as <hi>he was created in Chriſt Jeſus to good Works, ſo he did abound in all the Fruits of Righteouſneſs and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which are by Jeſus Chriſt to the Praiſe and Glory of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And tho he was thus rich
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45330:44"/>
in good Works, yet his charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſtributions were never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the ſound of a Trumpet, but diſpers'd to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in the moſt ſilent and ſecret way. <hi>He deliver'd the Poor that cry'd, and the Fatherleſs, and him that had none to help him; the bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon him, and he cauſed the Widow's heart to ſing for joy.</hi> Yet in all this he obſerved the Rule of our Saviour as near as poſſible, <hi>not let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his right hand know what his left hand did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He gave very liberally, tho ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry privately, to encourage the bringing up of a Pious and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Miniſtry in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that ſuch a Deſign was forming in <hi>London,</hi> he offer'd moſt generouſly to encourage it, but before it could be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd, cruel Death fetter'd thoſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45330:44"/>
hands that were always active in diſpenſing the moſt noble Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>And I think it no contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Branch of his Character, that he paid a deference and reſpect to all that were of the Sacred Order of the Miniſtry, under what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination ſoever they paſſed: Tho his Ears were not ſervilely boar'd to any, for he did not look on 'em as Lords of his Faith, but Helpers of his Joy. Yet, I ſay, he was not wanting to afford 'em the Teſtimonies of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. He gave liberally to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſeveral Lectures; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he encourag'd that which is carried on in this Place: for he was a Gentleman of univerſal Charity to all that bore the Image of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>He was very tender of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of all Men; and as he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45330:45"/>
could not endure to hear the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Men made a matter of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, ſo he always deeply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Reproaches and Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that are too commonly the Sauce of Converſation, and look'd upon a Man's good Name as too valuable to lie at the mercy of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Jeſter: ſo that I may ſay he was as free from raſh Cenſures, as he was from deſerving 'em.</p>
            <p>He was always ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any difference betwixt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Parties, which he did with that dexterity and impartiality, that that Man was ſuſpected to have a very bad Cauſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd his Arbitration.</p>
            <p>As to his acquitting himſelf in his publick Imploy, it was with that Honour that few Men in an Age do; he was ſo little charm'd with the glitter of Wealth, and his Mind was ſo imbu'd with the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45330:45"/>
Principles of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that he thought it below him to raiſe his Eſtate by the mean practices of Craft or Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Bribery or Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>He fear'd God and honour'd the King, and did not meddle with thoſe that are given to change: His Loyalty to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty <hi>William</hi> the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the remarkable Services he has done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in contributing towards ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Credit of the Nation at a time when it run very low, are too well known to need reciting here.</p>
            <p>Should I ſpeak of him as a Husband, a Parent, a Maſter, or a Friend, I may ſay without an <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> he had few Equals un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven; for never did I ſee a more affectionate Husband, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Father, pleaſant and faithful
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45330:46"/>
Friend. Yet all theſe things that I have mention'd, and a great many more I have not time to name, that are lovely and of good report, could not prevent his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeiz'd with a mortal Sickneſs;<note place="margin">Pſal. 89. 48.</note> 
               <hi>For what Man is he that liveth, and ſhall not ſee Death? Shall be deliver his Soul from the hand of the Grave? Selah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Illneſs was more violent and dangerous than was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally apprehended, till within a day or two before his Death: he then being ask'd concerning his hopes of eternal Life, declar'd, <hi>They were fix'd on the Satisfaction and Obedience of Chriſt, and that upon the Righteouſneſs of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer alone he reſted for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his Sins and everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</hi> But immediately after this he grew delirious, and ſo was render'd uncapable of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45330:46"/>
diſtinctly concerning Divine things; yet even while he was thus indiſpos'd, he deſir'd me to pray with him, and told me that he heartily joyn'd. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a few hours before he dy'd he lay a little compos'd, and we imagin'd that ſome revival would have enſu'd; ſo apt are we to flatter our ſelves with the belief of that which is the matter of our earneſt Wiſhes. But alas! one hour ſunk all expectation of Life, and the next put a Period to it.</p>
            <p>Thus liv'd and dy'd that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Perſon whoſe Deceaſe has occaſion'd this Diſcourſe; and tho he be dead, yet he ſpeaketh, and his Works praiſe him more in the Gate, than I have done from the Pulpit. Is he dead? he is not gone out of the World, but remov'd to a better part of it;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45330:47"/>
he has only chang'd his Place, his Company, and Work. Therefore you his ſorrowful ſurviving Half, and the reſt of his mourning Friends ſhould not think on him as loſt, but as ſet at liberty; not as decaying among the Clods of the Valley, but as ſhining on an illuſtrious Throne. Stop your Tears, for were he ſenſible of your Grief, and capable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a pauſe in the midſt of his Hallelujahs, he would ſay to you that ſurvive, <hi>Weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves.</hi> Therefore let us all think what Improvement to make of this ſudden and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Providence: And thoſe things that 'tis proper to inſtruct us in, I ſhall but juſt name, and conclude: Let this Providence put us on the moſt ſerious Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; <hi>In the day of adverſity conſider,</hi> ſays the wiſe Man. Let
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45330:47"/>
us conſider and reflect upon the vanity and uncertainty of human Life; ſurely when ſo bright and vigorous a Flame is ſo ſuddenly extinguiſh'd, that Scripture is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently fulfill'd that ſays, <hi>Verily Man in his beſt Eſtate is altogether Vanity.</hi> Let us learn a holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency to the things of this World; let us be convinc'd how ineffectual are all kind of means to preſerve Life when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is gone forth. If the Skill of Phyſicians, if the melting Affection of a Wife, and the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayers of Miniſters could have prevented the Death of our Friend, we had not been mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here at this time: Therefore let us adore the Soveraignty of God, who acts as he pleaſes, and gives no account of his Matters to the Children of Men. Let us truſt in the Lord, who changeth

not, and ſubmit to his diſpoſing Will, which is directed by Wiſdom and Love. Finally, prepare to follow; <hi>Be ye alſo ready:</hi> walk with God while you tarry here, that when he calls you out of this lower World, he may take you into his bliſsful Preſence, and ſay<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 21.</note> unto each of you, <hi>Well done, thou good and faithful Servant; thou haſt been faithful over a few things, I will make thee Ruler over many things: enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</hi>
