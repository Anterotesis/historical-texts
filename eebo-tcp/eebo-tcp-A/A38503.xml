         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>TO make ſome eſtimate of the
value which hath been from
time to time ſet on the Dictates of
<hi>Epictetus,</hi> we may content our
ſelves with this remark, that ſo
many Learned Hands have been
employ'd either in the rendring
of them into other Languages, or
the explication of them in his
own. In the <hi>Latine,</hi> there are
many Verſions, of all which it is
not our deſign here to give any
<pb facs="tcp:49014:5"/>
particular account. In <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
I cannot find that it hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
above once before, done as
cloſe as could be to the Original,
and as well as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could
bear it: which Edition came out
about the year 1610. entituled,
<hi>The Manual of Epictetus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
eminent Perſons ſpent their
pains about it, among whom Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieur
<hi>Boileau</hi> is the laſt, and
conſequently the moſt exact, in
regard he had conſulted all that
had gone before him on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
His labours herein prov'd
ſo acceptable, that in few years his
Work came to a third Impreſſion,
<pb facs="tcp:49014:5"/>
which appearing abroad in the
year 1667. is the Original of
this Tranſlation. It ſeems, in the
precedent Editions Monſ. <hi>Boile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>au</hi>
had intituled it <hi>The Enchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridion
of Epictetus;</hi> but in the
laſt, out of complyance with the
advice of ſome <hi>Friends,</hi> and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
that ſome Words, as they
are not ſo eaſily pronounc'd, ſo are
they not ſo eaſily naturaliz'd as
others, he put out that Title, and
call'd it, the <hi>Philoſophy of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pictetus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Du Vair,</hi> who ſome
years ſince tranſlated this Tract,
was pleas'd to call it alſo the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
of Epictetus.</hi> But our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb facs="tcp:49014:6"/>
declin'd that name too, partly
out of a conſideration that the
Word <hi>Manual</hi> ſeems to be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
conſecrateed to Works of
<hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> and partly,
that <hi>Enchiridion</hi> is a <hi>Greek</hi>
Term, which, in this place, properly
ſignifies a <hi>Ponyard.</hi> The reaſon
alledged by <hi>Simplicius,</hi> why <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
gave it that Title, is this;
That, as Ponyards are light
Armes, which we commonly carry
about us, to be us'd when we are
ſurpriz'd by our Enemies: So
ſhould we always have this little
Book before our eyes, that we may
the better oppoſe the aſſaults of
our Paſſions, a kind of domeſtick
<pb facs="tcp:49014:6"/>
Enemies, whereof we ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
diſtruſtfull. Had our Author
been ſatiſfy'd with this fancy of
<hi>Simplicius,</hi> he would ſtill have
entituled his Book, the <hi>Ponyard
of Epictetus;</hi> but ſomewhat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly,
inaſmuch as beſides that
it might have frighted ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
it ſounded not well to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
either defenſive or offenſive
Armes to <hi>Epictetus,</hi> a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
ſo ſignall for his Conſtancy
and Patience. Vpon which refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
he thought beſt to call it
ſimply the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctetus.</p>
            <p>Monſ. <hi>Boileau</hi> affirms further
of himſelf, that, for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
<pb facs="tcp:49014:7"/>
of the Original Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
he got all the helps he could
out of the Diſcourſes of <hi>Arrian</hi>
and the <hi>Greek</hi> Commentary of
<hi>Simplicius,</hi> an excellent Work,
comprehending the whole <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of the <hi>Stoicks.</hi> He ſaies alſo,
that, among the many <hi>Latine</hi>
Verſions, he kept moſt cloſely to
thoſe of <hi>Politian</hi> and <hi>Wolfius,</hi>
as the moſt exactly done; not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
the late labour of <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
upon this <hi>Piece,</hi> in a large
Commentary upon that of <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what our Authour moſt
eſteems in this Work of his, is the
<hi>Life of Epictetus,</hi> which had
<pb facs="tcp:49014:7"/>
not been written in any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
before, and conſequently
muſt require the greater pains,
ſince it was to be collected out of
ſo many ſeveral Authors. Had he
pleas'd he might have made it
larger; but ſome things have
been omitted, that it might be the
more proportion'd to this Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment.</p>
            <p>At the end of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
follows <hi>Cebes's Tablet,</hi>
that is, an <hi>Embleme,</hi> or
<hi>Repreſentation</hi> of <hi>Humane
Life,</hi> before which there is a
Preface giving an account of
it. Theſe two Pieces have
been for the moſt joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb facs="tcp:49014:8"/>
partly upon a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the allyance of the
Subject, and partly upon that
of their Antiquity.</p>

that amongſt the Inſtructions he gave

and after him, <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> who
alſo pretends that this Epigram is not
<hi>Epictetus</hi>'s, and that it was added to <hi>A.
Gellius</hi> by ſome <hi>not-deeply-learnt</hi> perſon.
All the reaſon he gives of it, is, That it
is not found in an ancient Manuſcript
of <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi>'s: I am apt to believe
it might be ſo. But if this conjecture
be true; it must be alſo granted, that
the ſame <hi>not-deeply-learned</hi> perſon had
got it added to <hi>Macrobius,</hi> who cites it,
as <hi>Epictetus</hi>'s, in the firſt Book of his
<hi>Saturnalia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">c. 11.</note> and brings in the ſame words
of <hi>Aulus Gellius.</hi> But indeed the reaſon,
arguing this Epigram not to be <hi>Epicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>'s,
is this, that it cannot eaſily be
preſum'd, a Philoſopher, ſo remarkable
for his modeſty and humility, as he was,
ſhould ſpeak ſo advantageouſly of his
own worth.</p>
            <p>Howere it might be, this is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49014:17"/>
that Fortune had not the leaſt
kindneſs for <hi>Epictetus;</hi> yet did not her
Perſecutions ever oblige him to make
his addreſſes ever the more to Great
Perſons. <hi>They are very much to blame,</hi>
ſaid he ſometimes,<note place="margin">Arr. <hi>Diſſ. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 19.</note> 
               <hi>to pride themſelves in
the conceit that ſo many court them with their
reſpects and ſervices. Do they imagine, that
it is for their own ſakes all theſe ſubmiſſions
are made? Everyone, as to that particular
minds his own concern, which taken away they
are ſoon ſlighted. They are juſtly ſerv'd, as
Aſſes are: If they be rubb'd or curry'd, it is
in order to ſome ſervice to be got out of them.
So we reverence thoſe men, as men do the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
at</hi> Rome. <hi>If Altars be erected to her, it
is out of a fear of the hurt ſhe may do. But
what ſo great miſchief,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arr. <hi>Diſſ. l 2 c.</hi> 6.</note> continu'd he, <hi>are we
afraid of at their hands? The worst they can
do is to ſend us into another World. What mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
it? Must we not alwaies expect death?
Are not all the waies of Death equal? And
is not that, through which a Tyrant ſends us,
many times the ſhorteſt and the eaſiest? In a

Whereas a Feaver is ſometimes above a year
ere it diſpatches him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>When he met with any of those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49014:17"/>
who are of opinion they tranſcend
others, becauſe they are in favour with
the Prince, or can derive their Pedigree
from a long ſeries of Anceſtors; he
treated them after a very pleaſant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
You imagine, <hi>ſaid he to them,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
your Grand-father was <hi>Conſul,</hi>

Father a <hi>Senator,</hi> and you are <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,</hi>
that you are more at liberty, and of
better quality than another. Know that you are
more a Slave, than the meaneſt Slave among
the popular, and that the condition of ſuch a one
is better than yours. For if he be ill-treated
ſometimes by an imperious Maſter, you are
continually domineer'd over and tormented by
Ambition, or ſome other Paſſion. The only
advantage you have over him is, that he is but
a Slave in ſome courſe-cloath, and you are one
in a Scarlet-coat. Beſides, if he does not his
duty, he must expect the laſh or ſome ſuch pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment;
whereas, if you do not yours, you are
ſomewhat more honourably dealt withal; for
your head is ſtruck off, as beſeems a Favourite
of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>Thus were Perſons of quality treated
by <hi>Epictetus:</hi> So that his extream po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
aud the meanneſs of his extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
could not check him out of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of making ſport at their Wealth,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49014:18"/>
and imaginary Grandeurs: His vertue
had exalted him above all thoſe things,
And though Fortune alwaies wreak'd
her malice upon him, yet would he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
repine, but paſſ'd away his life in
perpetual content.</p>
            <p>But if he might juſtly complain of
the niggardlyneſs of Fortune towards
him, as to corporeal accommodations;
he was on the other ſide to acknowledge
the profuſeneſs of Heaven towards him,
as to the advantages of his Mind. It
ſeem'd the former had not declar'd her
ſelf his enemy; but that his triumph
over her might be the more glorious.
Nay, I dare affirm, that Bondage, and
the infirmity of his Body were the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
retinue of his Vertue, that it
might appear with greater luſtre to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.
For, without flattery, never
did any perſon force up conſtancy to ſo
noble a height.</p>
            <p>While he was yet a Slave to <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus,</hi>

I am confident, we ſhould have found
many other as great examples of his
Patience. Nor is it to be doubted, but
that a man, who ſo ſuffer'd his Leg to
be broken, had before made diſcoveries
of his Conſtancy upon ſeveral other
occaſions. And indeed this Vertue was ſo
attendant on him, that it forſook him
not even in the most conſiderable actions
of his Life. Thence it came that he ſaid,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49014:19"/>
               <hi>If your Oyle be ſpilt, or your Wine ſtollen out
of your Cellar; you are to make this refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in your ſelf, That by ſuch caſualties is
Conſtancy purchas'd.</hi> But if he maintain'd
theſe Maximes with much earneſtneſs,
he obſerv'd them with no leſs rigour.</p>
            <p>For one day this Philoſopher having
bought an Iron-lamp,<note place="margin">Arr. <hi>Diſſ. l. 2. c.</hi> 6.</note> which he thought
a very precious piece of Houſhold-ſtuff;
as he was in a deep meditation in
the Chimney-corner, a Thief came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Room, and ſtole away his Lamp,
without his perceiving of him. So that
a while after, <hi>Epictetus</hi> looking about,
and miſſing his Lamp, fell a ſmiling, and
without any diſturbance, ſaid, <hi>I ſhall
deceive this Thief to morrow, for if he come
for another Lamp, it ſhall be but an Earthen
one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True it is, we cannot affirm this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was of equal gallantry with the
former; yet, in my judgment, it is no leſs
remarkable. There is not ought
wherein the Genius of perſons is ſo
diſcoverable, as in their trivial things
inaſmuch as the Soul appears therein
as it were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtript of the diſguiſe of all

Intereſt, or Ambition cauſing
her, moſt commonly, to act contrary to
the natural bent of her inclination.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Philoſopher;
it may be truly ſaid, That never man
knew better how to ſuffer, than he did.
It was a Science he had learnt even
from his tendreſt age, and wherein he
improv'd himſelf to the laſt moment of
his life. He needed not Companions in
his misfortunes, that he might derive
Conſolation from their joynt-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
He never ſought any but in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and if his mind were ſenſible of
any grief, it was only of the grief of
others. He thought it the greateſt mark
of the malignancy of a corrupt nature,
to imagine evil leſs burthenſom, when
ſeveral other perſons participate of it
with us: as if our ſufferings were
heightned, or remitted, proportionably
to the augmentation or diminution of
theirs.</p>
            <p>According to this Principle was it,
that he affirmed thoſe perſons were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
who complain'd, that none
were unjuſtly dealt with but themſelves.
<hi>How,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if you are ſentenc'd to have
your head ſtruck off, would you have all other
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49014:20"/>
Men condemn'd to the ſame puniſhment; and
can you find no Conſolation, but in the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Mankind?</hi> Thence it came that
<hi>Epictetus</hi> ſo highly celebrated the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
and great courage of <hi>Lateranus.</hi>
For <hi>Nero</hi> having condemn'd him to have
his head ſtruck off, and the Execution<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
having but ſlightly wounded him at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
firſt blow, he had the heart to lift up
his head, and to ſtretch forth his neck
the ſecond time. Nay, a little before
his death, <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> making ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatives
to him about the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
he was charg'd withal, he undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
made this Anſwer; <hi>If I had any thing

               <hi>I would tell it thy Maſter, and not
Thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>Epictetus</hi> was the moſt reſolute,
and the moſt conſtant of all Men; ſo
were the judgments he made of Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Conſtancy, better and more
ſound, than thoſe of any other. For
though he were moſt intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with theſe two Vertues, as
being his firſt and moſt ancient inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
yet could he not endure them, if
they had the leaſt blemiſh, that rendred
them inſupportable. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he would not
have a Man to be heartleſs and coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49014:20"/>
ſo would he neither have him to
be temerarious. When a man might
go through a plain, or ſome eaſy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
he would not have advis'd him,
to take his way through ſteepy and
rough places. He was not of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of that Philoſopher,<note place="margin">Diog. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert. in vita</hi> Pyrrh.</note> who would
rather have a Cart paſs over his body,
then turn out of his way to avoid it.
<hi>Epictetus</hi> behav'd himſelf otherwiſe;
for when <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> made it his ſport
to break his legg, he generouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd
it; but if <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> had had
the good nature, to have forborn
that diverſion, he had very much
oblig'd him. He thought it as great
a vanity and ſhame, for a man to run
himſelf into danger, where there was
no neceſſity for the doing of it, as
there was honour and Virtue, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it, when his duty oblig'd him
thereto.</p>
            <p>But when Reaſon requir'd a man's
exposing of himſelf to danger, he
would then have him think of no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
but look on all inconveniencies
and difficulties as ſo many trials of
our Virtue, and occaſions, contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to our glory. <hi>Had</hi> Hercules,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49014:21"/>
ſaid he, ever been Hercules, if that
Lyon, that Hydra, that wilde Boar,
and all thoſe Monſters, whereof he disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd
the Earth, had not exercis'd his
courage? How is it to be imagin'd, he
ſhould come to the height he attain'd, if his
Virtue had not met with employment?
What advantage could we have made of all
his ſtrength, all his patience, and all his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
had he not embrac'd the occaſions of
making diſcoveries thereof? Not that it
is to be inferr'd hence, that he would
have a man wiſh to ſee whole Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
peſter'd with Lyons and Hydraes,
that he might thereby ſignalize his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour:
but he only maintain'd, That
the caſuall meeting with theſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
had made a fortunate diſcovery,
what kind of perſon Hercules was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epictetus</hi> ſaid further, that <hi>Helvidius</hi>
had been admirably well convinc'd of
this truth; that he had perfectly ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
theſe Maximes, and that never any
man had been more indivertible from
his Sentiments, then he. When he
once thought it his <hi>devoir,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
himſelf oblig'd in Conſcience
to do ſomething, though the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
the Senate, and the People ſhould
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49014:21"/>
have conſpir'd together, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
their joynt endeavours, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
what he was reſolv'd to do;
yet was not all that combination of
Emperour, Senate, and People able to
tempt him to the least act of mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>It happen'd one day, that <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>
was deſirous to get ſomething paſs'd
in the Senate. He, well acquainted
with the humour of <hi>Helvidius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arr. <hi>Diſſ. l. 1. c.</hi> 2.</note> and
knowing he would be ſure to oppoſe
it, forbad him to come that day into
the Senate. <hi>Helvidius</hi> having receiv'd
that meſſage made the Emperour this
return, That it was in his power
to deprive him of his charge; but that
while he continu'd a Senator, he could
not exempt himſelf from doing his
duty, and coming to the Senate. Be
it ſo, reply'd <hi>Veſpaſian;</hi> I am content
you ſhould come thither, conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you ſay nothing. If I am not
preſs'd to give my vote, anſwers <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidius,</hi>
I promiſe you to be ſilent.
But there is a neceſſity of my requiring
your advice, ſaies the Emperour.
There is in like manner, replies <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidius,</hi>
a neceſſity, that I ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49014:22"/>
you, and that I ſhould ſpeak what
I conceive juſt and reaſonable. If
you do ſo, and that it oppoſe what I
would have done, added <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> I
ſhall put you to death. When did I
ever tell you, replies <hi>Helvidius,</hi> that I
was immortall? you will execute your
charge, and I will endeavour to do the
like by mine. It may be your part to
ſentence me to baniſhment, and it is
mine chearfully to ſubmit thereto. It
is your part to order my death, and
mine, reſolutely and undauntedly to
receive it.</p>
            <p>I make the leſs difficulty to fall into
theſe little Digreſſions, becauſe I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that <hi>Plutarch</hi> is no enemy to the
like, and that they are not the meaneſt
Ornaments of the Lives which he hath
written.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epictetus</hi> was alſo a great admirer of
the Conſtancy expreſs'd by <hi>Agrippinus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arr l. r. c. 2.</note>
For, ſome one telling him, that an
Information, which concern'd his life
was put in againſt him in the Senate,
he made anſwer, I am glad of it; but
what time of the day is it? Being told,
it was about five in the After-noon,
Come, repli'd he, let us go to the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49014:22"/>
Bath, it is time to part. Being
return'd home a little while after,
news was brought him, that the
Information was found againſt
him. Well, ſaid he, what am I ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc'd
to? to Death? No, repli'd
he who brought him the tydings, you
are only condemn'd to baniſhment.
Very well, repli'd <hi>Agrippinus,</hi> let us
ſup to night at <hi>Aricia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epictetus</hi> had further a particular
veneration for <hi>Pyrrho,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Town a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Leagues from <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>Sceptick,</hi>
upon this account, that he put no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> He
eſteem'd above all the reply he made to
a certain perſon, who thought to
make ſome ſport with him. For that
man ſaying to him, Why doſt thou
not therefore dye, <hi>Pyrrho,</hi> ſince it is
indifferent to thee, whether thou
liveſt or dieſt? That is the very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it, repli'd he.</p>
            <p>In a word, <hi>Epictetus</hi> would have all
Philoſophy to conſiſt in Conſtancy
and Continence. Whence he had
allwaies theſe words in his mouth,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Bear</hi> and <hi>Forbear,</hi> but
the grace and energy of the ſaying is
much greater in the Greek, than in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49014:23"/>
any modern Languages. Thence it
came, that he was ſo much taken with
the procedure of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> towards a
<hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> who had ſtruck out one
of his Eyes. For the people having
deliver'd up the perſon to be puniſh'd;
<hi>Lycurgus,</hi> inſtead of revenging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon him, inſtructed him in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
Wherein when he had made a
conſiderable proficiency, he order'd
him to be brought upon the Theatre,
to the great aſtoniſhment of the
People, who thought him dead long
before; and ſaid to them, This man,
whom you deliver'd up to me as a
wicked and perfidious perſon, I now
return you vertuous and juſt.</p>
            <p>The more we look on <hi>Epictetus,</hi> as
an unbyaſs'd eſteemer of mens Actions;
the more glorious is it to the memory
of theſe great Perſons, to have had
ſuch an Approbator as he was. He, all
his life, made profeſſion of the <hi>Stoick</hi>
Philoſophy; that is, the ſevereſt and
moſt auſtere of all Antiquity. Never
was there any perſon who knew better
how to reduce to practice the Maximes
and Precepts of that Sect. For though
he may be numbred among the laſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49014:23"/>
that apply'd themſelves thereto, yet
was he one of the greateſt Ornaments
of it. In his Diſcourſes and Actions,
he imitated <hi>Socrates, Zeno,</hi> and <hi>Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
When he undertook any work,
he firſt conſider'd, what they would
have done, upon the like occaſion.
When he reprov'd, or inſtructed any
one, he alwaies entertain'd him with
ſome example of thoſe Philoſophers.
In fine, he look'd on them as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
infinitely tranſcending all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>But, above all, he had a particular
eſteem for <hi>Socrates,</hi> and had fram'd
himſelf to a ſtile like his. In his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
he us'd compariſons ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
and ſo pertinent, that he inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
won all to his Opinion. He was
ſo perſuaſive, that he forc'd even ſuch
as diſputed againſt him, to be witneſſes
of the truth he ſpoke. He was no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fector
of polite or elegant expreſſions;
but if his Diſcourſe were intelligible,
and full of good ſence, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of that of <hi>Socrates,</hi> he was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd.
In a word, He had propos'd that
Philoſopher to himſelf, as the model,
and rule of all his actions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:49014:24"/>
Though he much eſteem'd <hi>Pyrrho</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
yet had he ſo ſtrange a contempt
for the <hi>Pyrrhonians,</hi> that he could not
endure them. A certain Pyrrhonian
one day taking a great deal of pains to
prove, that the Senſes alwaies deceiv'd
men, he ſaid to him, <hi>Who of your Sect
intending to go to the Stoves, miſtook his
way, and went to the Mill?</hi> It was alſo
an ordinary ſaying with him,<note place="margin">Arr. <hi>Diſſ. l 2. c.</hi> 20.</note> 
               <hi>Were I a
Servant to ſome of theſe</hi> Pyrrhonians, <hi>I
ſhould take a pleaſure in tormenting them.
When they ſaid to me,</hi> Epictetus, <hi>poure
ſome Oyl into the Bath, I would caſt ſome
Brine on their heads. When they call'd for
Water-gruell, I would bring them Vineger.
And if they complain'd of that uſage, I
would tell them their ſenſes were deceiv'd,
and would perſwade them that Vineger and
Water-gruell was the ſame thing, or I
would make them renounce their own ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He declar'd himſelf a perpetuall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
of</hi> Opinion <hi>and</hi> Fortune, <hi>by whom
yet others thought the world go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd.</hi>
The greateſt part, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> of
thoſe things which we admire are but pure
fantaſticall humours. <hi>For inſtance,</hi> The
Iliad, which is ſo much talk'd of, is it not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49014:24"/>
a pure humour? An humour came into <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris's</hi>
head, to carry away <hi>Helene;</hi> ſhe
was in a humour to follow him, and <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
muſt needs be in an humour to be angry
at it. And this ſpeaking properly, is the
main deſign of the Iliad. But if <hi>Menelaus</hi>
had behav'd himſelf like a prudent man, and
had imagin'd, that he was no ſmall gainer,
by the loſs of ſuch a Wife, what had become
of the <hi>Iliad?</hi> Would not it, and the <hi>Odyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
have been clearly loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to Fortune,</hi> Epictetus <hi>compar'd
her to a Lady of Quality, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes
her ſelf to Servants, and the
meaneſt among ſuch. He ſaid</hi> that the
Life, which had any dependence on Fortune,
was like a Torrent after a violent ſhower,
muddy, foule, hard to be got over, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
and of ſhort continuance. <hi>He main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
on the contrary,</hi> that a minde addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to Vertue was like an unexhauſted ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
Spring, whoſe waters were clear,
ſweet and pleaſant to drink, in a word,
not chargeable with any manner of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>In like manner, it was his higheſt
care to heighten himſelf up more and
more towards perfection in the ſtudy
of vertue. He had renounc'd all other
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49014:25"/>
pleaſures, that he might the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively
proſecute thoſe of the mind.
When he was at any great Feaſt,<note place="margin">Stob. <hi>Ser.</hi> 1.</note> he
minded not ſo much the ſatisfaction of
his body, as that of his mind. For it
was his perſuaſion, that what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd
on the body periſh'd, and was
never recover'd again; whereas what
was beſtow'd on the mind conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
and was never loſt: For this
reaſon did he prefer the Tranquillity
and indiſturbance of the Soul, before
all other things imaginable. And he
held it for a Maxime, That as a man
would be loath to be caſt away in a
Ship, though it were ever ſo beautiful,
and loaden with Treaſures and wealth:
ſo how rich and ſumptuous ſoever a
Houſe may be, a man ſhould never be
ſo carefull in the preſerving of it, as to
be cruſh'd by the burthen of exceſſive
cares and diſquiets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This was alſo another ſaying of his.</hi>
If <hi>Perſia</hi> had been the place of your Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">Stob. <hi>Ser.</hi> 38.</note>
it is certain you would have had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to live in <hi>Greece;</hi> you would
only have wiſh'd to live happily in your own
Country. When therefore a man is born in
Poverty, to what end ſhonld he have the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49014:25"/>
ambition to be rich? Why does he not rather
frame himſelf to a contentedneſs in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and endeavour to live happily there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?
As it were better for a man never to
lye in any but a narrow Bed, and to have
his health; then to be ſumptuouſly lodg'd,
and to be ſick: So ought it to be a mans
wiſh rather to preſerve an indiſturb'd tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
and compoſure of mind, in a mean
condition, then be tormented with Grief
and Vexation, amidſt a greater liberality
of Fortune. We muſt not imagine, that
our unhappineſs proceeds from Poverty, but
from Ambition. Nor are we deliver'd
from fear, by Wealth, but only by reaſon.
Whence it comes, that he who makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of Reaſon is content in himſelf, and
charges not his grievances on Poverty.
<hi>Theſe were the reflections of</hi> Epictetus
<hi>on thoſe things whereof men make ſo
great account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He could not endure thoſe perſons,
who ſought pretences to conceal, or
juſtifie themſelves in their miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
He ſaid they imitated the <hi>Roman</hi>
Curtezans; who to cover their ſhame
and to juſtifie their Lewdneſs, made
their advantage of <hi>Plato's</hi> Books of
<hi>Common-Wealth;</hi> inaſmuch as that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49014:26"/>
would have women to be
common: not piercing into the ſenſe,
but lewdly interpreting the words of
that great man. For he does not hold
that a Woman married to one man
ſhould afterwards proſtitute her ſelf
to all others; but he would abrogate
that kind of Marriage between one
Man and one Woman, to introduce
another. For this reaſon <hi>Epictetus</hi>
never bethought himſelf of any excuſe,
when he was once ſenſible that he had
done amiſs: on the contrary, he was
never better pleas'd, than when his
miſcarriages were diſcover'd to
him.</p>
            <p>One day,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arr.</hi> Diſſ. l. 1. 6. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Rufus</hi> bitterly reproving
him, that he had not obſerv'd an omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in a Syllogiſme, he made anſwer.
I have not committed ſo great a crime,
as if I had ſet the Capitol on fire.
How, wretch, replies <hi>Rufus,</hi> doſt
thou think there is no other crime,
than that of firing the Capitol? <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctetus</hi>
was ſo far from being diſpleas'd
at ſo ſharp a retort, that he gave <hi>Rufus</hi>
thanks, and afterwards told the ſtory
to all the World.</p>
            <p>Another time a certain perſon, who
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49014:26"/>
had been very wealthy, but then was
fallen into extream Poverty, came and
intreated him to write on his behalf
to the People. <hi>Epictetus,</hi> glad to do
him any ſervice, writ him a moſt Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Letter, wherein he repreſented
and bemoan'd his misfortune, in ſuch
terms, as might have excited compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Perſons the leaſt inclin'd to any.
But when the other had read it, inſtead
of giving him thanks, he return'd it
him again, alledging, that his addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to him were out of hopes of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſome aſſiſtance from him, and
not of being bemoan'd, which he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not. That ſcornfulneſs ſo pleas'd
<hi>Epictetus,</hi> that he thought himſelf
more oblig'd to him for that Anſwer,
than if what Worthy perſon had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
him kindneſs, with the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating
Complements.</p>
            <p>But above all things, <hi>Epictetus</hi> was
extreamly nice in point of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi>
and there needs be no more ſaid, than
that he was a <hi>Stoick,</hi> to give ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
that he was ſincere and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſs'd.
He would not have a man

               </note> He was perſwaded, that it

No, no. True it is that a man ought to

that he may therewith relieve them, in their
neceſſities; but if you can direct me how
it may be gotten, in the age we live in, with

Goods, Conſider whether you are not very

a faithfull Friend before money?</hi> This
certainly was an Anſwer beſeeming a
true Philoſopher.</p>
            <p>But what's particularly obſervable
in <hi>Epictetus,</hi> is, that, of all the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Philoſophers, he had the beſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49014:29"/>
concerning the Deity, and the
greateſt inſight into our Myſteries.
His ſentiments are ſo conformable to
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> that St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as great
an enemy as he was to the ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
ſpeaks very advantageouſly
of this Man; nay ſo far, as to honour
him with the denomination of <hi>Most
Wiſe.</hi> And no doubt St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had
great reaſon to give him that Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arr.</hi> Diſſ. l. 1. c. 9. l. 2. c. 14.</note> ſince <hi>Epictetus</hi> was clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
of the Immortality of the
Soul, a great admirer of Providence,
a Mortall enemy to Impiety and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme,
acknowledg'd but one Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and made Modeſty, not to ſay,
Humility, the ground of his Morals,
as we have already obſerv'd.</p>
            <p>But what I more highly eſteem in
him, is, that having been Nurs'd up
in the Principles of the <hi>Stoick</hi> Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
he ſuck'd nothing of its bitter.
neſs, And that he had wean'd his mind
from moſt of its Errours and falſe
Maximes.<note place="margin">The <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks</hi> exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Wiſe Man above God.</note> In a word, He had no tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of thoſe inſolent Opinions, and
ridiculous qualifications, which the
<hi>Stoicks</hi> requir'd in their <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> or
Wiſe Man. A man who had reduc'd
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49014:29"/>
all his Philoſophy to Practice, and
one, who, by the acknowledgment of
all ſubſequent Ages ſince his time, was
the moſt knowing and the moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all the Philoſophers, ſuch a man,
I ſay, muſt needs be far from any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of his being above God. So
that if <hi>Epictetus</hi> was a <hi>Stoick,</hi> he was
a much more reform'd <hi>Stoick,</hi> than
any of the reſt. he had not ſo great a
Devotion for the School of <hi>Zeno,</hi> or
was ſo ſworn to the obſervance of his
Morality, as that he would not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
tranſgreſs the rules of it. On
the contrary he gloried in oppoſing
them, when he thought them not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with good Manners and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
and certainly, if St. <hi>Jerome</hi>
made it no difficulty to place a <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher</hi>
of the ſame <hi>Sect</hi> in the Catalogue
of the <hi>Saints,</hi> What may we think of
<hi>Epictetus?</hi> For, not to urge that he
alwaies ſpoke very clearly of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of the Soul, and that <hi>Seneca</hi>
never fully expreſs'd his ſentiment as
to that point, he hath this further
advantage over him, that he never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
that pernicious and tragical
Maxime of <hi>Stoicks Cloiſter,</hi> ſo receiv'd

and pretends that <hi>Epictetus</hi> was
fallen into that Errour, as well as the
reſt of the <hi>Stoicks.</hi> but I know alſo,
that it is very likely, <hi>Wolfius</hi> is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
as to that particular. For the
only Text on which he grounds that
Conjecture, is this that <hi>Epictetus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
in <hi>Arrian, That when a man is
weary of acting his part, he is to remember,
That the Door is open.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when he ſaies, <hi>The Door is open,</hi>
He means not by thoſe words, That
<hi>a man may be his own Murtherer.</hi> His
meaning is plainly this, that when we
are weary of Life, and the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we are in, it concerns us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that our Term is almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
that within a ſhort time we
ſhall be delivered from that diſquiet,
and that infallibly we ſhall dye. This
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49014:30"/>
was the reflection of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> And,
to be aſſured of it, we need only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
how clearly he expreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the ſame purpoſe, in another
paſſage, where he derides thoſe, who
are much troubled for the morrow.
Thus then he ſpeaks to them. <hi>If you
have any thing to eat to morrow,</hi>

               <hi>you will
eat, if you have nought, you will forbear
eating: the worst that can befall you, is to
go into the other World, The Door is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
open for you.</hi> This paſſage is as
much to the point in Debate, as the
other; and yet no underſtanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
will maintain that <hi>Epictetus</hi> his
meaning in this place, is, <hi>That it is
lawfull for a man to be his own Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
For, two or three lines before,
he holds, That,<note place="margin">Arr. l. 1. C. 9.</note>

               <hi>to deliver us from
their Perſecution. It is juſt, adds he,
that we continue in the rank wherein God
hath placed us. We muſt leave it to him to
remove us out of it, when it ſhall pleaſe
him. The time of our aboad will not be
long. When a man hath once taken this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
there is no Tyrant but we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy.</hi>

               </note> that
we ſhould ſee <hi>Epictetus</hi>'s Letters, which
were, as he was told, in the Library
of <hi>Florence.</hi> But it is very likely, that
he, who told him that News, was not
well informed of the truth, and that
we may long expect the publiſhing of
them.</p>

Of what Diſeaſe <hi>Epictetus</hi> died, or at
what time, is not well known. True
it is, that <hi>Suidas</hi> affirmes he died un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the reign of <hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi> But
I much queſtion the truth of it. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius,</hi>
who hath been very large as to
this particular, brings ſeveral reaſons
to make it appear that <hi>Suidas</hi> was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that the ſame <hi>Suidas</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,<note place="margin">Suid. <hi>in</hi> Epict.</note>
that <hi>Epictetus</hi> was a ſlave to
<hi>Epaphroditus, who was Captain of the
Life-Guard to Nero.</hi> Now, from the
death of <hi>Nero</hi> to <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
to the Empire,<note place="margin">Salm. <hi>in Not. ad</hi> Epic. <hi>&amp;</hi> simpl.</note> there are
near ninety four years. Nay before
<hi>Epictetus</hi> was in a condition to do <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paphroditus</hi>
any ſervice, and to come
from <hi>Hierapolis</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> he muſt be of
ſome Age. So that according to this
computation he muſt have lived near
a hundred and twenty years: which is
not eaſily believ'd. And yet there
may be ſomewhat in the conjecture,
though not enough to make it convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
for it is poſſible,<note place="margin">Lipſ. <hi>in</hi> Manud. <hi>ad St.</hi> Phil. l. 1. c. 19.</note> as <hi>Lipſius</hi> hath
well obſerv'd, that he did not ſerve

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49014:34"/>
by alledging that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> is here

               </note>
which argues that <hi>Nero</hi> was then
living.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salmaſius</hi>'s ſecond reaſon is, that
<hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> numbers not. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctetus</hi>
among thoſe whom he had heard.
He only affirms, that he had ſeen his
<hi>Commentaries,</hi> by the means of <hi>Junius
Ruſticus,</hi> who ſent him them. This
reaſon ſeems to me much weaker than
the former. For, beſides that <hi>Epictetus</hi>
might at that time be retir'd to <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi>
he died haply at the beginning of
<hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi>'s Reign. And <hi>Suidas</hi>
affirms only, that he came to the time
of that Emperour. And ſo though <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pictetus</hi>
had lived till the beginning of
his Reign, it is poſſible that Emperour
might not ſee the <hi>Commentaries</hi> of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pictetus,</hi>
till after his death.</p>
            <p>The third reaſon alledged by <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
ſeems to me to be of no validity at
all. He ſaies, that <hi>Epictetus</hi>'s Lamp
was ſold in <hi>Lucian</hi>'s time, and thence
he infers, that <hi>Epictetus</hi> was then dead.
But this does not prove any thing. For
there are very high probabilities, if
not certainty, that <hi>Lucian</hi> died not till
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49014:34"/>
after <hi>Marcus Aurclius.</hi> And ſo, that
Lamp might have been ſold in <hi>Lucian's</hi>
time, though <hi>Epictetus</hi> liv'd to the
time of that Emperour. Nay it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
it was ſold in the Life-time of
<hi>Epictetus;</hi> and in that caſe, there would
be no difficulty.</p>

who writ in the time of <hi>Antoninus

thus, <hi>The memory of Epictetus the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
is yet freſh.</hi> The paſſage is not
faithfully ſet down by <hi>Salmaſius.</hi> For
it is preciſely ſaid in <hi>Aulus Gellius,
That Epictetus alſo was a slave, is of freſh
Memory.</hi> That is, it was of freſh me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
that <hi>Epictetus</hi> had been a
Slave, and not ſimply that he had
been.</p>
            <p>To conclude, The laſt Reaſon
brought by <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> is, that <hi>Aulus
Gellius</hi> ſpeaks in another place, in theſe
Terms, <hi>I have heard Favorinus ſay that
Epictetus ſaid</hi> &amp;c. So that, ſince <hi>Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi>
died under the Emperour <hi>Hadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
Salmaſius,</hi> infers, that <hi>Epictetus</hi>
could not have liv'd up to the time of
<hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi> This reaſon is not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49014:35"/>
convictive, becauſe <hi>Favorinus</hi> might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> of what, Epictetus
ſaid, though <hi>Epictetus</hi> were not
dead. Yet muſt we allow it ſome
ground. For <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> who writ
in the time of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor
of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> when he
ſpeaks of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> expreſſes himſelf in
theſe Terms. <hi>Epictetus ſaid. That ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Old Man ſaid, I have been inform'd
by ſuch a one, that Epictetus ſaid.</hi> Which
clearly argues that he was not then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
And what makes me the more
inclinable to this opinion, is, that it
is probable, that <hi>Arrian</hi> had not made
any collection of the <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctetus,</hi>
till after the death of that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher.
And if ſo, it is impoſſible
that what is affirmed by <hi>Suidas</hi> ſhould
be true, and that <hi>Epictetus</hi> liv'd up to
the time of <hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi> For in the
time of <hi>Aulus Gellius;</hi> who, as hath
been obſerved, writ under <hi>Antoninus
Pius,</hi> theſe <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> were already
published, and generally known. True
it is, that <hi>Arrian</hi> might have made that
Book in the Life-time of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> but
there is little probability, and it will
not eaſily be preſum'd, that the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49014:35"/>
and memorable things of a
perſon yet living ſhould be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>There is yet another very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
difficulty, which hath not been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by any one. This is; that,
from <hi>Nero's</hi> death, to the Edict ſet forth
by <hi>Domitian,</hi> touching the Baniſhment
of the Philoſophers, there is very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
above twenty years. For that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
was publiſhed in the eighth year of
his Reign, as is affirmed by <hi>Euſebius.</hi>
Now if the conjecture of <hi>Lipſius</hi> be
true, and that <hi>Epictetus</hi> did not ſerve
<hi>Epophroditus,</hi> till after <hi>Neros</hi> death, it
would follow, that at the time of that
Edict, <hi>Epictetus</hi> could not be above
eighteen or nineteen years of Age.
Which cannot be granted, For then he
had obtained his Liberty, and was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at that very time in great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
inaſmuch as it is affirmed by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Gellius;</hi> that, upon the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Philolſopher, he was forced to
retire to <hi>Nicopolis.</hi> It muſt needs be
allowed then, that he was at that time
about thirty years of Age. But if he
were of that Age, at the time of that
Edict, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49014:36"/>
he lived near a hundred and eight or
nine years, to come up to the time of
<hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi> Which is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable;
ſince <hi>Lucian,</hi> who lived in that
very time makes no mention of <hi>Epicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
in his Dialogue Of <hi>Long-livers.</hi>
True it is,<note place="margin">Fuſeb. <hi>in Chron.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſpeaks alſo of
a ſecond Edict againſt the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi>
which was not publiſhed till the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
year of <hi>Domitian's</hi> Reign. But,
not to take notice, that he is the only
perſon of all the Chronologers and
Hiſtorians, who makes any mention
of this ſecond Edict, <hi>Scaliger</hi> preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerves, that the Edict, whereof
<hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> ſpeaks, (which is the ſame
we now diſcourſe of) was the firſt
which was publiſh'd in the eight year
of <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign.</p>
            <p>This reaſon ſeems to me ſo ſtrong,
that I ſhould make no difficulty to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that <hi>Suidas</hi> was miſtaken, if I had
not met with a paſſage of <hi>Themiſtius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Them. <hi>in Orat. ad</hi> Jovin.</note>
where he preciſely ſaies, <hi>That the two
Antoninus</hi>'s <hi>rendred great honours to Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctetus.</hi>
Yet might it be anſwer'd, that
what is ſaid is by an Orator, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
not that ſtrictneſs, which was
requiſite in a faithfull Hiſtorian. Or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49014:36"/>
haply that <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was a
great honourer of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> in the
time of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> and <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi>
and before he came to be Emperour.
Or rather, that he did him thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
after his death. As indeed we
ſee, by the Books he hath left us,
that he had a particular Veneration
for his Memory. In fine, This is not
without ſome difficulty, and I ſhould
be loath to be abſolutely deciſive in
the point. I therefore think it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
that I have ſimply laid down
the doubts of both ſides. And yet,
after a mature examination of theſe
things, if I may preſume to give my
judgment, I am the rather inclin'd
to comply with what is affirm'd by
<hi>Salmaſius,</hi> that <hi>Epictetus</hi> reach'd not
the Reign of <hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi> For
beſides that <hi>Suidas</hi> is an Author who
hath not alwaies light on the truth,
it was a moſt undeniable miſtake in
him, when he affirm'd that <hi>Epicletus</hi>
had written much. So that it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
he may alſo be miſtaken in his
computation of the time. Howere
it be, yet this is certain, that <hi>Epictetus</hi>
was regretted by all the illuſtrious
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49014:37"/>
Perſons in his time, and that his
memory will be precious to poſterity.
And this all I could meet with of his
<hi>Life,</hi> which hitherto hath not been
written in any Language, ſince that
<hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> done by <hi>Arrian,</hi>
hath been loſt.</p>

which have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance

<hi>Opinion, Inclination, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
Averſion;</hi> in a

There are others alſo which

That which hath its dependance on
us,<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> is, of its own Nature, Free, and
cannot be obſtructed, nor forbidden
by any one. On the contrary, That
which hath not its dependence on us,
is weak, ſervile, eaſily obſtructed, and
ſubject to another.</p>
               <p>Remember then,<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> that if you take
to be Free, that which, of its own
natures is Servile; and if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what is ſubject to another, as a
thing proper to your ſelf; Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
I ſay, that you will meet with
great obſtructions, and that you will
be diſturbed in all your deſignes, that
you will be expos'd to a thouſand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets,
and in fine, that you will
charge your misfortunes upon the
Gods and Men. But, on the contrary,
if you are perſwaded that that only
belongs to you which really does ſo,
and can conſider, as alienated from
you, that which in effect is ſo, aſſure
your ſelf, that nothing will be able
to divert you from what you have
propoſed to your ſelf, that you will
not attempt any thing with a kind of
violence to your ſelf, that you will
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49014:42"/>
not blame or accuſe any one, that no
body will give you any Check, that
you will have no enemies; and in fine,
that you will never be ſubject to the
leaſt regret.</p>
               <p>If you are deſirous of goods ſo
great as theſe are,<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> know, it is not

that they be in ſome meaſure deſired;
but it is alſo requiſite, that you be
readily diſpos'd to a renunciation of
certain thing, and, for a time, to a
deprivation of ſome others. For, if

are poſſeſs'd, you are ambitious of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
into Charges, or the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition

will abſolutely loſe the aſſured means,
whereby Liberty and Felicity are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirable,
and that haply, after
all, you will be defeated of what
you courted with ſo much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>When you meet with any diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
occurrence,<note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> accuſtom your ſelf
to this reflection, that it is not ſuch
as it ſeems to be, and that it is only a

pure imagination. When you ſhall
have made that reflection, examine
what it may be, and make your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the rules you have for that
purpoſe. Conſider whether it be any
of thoſe things which have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
on you. For otherwiſe if
it have not any, be immediately ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd,
that it concerns you not.</p>
               <p>Know,<note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> that the End of Deſire is the
obtaining of what is deſired, and that
the End of Averſion is, that one fall
not into that which he would eſchew.
And as he is Unfortunate who is fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
of what he wiſhes; ſo he is
miſerable who falls into that which he
would moſt a void. If therefore you
have an averſion only for what hath
its dependence on you, as for falſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
be aſſur'd, that you will never
fall into that which you hate. But if
you have an averſion for that which
depends not on you, as for Diſeaſes,
Death, or Poverty, queſtion not but
you will become Miſerable; ſince it
is not in your power to avoid them,
and that you will infallibly fall into
them.</p>

If you are deſirous to be Happy,<note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note>
never have any repugnance for that
which hath not its dependence on
you, but direct all your averſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that which is obſtructive to
the nature of the things dependent on
your Liberty. Moreover, make no
ſudden wiſhes of any thing with too
much earneſtneſs; For if you deſire
things not dependent on your ſelf, it
is impoſſible but you muſt be fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thereof; and if you deſire thoſe
which have their dependance on your

the deſiring of them out of a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
regard. If therefore you would
do well, approach them ſo as that
you be able to withdraw your ſelf
from them, when you ſhall think fit.
But let all this be done with diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and reſervedneſs.</p>
               <p>The true expedient to avoid being
ever troubled,<note place="margin">Sect. 8.</note> is, to conſider all the
things that are for our pleaſure, or
for our advantage, or ſuch as for
which we have any affection, as they
are in themſelves. We muſt begin
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49014:44"/>
to examine even to the leaſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>I hear fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicius, <hi>who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of</hi>

For example, when you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
an earthen veſſel, bethink your
ſelf that it is an earthen veſſel, which
you do remove, and that it may be
eaſily broken. For having made this
reflection, if it chances to break, you
will not be troubled at it. In like
manner, if you love your Son, or
your Wife, reflect that the perſon
you love is of humane race; for by
that means, if they come to dye, you
will not be ſurpriz'd at it.</p>
               <p>Before you undertake any work,<note place="margin">Sect. 9.</note>
examine of what kind it is. If you
have reſolved to go into a Bath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you ſet forth, repreſent to your
ſelf all the inſolences that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in thoſe places. They there
caſt water at one; they force him
out of his place; he is ſubject to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts;
he may loſe his cloaths. Make
no queſtion but you would more ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
execute what you undertake, if
you ſay to your ſelf; I will go into
the Bath, but I will alſo keep to the
courſe of Life, which I have propos'd
to my ſelf. Obſerve this Maxime in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49014:44"/>
all your enterpriſes. For by that
means, if any obſtruction or diſgrace
happens to you, as you bath your ſelf,
it will be without diſturbance to you,
and you will preſently ſay, I came
not hither only to bath my ſelf, but
I came alſo with a reſolution not to
do any thing contrary to my ſetled
courſe of life, which I ſhould not
obſerve, if I endured the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences
committed hear with any kind
of regret or diſſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>The diſturbances which men are in<note place="margin">Sect. 10.</note>
proceed not from the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
but only from the opinions
they conceive of them. For example,
to ſpeak rightly of it, Death is not
any Evil; ſince that if it were ſuch
it would have appear'd dreadful and
unpleaſing to <hi>Socrates,</hi> as well as to
other men. No no, it is only the
Opinion men have of death which
renders it dreadful. When therefore
we are any way diſturb'd, or
troubled, we have none to quarrel
at, but our ſelves and our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:49014:45"/>
It is a great diſcovery of ignorance
and a brutiſh diſpoſition to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
others with their miſeries.<note place="margin">Sect. 11.</note>
He begins to enter into the way of
wiſdome, who charges only himſelf

who neither chargeth himſelf nor
others.</p>
               <p>Never make any oſtentation of the
excellency which is in another.<note place="margin">Sect. 12.</note> If a
Horſe could ſay, that he is a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Creature, it were ſupportable in
his mouth. But when you make it
your brag that you have an excellent
well-ſhap'd Horſe can you tell what
you do? you boaſt of what belongs
not to you. What is there then that
is yours? The uſe of what falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your ſight.<note place="margin">A Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hard.</note> And hence it comes,
that if you look on things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably
to their nature, and make
ſuch judgments of them as you ought,
then ſhall it be lawfull for you to
make your brags thereof; inaſmuch
as your exultation is for a good,
whereof you are effectually poſſeſs'd.</p>

If you go to Sea, and the Ship come<note place="margin">Sect. 13.</note>
to Land at ſome place, you are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to go out of it, to take in freſh
water; nay if you have a mind to
gather of the Shells you meet with in
your way, no body will hinder you.
But it is ſtill expected that your
thoughts ſhould be upon the Ship,
and that you ſhould be attentive to
the maſters call; for you muſt be
ready to leave all, leaſt upon your
neglect, he might order you to be
caſt into the Veſſel with your hands
and feet bound like a beaſt. The ſame is
to be ſaid in the caſe of humane Life.
If God is pleas'd to give you a Wife,
or Children, it is permitted you to
take them, and to have your enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of them. But if it happen that
God calls you, you muſt leave them
without any further thoughts of
them, and make haſt to the Veſſel.
And if you are already well advanc'd
in age, have a care you be not
at any great diſtance from it, out
of a fear you be not ready, when you
ſhall be called.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:49014:46"/>
Never deſire that things ſhould
happen as you would have them; but
endeavour to make your wiſhes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant
with the emergencies. By this
means, what ever comes to paſs will
be conformable to your wiſhes.</p>
               <p>Sickneſs is an impediment to the
Body,<note place="margin">Sect. 15.</note> but not ſo to the Will. For
example, when a man is Lame, it is
an obſtruction to his feet in going;
but that hinders not his Will to do
what it is inclin'd to, if it does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
any thing but what it is able
to compaſs. Make the ſame conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of all the things that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
and you will find, that it is
not you that are incommodated by
them, and that it is alwaies ſome
other.</p>
               <p>In whatever ſhall happen to you,<note place="margin">Sect. 16.</note> be
mindfull to conſider, what means
you have to ſecure your ſelf againſt it.
If, for example you ſee a beautiful
Youth, or a fair Virgin, bethink
your ſelf, that you have Temperance,
which is a powerful preſervative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Beauty. If you are oblig'd
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49014:46"/>
to undertake ſomething not to be
overcome without much labour and
hardſhip, have your recourſe to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.
If you have receiv'd any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
arm your ſelf with Conſtancy.
For if you accuſtom your ſelf alwaies
to act after this manner, occurrent
Objects will have no prevalence over
you.</p>
               <p>Never ſay that you have loſt any
thing,<note place="margin">Sect. 17.</note> but let it be your conſtant ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that you have reſtor'd it. When
your Son or your Wife dye, ſay
not that you have loſt them, but ſay
rather that you have reſtor'd them
to him who had beſtow'd them on
you. But when ſome part of your
Inheritance is taken away from you,
muſt it be ſaid in like manner, that
you have reſtor'd it? you think haply
that you ought not to uſe that kind of
expreſſion, becauſe he is ſome wicked
perſon who hath depriv'd you of
it? As if it concern'd you, by whoſe
means your Land returnes to him
who had given it you. As long there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as you ſhall have it at your own
diſpoſal, look on it as if it were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49014:47"/>
anothers, and part with it, as little
troubled, as Travellors are when
they leave the Innes where they had
lodg'd.</p>
               <p>If you are deſirous to make any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
in the ſtudy of Vertue,<note place="margin">Sect. 18.</note>
wean your mind from thoſe ſorts of
Imaginations. <hi>If I be not carefull of
my affairs, I ſhall not have where with all
to ſubſiſt. If I chaſtize not my Son, he
will prove undutifull.</hi> Learn that it is
better to dye of hunger, and preſerve
a greatneſs of courage, and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of mind to the laſt gaſpe, than to
live in abundance, with a Soul full
of diſturbance and torment. Learn,
I ſay, that you ought rather to ſuffer
your Son to become undutifull and
wicked, than to become your ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.
In a word you muſt prefer
the ſerenity of your own mind before
all concerns. But to attain that, it
is precedently requiſite, that you
make trial of your ſelf even to things
that are moſt inconſiderable. For
example, if your Oyl be ſpilt, or
your Wine ſtollen out of your Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
make this reflection and ſay in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49014:47"/>
your ſelf; At this rate muſt a Man
purchaſe Tranquillity and Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
And indeed nothing is got with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome pains, and it is neceſſary,
that what we have ſhould coſt us
ſomething. Do the like when you
call your Servant. Imagine, that he
is not ready, and that if he were,
he will not haply do any thing of
what you deſire of him. Howere it
be, have a care that he has not the
power to put you into any indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to cauſe any diſturbance in
your mind, when he hath an humour
to do it.</p>
               <p>Never be troubled that you ſhould
paſs for an extravagant perſon in the
Apprehenſions of the Multitude,<note place="margin">Sect. 19.</note> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon their obſervance of your
contempt of external things. Nor
be ever deſirous of being accounted
a man of excellent endowments. If it
unexpectedly happen, that people
make any account of you, then moſt
miſtruſt your ſelf; in aſ much as it is
extreamly hard to be attentive to
what is external, and to ſtick cloſe
to a reſolution correſpondent to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49014:48"/>
Nature, and the courſe of Life which
you have propos'd to your ſelf; and
it muſt needs come to paſs, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the one you will be forc'd to
relinquiſh the other.</p>
               <p>If you deſire that your Wife,<note place="margin">Sect. 20.</note> your
Children, and your Friends ſhould
live alwaies, you are at a loſs of
judgment; for it is as much as to
wiſh that what hath not any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on you, ſhould be abſolutely
dependent on you, and that what is
anothers ſhould belong to you. In
like manner, if you expect that your
Son ſhould commit no miſdemeanour,
you are no leſs ridiculous. For it is as
much as to wiſh, that Vice ſhould not
be Vice. If therefore you would never
be fruſtrated of your deſires, deſire
only thoſe things which are depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
on your ſelf.</p>
               <p>He is truly Maſter of all things,<note place="margin">Sect. 21.</note>
in whoſe power it is to retain ſuch as
he will, and to reject ſuch as are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
to him. Whoever then hath
a deſign to be free after this manner,
muſt accuſtom himſelf not to have
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49014:48"/>
any deſire, nor any averſion for ſuch
things as are dependent on another:
for if he act otherwiſe, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
fall into Servitude.</p>
               <p>Remember that your demeanour in
Life muſt be ſuch,<note place="margin">Sect. 22.</note> as if you were at a
great Feaſt. If any Diſh be preſented
to you, you may decently help your
ſelf what you think fit of it. If it be
deſign'd only to paſs by you, far be
it from you to ſtop it, and to put your
hand raſhly into it. Expect patiently
till it return to you again. Thus
ought you to behave your ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
your Children, towards your
Wife, towards the Magiſtrates, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Riches, and towards all other
things of that nature. For by this
means, you will become worthy to
be entertain'd at the Table of the
Gods. But if you are ſo generous as
to refuſe even that which is preſented
to you, you will not only deſerve
admiſſion to the table of the Gods,
but you will be worthy alſo to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
of their power. And it was
for this kind of demeanour that <hi>Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
and <hi>Heraclitus</hi> were reputed divine
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49014:49"/>
men, as indeed they were.</p>
               <p>When you ſhall obſerve any one
ſighing,<note place="margin">Sect. 23.</note> either upon a remembrance
that his ſon is gone abroad to travel,
or that he hath loſt what he was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
of, be not ſurpriz'd at the Object
and imagine not the perſon to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
unhappy, for the loſs of things
not within his diſpoſal. But make
this diſtinction within your ſelf, and
preſently ſay; It is not that Accident
which afflicts the man; for there are
others concern'd in the like that are
not any way diſturb'd thereat; it is
the opinion which he hath conceiv'd
thereof that torments him. Then uſe
your utmoſt endeavours to undeceive
him, and to recover him out of evil
Opinion. Nay, if you think it
convenient, you may pretend ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and a certain fellow-feeling of
his affliction. But have a care that
Grief do not effectually ſeize your
heart, while you think only to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonate
it.</p>
               <p>Remember your ſelf,<note place="margin">Sect. 24.</note> that you are
to act here the part which the Maſter
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49014:49"/>
of the Revels hath been pleas'd to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
you. If your part be ſhort, be ſhort
in the acting of it; if it be long, be
content to go through with it. If he
have appointed you to do that of a
poor Man, endeavour to acquit your
ſelf in the action as well and as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
as you can. If fine, if he have
impos'd upon you that of a Prince,
or a Lame perſon, or a Tradeſman,
it is your concern, to act according
to what is aſſign'd you, and hath
been directed by another.</p>
               <p>If it chance that you hear a <hi>Crow</hi>
croaking,<note place="margin">Sect. 25.</note> be not the leaſt troubled
at it. But let this be your immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
reflection, I am not the perſon
threatned by that <hi>Crow;</hi> it may
haply be my Body, or the little Eſtate
I am poſſeſs'd of, or my Reputation,
or my Children, or my Wife, for as
to my own part, there is not any
thing but preſages happineſs to me;
in regard that, of whatever ſhall
happen, it depends only on my
ſelf to make all the advantage
I can.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:49014:50"/>
You may be invincible,<note place="margin">Sect. 26.</note> if you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
not any engagement, but
ſuch as you are aſſur'd of the ſucceſs
thereof, and where the obtaining of
the Victory depends only on your
ſelf.</p>
               <p>If you obſerve any one advanc'd
to Dignities,<note place="margin">Sect. 27.</note> or in favour and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
be not ſurpriz'd at the outward
appearance of it, and ſay not, that
he is therefore happy. For ſince the
true tranquillity of the mind conſiſts
in our wiſhes only of what depends
on our ſelves, the luſtre of Grandeurs
ought not to raiſe any envy or jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy
in us. Nor ſhould you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any ambition of being a Senator,
a Conſul, or an Emperour, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
buſineſs you are to mind, is Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
That ought to be the ultimate
end of all your pretenſions. Now to
attain that, there is but one way,
which is, to ſlight whatever depends
not on us.</p>
               <p>Remember alſo it is not either he
who injuries you,<note place="margin">Sect. 28.</note> nor yet he who
ſmites you that offends you, but it is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49014:50"/>
the Opinion you have conceiv'd
thereof. When therefore any one
ſhall occaſion your being angry, know,
that not he, but your own Opinion
hath incens'd you. Accordingly you
ought to be very carefull that you be
not tranſported by your paſſion;
for if you delay it for ever ſo little a
while, you will the more eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
it.</p>
               <p>Let Death,<note place="margin">Sect. 29.</note> Baniſhment, and all
thoſe other things, which the greateſt
part of Men put into the number of
Evils, be your daily Meditation;
but let your thoughts be particularly
fixt on Death. For by this means
you will never have any mean and
ſervile conſideraton, nor ever wiſh
any thing with paſſion.</p>
               <p>If you have a deſign to perfect
your ſelf in the ſtudy of Philoſophy,<note place="margin">Sect. 30.</note>
prepare your ſelf, before you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
any thing, to endure the deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the World. It will be ſaid
to you, How are you become a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
of a ſudden? Whence came
you by that ſevere aſpect? Laugh
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49014:51"/>
at all that, conditionally that what is
ſaid be not true, and that you have
not that gravity, wherewith you are
reproached. Do you only demean your
ſelf ſo towards what ſeems beſt to
you, that nothing be able to divert
you from it, and continue conſtant
thereto, as if God had appointed
you to do ſo. If you perſiſt in the
ſame reſolution, and prove conſtant
in the ſame eſtate, you will become
the object of their admiration who
before derided you. If on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
you flag, and if once you give
way to any change of reſolution, all
you have done will only occaſion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to repeat their deriſions of
you.</p>
               <p>Suffer not your mind to be diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with imaginations of this kind,<note place="margin">Sect. 31.</note>
that you will not be conſider'd, and
that you will not be reſpected, and
honoured. For if it were an evil
not to receive honour, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
would be, that it were in the
power of another to make us unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
Which cannot be, in regard
that the ſame reaſon which exempts
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49014:51"/>
us from being involv'd in Vice, by
the act of another, exempts us alſo
from being involv'd in evil, by the
act of another. Is it a thing at our
diſpoſal to be advanc'd to ſoveraign
dignities, or, to be invited to great
Feaſts, or in fine, to be poſſeſs'd of
all the other goods not dependent on
us? No, it is clearly out of our
reach. How then can you ſay, that
you ſhall live in Diſeſteem and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny,
if you have not the enjoyment
of theſe kinds of things? How, I
ſay, can you complain, that you
ſhall not be reſpected, when you are
to confine all your deſires, and all
your pretenſions, within your ſelf,
and what depends on you, where
you are allow'd to exalt your ſelf as
much as you pleaſe? You will haply
reply, if I live ſo, I ſhall never be
in a condition to ſerve my Friends.
Ah! How are you miſtaken! How
do you imagine that this propoſition
is to be underſtood, a man is oblig'd
to aſſiſt his Friends? Tis not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
meant, that he is to ſupply them
with Mony, or to make them Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince that is not in our
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49014:52"/>
power, and that it is impoſſible for
one to beſtow that on another which
he hath not himſelf. I foreſee the
anſwer you will make me, to wit,
that a Man is to uſe all induſtry
to raiſe himſelf to wealth and
credit, that he may be able to
relieve his Friends in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities.
But if you can ſhew me
a way whereby they may be attain'd
without hazarding the loſs of vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Inclination, Sincerity, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity,
I promiſe you that I will
attempt alwaies to do it. If then
you expect from me that I ſhould
hazard the loſs of my own goods, to
endeavour the acquiſition of others
for you, which are not true goods,
conſider whether you are not unjuſt
and unreaſonable. Reflect then,
whether you ought not to make grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
account of a ſincere, vertuous,
and faithfull Friend than of Mony?
Do therefore all that lies in your
power to preſerve theſe qualities in
me, and never preſs me to do any
thing which may reduce me into a
capacity of looſing them. You may
yet poſſibly make this further reply,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49014:52"/>
that by this means you will not be
able to ſerve your Country. But
what do you mean by thoſe words?
'Tis true, you will not be able to
adorn it with Triumphal Arches or
publick Baths. They are not Smiths
who furniſh the City with Shoes, nor
hath it Arms from Shoemakers. 'Tis
well that every one act according to
his profeſſion? What do you imagine
that you contribute nothing of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to your Country, when you
ſupply it with an Inhabitant, who is
a perſon of Worth and Integrity?
Know, that you could not have
done it a greater ſervice. No more
then henceforth of that Diſcourſe.
Say not that you are of no account
in your City. It matters not what
rank you are in, provided you mind
the improvement of Honour and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
in it. Do you imagine you
will be advantageous to your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
if you quit the purfuit of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues?
Imagine to your ſelf what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
it can receive from you, when
you ſhall become Impudent and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:49014:53"/>
Take it not ill,<note place="margin">Sect. 32.</note> to ſee any one
plac'd at Table above you, or ſaluted
before you, or to find people inclin'd
to follow his advice, rather than
yours: for if the things are good,
you ought to be glad they happen to
him; if on the contrary they are bad,
you ſhould not have any regret at
their not befalling your ſelf. Beſides,
remember, that ſince you proſeſs
not to do ought for the attainment
of external things, it is no miracle
if they happen not to you, and that
others perſons, who have us'd their
utmoſt endeavours to attain them,
are prefer'd before you. Nor indeed
is it just, that he who ſtirs not out
of his Houſe ſhould be of equall cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
with him who ſpends moſt of his
time in Viſits, and is perpetually at
the gates of Grandees. It is not,
I ſay, reaſonable, that he who
cannot he induc'd to commend any
one, ſhould be equally conſider'd
with him, who beſtows exceſſive
praiſes on the moſt inconſiderable
Actions. He certainly muſt be an
unjuſt, and withall an inſatiable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who deſires to have theſe ſorts
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49014:53"/>
of goods for nothing, and without
buying them, at the price they coſt.
Be it ſuppos'd, for example, that
Lettices are to be ſold, and that they
are worth a half-peny, if any one
gives that rate, he may have them.
But if you will not give any thing for
them, you ſhall go without them.
Shall this render your condition
worſe than that of the other? By no
means; for if he hath the Lettices,
you have your Mony. The caſe is
the ſame as to thoſe we ſpeak
of. If you are not invited to a Feaſt,
it argues you have not paid your
Club. The Founder of the Feaſt ſells
it for flatteries, for compliance, and
for ſubmiſſions. If you are deſirous to
be admitted thereto, reſolve to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
it at the price ſet upon it. For
to pretend to theſe things, without
doing what is neceſſary for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taing
of them, argues Covetuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and want of Judgement. Do
you imagine alſo, that, if you loſe
that Supper, you have nothing in
requital? Aſſure your ſelf you have
ſomewhat that is much more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
You have not prais'd him
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49014:54"/>
whom you had no mind to praiſe.
You have not born with his inſolence,
wherewith he treats ſuch as come to
his Table, this is the advantage you
have made.</p>

When our neighbours Servant break
a Glaſs, we preſently ſay, it is an
ordinary accident. You ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean
your ſelf ſo, when your own is
broken, and be as cold and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
as you were when your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
was broken. Apply this alſo
to greater matters. When your
neighbours Wife or Child dies, no
body ſaies there is any thing in it but
what is natural. But when that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
happens to our ſelves, we
break forth into lamentations and
clamours; Ah! How unhappy am I,
Ah! What a wretched perſon am I?
And yet we ſhould remember our

The nature of Evil is, in the World,<note place="margin">Sect. 34.</note>

               <p>If any one ſhould deliver up your
Body to the firſt perſon he met,<note place="margin">Sect. 35.</note> that
he might do what he pleas'd with it,
I am confident you would not take it
well, and that you would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
thereat. And in the mean
time you are not aſham'd to expoſe
your Soul to the fantaſtick humour
of all the World. For as ſoon as any
reviling word is ſaid to you, you are
troubled, and tranſported with grief
and indignation. Do not therefore
undertake any thing, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
beforehand what ought to
precede, and what muſt be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of ſuch an enterpriſe; for
if you act otherwiſe, it will come to
paſs, that haply your deſign will
prove fortunate at the beginning,
and that you will take a pleaſure
therein. But be aſſured, that you
will afterwards be aſham'd of it, and
that, ſooner or later, you will have
occaſion to repent you of it.</p>
               <p>

No doubt it would be a great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to you to gain the Victory
at the Olympick Games.<note place="margin">Sect. 36.</note> I aſſure
you, it ſhould be as much my deſire
as yours. For when all's done, we
muſt acknowledge that it is a very
gallant thing. But if you have that
deſign, it is requiſite, that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what is precedent, and what is
conſequent to ſuch an enterpriſe.
When you ſhall have made that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
take notice of what you
ought to obſerve. Accuſtom your
ſelf to keep within your own rank;
Not to eat, but upon neceſſity; To
abſtain from all ſorts of delicate, and
picquant ſawces; Never to drink
out of humor or wantonneſs; Nay, to
forbear the drinking of Wine, if you
are not commanded to do it; To do
your exerciſe at the appointed hours,
in hot weather, in cold weather, not
ſuffering any thing to divert you
from it. In fine, You muſt reſign
up your ſelf to the Maſter of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,
as to a Phyſitian. And then
you may enter the Liſts. But you muſt
alſo direct your apprehenſions to
all the things which may happen, one
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49014:55"/>
while, of hurting your Hands, and
your Feet, and another of having
your Mouth full of Duſt, ſometimes
of being well Cudgel'd, and after all
this ſtruggling, you alſo run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of getting the worſt. Now if
nothing of all this ſtartle you, and
that you ſtill perſiſt in your former
deſign, then you may venture into
the Ring. For if you demean your
ſelf otherwiſe, it will happen to you,
as to thoſe little Children, who now
take up them to be Wraſtlers, then
Pipers, then Fencers, then Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petters,
and then actors of Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
undertaking all ſorts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
though they are incapable of
exerciſing any. So you will be a Wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
a Gladiator, an Orator, a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
and of all this nothing. You will
imitate, like an Ape, whatever you
ſee done by others, and you will
ſlightly quit one thing, to embrace
another. Would you know the cauſe
of it? 'Tis this, that you undertake
all without recollection, and that
you are inconſiderately inclin'd
thereto, and that you comply only
with the ſudden ſallies of your own
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49014:56"/>
fantaſtick humour. You behave your
ſelf like thoſe who have an itching
inclination to be Philoſophers, when
they hear ſome one ſay, <hi>Ah, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
was that ſaid Socrates! Who
could raiſe an argument to that height,
and preſs it with ſo much vigour as
he!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O man,<note place="margin">Sect. 37.</note> be who you will, if you
are deſirous to compaſs your deſigns,
conſider beforehand what you would
do, and ſee, whether that which you
undertake be conformable to your
nature or not. If you are deſirous
to venture at the Exerciſes, as Wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or the like, conſider whether
your Arms are ſtrong enough, and
whether your Limbs and Reins are
fit, and well-ſet for it; in regard
that this man is naturally deſign'd to
one thing, and that, to another.
When you ſhall have taken a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to become a Philoſopher, if you
think to eat, and drink, and act the
delicate perſon, as you did before,
you will be extreamly miſtaken. You
muſt reſolve to be vigilant, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious,
to forſake your Friends,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49014:56"/>
to be ſlighted, ſometimes by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
to ſee all others more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and in greater credit than you
with eminent Perſons, Magiſtrates,
Judges, and in any affair whatſoever.
Reflect then on all theſe difficulties,
and conſider whether you had not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enjoy Tranquillity of Mind,
Freedom, and Conſtancy. For if
you make not this reflection, I muſt
mind you of having a care, that you
follow not the example of thoſe little
Children I ſpoke of before, and be
one while a Philoſopher, ſoon after
a Receiver of the publick Taxes,
then an Orator, and in fine a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Believe me, all
theſe employments will not fadge
well together. It is requiſite you
take it into your conſideration, that
you are but one Man, and that it is
neceſſary, you ſhould be abſolutely
good, or abſolutely bad. For, in a
word, you muſt either only proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the cultivation of your Mind
and Reaſon, or apply your ſelf to
the purſuit of external things, and
abſolutely addict your ſelf thereto.
For it is impoſſible for a man to do
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49014:57"/>
both together. That is to ſay, it is
neceſſary that you either keep within
the Sphear of a Philoſopher, or come
into the common claſs of the meaner
ſort of People.</p>
               <p>All the Devoirs and Reſpects we
render ought to be ſuitable to the
quality of the perſons who receive
them.<note place="margin">Sect. 38.</note> If it be a Father, our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir
obliges us to have a care of him,
and to comply with him in all things.
If he reviles you, if he ſmite you,
all muſt be ſupported with patience.
But, will you haply ſay, my Father
is a wicked Man? What matters it?
That excuſe is not allowable. When
Nature gave you a Father, ſhe was
not engag'd to give you a good one.
In like manner, when your Brother
injures you, be not over intentive to
what he does to you, but conſider the
obligations of your own duty, and
how you are to demean your ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, that ſo you may do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is conformable to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Thus will it come to paſs,
that no Man will have the power to
offend you, if you will it not, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49014:57"/>
if any do you an injury, it proceeds
only from this, that you imagine it
done to you. Make the ſame judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the reſt. You will come
to underſtand what are the Devoirs
of a Neighbour, of a Citizen, of
a Military General, and of all others,
if you accuſtom your ſelf to conſider
what they are.</p>
               <p>Know,<note place="margin">Sect. 39.</note> that the principal point of
Religion conſiſts in having right ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of the Gods. As for inſtance,
to believe they really are, that they
govern the World, with goodneſs
and juſtice, that they are to be obey'd,
that men ought to acquieſs in what
they do, and indiſputably follow
their Orders, as proceeding from a
moſt excellent and moſt accompliſh'd
intelligence. For, thus principled,
you will never charge them with
ought, and you will not complain
that they have deſerted you. But
this is not a thing to be attempted,
if you do not ſlight whatever is not
dependent on you, and if you do not
place all Good and all Evil, in that
which abſolutely depends on you.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49014:58"/>
For if you imagine, that any other
thing is Good or Evil, it muſt needs
come to paſs, that you will be often
fruſtrated of what you wiſh, that
you will fall into what you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to ſhun, and that you will
blame and have an averſion for thoſe,
who have caus'd you that misfortune.
Accordingly, as it is natural for all
Animals to ſhun what is hurtful to
them, and to have an averſion for all
ſuch as are able to do them any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
So have they the ſame propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
to embrace what is beneficial to
them, and to cheriſh all thoſe who
can do them any good. So that it is
impoſſible, that a perſon who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
he hath receiv'd any damage,
ſhould admit of a joynt-exultation
with the other, who hath done it
him, nor that the diſpleaſure he hath
receiv'd ſhould give him any joy.
Thence it comes that the Son ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
reviles his Father, becauſe he
gives him not that which hath the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
of Good amongſt Men.
And this alſo was the occaſion of the
War between <hi>Etcocles</hi> and <hi>Polynices;</hi>
becauſe their imagination was fixt on
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49014:58"/>
this, that Soveraignity was a Good.
Thence it comes alſo, that the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man,
the Pilot, the Merchant, and
thoſe who looſe their Wives, or their
Children, ſpeak injuriouſly of the
Gods. Odinarily Piety and Profit
meet together. From that reaſon
does it proceed, that he who is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
not to wiſh and ſhun any thing,
but what he ought to ſhun, or wiſh,
makes it his ſtudy at the ſame time to
be a Pious and a Juſt man. Beſides
every Man is oblig'd to make his
Oblations and Sacrifices according
to the cuſtom of the Country where
he lives, with much Modeſty, avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
avarice and prodigality, and
doing it alſo with all the purity,
and all the diligence requiſite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>When you go to a Foreteller of
things to come,<note place="margin">Sect. 40.</note> no doubt, but you
are ignorant of what is to happen.
For it is, to be inform'd by him, that
you conſult him. But, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that which ſhall happen will be
good or bad, you have no need of
the Foreteller, becauſe you know
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49014:59"/>
it already, if you are a Philoſopher.
For if it be not ſomethìng dependent
on your ſelf, as it muſt neceſſarily be,
ſince you are not ignorant of the
ſucceſs of it, you may confidently
affirm, that it is neither good nor
bad. When therefore you go to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
the Fortune-teller, be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd
with either Deſire or Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
otherwiſe you will never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
him without trembling. Hold
it for a Maxime, that every Event is
indifferent, that it can never give
any obſtruction to what you had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to do, and, whatever it may
be, that it is always in your power
to apply it to a good uſe. Approach
the Gods therefore with a reſolute
and aſſured mind, and look on them
as ſuch as are able to give you good
counſels. When they have return'd
you any anſwer, follow it exactly.
Conſider who they are whom you
have conſulted, and that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forbear obeying them without a
contempt of their power and incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their diſpleaſure. The things,
about which we are to conſult the
Oracle, are thoſe, as <hi>Socrates</hi> affirm'd,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49014:59"/>
the whole conſideration whereof is
attributed purely to hazard, and
which cannot be foreſeen, either by
Reaſon, or any other Art whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
So that when the queſtion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the defence of your Country,
or of your Friend, there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of going to the South-ſayer;
inaſmuch as if the South-ſayer tell
you, that the entrails of the Victime
preſage ill ſucceſs, it is an infallible
ſign, either that you will dye, or
that you will be crippled, or that
you will be baniſh'd, which might
haply divert you from the deſign you
were engag'd in. In the mean time
Reaſon adviſes, that you ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
your Friend and Country, even
with the hazard of your Life. Make
your applications then to a greater
Oracle. Go to the <hi>Pythian</hi> Prieſt,
who drove out of the Temple a Man,
who ſometime before had wav'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
one of his Friends, then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be murther'd.</p>
               <p>It is requiſite that you preſcribe to
your ſelf a certain courſe of Life,<note place="margin">Sect. 41.</note> and
a Law, to be inviolably obſerv'd by
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49014:60"/>
you, wherever you may be; whether
your converſation be amongſt Men,
or that you are privately retir'd from
all company.</p>
               <p>Keep ſilence,<note place="margin">Sect. 42.</note> as much as you can.
Never ſpeak any thing but what is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
neceſſary, and to do that,
ſpend as few words as you can. When
any occaſion of ſpeaking ſhall preſent
it ſelf, amuſe not your ſelf in diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
either of the Gladiators, or the
Circean Exerciſes, or of the Olympick
Games, or of eating, or of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or of any of all thoſe imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies,
which are the Subjects of
moſt peoples Diſcourſes. But above
all things, be careful, in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
to avoid both Praiſe and
Diſpraiſe, and making Compariſons
between any.</p>
               <p>When you are amongſt your
Friends,<note place="margin">Sect. 43.</note> if their communication be
of any thing which is not decent, uſe
all the endeavours you can to bring

refrain from the clamours, ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

               <p>When you are to go to ſpeak with

your reflections on it. Then conſider
the difference there is between the
time, during which you have the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of that pleaſure, and that
wherein, after you ſatisfaction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
you will repent you of it, and find
fault with your ſelf for ſo doing.
Oppoſe alſo thereto, the ſatisfaction
it will be to you, if you abſtain from

which are the ordinary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
of Voluptuouſneſs. Bethink your

excellent than any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>When you are once fully reſolved
to do any thing,<note place="margin">Sect. 57.</note> fear not to be ſeen
in it, even though the People were
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49014:63"/>
ready to make the worſt conſtructions
of it. For if what you do be a Good,
you are to defie all apprehenſions,
ſince you cannot be reprov'd without
injuſtice. But, on the contrary, if it
be an Evil, you ought not onely to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd

                  <hi>And:</hi> So when you
are at a Feaſt, and that you take
a pleaſure in the beſt Meſſes that are
brought to the Table, if you parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
regard your body, you do
ſomewhat that is moſt excellent for
your body. If you alſo conſider the
community and equality, which
ought to be obſerved amongſt the
Gueſts, you do a very undecent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
When therefore any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
you to Dinner, you ought not
onely to regard your appetite, and
what you love beſt, but you are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
obliged, to expreſs a certain
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49014:64"/>
deference and reſpect towards the
preſon by whom you are treated.</p>
               <p>If you undertake any Employment
which is above your abilities,<note place="margin">Sect. 59.</note> beſides
the hazard of your coming off with
diſcredit, it will occaſion your neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of ſome other, whereof you
might have acquitted you ſelfe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
well.</p>
               <p>When you walk, you are careful
enough to avoyd treading on the
which may happen to
be in your way.<note place="margin">Sect. 60.</note> So ought you, in
Life, to be no leſſe cautious, that
the ſuperiour part of your ſoul be not
injur'd by any bruitiſh Paſſions, or
falſe Opinions. For you will with
much greater facility compaſs your
deſigns, if you obſerve this Maxime
in whatever you undertake.</p>
               <p>The body ought to be the ſtandard
of Wealth, as the Foot is the meaſure
of the Shooe.<note place="margin">Sect. 61.</note> Obſerve this rule well,
and you will never be at any great
diſtance from Mediocrity, nor the
limits preſcrib'd thereby. If you
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49014:64"/>
neglect it, you will unqueſtionably
tumble down the precipice. For as,
when you have once had the curioſity
of getting Shoos after the neweſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
and ſuch as exceed the meaſure
of your Feet, you will afterwards be
of an humour to have them gilt, and
then to have them of Purple, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broider'd,
with much coſt and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip:
So in the buſineſs of wealth,
when you have once exceeded the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of Mediocrity, there is then no
ſtinting of you, but you are inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
tranſported into all manner of
Luxury and Exceſs.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as young Mayds are arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to the age of fourteen years,<note place="margin">Sect. 62.</note> Men
begin to call them their Miſtreſſes.
This raiſing an apprehenſion in them,
that Nature hath diſpoſed them into
the World for them, and that it muſt
be their endeavour to humour them,
they thereupon make it their maine
buſineſs to dreſs and trick up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and place all their expectations
in their ornaments. It is therefore
requiſite they ſhould be brought to
apprehend, that theſe honours and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49014:65"/>
civilities are rendred them, onely
upon the account of their Modeſty,
Diſcretion, and reſpectful Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>To be over much addicted to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
things is ever the argument of
a mean Soul.<note place="margin">Sect. 63.</note> As for inſtance, to be
aſſiduous in Exerciſes, to drink and
eat much, to be exceſſively addicted
to Women, and to ſpend too much
time in the other functions of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
All this is to be done as it were
in haſte, and without any great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
all our earneſt cares were are
to reſerve for the Mind.</p>
               <p>When any one injures you by word
or deed,<note place="margin">Sect. 64.</note> remember, that he would
not have done ſo, if he had not had
an imagination that he ought to have
done it. Do you think he could quit
his own ſentiment to follow yours?
If he does not make a ſound judgment
of things, and be accordingly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
he ſuffers the trouble and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
ariſing thereby. When a man
judges that a true Thing is falſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is obſcure and immers'd in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49014:65"/>
darkneſs, this judgment injures not
the truth. He who makes ſuch a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
injures none but himſelf. If
you follow this Maxime, when any
one ſhall revile you, you will pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
endure it; For you will always
ſay in your ſelfe, this Man thinks that
what he does it well done.</p>
               <p>Every thing hath two faces, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
one is ſupportable,<note place="margin">Sect. 65.</note> the other in
ſupportable. For example, when
your Brother injures, look not on
him as he is injurious to you. For
what he does, if it be ſo taken, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be indured. Conſider him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as he is your Brother, with
whom you have had a joynt-educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And ſo you will take it after
another manner, which may render
his action ſupportable.</p>
               <p>Theſe kinds of Propoſitions are
not conſequent one to the other;<note place="margin">Sect. 66.</note> 
                  <hi>I
am wealthier that you are, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I am the honeſter man. I am more
eloquent than you are, therefore I am the
more virtuous man. But theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are good: I am wealthier than
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49014:66"/>
you are, therefore my wealth is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
than yours. I am more eloquent
than you are, therefore my way of ſpeaking
is more excellent than yours.</hi> So that this
ſhould give you very little trouble,
ſince eloquence and wealth ought
not to be the object of your care.</p>
               <p>If you meet with any one in the
Bath,<note place="margin">Sect. 67.</note> who hath ſoon done waſhing
himſelfe, ſay not that he waſhes not
himſelfe well, but ſay that he makes
much haſt to waſh himſelfe. In like
manner, if any one drink much, ſay
not that he does ill in drinking at
that rate, but ſay ſimply, that he
drinks much. For, how came you
to underſtand that he did ill, that
you ſhould paſs ſuch a Judgment of
him? If you are thus reſerv'd in
your ſentiments you ſhall penetrate
into the thoughts of another, and
your thoughts ſhall be conformable
to thoſe of others.</p>
               <p>What place or company ſoever
you are in,<note place="margin">Sect. 68.</note> never ſay that you are
a Philoſopher, and amuſe not your
ſelfe in declaring before Ignorant
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49014:66"/>
Perſons what Maximes you follow.
Do you only performe what they
enjoyne you. When a man is at a
Feaſt, it is not ſeaſonable to talk of
the Manner of eating decently. He
muſt eat decently without ſpeaking
of it. <hi>Socrates</hi> was a perſon, who
was never guilty of any Oſtentation.
Nor ever was there any perſon that
ſupported it from others with ſo much
conſtancy. When ſome out of meer
contempt of him and his doctrine,
came and intreated him to conduct
them to ſome other Philoſophers, and
to give them his recommendation to
them; ſo far was he from giving them
any repulſe, that, with much civility,
he went along with them to thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Philoſophers. So little was he
troubled, that the Doctrine of others
ſhould be prefer'd before his own. If
it happen then that any one ſpeak of
ſome Axiome of Philoſophy before
ignorant perſons, be you ſilent as
long as you can, in regard it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to he fear'd, that you may caſt up
what you have not yet well digested.
If any one reproach you with Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and you are not any way mov'd
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49014:67"/>
at it, know that you have already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
ſome part of what your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
enjoyn you. Sheep do not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
up the Food or Graſs they have
eaten, but, in requital, are thereby
fatted up, and ſupply their Owners
with Milk and Wooll. In like manner
ought not you to amuſe your ſelf in
entertaining ignorant perſons with
your Precepts, becauſe it is a ſign
you have not well digeſted them.
They are rather to be inſtructed by
your Actions.</p>
               <p>If you have learnt to ſatisfie your
body with little,<note place="margin">Sect. 69.</note> forbear making any
oſtentation of it. If you have brought
your ſelfe to a cuſtome of drinking
onely water,<note place="margin">I here follow the ſenſe of <hi>Simplicius,</hi> yet doubt whether it be that of <hi>Epicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> I think <hi>Epicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> would only ſay, <hi>That a man ſhould not amuſe himſelfe to go and imbrace Statues in the midst of W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nter, to be admired by the People,</hi> as <hi>Diogenis</hi> the <hi>Cynick</hi> did, as <hi>Laertius</hi> affirms.</note> think not that
you are to boaſt of it. And
if you would ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
your ſelfe in a thing
requiring much pains and
labour, do it privately, and
be not deſirous that others
ſhould ſee you, in imitation
of thoſe, who being perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
by perſons of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
run and imbrace Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49014:67"/>
to get the people together, and
in that poſture cry out, that they
have ſuffered violence. Whoever
ſeeks glory by ſuch means ſeeks onely
the outſide of it, and looſes the fruit
both of Patience and Frugality; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as he places the end of theſe
excellent vertues in the opinion of
the multitude. Certainly, all Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
in this particular is frivolous
and of no advantage. If you would
accuſtome your ſelfe to Patience, take
fair water into your mouth, when
you are extreamly thirſty, and having
ſpurted it out immediately, without
ſwallowing ſo much as one drop, tell
not any body of it.</p>
               <p>It argues a meanneſs of ſpirit and
ignorance in any man,<note place="margin">Sect. 70.</note> never to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
Good or Evill from himſelf; but
to expect is always from ſome thing
not dependent on him. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
it is the characteriſtick of a
Philoſopher, not to expect his Good
or Evil, but from himſelf.</p>
               <p>The ſigns whereby it may be known
whether a man makes any proficiency<note place="margin">Sect. 71.</note>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:49014:68"/>
in ſtudy and vertue, are theſe, Not
to reprove, not to commend, not to
blame, and not to accuſe any one,
not to boaſt of what he is, or what
he knows; to be his owne accuſer,
when he is hindred or forbidden to
do ſomething, to laugh in his ſleeve
at thoſe perſons who commend him;
not to be angry when any find fault
with him; but to imitate thoſe, who
having not perfectly recover'd their
health, walk gently for fear of ſtirring
the humours; to have an abſolute
power over his deſires; not to have
any averſion but for what is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the nature of thoſe things
which depend on him; not to wiſh
any thing paſſionately; not to be
concern'd whether he be accounted
an Ignorant or a Knowing perſon;
in fine, to be diſtruſtful of himſelfe,
as of a domeſtick Enemy, whoſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes
he is always afraid of.</p>
               <p>When any one makes it his brag,<note place="margin">Sect. 72.</note>
that he can explicate the Books of
<hi>Chryſippus,</hi> let this be your reflection,
that it <hi>Chryſippus</hi> had not written ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely,
this other perſon had had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49014:68"/>
to brag of. Yet is not this
that which I ſeek after, my deſigne
is to ſtudy Nature, and to follow
Her. When I am told then, that
<hi>Chryſippus</hi> is her interpreter, my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
is to him, and if I underſtand
him not, I ſeek out ſome other body
that can explicate him to me. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
have I not done anything that is
excellent or commendable. For, when
I ſhall have met with any one that is
able to explicate that Philoſopher to
me; yet the main thing is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd,
which is, the putting of his
Precepts into practice. If I make no
further progreſs than to admire the
explication of <hi>Chryſippus,</hi> all amounts
only to this, that where I was a <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher</hi>
before, I am now become a
<hi>Grammarian.</hi> All the difference is,
that inſtead of <hi>Homer,</hi> I explicate
<hi>Chryſippus.</hi> And thence it must come,
that I am much more aſham'd I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do actions ſuitable to his Precepts,
then I am at my not underſtanding
of him.</p>
               <p>OBSERVE what we have deliver'd
as inviolable Lawes,<note place="margin">Sect. 73.</note> which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49014:69"/>
not trangreſs without impiety
and trouble not your ſelfe, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all that might have been ſaid;
ſince that depends not on you.</p>
               <p>How long will you defferre apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your ſelf to ſuch excellent things,<note place="margin">Sect. 74.</note>
and putting in practice ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
inſtructions? When will you
give over violating the Lawes of
right reaſon? you have heard the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
which you ought to embrace,
and I am inclin'd to believe, that
you have already embraced them;
but give others ſome aſſurance of
it. What other Maſter do you yet
expect, till whoſe coming you deferre
your reformation? Bethink your
ſelfe, that your youth is paſt, and
that you are come to the age of a man.
If you neglect theſe Precepts, and
if you make them not your Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories
of your Manners, you will put
it off from day to day, and from time
to time make additional and reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
reſolutions, and ſo your life will
ſlide away ſo inſenſibly as that it
will not be perceivable, whether you
have made any progreſs in the ſtudy
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49014:69"/>
of Vertue or not. In fine, your life
and your death will not be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable
from that of the meaneſt
perſon among the Populace. Now
therefore, without any further delay,
embrace the life of a man aiming at
proficiency and perfection. Look upon
whatever ſeems beſt to you, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trangreſſible
Law. If any thing la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious,
if any thing delightful, if
any thing glorious, if any thing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſeful
preſents it ſelfe, remember
it is time to enter the liſts in order to
an engagement, that the Olimpick
Exerciſes are come, and that there
is no thinking of any retreat. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
your ſelfe, that your Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is concern'd in either the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
or gaining of the Victory. By
this meanes was it that <hi>Socrates</hi> came
to that point of Wiſdome which was
juſtly attributed to him, by preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelf to all occaſions, and
not harkning to any advice but that
of Reason. For your part then
who are not yet a <hi>Socrates,</hi> you
ought to live as a man deſirous of
becoming as wiſe as <hi>Socrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:49014:70"/>
The chiefeſt and moſt neceſſary
part of Philoſophy is that which
treats of the uſe of the Precepts,<note place="margin">Sect. 75.</note> for
example, <hi>Not to lye.</hi> The ſecond,
that which treats of Demonſtration;
for example, <hi>Of the reaſon why men
ought not to lye.</hi> And the third is
that which confirmes and examines
the two other parts; for example,
it ſhews, why ſuch a thing is Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.
It teaches alſo, what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.
is, what, Conſequence,
Diſpute, Verity, Falſity, and all
the reſt. The third part is neceſſary
for the ſecond, and the ſecond is ſo
for the Firſt. But the Firſt, as I
have already ſaid, is the moſt nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary
of all, and therefore that is
the part whereunto a man is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to apply himſelfe. And yet
our courſe is quite otherwiſe. We
only ſtick to the third part, we ſpend
all our Study and Time therein,
and we abſolutely neglect the First.
Thence it comes that we fall ſhort,
when we are to prove by ſound De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations,
that men ought not to
lie; and yet we cannot forbeare
lying dayly and hourely.</p>

of Humane Life, done by one of
the moſt expert Maſters that ever
were. This Philoſopher liv'd
four hundred and ſixty years, or
thereabouts before the Birth of
our Saviour. He was born
<pb facs="tcp:49014:73"/>
at <hi>Thebes,</hi> in <hi>Beotia,</hi> and
the Diſciple of <hi>Socrates. Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
Laertius</hi> affirms, that he
writ three Dialogues, two where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are loſt. So that we have
remaining but only this, which he
entituled the <hi>Tablet</hi> or Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of Humane Life. Yet
are there ſome Criticks, as <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fius,</hi>
who affirm it is not his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is mention made in it
of <hi>Plato,</hi> who liv'd at the ſame
time. But this conjecture is
groundleſs, inaſmuch as it would
follow by the ſame reaſon, that
<hi>Plato</hi> muſt not have made the
Dialogue of the <hi>Immortality of
the Soul,</hi> ſince mention is made
<pb facs="tcp:49014:73"/>
there of <hi>Cebes.</hi> Howere it be,
thus far we are certain, that
this is a moſt excellent and moſt
ancient Piece. For <hi>Tertullian</hi>
obſerves, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> the
Lawyer his Kinſman, publiſh'd
an explication of it. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
reputation it hath continu'd
in, for the ſpace of twenty Ages,
that it hath been in the World,
hath been ſo extraordinary, that
it hath been tranſlated into moſt
Languages. It hath been my
fortune to have met with fifteen
different Verſions in the Latine
tongue. <hi>Velſius, Odaxius,
Wolfius</hi> and <hi>Caſelius,</hi> have
taken moſt pains about this Work,
<pb facs="tcp:49014:74"/>
but particularly <hi>Velſius.</hi> For
he hath writ a large Commentary
upon this <hi>Tablet,</hi> containing in
a manner all the Moral Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
of the <hi>Platoniſts. Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardi</hi>
rendred it into the <hi>Italian,</hi>
and <hi>Salmaſius</hi> hath ſome time
ſince given us an ancient <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Paraphraſe of it, and a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Verſion of <hi>John Elichman,</hi>
one of the most knowing Perſons
of his Age in the Oriental
Tongues. But the Author of
that Paraphraſe hath committed
a ſtrange fault, and ſuch as I
think conſiderable enough not to
be omitted here. He imagin'd,
that the Ancient man, who makes
<pb facs="tcp:49014:74"/>
an explication of this <hi>Tablet</hi> or
Repreſentation, was called <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules;</hi>
upon no other ground,
than that <hi>Cebes,</hi> cries out in
ſome places, <hi>O Hercules;</hi>
which is only an exclamation
ordinary amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi>
and <hi>Latines,</hi> when they were
ſurpriz'd at any thing. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more common in our
Books.</p>
               <p>For the better direction of
the Reader, and greater eaſe of
his Memory, there is at the end
of this little Book, a piece of
Sculpture, exhibiting the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme</hi>
it ſelf, and a ſhort Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
by way of Figures,
<pb facs="tcp:49014:75"/>
in the Cut, anſwerable to others
in the Leaf next adjoyning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,

OF
HUMANE LIFE.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S we were walking in the
Temple of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and
viewing the ſeveral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
which had been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
there, among other
things, we took particular notice,
at the entrance of it, of a certain
Draught, or Picture, very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49014:77"/>
as well for the Manner of it,
as the Subject. We could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
what it might be, nor of what
Antiquity. For though what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
therein had in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the reſemblance of a City, or a
Camp, yet was it not indeed either
of the two. It was a great Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
within which there were two
other Encloſures, whereof one was
larger than the other. Near the
Gate leading into the firſt, there
were ſeveral Perſons drawn, and
within it might be obſerv'd an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Women. But at the entrance
might be ſeen an ancient Man ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
drawn in the poſture of one,
who ſeem'd to have ſome directions
to give thoſe who entred into the
Encloſure.</p>
               <p>After we had a long time taken a
proſpect of that Emblematical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation,
and were at a loſs,
what to think of it, there happen'd
to be ſtanding by us a very ancient
Man, whoſe curioſity had engag'd
him upon the Survey of that Piece, as
ours had us. This good Man had
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49014:77"/>
well obſerv'd all our Actions, and
thereupon addreſs'd himſelf to us in
this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>It is no wonder, my Friends, if
you find it ſo hard a matter to gueſs
at the explication of that Picture.
There are few perſons, even of this
Country, who know the meaning of
it. This Preſent was not made by
any of the Inhabitants of this City
A ſtranger, came heretofore into
this Country, a perſon no leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable
for the excellency of
his Apprehenſion, than for his deep
Wiſdome. That man, in all his
words and in all his actions imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the courſe of life of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>
and <hi>Parmenides.</hi> He it was who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
this Temple, and that Emble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Picture to <hi>Saturn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ask'd him, whether he had any
acquaintance with that Perſon. Yea,
ſaid he, I have been an admirer of
him a long time. For though he
were but a young Man, yet could he
diſcourſe of all things very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently.
I have heard him oftentimes
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49014:78"/>
diſcourſing upon the ſubject of this
Picture. I intreat you, as you love
the immortal Gods, Cry'd I, to give
us an explication of it, if your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
will permit it. You will
infinitely oblige us, for we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
deſirous to know what it
ſignifies. With all my heart ſaid he.
But it is neceſſary, that I give you
an Advertiſement before-hand, of
the danger whereto you expoſe
your ſelves. For if, when I ſhall
have related theſe things to you,
you perfectly comprehend them,
you will become Wiſe and Happy;
if not, you will be ignorant and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,
and you will lead a wicked and
a wretched Life. This Embleme
hath ſome correſpondence with that
which was propoſed by<note n="*" place="margin">A Sorceriſs who had the face of a young Maid, and in the rest of her body reſembled a Lyon.</note> 
                  <hi>Sphinx;</hi>
whoever could not explicate what
ſhe ſaid was by her put to death:
On the contrary, ſhe ſav'd his life,
who found out the explication of it.
The ſame thing is to be affirm'd of
this Picture. For Extravagance is
like a <hi>Sphinx</hi> among Men, obſcurely
propoſing what is good, bad, and
indifferent. If any one be not able
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49014:78"/>
to diſcern them, ſhe kills him not
immediately at a blow, as the <hi>Sphinx</hi>
did; but ſhe treats him with greater
cruelty. For ſhe puts him to death
by degrees, as thoſe who are put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Rack. In like manner, if
any one attains the knowledg of
theſe things, beſides his clearing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from that misfortune, Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
vaniſhes, and he is perfectly
happy all the reſt of his days. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you therefore, ſaid he, by the
Love you bear your ſelves, to give
your greateſt attention to what I
am going to relate to you. Juſt
Gods! cry'd I, what impatience
have you rais'd in us, to be inform'd
of theſe things, if they are ſuch as
you repreſent them! Make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
of it, replies he. I intreat
you then, ſaid I to him, to deliver
us out of this impatience, and to be
aſſur'd, that we too much fear the
danger wherewith you threaten us,
and that we have alſo too high an
eſteem for ſo noble a reward, to
ſuffer the leaſt of your words to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
our attention.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:49014:79"/>
Having thereupon taken a little
walking-ſtick in his hand, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
it to the Embleme, do you
ſee, ſaid he, that large Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?
Yes, we do ſee it, ſaid
We.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary, ſaid he, that you
firſt know, that that Place is called
<hi>Life,</hi> and that the perſons whom
you ſee ſtanding there neer the Gate,
are ſuch as are to enter into it. As
to the Old Man, whom you ſee rais'd
above all the others, holding a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in one hand, and making a ſign
with the other, he is called <hi>Genius.</hi>
He gives directions to thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
what they ought to do, when
they ſhall come into Life, and ſhews
them the Way they are to take, in
order to their happy being therein.
I pray tell me, ſaid I, where is that
Way, and what is to be done to
come into it. Do you not perceive,
ſaid he, that, towards the Gate,
through which all thoſe perſons paſs,
there is a Throne, on which there
ſits a Woman, who is painted and
ſeems to have many attractions to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49014:79"/>
perſwade? What you ſay is true,
ſaid I; ſhe hath alſo a Cup in
her hand. How do you call
her?</p>
               <p>She is called <hi>Imposture,</hi> reply'd
he, becauſe ſhe generally deceives
all Men. What is her employment?
It is, reply'd he, to preſent all thoſe
who enter into <hi>Life</hi> with a certain
Drink, whereby ſhe inebriates them
With <hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>Ignorance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What happens afterwards? As
ſoon as they have taken of that
Drink, they enter into <hi>Life,</hi> ſaid
he.</p>
               <p>Can none be exempted from taking
of it? None. Only ſome drink
more of it, others, leſs. Do you
not ſee further, that, within the
Gate, added the Old Man, there
are certain Women, who ſeem to
be highly engag'd in a mad debauch?
If you obſerve them well, you
will find they are in poſtures much
different one from another. Thoſe
are <hi>Opinions, Concupiſcences,</hi> and <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs.</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:49014:80"/>
Now when thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of whom I have ſpoken, come
to enter into <hi>Life,</hi> thoſe Women are
tranſported with joy, they embrace
them with the greateſt kindneſs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
and prevail ſo far as to
draw them to them. And whether
do they conduct them? They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
Some to the Port of ſafety, and
others, to Precipices. Which Fate
attends them, becauſe they were
poiſon'd by <hi>Impoſture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is a very ſtrange Drink that
you tell us of, reply'd I. That is
not all, added he. For though they
promiſe all, that they will conduct
them to happy Life, and furniſh
them with the means of attaining it,
yet many ſuffer themſelves to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
out of the right way, and
inconſiderately run of all ſides, by
reaſon of the <hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi>
they have taken, at their entrance
into <hi>Life,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Inform me, I pray, who is that
Woman exalted upon a Ball? ſhe
ſeems to be blind, and diſtracted.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49014:80"/>
You are in the right, reply'd he.
Her name is <hi>Fortune,</hi> ſhe is not only
blind, but ſhe is alſo deaf, and mad.
She runs up and down, takes away
from one, gives to another, And it
will not be long after ſhe hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd
ſomething on this Man, ere
ſhe gets it away again, and diſpoſes
it into other hands. Whatever ſhe
does diſcovers her temerity and
inconſtancy. Accordingly, her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
is extreamly well repreſented
to us by the poſture ſhe is in. For if
ſhe be plac'd upon a Ball, it is to
ſhew, that there is not any aſſurance
in the preſents ſhe makes us, and
that there needs but a ſmall matter to
ruine him, who puts any confidence
in her.</p>
               <p>Thoſe whom you ſee ſtanding by
her, and endeavouring to catch what
ſhe caſts away, are called the <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate.</hi>
Why, ſaid I, are they ſo
different one from another? ſome
of them, ſeem to be tranſported with
gladneſs, and others, to be in a
dreadful deſpair?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:49014:81"/>
Thoſe, ſaid he, whom you ſee ſo
jocund, are the Perſons, who have
received ſome favour from <hi>Fortune,</hi>
and thence it comes, that they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
her with the name of <hi>Good
Fortune.</hi> Thoſe, on the contrary,
who are ſo dejected, and ſtretch out
their Arms, repreſent the Perſons
from whom ſhe hath taken away
what ſhe had given them, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
they call her <hi>Ill Fortune.</hi>
What preſents, reply'd I, can ſhe
make them, that they ſhould be ſo
jocund, after the receipt thereof,
and what can ſhe take away from the
others, that ſhould put them into
ſo great a Conſternation? It is that,
reply'd he, which we ordinarily
imagine to be the true Goods, as
<hi>Wealth, Reputation, Nobility, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Soveraignty, Kingdoms,</hi> and
all the other things of that nature.
But we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak
of them elſewhere. Let us now go
on with the explication of our Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
               <p>Do you not obſerve, that when
ſome have paſt that Gate, there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49014:81"/>
it another Encloſure beyond
which there are certain Women, who
may be noted by their dreſſes to be
of ill demeanour? I obſerve them
very well, reply'd I.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, ſaid he, are named <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence,
Luxury, Rapine,</hi> and <hi>Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
They are there ſet, as it were
Sentinels, to take notice of thoſe
who have received any favour from
<hi>Fortune,</hi> and when they can meet
with any one, they are extreamly
glad. They embrace him, and treat
him with great kindneſs; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
him a pleaſant Life, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from all kind of trouble
and croſſes. In fine, if they can
perſuade him, and if he once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
himſelf up to pleaſures, that
Life is indeed delightfull to him for
a time; but it will not be long
after he hath taſted of its enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ere he will be of a contrary
Opinion, and find nothing but
bitterneſs in it, and when he begins
to come to himſelf, he is too late
convinc'd, that he hath not enjoy'd
any true pleaſure, that he hath
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49014:82"/>
ruin'd himſelf, and that people
laugh at him. For when he hath
ſquander'd away all that <hi>Fortune</hi>
had beſtow'd on him, he becomes a
Slave to thoſe Strumpets, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to a neceſſity of undertaking
all ſorts of wicked actions, even to
thoſe that are moſt prejudicial to
himſelf, and ſuch as hurry him to
the precipice of deſtruction. As for
example, to Steal, to commit Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge
by the robbing of Temples,
to betray his beſt Friends, in a
word, to commit all ſorts of crimes
and unrighteous Acts. In fine,
when he is come to the height of his
wickedneſs, he is deliver'd up into
the hands of <hi>Puniſhment.</hi> Who is
that Woman you ſpeak of? Do
you not perceive behind there, a
little Door, and a narrow and very
obſcure Dungeon, at which may be
ſeen the glimpſe of certain Women
that are naſty, and cover'd only
with dirty rags and tatters? Yea,
reply'd I, I do ſee them very well.
She who hath a whip in her hand,
ſaies the Old man, is called <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
She who hath her head bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49014:82"/>
down towards her knees, is <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
And the other, that tares her
hair, is called <hi>Miſery.</hi> And for the
deformed and dreadful-look'd-man,
who ſtands neer thoſe Women, and
who is lean and ſtark-naked, he is
called <hi>Mourning.</hi> That other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who is behind him, is his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
named <hi>Rage,</hi> or <hi>Deſpaire.</hi> To
theſe horrid Monſters is this miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
man firſt deliver'd, that he
may lead a Life with them, in Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
and Torments. A while
after, he is dragg'd into another
Houſe, which is no leſs terrible
than the former. It is that of <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</hi>
There muſt he ſpend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of his days, in perpetual
calamities. What becomes of him
at laſt, ſaid I? If it happen, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
he, that he makes his appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to <hi>Repentance,</hi> ſhe recovers
him out of that unhappy condition,
ſhe works a change in his opinion
and will, and re-excites in him a
deſire of applying himſelf to <hi>True
Doctrine;</hi> though <hi>Opinion</hi> may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
conduct him ſometimes to
<hi>Falſe Doctrine.</hi> So that if he follow
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49014:83"/>
the <hi>Opinion</hi> which guides him to
<hi>True Doctrine,</hi> ſhe cleanſes him of
his former errors, and he becomes
happy for the remainder of his days.
But if on the contrary he be ſtill ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by <hi>Falſe Doctrine,</hi> he will run
the hazard of a relapſe into his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſentiments, and return into
the ſame condition, wherein he was
before.</p>
               <p>But who is that <hi>Falſe Doctrine</hi> you
ſpeak of, ſaid I? Do you not
perceive that other Encloſure ſaid
he? I do, ſaid I. On the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of it, ſaid he, towards the Gate
there ſtands a Woman advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
dreſs'd, yet ſeems to betray
ſomething of modeſty. She it is
whom the greateſt part of Men, and
particularly thoſe who are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for their internal Endowments,
call <hi>Doctrine,</hi> though ſhe never was
ſuch, and that that name is falſely
attributed to her. And yet thoſe
who are deſirous to be happy, and
come to <hi>True Doctrine,</hi> do firſt take
their way to her. Not but that
there is another Way, but that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49014:83"/>
this is the more ordinary. As to the
Men, whom you ſee walking in that
Encloſure, they are the followers
of that <hi>Falſe Doctrine,</hi> who are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
and deceived with an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of her being the <hi>True Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
They are known by the
names of <hi>Poets, Orators, Logicians,
Muſicians, Arithmeticians, Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
Aſtrologers, Epicureans, Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks,
Criticks,</hi> and all the others,
of that qualification.</p>
               <p>Who are thoſe Women, who ſeem
to run to and fro, and with whom
you ſaid a while ſince that <hi>Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi>
was? How come they within
that ſecond Encloſure? you are not
miſtaken, reply'd he; they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the very ſame. They ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
advance ſo farr. But they come
not thither ſo oft as they do within
the firſt Encloſure. Nay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Opinions</hi> get in there. For
thoſe whom you ſee there have ſtill
within them ſome remainders of the
Drink which <hi>Impoſture</hi> had preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them withall. They are ſtill at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Extravagance,</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:49014:84"/>
and they will never quit thoſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate
Opinions, and will not be
diſengag'd from thoſe other vicious
inclinations, till ſuch time as
having forſaken that <hi>Falſe Doctrine,</hi>
they enter into the way of <hi>True
Science,</hi> to take an Antidote, for
the disburthening themſelves of all
their evil <hi>Opinions,</hi> and the diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vices wherewith they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
For as long as they ſhall
continue in falſe Opinion, they will
never be able to recover their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
nor oppoſe the leaſt evil, by
the means of thoſe ſorts of Sciences.
I pray tell me, where is the Way
which conducts men to <hi>True Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
Do you perceive, ſaid he,
at the top of the Mount, a certain
place, which is deſert, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited.
Very well anſwer'd I.
You ſee alſo, continu'd he, a little
Gate, before which there is a Way,
wherein there are few perſons to be
met, becauſe it ſeems to be inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
by reaſon of its craggineſs and
difficulty of aſcent? I ſee all that,
ſaid I; you are much in the right.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49014:84"/>
when you ſay that way is very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
paſſable. If you look very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly,
a litle beyond it, there is
an extraordinay high Hill, whereof
the way is very narrow, and come
paſs'd of all ſides with precipices?
Very true.</p>
               <p>You are to know, that that is the
Way which conducts to <hi>True Doctrine,</hi>
and is, as you may obſerve, very
hard to be diſcover'd. But do you
conſider alſo, that, upon that Hill,
there is a great and high Rock,
very ſteepy all about, on which
there are two Women, ſtrong and
robuſt, which ſtretch out their
Arms to all? I ſee them very well,
how are they called? One is called
<hi>Continence;</hi> the other, <hi>Patience.</hi> They
are Siſters. The reaſon of their
ſtretching forth their hands ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
to ſuch perſons as preſent
themſelves, is to exhort thoſe who
are in their Way to take heart, and
not to put a check to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
out of any diſcouragement;
and it is alſo to advertiſe them,
that they have not long to ſuffer,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49014:85"/>
ere they come into the right
way.</p>
               <p>I would fain know, when with
much difficulty they have got to that
Rock, how they will be able to
aſcend any higher; for I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no path, nor tract in which
they may go? Thoſe two Women,
reply'd he, come down from the
top of the Rock towards them, and
draw them up, where they give
them the convenience to reſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and take their breath.
Then they give them courage and
new ſtrength, and promiſe them
that they will be their guides to
bring them to <hi>True Doctrine.</hi> In
fine they ſhew them, that the way
to her is pleaſant, eaſy, and free
from all misfortune.</p>
               <p>But, added he, do you perceive,
near that little Copſe of Wood, a
Place, which is no leſs divertive,
as well by reaſon of the great light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs
of it, as for that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
a delightful Meadow?
You ſee alſo in the middle, another
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49014:85"/>
Encloſure, and another Gate? It
is very right, reply'd I. That place
is called the <hi>Seat</hi> and <hi>Manſion</hi> of
the <hi>Bleſſed.</hi> It is there the <hi>Vertues</hi>
and <hi>Felicity</hi> have eſtabliſhed their
Throne.</p>
               <p>O how pleaſant does that place
ſeem to be! cry'd I. Do you not
farther obſerve, ſaid he, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Gate, there is a Woman
very modeſtly clad, of a grave
look, and who yet is extreamly
beautiful, though ſhe be well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
in years? ſhe is not made
ſtanding on a Ball, as <hi>Fortune</hi> is;
on the contrary, ſhe ſitss down upon
a ſquare ſtone, which is firm and
immoveable. On both ſides of her
are two Women, who in likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
are her Daughters. What
you ſay is true. She in the midſt,
reply'd he, is <hi>True Doctrine,</hi> and
the two others are named <hi>Truth</hi> and
<hi>Perſuaſion.</hi> She is ſeated on a ſquare
ſtone, to ſhew Travellers, that the
way which leads to her is firm, and
ſecure, and to raiſe in thoſe, who
receive any preſents from her hands,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49014:86"/>
an apprehenſion that her gifts are as
certain as thoſe of <hi>Fortune</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant,
and that they ſhall never be
diſturbed in the enjoyment of their
Goods. What is ſhe able to give?
Aſſurance and quiet in their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
reply'd he. But what is the
excellency of thoſe preſents? They
have the virtue of aſſuring Men,
that there ſhall not happen to them
the leaſt diſſatisfaction in Life. O
ye juſt Gods! what attractive gifts
are theſe? But how comes it, ſaid
I, that <hi>True Doctrine</hi> is ſet without the
Encloſure? It is to cure thoſe who
come to her, and to adminiſter to
them a certain Medicine, to the
end that, being purged, ſhe may
conduct them to the <hi>Vertues.</hi> How
can that be done reply'd I? I do
not comprehend what you ſay.
You will comprehend it within a
ſhort time, reply'd he. The caſe here
is the ſame as with a man caſt down
by a great ſickneſs, whom they are
conducting to a Phyſician. Firſt of
all the Phyſitian makes uſe of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
Whereby all the ill humours
he hath in the Body may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log'd;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49014:86"/>
then he reſtores him by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to his ſtrength, and in fine
recovers him to his former health.
But if the ſick perſon will not
obey him, no wonder if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe
into the violence of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</p>
               <p>'Tis enough, anſwer'd I, what
your meaning is, I now fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.
In like manner, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
he; if any one put himſelf into
the hands of <hi>True Doctrine;</hi> ſhe
treats him, and gives him of a drink,
whereby ſhe communicates her
vertue to him, that, being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and having disburthen'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of all that was evil, as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
the <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Errour</hi> he
had taken of <hi>Impoſture,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Vices, wherewith he had been
fill'd in the firſt Encloſure, as <hi>Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,
Avarice, Wrath, Covetuouſneſs,</hi>
and <hi>Incontinence,</hi> ſhe may bring him
to <hi>Science,</hi> and the other <hi>Vertues.</hi>
Who are thoſe Women, ſaid
I?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:49014:87"/>
What, ſaid he, do you not ſee, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
he, that within that Gate,
there is a company of fair Ladies,
very plainly cloath'd, and yet have
all the attractions and all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
could be wiſh'd in them? I
ſee them very well, reply'd I;
but I pray tell me their names. The
chiefeſt of them is <hi>Science;</hi> her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Siſters are <hi>Fortitude, Juſtice,
Integrity, Temperance, Modeſty, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality,
Continence,</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs,</hi>
beautiful Ladies indeed! cry'd I.
What hopes ought we not now to
conceive? You may hope any thing,
added he, if, perfectly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
what I have ſaid, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it by your practiſe.</p>
               <p>We ſhall endeavour it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of our power, reply'd I. Which
if you do, anſwer'd he, you will be
aſſuredly happy.</p>
               <p>But when they have taken this
man into their protection, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of him? Whither do they
diſpoſe of him? They conduct him
to their Mother, who is named <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:49014:87"/>
Do you obſerve the Way
leading up to the Mountain, which
is as it were a Cittadel in the midſt
of the other Encloſures? Do you
alſo take notice, that at the entrance
of it there is a very beautiful Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
ſeated on a Throne, very neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
clad, yet without affectation, and
Crown'd with Flowers? I ſee her.
Know then that ſhe repreſents <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi>
reply'd he? Now when any one
comes up to the place of her aboad,
ſhe and all the other Vertues Crown
him, as they do thoſe who have
gain'd great Victories. What Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes
hath he gain'd for that, ſaid
I? Very great ones, reply'd he.
He hath ſurmounted, and quell'd
the dreadful Monſters, which did
him a thouſand miſchiefs, and
brought him into ſlavery. But
thoſe noble Victories have made
him Maſter of himſelf, and thoſe
very Monſters, whom he obey'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
are now become his ſlaves.
What Monſters, are thoſe? Firſt,
<hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>Ignorance.</hi> What do you
not think that they are Monſters?
I do, reply'd I, and very dreadful
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49014:88"/>
ones. Next, reply'd he, there are
<hi>Grief, Sadneſs, Avarice, Incontinence,</hi>
and all the other Vices of that kind.
Then hath he an abſolute power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them, and does not obey them,
as he did before. O illuſtrious
Actions! O remarkable Victory!
But, I pray, tell me, what Vertue
hath that Crown wherewith he is
adorn'd? O my dear Friend, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
the Old Man, how powerful is
that Crown? He who is once adorn'd
therewith becomes perfectly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
and grounds not his hopes upon
the happineſs of another. They are
ſetled in himſelf. O the noble way
of conquering, cry'd I! But when
he is Crown'd, what does he? or
whether goes he?</p>
               <p>The Vertues bring him back to
the place whence he came, and make
him ſee, how unhappy and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
they are who continue in it,
what miſcarriages they fall into in
<hi>Life,</hi> how far they are out of the
way to <hi>Felicity,</hi> and how they are
led away Captives by their enemies;
ſome, by <hi>Incontinence;</hi> others, by
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49014:88"/>
                  <hi>Avarice;</hi> others; by <hi>Vanity;</hi> and by
all the other Vices, wherein they
are ſo entangled, that it is impoſſible
for them to get out of them. So
that, for the remainder of their
days, they are in perpetual diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
not able to find out the way,
which conducts them to <hi>True Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;</hi>
becauſe they have forgot
the percepts and directions, which
the <hi>Genius</hi> had given them, at their
firſt entrance into <hi>Life.</hi> What you
ſay ſeems to me to be very true, but
I have yet one difficulty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Why do the <hi>Vertues</hi> ſhew
him the place whence he came?
It is, reply'd he, becauſe he had no
certain and real knowledg of what
paſſes there; and that, by reaſon of
the <hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> which
he had been preſented with, by
<hi>Impoſture;</hi> he was miſtaken in the
diſcerning of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi> Whence
it came to paſs, that he led an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Life, and like that of thoſe
who had continu'd in it. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
acquired the true <hi>Science</hi> of
things, he hath this happineſs, and
this advantage, that he may, at
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49014:89"/>
his own eaſe, conſider the miſeries
of others, without the leaſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of being expos'd thereto
himſelf.</p>
               <p>When he hath excercis'd his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
upon all that, what
becomes of him? He goes up and
down, which way he pleaſes. There
is no place, where he is not in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as much as if he were in the
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of it was ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult that it ſeem'd habitable only by the Gods. See</hi> Pomp. Mela de ſit. Orb.</note> 
                  <hi>Corycian Cave.</hi> For whither ſoever
he goes, he is aſſur'd, that he ſhall
always live irreproachably, that
all people will entertain him, and
that with ſuch pleaſure and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
as a ſick perſon does his
Phyſician. How, ſaid I, is he no
longer afraid of thoſe Women whom
you call Monſters, ſince he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
from all thoſe Evils, which
men are ſubject to through their
means?</p>
               <p>He abſolutely defies them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
he. He ſhall be no longer
tormented, either by <hi>Grief,</hi> or <hi>Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
or <hi>Incontinence,</hi> or <hi>Avarice,</hi> or
<hi>Indigence,</hi> or any other Monſter;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49014:89"/>
becauſe he hath an abſolute power
over them, nay hath a certain So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verainty
over the Evils, whereby he
was perſecuted before. And as
thoſe who have been once ſtung by
a Viper, ordinarily carry about
them a Preſervative, to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt the Venome of all
other Serpents; ſo is it not in the
power of any thing to hurt him any
more; becauſe he always hath the
remedy about him.</p>
               <p>What you ſay is admirable, but;
I pray, inform me, who they are,
whom I perceive coming down
from the Hill; ſome are Crown'd,
and betray their joy in their very
countenances; others, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
have their heads and hips
all bruis'd, and are detain'd Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
by thoſe Women? They
who are Crown'd, reply'd he, are
ſuch as have been preſerv'd by <hi>True
Doctrine,</hi> therefore do they diſcover
their alacrity, and joy. As for the
others, who have no Crowns;
ſome of them having been rejected
by <hi>True Doctrine</hi> return from her,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49014:90"/>
Miſerable and Unhappy; and the
others having ſpent all their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
after they had got up as far
as <hi>Patience,</hi> take their way back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and inconſiderately wander
up and down through deſolate
places. The Women, who follow
them, are <hi>Affliction, Deſpair, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny,</hi>
and <hi>Ignorance.</hi> If it be as
you ſay, there are no Evils where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are not perſecuted.</p>
               <p>That is alſo true, reply'd he;
but there is yet more in it: when
they are come back within the firſt
Encloſure, towards <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi>
and <hi>Incontinence,</hi> they do not accuſe
themſelves of having done amiſs,
nay, on the contrary, they raile at
<hi>True Doctrine,</hi> they look on all
that follow her, as unfortunate and
miſerable perſons, who are got
out of the way which ought to be
follow'd, and who have loſt the
Goods, whereof they imagin'd
themſelves poſſeſs'd. What may
thoſe Goods be? ſaid I. To tell
you in a word, reply'd he, it is
<hi>Debauchedneſs</hi> and <hi>Incontinence.</hi> For
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49014:90"/>
they place the chief Good, in
eating and drinking, as Beaſts,
do.</p>
               <p>I pray, tell me, how you call
thoſe Women, who are ſo chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and ſo jocund in their return?
They are <hi>Opinions,</hi> who, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted,
to <hi>True Doctrine,</hi> thoſe who
are now among the <hi>Vertues,</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
back to bring others thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to give others an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that ſuch as they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
thither are perfectly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</p>
               <p>Do they go quite to the <hi>Vertues,</hi>
ſaid I? No, for <hi>Opinion</hi> is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to come up to <hi>Science</hi> they do
not conduct any further than to
<hi>True Doctrine,</hi> and as ſoon as they
have recommended any one into
her hands, they immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
to find out others. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they may be compar'd to thoſe
Veſſels, which are fill'd with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Merchandizes, as ſoon as they
are unloaden of what they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
It muſt be confeſs'd, that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49014:91"/>
you make what you ſay very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible,
ſaid he; but you have
not yet explicated to me what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
the <hi>Genius</hi> gives thoſe who
enter into <hi>Life.</hi> Only this; ſaid
he, that they be courageous. Do
you therefore, my Friends, take
courage. For I will give you ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
even to the leaſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
ſo that nothing ſhall eſcape
your knowledg. Certainly, ſaid
I, we are extreamly oblig'd to
you.</p>
               <p>Whereupon directing his hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
towards the Picture. Do you
ſee, ſaid he, that Woman who is
blind, and who ſtands upon the
Ball, whom erewhile we called <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune?</hi>
We ſee her very well. The
<hi>Genius,</hi> reply'd he, gives them this
advertiſement, that no credit is to
be given to what ſhe ſaies, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
charges them, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what proceeds from her, as
any thing certain and ſtable; ſince
that, in fine, nothing hinders her
depriving us of what ſhe gives us,
to diſpoſe it into other hands, ſince
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49014:91"/>
it is one of her ordinary pranks.
For that reaſon is it alſo, that he
adviſes them, not to be overcome
by her Preſents, not to betray any
extraordinary joy, when they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to us, and, in like manner,
not to be dejected, when they are
taken away from us; not to afford
them our praiſe, or diſpraiſe, and
to have this conceit of her, that ſhe
does not any thing by the dictate of
reaſon; but always inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and by chance. Thence he alſo
adviſes us not to admire any thing
ſhe does, and not to imitate thoſe
deceitful Bankiers, who having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
other mens Mony, are as
glad, as if it were their own, and
are angry when it is called for in
from them, as if ſome great injury
were done them: not remembring
that it was put into their hands,
only for the Creditors conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to take it in, when he pleas'd.
Thus doth the <hi>Genius</hi> direct us to
look on the Favours of <hi>Fortune,</hi>
and to be always mindful, that it
is her cuſtom, to take away again
whatever ſhe gives, to reſtore ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49014:92"/>
more than ſhe had ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd,
and to carry away; after
all that, not only what ſhe had
lately given, but all a man was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes'd
of before. Hence is it, that
he adviſes them, to accept of the
Goods ſhe gives, and immediately
to make their recourſe to <hi>True Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
who will abſolutely ſecure
the poſſeſſion thereof, if they can
be but preſerv'd, till they have come
up quite to her. For this <hi>Doctrine</hi>
is nothing elſe but the true <hi>Science</hi>
of ſuch things as are beneficial,
and the aſſured and clear poſſeſſion
thereof. Hence is it, that he minds
them of making their applications
as ſoon as they can to her. And
if it happen, that they meet with
<hi>Incontinence</hi> or <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> he
Councils them to get out of their
company with the ſooneſt, and not
to credit what they ſay, till they
come to <hi>Falſe Doctrine.</hi> For he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
them to continue there a
while, and to take of her what ſhe
pleaſes, as it were by the way, and
without making any halt, that they
may haſten thence towards <hi>True
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49014:92"/>
Doctrine.</hi> And theſe are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
which the <hi>Genius</hi> gives;
if any one ſlights them, or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
them not as he ought to do,
he becomes a wicked perſon, and
periſhes miſerably.</p>
               <p>This is the Riddle, my Friends,
which you ſee repreſented in that
Embleme. If now you are deſirous
to put any queſtion to me, for the
better underſtanding of every
thing in particular, I am as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to give you all the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I can, and not to conceal any
thing from you.</p>
               <p>You ſay very well, reply'd I;
but if you are ſo pleas'd, tell us,
what the <hi>Genius</hi> enjoynes them to
receive from <hi>Falſe Doctrine?</hi> Thoſe
things, reply'd he, which ſeem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to Life, as <hi>Learning,</hi> and
other things relating to <hi>Study,</hi>
which <hi>Plato</hi> affirmed had certain
curbs to prevent young people from
being inclin'd otherwiſe. Not
that they are abſolutely neceſſary
in order to an arrival to <hi>True
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49014:93"/>
Doctrine;</hi> for we are not melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
thereby. Without them, we
may come to the perfection of
<hi>Vertue,</hi> but they facilitate our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of it, and are not without
ſome advantage. We may, indeed,
acquire the knowledg of what is
unknown to us, by the means of
an Interpreter, explicating to us
what we underſtand not: yet is
it better to be acquainted with the
Language, and not to ſtand in
need of an Interpreter. So, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
theſe <hi>Sciences,</hi> nothing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs
our attaining of <hi>Vertue.</hi>
'Tis true, they are Ornaments,
and excellent Directories, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are illuminated in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of it; but it follows not, that
they, who are endued therewith,
are in a better condition, or have
a greater bent to goodneſs, ſince
they are deceiv'd, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in the knowledg of <hi>Good</hi>
and <hi>Evil,</hi> and, many times, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
with all manner of Vices and
Miſdemeanours. No, no, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
he; nothing hinders, but
that he; who is come to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49014:93"/>
by Study, and hath attain'd
all the Sciences, may be as much
inclin'd to Debauchery, Avarice,
Incontinence, Injuſtice, Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
and Extravagance, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
This we are convinc'd
of, by daily experience. Why
then ſhould they aſſume any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to themſelves above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in order to their meliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
upon the account of thoſe
Sciences? I think we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſufficiently ſhewn, by what
we have ſaid, that there is no
likelyhood of any ſuch thing. It
may be, thoſe perſons imagine
they are in a better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than others, becauſe they
are within the ſecond Encloſure,
and conſequently at a leſs diſtance
from <hi>True Doctrine.</hi> But what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
is it to them, that they
are not at ſo great a diſtance
from her, as the others, ſince
we ſometimes find thoſe perſons,
who were with <hi>Incontinence,</hi> come
up, from the firſt Encloſure, to
the third, and aſcend even to <hi>True
Doctrine,</hi> leaving thoſe Learned
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49014:94"/>
men behind them. How then can
it be imagin'd, that they ſhould
have any Prerogative, ſince that,
many times, with all their Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
they are longer than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
ere they take into the right
Way, and diſcover more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Learning what they ought
to know, in order to their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
thereto. For they, who are
in the ſecond Encloſure, though
there were nothing elſe to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
againſt them, profeſs a
knowledg of what they know not:
and while they continue in that
ſentiment, it is impoſſible they
ſhould ever come to <hi>True Doctrine.</hi>
I believe, you alſo perceive, that
the <hi>Opinions</hi> come from the firſt
Encloſure towards them. Thence
comes it, that they are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the others, if <hi>Repentance</hi>
do not accompany them, and if
they admit not a perſuaſion of their
not having <hi>True Science,</hi> but that
they are ſtill ſeduced by <hi>Falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
For while they remain in
that condition, it is impoſſible
they ſhould ever become happy.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49014:94"/>
Therefore, my Friends, you are
ſeriouſly to endeavour the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of theſe Inſtructions, and to
reflect on them, till you have
converted them into a habit. Let
them be the ſubject of your moſt
earneſt meditation, aſſuring your
ſelves, that your thoughts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be too much fixt upon them,
All the reſt is, in compariſon,
nothing conſiderable, nay it is
rather to be look'd on as of no
advantage, and ſuperfluous. Be
mindful then to do what I tell
you; for otherwiſe, all you
have already underſtood will
not be any way beneficial to
you.</p>
               <p>We ſhall not be negligent in the
doing of it, ſaid I to him: yet
give us this further explication,
why you put not into the number
of <hi>Goods,</hi> thoſe things which men
receive from <hi>Fortune,</hi> as <hi>Life, Health,
Wealth, Reputation, Children, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,</hi>
and all other concerns of
that kind? Tell us alſo, why
you put not into the number of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49014:95"/>
                  <hi>Evils,</hi> thoſe things which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thereto? To be free with
you, all you have told us, as to
that particular, ſeems to us a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox.
I beſeech you, take the
pains to tell us what you think of
it. With all my heart, reply'd
the Old Man. Do you think, ſaid
he, that <hi>Life</hi> is a <hi>Good,</hi> in him,
that does not live <hi>Well?</hi> No, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
I; on the contrary, I hold
it to be an <hi>Evil</hi> for him. But as
<hi>Life</hi> ſeems to me to be an <hi>Evil,</hi>
in thoſe who live <hi>Ill;</hi> ſo do I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
it to be a <hi>Good,</hi> in thoſe who
live <hi>Well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That cannot be, reply'd he, for
it is impoſſible, that the ſame thing
ſhould be both <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi> inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it would be, by that means,
<hi>beneficial</hi> and <hi>hurtful,</hi> the object of
<hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>averſion,</hi> at the ſame time;
which is a contradiction. But let
us ſay more, let us acknowledg,
that there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>living,</hi> and <hi>living ill.</hi> The
wicked <hi>Life</hi> is always an <hi>Evil,</hi> and
Life, indefinitely ſpeaking, cannot
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49014:95"/>
be ſuch. Is not that your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
It is ſo, reply'd I. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
then will be, reply'd he,
that <hi>Life</hi> is never an <hi>Evil,</hi> ſince that,
if it were ſuch, it would follow,
that there muſt be ſomewhat of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
in thoſe who live <hi>Well,</hi> ſince
they would have Life, which were
an Evil; a poſition not maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
As therefore <hi>Life</hi> is common
to both <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad,</hi> it muſt be
neceſſarily inferr'd, that, of it ſelf,
it is neither <hi>good</hi> nor <hi>bad.</hi> It may
be compar'd to Cauſticks and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions,
which may be beneficial
to the indiſpos'd, and hurtful to
thoſe who are in health. But that
you may the better comprehend
this truth, conſider in your ſelf,
whether you would not prefer a
noble and a generous <hi>Death,</hi> before
a wicked, and an infamous <hi>Life?</hi>
I am confident you would not make
any pauſe at it, and that you would
embrace Death. No queſtion of
it, reply'd I. Then by conſequence,
ſaid he, Death is no Evil, ſince it
is ſometimes more advantageous to
dye than to live. The ſame thing is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49014:96"/>
to be ſaid concerning ſickneſs and
health. There are certain times,
and certain occurrences, wherein
health would be prejudicial to us.
And to make it appear that it is ſo,
let us make the ſame conſideration
of Wealth. Do we not daily ſee,
that ſome very rich men live a lewd
and miſerable Life? No, no, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
he, Wealth contributes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to happy Life; but, on the
contrary, the wealthieſt, for the
moſt part, are the moſt unhappy.
Let us then conclude, that it is not
<hi>Wealth,</hi> but <hi>True Doctrine</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
an inclination to goodneſs.
And thence it juſtly follows, that
Riches are not to be numbred among
Goods, inaſmuch as they do not
make men better, or more happy.
So that, as they are hurtful to thoſe
who cannot tell how to uſe them,
ſo can they not be accounted Goods,
ſince it is ſometimes advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to be without them. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there be any one that knows
how to make good uſe of them, he
ſhall live happy; if not, he ſhall be
miſerable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:49014:96"/>
In fine, to ſum up all in a word,
that which creates diſorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
in the minds of men, is, the
<hi>Opinion</hi> they have, of theſe kinds
of things. Some ſhun them, as the
ſource of all Evils, and others ſeek
after them, as true Goods, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that by their means only they
may become happy. Nay they are
ſo fixt in this perſuaſion, that to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
theſe, they make no difficulty
of committing the greateſt enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and moſt deteſtable actions.
Which happens to them, becauſe
they know not the nature of true
<hi>Good.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">This I take out of the Latius Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daxius.</hi>
                  </note> They know not, that, from
<hi>Evil,</hi> there never proceeds any good.
They conſider not that moſt men
have acquired their wealth and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,
by the means of their
Crimes, as by Perfidiouſneſs, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries,
Murthers, Rapine, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enormous actions. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be true, that no Good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from Evil, and yet that Riches
are many times the production of
Crimes, it inevitably follows, that
Riches cannot be called Goods. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
Good and Evil are incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49014:97"/>
and as it is impoſſible to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
Wiſdome and Juſtice by bad
actions, ſo will it not ever be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that Extravagance and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
can proceed from any good
cauſe. Since therefore it is true,
that nothing hinders but that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Glory, Victory, and other
things of that kind, may happen to
us by lawful ways, let us make this
concluſion, that, of themſelves, they
are neither good nor evil, and that,
properly ſpeaking, not any thing
but Wiſdome, is a Good, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Folly that is Evil.</p>
