            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and laste poynte of this matter is, that the sure and honest rule of liuynge is lernynge. And that is the thyng, whiche soonest helpeth a man to vertue: All other thynges temporall be but tryfils, and not of suche value, that there in we oughte to spende any studye. Doubtles nobilite or gentylnes of bloud is a goodlye thynge: and ryches is a thynge precious and delectable: but the gyftes of Fortune be suche, that as we may se by experience, she gyueth them, where they be not loked fore: and those whiche alredy haue them, she dispoyleth. More ouer great substance is a token or pray to allure seruauntes and other parsones ylle disposed / to wayte a man with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, and to enserche his cofers and baggis. And finally they be redy for euery lewde person, that may happe to take them. Honoure is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt, but it is vnstable and nothynge constaunt. Beautie is a thynge excellente, and for the attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge therof, moche debate hath ensurged: but yet it is transitorie, and dureth but a season. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilye helthe is a treasure, but that is also muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Strengthe is moche desyred, and is taken for a parte of felicitie: yet notwithstandynge hit soone fadeth, with age or sykenesse. And he that auaunteth hym selfe in myght of body and lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, is in a false opinion. For howe small a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of strength is in man, in comparison of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis: I meane elephauntes, bulles, and lyons? Therfore truely the thynge that in vs is diuyne and immortall is lernynge. Generally two spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb facs="tcp:10981:11"/>
thynges be in the nature of manne / whiche be good, that is to saye, knowlege and reasone. Knowlege commaundeth, reasone dothe obeye. As for knowlege no violence of Fortune maye take awaye / no vexation maye withdrawe, nor sickenes may corrupt / nor age by any meane may endomage. Onely knowlege perisshed with age eftsones reuiueth. And where all other thynges by longe contynuance decaye, onely counnynge with the yeres encreseth and multiplieth. warre lyke a raginge floode, draweth and carieth away all thynges with hym, onely lernynge, for that he may not stere it, he leaueth vntouched. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Stilpo the philosopher, as me semeth, made answere necessarye to be remembred.

            <p>NOwe to returne to mi first matter. My counsayle is that chyldren do eschewe to moche arrogaunt and pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous speche: and in like wise to auoyde homely and rude communicacion. Inflate and proude speche lacketh gentyllnesse: base and vile wordes nothynge perswadethe or moueth. For like as the body ought not only to be hoole from sickenes, but also to be of good habilite or facion: so shulde the oracion or sentence not be onely not sicke, but also firme and substanciall. For that thynge whiche is sure, is onely commendable: &amp; that whiche is exployted with daunger we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The one shall cause hym to be shameles: the other to be of vile cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and dastarde. The meane waye to holde in euery thynge, it is a high and perfecte crafte. Al be it I eftsones do remembre lernynge, yet what I deme therin, I wyll at this tyme differre.

hit is a great token of ignoraunce. For to speake alway one thynge hit is nowe and thanne tedious and intollerable. For one note of syng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, and one acte in an Interlude withoute va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riacion, is to the syngers &amp; playours laborious, and to the herers fulsome &amp; tedyous. Therfore pleasaunt varietie is in euery thynge delectable: mooste specially in voyces, and thynges made to beholde. Therfore in yonge men of good stocke, nothynge shulde lacke, worthye to be harde or sene. And to say the trouthe, there shulde be in them that, whiche menne calle the Cercle of ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge. But yet that is onely as it were to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted (takynge of euery doctrine some parte) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usynge them through at the fyrste syghte. For it is almost impossible to be perfecte in all thynges.

For wher there be thre maner of lyues, one called Actife, the other contemplatife, the thyrde voluptuous or sensuall, the laste beinge vicious and seruaunt to pleasure, apperteyneth to beastis, and men of no reputation or goodnesse.

But er I procede any further, I wyl shewe the historie of Cyclops, which is here remembred, that the taunt or rebuke gyuen by Theocrite may the better be vnderstande. After that the citie of Troye was destroyed, the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes laded with inestimable riches prepared their returne into their countreys, amonge whom the wyse and eloquent Vlisses, by whose policie the Grekes had exployted their affaires, trauayled lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge on the sees: to whom did happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maruailous and strange aduentures.

was named Polyphemus, who excelled al the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in enormitie of stature.
