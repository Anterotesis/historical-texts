         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>PErhaps it may ſeem ſtrange that I
ſhould thus undertake an Hydrological
Eſſay, ſeeing that many Eminent
Writers have given their judgement of the
Cauſe and Vertues of Mineral Waters, ſuch
as <hi>Georgius Agricola, Libavius, Solinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Andr. Baccius, Fallopius;</hi> and of
our own Countrymen Dr. <hi>Jorden, Simpſon,
Turner</hi> and many others both Ancient and
Modern Authors. Yet there were ſeveral
Reaſons inducing me to publiſh this my
Scrutiny into the Nature and Operation of
this New-found Spring, by ſome called <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moore
Waters</hi> naming the Spring from the
Place, which is near <hi>Ilmington</hi> a Town in
<hi>Warwick-ſhire.</hi> This may alſo deſerve
the Name of <hi>Ilmington-Spaw</hi> from its
brackiſhneſs, according to <hi>Van Helmonts</hi>'s
<pb facs="tcp:65192:4"/>
Appellation <hi>Parad.</hi> 3 and 4 of <hi>Fontes aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duli,
Spadanae</hi> or <hi>Spaw-Waters.</hi> Which
name I ſhall retain in my following Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>My chief Inducements hereto, were</p>
            <p>First, The Common Good; ſeeing Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
dayly flocked to this Fountain, of
whom many were poor illiterate Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that inconſiderately (without prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their Bodies or Phyſitians adviſe) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
hitherto might as well have haſtened
to their ruine, as to recover their impared
Health. For,</p>
            <p>The moſt ingenious Dr. <hi>Cole</hi> who firſt
tryed and applauded theſe Waters by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
a Perſon of Quality to the
Drinking of them, did ſo alarum the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ſort of People and the rude <hi>Mobile,</hi>
as if Waters had been found with ſome Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Vertue like the Pool of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſda,</hi>
or the Waters of <hi>Jorden</hi> when they
cured Leprous <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Doctor being called away
by his Employment, I was deſired by ſeveral
Gentlemen to commit the Tryals I had made
on thoſe Waters to the Preſs; on no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
then to give Caution to the incautelous
Multitude, among which many are (as

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Ancient Authors did uſually
take a general Survey of Mineral Waters,
not deſcending to a ſtrict Scrutiny by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
into Particular Springs. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon
which account many things have been left
falſe and imperfect, which an Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Particulars may deſcry; and perhaps
afford more of knowledge to Poſterity though
in a few Experiments, than in great Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
of Conjectural Philoſophy. As Dr.
<hi>Tyſon</hi> in his <hi>Phocaena</hi> Page<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. rightly
ſaith, <q>
                  <hi>Malpighius</hi> in his <hi>Silk-worm</hi>

Book of <hi>Inſects;</hi> and He and the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Dr. <hi>Crew</hi> have taught us more of
Plants, than either <hi>Gerard</hi> or <hi>Parkinſon.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet I deſire not to contemn, but to ſpeak
with due honour and reverence of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Ancients to whom we owe great
part of our knowledge, but withal hoping
that I may have as much freedome to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
my Sentiments, as others have
done theirs before me.</p>

Aq. Cap. 8. <hi>ranketh them under Five
Heads.</hi> viz. Vapours, Juices, Metals,
Stones, <hi>and</hi> Earth.</p>
            <p>As for Vapours impregnating Waters in
their Current, I ſee no reaſon to make them
a diſtinct Ingredient from the others, <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopius</hi>
alloweth only Vapours to be found in
Waters that are Poiſonous, Bituminous,
and Sulphureous, yet of what kind ſoever,
they ſeem not to differ from the Evaporating
Object: as the Vapour of Water, is but
Water rariſied, whoſe Particles recollected
in a Receiver may appear again under the
form of Water. As <hi>Helmont Parad.</hi> 2.
hath obſerved, <hi>Vapor reipſa nil aliud eſt
<pb facs="tcp:65192:6"/>
Materialiter &amp; formaliter, quam Ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morum

To the ſame effect ſpeaketh <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bavius
de Jud. Aq. Lib. 1. Cap.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Jorden On Natur. Bath. and Min.
Wat. Cap.</hi> 4. not content with what <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopius</hi>
hath done, eſpecially becauſe New
Minerals have lately been diſcovered (as
<hi>Calaem</hi> in the Eaſt Indies, <hi>Rhuſma</hi> and
<hi>Terra Ghetta</hi> in Turky <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and perhaps
future Ages may diſcover many more) hath
comprehended them under Seven Heads;
taking a Mineral for <hi>An inanimate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Body bred in a Mine, in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of the Earth.</hi> His <hi>Genera</hi> are 1 <hi>Earth,
2 Stone, 3 Bitumen, 4 Salts or Concrete
Juices, 5 Spirits, 6 Mean or half Metals,
7 Metals.</hi> Of all which in as much as they
cauſe Alterations in Waters, I ſhall take
a ſhort Survey; Brevity here beeng in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Earth</hi> is a cold dry ſluggiſh Body
altogether effete in its vertue, except when
it containeth ſome active Principle; ſuch
as a Nitrous Salt by which Fullers-Earth
doth ſcour Cloth, and Marle laid on Land
<pb facs="tcp:65192:7"/>
doth cauſe Fertility; or an Aluminous Salt,
ſuch as is found near <hi>Scarbrough Spaw
&amp;c.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which account the Chymiſts
rightly call Simple Earth <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi>
or <hi>Terra damnata.</hi> Water hereby may
become turbid and muddy, but not impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
with any Vertue.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Stones</hi> by their Qualities of
Cold, Dryneſs, and Stipticity come near
that of Earth. Yea as Dr. <hi>Jorden Cap.</hi> 4.
hath hinted to us, Stones in their ſimple
Nature diſtinct from any other Ingredient,
are but as a <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> and untama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ire or Water. 'Tis true ſome Stones
will melt, others by Calcination turn as it
were to Aſhes; but that is from a Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous
Mixture of ſome Salt, Metal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And this may be concluded hence, The more
pure and free from Mixture Stones are, by
ſo much the more indiſſolvable by Water or
the devouring flames of Fire; as <hi>Diamonds,
Amiantus</hi> or <hi>Alumen plumoſum, Glym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
Saxum Arenarium </hi> all which
ſtony Concretions will endure the Fire: yea
<hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe had we but a pure ſtony Body it
would endure the waſhings of Water, and
<pb facs="tcp:65192:7"/>
the utmoſt degree of Fire. <hi>Pliny Natur.
Hiſt. Lib. 36. Cap.</hi> 19. ſaith <hi>Amiantus
lapis nihil igni deperdit.</hi> Not only the
<hi>Terra Damnata</hi> left after the Active
Principles are drawn off in Diſtillation
will endure the Fire; but the <hi>Asbeſtum</hi>
which is an Effloreſcence of the <hi>Amiantus,</hi>
and many ſuch like Stony Concretions (I
doubt not) were they free from Heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Mixtures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stones</hi> then in their ſimple Nature yield
no Vertue to Springs, except whilſt in their
Primitive juices or <hi>Solutis principiis;</hi> for
then they may cauſe an Alteration, as we
may perceive by many cold petrifying
Springs; of which almoſt infinite Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
might be produced here in our own
Country. But when there is a mixture
with a <hi>Minera,</hi> then <hi>Stones</hi> by Fire or
Water may ſoon ſuffer a Diſſolution: as
Marcaſites of <hi>Iron, Copper, Alum,</hi> &amp;c.
not only by fire may undergo a Change, but
alſo may communicate their Vertue to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
having a proper <hi>Menſtruum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Bitumina</hi> are either hard as
<pb facs="tcp:65192:8"/>
               <hi>Amber, Carbofoſſilis;</hi> or Liquid as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troleum</hi>
and <hi>Naphtha.</hi> We find by dayly
Experience that unctuous Matter or Oyls
will not undergo a perfect mixture with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
yet by ſome Mineral juice may have
its body ſo opened as to come floating with
the Spring Water though in a confuſed
Poſture. Yea ſaith <hi>Fallopius de Aq.
Therm. Cap.</hi> 8. It is ſometimes ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
that a Separation from the Water is
very difficult. Inſtances of Bituminous
Waters he giveth us; as the River <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paris</hi>
in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> which by its plenty will as
it were anoint the Bodies of them that ſwim
in it; the Fountains of Mount <hi>Gibbus</hi>
near <hi>Modena</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> many Fountains
likewiſe near <hi>Baia</hi> in <hi>Campania;</hi> ſo alſo
Springs at the foot of <hi>Veſuvius;</hi> many
alſo we read of in <hi>Saxony, Swedland,</hi> and
at <hi>Avergne</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> and of one famous
in our own Country at <hi>Pitchford</hi> in <hi>Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi>
and that Bitumen is the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Principle in our Springs at <hi>Bath,</hi> Dr.
<hi>Jorden</hi> hath proved <hi>De Nat. Bath &amp; Min.
Wat. Cap. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Concrete Juices</hi> called <hi>Salts</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:65192:8"/>
which are not only found in Waters but
being diſſolved make the Current Springs as
ſo many Menſtruums to unlock the Bodies of
other Minerals. The Species are uſually
reckoned Four <hi>viz. Alum, Vitriol, Nitre</hi>
and <hi>Common Salt</hi> (but as for the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
I ſhall not here diſpute) 'Tis true differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Salts will ſhoot by Chryſtallization into
ſeveral Forms, as <hi>Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Alum</hi> into
<hi>Glebas</hi> (although theſe of Alum differ
ſomething from them of Vitriol) Nitre
into <hi>Stirias</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> into <hi>Teſſeras;</hi> ſo
likewiſe will other <hi>Species</hi> of Salt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
under theſe, by reaſon of their Glebes
and difference of Particles. As for the
Vertues of ſuch Springs we muſt look to the
Nature of the Ingredients; and whether
the Waters are not impregnated with ſeveral
Mineras; from whence there muſt needs
follow great Variety in Mineral Waters.
That <hi>Salt, Nitre, Alum,</hi> and <hi>Vitriol</hi> are
Ingredients of Mineral Waters, we have
the Teſtimony of ſeveral Authors, too many
here to relate. As Salt-Springs at <hi>Saltz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
and <hi>Halſtat,</hi> and many other places
in <hi>Germany;</hi> the Salt-Springs in <hi>Tuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
and as our Springs at <hi>Droit-Wich</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:65192:9"/>
at <hi>Nant-Wich</hi> will teſtify. Nitrous Springs
we read of at <hi>Caleſtria</hi> in <hi>Macedonia;</hi>
in many places of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> in many places
in <hi>France</hi> mentioned by <hi>Du Clos Claſſe
Second and Third;</hi> and Nitrous Springs by
<hi>Baccius De Therm. Lib. 5. Cap.</hi> 6. Alum
Springs are frequent in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> and many
other Places of <hi>Italy;</hi> and alſo in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
and in <hi>Spain;</hi> with us at <hi>Oken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yate</hi>
in <hi>Shrop-ſhire,</hi> and that famous <hi>Spaw</hi>
at <hi>Scarbrough</hi> in York-ſhire. Vitrioline
Waters are alſo found (although the truth
thereof is queſtioned by Dr. <hi>Liſter De
Font. Med. Angl. Cap.</hi> 7.) Inſtances of
which Dr. <hi>Jorden de Nat. Ba. Cap.</hi> 7.
giveth us; as that at <hi>Cyprus</hi> deſcribed by
<hi>Galen</hi> where the Water is Green, at <hi>Smol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicium</hi>
in <hi>Hungary,</hi> in <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> &amp;c,
in which (ſaith he) the very Body of Vitriol
is found. Beſides the Teſtimony of <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont
Paradox.</hi> 4. of <hi>Pauhont</hi> and <hi>Save<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nir</hi>
two <hi>German Spaws,</hi> and the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Dr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> on our <hi>Scarbrough
Spaw;</hi> and as I ſhall prove of <hi>Ilmington
Spaw.</hi> As for the diſtinction of being
vertually or by its quality contained I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
allow of, not finding any ſolid Reaſon
<pb facs="tcp:65192:9"/>
how an Accident can be ſeperated from his
Subſtance, and remain Exiſtent in another:
for I look upon that Rule as true <hi>Accidens
non migrat a Subjecto in Subjectum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Spirits</hi> (ſo called from their Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latility
by fire) that enter the Compoſition
of Metals will not endure fuſion by fire
but eaſily fly off; ſuch as <hi>Quickſilver, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripigmentum,
Sandaraca, Chriſocolla,
Cadmia</hi>  which by ſome Authors are
reckoned for Concrete Juices, but by others
for <hi>Spirits</hi> from their Volatility: and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
endowed with theſe kind of Ingredients
are generally poiſonous. <hi>Agricola Lib. 1.
&amp;</hi> 2. telleth us of waters betwixt <hi>Seburgh</hi>
and <hi>Strapela</hi> that by their Malignancy will
kill Fiſhes, and other Animals that drink
thereof. Arſenical Waters we read of, as
at <hi>Circum</hi> in <hi>Thracia,</hi> at <hi>Perant</hi> near
<hi>Mompelier;</hi> of many ſuch waters <hi>Fallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius
de Therm. Aq.</hi> giveth us an account.
Now Dr. <hi>Jorden</hi> reckoneth ſome Waters
that contain Quickſilver for wholeſome wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters,
as that at <hi>Serra Morena</hi> and <hi>La
Nava</hi> in <hi>Spain, Almagra</hi> and <hi>Toletum.</hi>
But if we conſider how that <hi>Mercury</hi> is an
<pb facs="tcp:65192:10"/>
Enemy to the Nervous Parts, eſpecially
when unprepared; how it abounds with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenical
Particles before it is puriſied, we
may much doubt of the wholeſomeneſs of
them, yet I ſhall not diſpute againſt the
Poſſibility of the Thing. So alſo are theſe
from Sulphur very dangerous, becauſe they
often partake of a Poiſonous <hi>Minera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe that partake of</hi> Cadmia <hi>are to be
avoided, becauſe the Natural</hi> Cadmia <hi>is
Poiſonous and a ſtrong Cauſtick.</hi> Cadmia
foffili Aquae infectae acres eſſe conſueve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,
Agricol. de Natur. Eor. Efflu. ex

            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Mean</hi> or <hi>half Metals,</hi> ſo called
becauſe they are fuſible but not malleable like
Metals, as <hi>Antimony, Biſmuthum</hi> or
Tin-Glaſs found in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
Theſe may be Ingredients to Mineral
waters, and for the Vertues of ſuch we muſt
look to the impregnating Object.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>Metals</hi> as <hi>Lead, Tin, Iron
Gold, Copper,</hi> and <hi>Silver:</hi> for <hi>Mercury</hi>
from its Volatility by fire is reckoned by Dr.
<hi>Jorden</hi> among Mineral <hi>Spirits.</hi> Theſe
<pb facs="tcp:65192:10"/>
ſaith <hi>Fallopius de Therm. Aq. Cap.</hi> 8.
May be Ingredients in Mineral waters,
but telleth us, that he never knew any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Spring in which <hi>Metals</hi> had their
ſhare.</p>
            <p>But we have ſufficient Teſtimony of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Springs that are impregnated with
Metals. <hi>Baccius De Therm. Lib. 6.
Cap.</hi> 3. giveth us an account of ſeveral
waters that have preyed on <hi>Iron,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
whoſe Vertue is from the <hi>Magnet</hi> (which
indeed is a better ſort of Iron-ſtone) <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nander

Ingredients, as that impregnated with

<hi>Luca</hi> called St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Bath;</hi> with <hi>Lead,</hi>
as the <hi>Lead-Waters</hi> in <hi>Lotharingia;</hi> with
<hi>Iron,</hi> as at <hi>Siena, Verona,</hi> and <hi>Luca.</hi>
To which I might add our Chalybeat wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
at <hi>Tunbridge, Aſtrap,</hi> and <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough,</hi>
with our late found Spring at <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mington.</hi>
The ſame Author telleth us
that waters are found impregnated with
<hi>Gold, Silver, Lead,</hi> and <hi>Precious Stones</hi>
although very rarely, becauſe of their Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and the compact Subſtances of Pearls.</p>
            <p>

refer the Reader.</p>
            <p>But it may be queſtioned; how can <hi>Earth</hi>
be reckoned as a Mineral and one of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
ſeven <hi>Genera,</hi> taking a <hi>Mineral</hi> for
an <hi>Inanimate perfect Body bred in the
Bowels of the Earth? Anſw.</hi> Minerals
are here taken in a large ſenſe, under which
<hi>Earth</hi> is comprehended in as much as it is
the Receptacle and <hi>Matrix</hi> of Subterraneous
Conceretes, whoſe Particles may alſo be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to water in its Current; <hi>Stones</hi>
alſo in this reſpect may be taken for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concrete Juices</hi> or <hi>Salts</hi> are reckoned
as a Diſtinct <hi>Genus</hi> (although as I ſhall
hereafter prove, that all Compound Bodies
in the Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral
Kingdome are made out of a <hi>Succus</hi> as their
more immediate Matter) from their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
reſulting from their peculiar texture
of Parts. Thus <hi>Salts</hi> are reckoned from
their eaſy Diſſolution in water, and their
reconcretion. <hi>Bitumina</hi> from their burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and waſting by fire, although they enter
<pb facs="tcp:65192:11"/>
not the Compoſition of a Metal. <hi>Sulphur</hi>
will burn and waſt by fire, and is alſo often
a Metalline Ingredient; and is reckoned
with <hi>Mercury</hi> &amp;c. among <hi>Mineral Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
which are ſo called from their Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility
by fire although they enter the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of Metals. <hi>Antimony</hi> and <hi>Tin
Glaſs</hi> are accounted as half Metals, becauſe
they are fuſible, but not malleable like Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals;
which are both Fuſible and Malleable
Mineral Subſtances.</p>
            <p>I need not Apologize for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs
of Mineral Waters, ſeeing they have been
for ſeveral Hundreds of years in great Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
The <hi>Romans</hi> we are informed

<hi>Alpinus De Medic. Aegypt. Lib. 3. Cap.</hi>
17. giveth us an Account.</p>
            <p>I need not likewiſe relate the Superſtition
of the Ancients; who, when a Mineral
Spring was found, from the ſtrangeneſs of
its Effects ſoon dedicated it to ſome <hi>Saint</hi>
or <hi>Deity,</hi> becauſe they made little Scrutiny
<pb facs="tcp:65192:12"/>
into the Nature of Mineral Waters. And
ſince that Experimental Philoſophy hath
found favour in the world, knowledge here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hath dayly encreaſed; and for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
hereof, let us make enquiry into
each Particular, that at length we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Concluſions.</p>
            <p>In the Proſecution of my Deſign I ſhall
obſerve this method, and accordingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the following Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To enquire into the Nature of
Compound Bodies either in the Animal,
Vegetable or Mineral Kingdom; under
Minerals will fall in a Conſideration of
the Original and Difference of Glebes,
that chiefly give Eſſence to <hi>Mineral-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, To make Experimental Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays
into the Nature of <hi>Ilmington-Spring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, After taking a ſhort Survey
of moſt Diſeaſes incident to the Body of
man, as to their Cauſes or Original;
to enquire how far <hi>Ilmington-Spaw</hi> may
<pb facs="tcp:65192:12"/>
conduce to their Cure, and to preſerve
Health whilſt entire.</p>
            <p>But by the way take notice, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
I made the Experiments on <hi>Ilming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Spaw</hi>
in a dry Seaſon, and was very
careful and exact in the weight of the
water which I have given Pag. 48; it
may admit of a Variation not only in
weight, but be weakned in its Vertue in
a wet Seaſon when the Springs are rank
by a mixture of Rain-water; and alſo
by the breaking in of any freſh Spring.</p>

that proof by Authority,
where Reaſon and Experience are

<hi>Philoſophy</hi> is not to be founded on <hi>Phanſy,</hi> but
on Experience and plain Natural Diductions
therefrom: I ſhall in this following Treatiſe
lay down only ſuch Poſitions, that I find
built on Experience. For if bare Authority

to our Anceſtors, whoſe Works ſtill are
for our Inſtruction; but ſhall chiefly inſiſt in

            <p>In the proſecution of my deſign, I ſhall ſpeak
ſomewhat as to the Principles of Concretes,
which will lead me on to a conſideration of
Mineral Glebes, that principally give Eſſence
to <hi>Spaw-waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divers have been the opinions of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
about the Elements of Compound bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
not to mention the Opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi>
who obſerving <hi>Fire</hi> to be an active ſimple te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuious
body, made it the firſt Principle of all
things; nor the opinion of <hi>Heſiod,</hi> aſſigning
<hi>Earth</hi> for the Original of Compounds, there
are other more famous, which Sects of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
do ſtill maintain. Such as that 1ſt, of
the <hi>Aristotelians;</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, of the <hi>Chymiſts;</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, of

            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> place the foundation of

urgeth that Argument. <hi>Bodies conſiſt of ſuch
Principles into which they are ultimately reduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
But by all the Analyſis that either Art or
Nature could make, did never find <hi>Fire</hi> an
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65192:14"/>
ingredient. To talk of an Element of Fire
<hi>ſub Concavo Lunae,</hi> is but a ſuppoſition without
a Demonſtration. The <hi>Air</hi> we know is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and that in ſeveral reſpects, to the

abſtruſe Receſſes of Nature; that it is all one
as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Willis de Ferm. c. 1. p.</hi> 3. hath rightly
obſerved, to ſay a Houſe is made of wood and
ſtones, as to ſay a Body is made of the Four
Elements. For it is hard to imagine ſuch
Things to be Principles, which neither anſwer
the Phaenomena of Nature, nor the Reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. The <hi>Chymical</hi> Principles are, <hi>Salt,
Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> becauſe in an Analyſis of
Bodies by Fire, theſe Three appear; whether
the Concrete belong to the Animal, Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or Mineral kingdom. By Reduction of a
Metal or Mineral (as the Chymiſts thought)
into its firſt Elements, they extract a Sulphur
or Oyl, a Fluid which in Minerals is a plain
Mercury or Quickſilver, and a Salt. Out of
Vegetables and Animals, they extract an Oyl
or Sulphureous Spirit, which is but an Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Oyl gotten by Fermentation, a Salt, and
Mercury; which laſt is but the Phlegm or
Water, whoſe Particles are driven off by the

and perfection, as in the growth and fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Vegetables and their fruit; that by
the Depreſſion of this Active Principle,
Things are crude and immature, and by the
decay thereof decline and die. That Heat,
Conſiſtence, variety of Colours, and Taſts;
yea the amiable texture of Parts do chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on a Sulphur. That the Weight, Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
and Duration of Bodys without Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
do depend on a Salt, which detaineth
and fixeth the Volatile Parts and Sulphur.
That Water is a convenient Vehicle for the
moſt active Principles, and to aſſociate them
to the Salt. Upon ſuch like conſiderations
hath multiplied the Chymical Principles into
Five, <hi>Spiritus, Sal, Sulphur, Aqua &amp; Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt which multiplication I ſhall propoſe
theſe Experimental Obſervations, proving
<hi>Spiritus</hi> to be no diſtinct Principle from the
three former, <hi>viz. Salt, Sulphur and Mercury:</hi>

All ſorts of Chymical Spirits are reduceable
to two kinds, <hi>Sulphureous</hi> and <hi>Saline;</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Spirits there are two ſorts, <hi>Volatile Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalizate</hi>
and <hi>Acid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sulphureous Spirits, ſuch as Spirits of Wine,
Roſemary, Juniper; and all Sulphureous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
got by fermentation out of Vegetables,
are nothing but an eſſential Oyl or Sulphur
exalted with a little Phlegm and Salt. This
is evident from its Inflammability, which is
allowed on all ſides to depend chiefly on the
Sulphur.</p>
            <p>Take Spirit of Wine or Brandy a Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
it will take flame by a burning Paper or
Candle, which will continue until all is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
except an inſipid Water or Phlegm:
and the beſt way of trying the goodneſs of
Vinous Spirits, is by inflammability; which
prove better or worſe, according as they
burn away more or leſs. Some Chymiſts aſſert,
they have had ſuch highly rectified Spirits of
Wine, that by burning would totally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
away, that the flame would like the
containing Veſſel dry, leaving neither Faeces
nor Phlegm. What difference is there betwixt
Sulphur, and Sulphureous Spirits; excepting
Fermentation and Diſtillation, by which the
ſubtile parts are ſeparated from the more fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent,
but not in an ordinary Sulphureous
Body, ſeeing both take flame and burn alike?
Tis true, by Diſtillation the more refine parts
are ſeparated, and the Sulphureous carry
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65192:16"/>
with them ſome Phlegm, and a little Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Salt: but that deſtroyeth not the Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
parts as ſuch, which being the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
Principle, give denomination to the
Liquor, and differ not as to the Principle of
Sulphur.</p>
            <p>Volatile Saline Spirits, as Spirit of Harts-horn,
Spirits of Sal Armoniac; and all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
drawn from Animals, as Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> conſiſt of a volatile Salt diſſolved
in a little Phlegm, with a very ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Sulphur. And that it dependeth on a
Volatile Salt diſſolved in Phlegm, is thus Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.
Fill a ſmall Vial with good Spirit of
Harts-horn, Sal-Armoniac, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let it ſtand
without moving for about half a year, you'l
find a Phlegm inſtead of a Spirit, but the Salt
all ſhot or Chryſtallized to the ſides of the
bottle; which Salt being diſſolved in freſh
Phlegm, will become again Spirit of Harts-horn.
Beſides you may make Spirit of Harts-horn
thus, yea as good as the ſhops will afford.
Take of the Volatile Salt ſhot in the Neck,
or to the ſides of the Receiver in the Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Harts-horn; mix it with ſo much
Phlegm drawn off, as ſufficeth for its diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
you'l have an excellent Spirit, which
according to the Quantity of Salt diſſolved
will be ſtronger or weaker. So that the
Phlegm riſing with volatile Salt in Diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or afterwards mixed with it; liquiſieth
and turneth it into a Spirit. The ſame may
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65192:16"/>
be ſaid of the Spirits of all Animals, and is
manifeſtly apparent by the Diſtillation of
Vipers, whoſe Salt ſticketh for the greateſt
part to the ſides of the <hi>Receiver,</hi> or head of
the <hi>Limbeck,</hi> but mixed with the Phlegm doth
become a Spirit of Excellent Uſe.</p>
            <p>This Salt in Diſtillation carrieth with it a
little yellowiſh Oyl, but by inſtillation of
<hi>Sp. Vini Tartarizatus</hi> is preſerved, except the
Spirit of Wine containeth a conſiderable
quantity of Phlegm, which will ſoon diſſolve
the Volatile Salt of Vipers.</p>
            <p>Acid Spirits, as of <hi>Vitriol, Vinegar, Sulphur
&amp;c.</hi> is but an Eſſential acid Salt liquified by
Phlegm, or by Violence of Fire. Spirit of
Vitriol is Salt Liquified by force of Fire,
which hath freed the Saline from the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrious
parts; this we may conclude from
the Cauſtick quality both of the Spirit and
Oyl; which only differ, in as much as the
Oyl is the more Acid part of Vitriol with a
little Phlegm and Sulphur and improperly
called Oyl, but the Spirit with more Phlegm
and leſs of the Acid Part. And that <hi>Spirit</hi> of
<hi>Vitriol</hi> chiefly conſiſts of a Salt <hi>in fluore,</hi> is
more fully manifeſt by inſtillation of an <hi>Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi>
for Example; pour <hi>Olcum Tartari per
Deliquium,</hi> upon Spirit of Vitriol, as in the
making of <hi>Tartarum Vitriolatum,</hi> the Acid
of Vitriol and Alkali of Tartar combine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into a Neutral Salt, but the Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
part is evaporated as an inſipid Water.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65192:17"/>
So may any Acid Salts <hi>in fluore,</hi> being mixed
with Alkalis be revived again into dry Salts,
by Evaporation, Precipitation, Chryſtalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that Saline Spirits either Acid
or Alkalizate, in as much as they contain a
Salt highly exalted or volatiliſed, are called
<hi>Spirits, Sal quatenus volatile Spiritus dici po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt.

transformed thereto, a Man feedeth on the
fleſh of the Ox, whoſe material Principle is
but Water transformed into a Plant, thence
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65192:21"/>
into Fleſh by divers fermentative alterations
of the Ox, and now farther according to the
ferments of Man.</p>
            <p>But to ſhew more particularly, how that
<hi>Water</hi> or at leaſt a <hi>ſuccus</hi> is neceſſarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the nutrition of every Animal; Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
taken into the ſtomach, before it is fit
for nutrition is turned into Chyle, (which is
a Succus) from whence blood, then Chyme,
to be aſſimilated into each part. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
Bread or Fleſh eaten by a man, is by
concoction turned into a fluid Chyle, by the
ferment in ſanguification, the Saline and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous
parts work upon each other, and
turn the Chyle into Blood; out of which a
<hi>ſuccus</hi> is ſeparated, and by the innate ferment
of each part aſſimilated thereto. What is
Fleſh but a <hi>Leffas</hi> or watery <hi>ſuccus</hi> firſt turned
into Graſs, Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and at length by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
alterations by ferments ſhaped into
Fleſh. And the more probable it is, ſeeing
that the Fleſh, Blood, Urine or Milk of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
by bare diſtillation is turned for the
greateſt part into Phlegm. The fleſh of Eeles
(as Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> hath obſerved) by diſtillation
doth yield a great quantity of water, and
whilſt diſtilling they ſeem to boyl like a pot
of water, ſeeming to be nothing elſe but a
congealed water.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſemen</hi> of Vegetables before roots and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65192:21"/>
branches are formed do require a moiſt body,
which according to the Plaſtick power of the
<hi>Archeus,</hi> doth <hi>Proteus</hi> like turn its ſhape, and
that which was in the form of Water is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a Vegetable, which by the Ferments
of our body may become blood or fleſh, which
at length by Putrefaction may be reſolved and
turned in Worms <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But even to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Worms and Inſects a putrid juice is
required.</p>
            <p>If we look to the firſt formation of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
we ſhall find the <hi>Sperme</hi> to be but a
Liquor diſguiſed by the Ferment of Seminal
Veſſels, which by circulation through the
parts of the body whilſt blood, is impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with an Effloreſcence of the whole. And
when it is thus prepared, before the <hi>Aura
vitalis</hi> can exert its operation, it muſt have
a convenient Matrix as a place, but an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of moiſture for encreaſe of the Animal
formed.</p>
            <p>As Vegetables and Animals have their Seeds,
ſo likewiſe Minerals in the Bowels of the
Earth; and not only to the encreaſe, but
alſo to the firſt formation of a Particular in
either of theſe <hi>Species,</hi> we ſtill find a <hi>Succus</hi>
required. 'Tis true the Mineral Seeds are
inconſpicuous and fall not under our ſenſe of
<hi>Seeing.</hi> So by an exact enquiry we ſhall find
theſe of Animals and Vegetables. For the
prolifick part, or <hi>Genitura</hi> is properly the
<hi>Seed;</hi> but the Sperme in an Animal, and the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65192:22"/>
Grains or Corns among Vegetables, are but
convenient Receptacles to lodge the more
active part, (which is indiſcernable by the
beſt inſtruments in Opticks) until ſet at work
by ſome External cauſe, in its proper place.
But however we ſee by dayly experience, that
by the plaſtick power of the Seeds, a juice is
formed into roots and branches: ſo from
Metaline and Mineral Seeds placed in the
body of the earth, rather in divers parcels
thereof <hi>ab origine;</hi> whence the variety of
Mineral Glebes, which turn a <hi>Succus</hi> into
their own nature. Theſe Mineral Principles
being ſet at work by the Celeſtial influence
upon appropriate matter, form to themſelves
a Mercurial Juice and Sulphur, as the more
immediate matter to the production of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
or Minerals, which by the ſpecifick Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Seeds at length are compleated.</p>
            <p>That Mineral Glebes will appropriate a
juice, and therefrom perfect a Metal is hence
evident. As Earth out of which Nitre is
extracted, and afterwards expoſed to the open
Air will centre upon it the floating Saline
Particles; the like effect we ſhall find upon
the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> of Vitriol, ſo as to be
again impregnate with a freſh Vitriol or Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre;
in like manner Mineral Glebes after the
Metal is extracted, will again convert a <hi>Succus</hi>
into a Metal: as the Miners of Tin, Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
can teſtify, who find a freſh Ore where All
was for ſixty or ſeventy years before extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

could the fire burn round theſe Hills, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
return violently to the ſame place it had
burned in about a hundred years before. It
muſt certainly find new matter, ſeeing that
in former Eruptions of fire Aſhes have been
caſt forth, yea the very ſtones and earth have
been as it were calcined to Powder. So that
we cannot imagine Sulphureous matter to be
there left, but by the Seminal Principles and
a convenient <hi>Succus</hi> to be newly begotten.
But I need not proceed to produce the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of more Authors, as I might out of

whether with <hi>Eraſtus</hi> in defence of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>

to be a <hi>Vapor,</hi> or with <hi>Agricola</hi> we believe

For if the Matter do arrive to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Glebes under the form of <hi>Halitus</hi> or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65192:23"/>
               <hi>Vapor;</hi> What is <hi>Vapor</hi> but a <hi>Succus</hi> or moiſt
body, whoſe Particles are ſeperated and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
apart, but may be collected again into
a greater Bulk by a Receiver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Helmont</hi>
hath ſufficiently proved? In Diſtillation of
Water the vapour that ariſeth is but Water
rarified, whoſe Particles collected in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
make up again a body of Water.</p>
            <p>That Minerals may be made out of Water,
we have that Experiment cited by Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>
out of <hi>Monſieur de Rochas.</hi> 
               <q>I took (ſaith he) wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which I well knew not to be compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nor mixed with any other thing then the
Spirit of Life. By a well proportioned ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
heat I ſo ordered it, that with it
and coagulations, congelation and fixation
I turned it into earth, which earth produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Animals Vegetables and Minerals.</q> Here
Water was turned into Earth which at length
was converted into either of the Three States.</p>
            <p>Out of Mercury ſaith the afore-cited Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
a fourth or fifth part of Water may be
obtained without any addition, which for
ought he could find, could not be reduced to
Mercury; ſo that it appeared to be plain
Water.</p>
            <p>As for that Objection; why Metals ſhould
weigh heavier than water, or that a Spoonful
of Quickſilver is in proportion nigh fourteen
to one, if Metals ſhould be made out of, or
elſe Water diſguiſed? This I ſay doth depend
on the Seminal Principles collecting more mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65192:24"/>
in leſs ſpace in ſome bodies then in others.
Bodies which have few Pores or Interſtices
of parts, but Particles of matter cloſely uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
ſo they are more heavy or light, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the ſame Elementary matter compoſe
all, but not compact in all bodies alike. And
the inſpection through a Microſcope on the
Pores of bodies will clear up this anſwer to
the Objection.</p>
            <p>The firſt Change of Water in order to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
is into a Mineral Mercury, the next change
by coagulation with Sulphur is into ſome
metal, according to the Specification of the
Seed, the repurgation from Sordes or fecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
matter, and the tincture of the Sulphur
either Solar, Lunar, Saturnine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of Metals ariſe.</p>
            <p>Although the foregoing Experiments prove
the more immediate matter of Generation
and Nutrition to be Water, yet they do in
effect prove one material Principle which is
the ultimate Reſult of Water and all other
Bodies; as by the Experiment of <hi>Monſieur de
Rochas,</hi> and by Converſion of water into the
roots and branches of Vegetables may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.
For as <hi>Helmont</hi> by his <hi>alkaheſt</hi> could
convert Stones, Earth, Glaſs, yea any body
into water; ſo water may again be tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into fixed matter. As it is proved by the
encreaſe of Mints or other Vegetables in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
by <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Experiment before cited
of a Willow Tree; by Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65192:24"/>
of a Squaſh, in which water is transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
into a body according to the nature of
the thing nouriſhed. Yea in the Animal,
Vegetable and Mineral Kingdome, as the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is converted into a <hi>Succus,</hi> or at leaſt
is a ſucculent matter before Nutrition; ſo
the <hi>Succus</hi> is again converted into fleſh, bones,
roots, branches, leaves, or metalline Concrete,
according to the individual and its parts of
this or the other Species. So that it may be
as well urged; That fixed matter is the firſt
Element of all things, as well as Water. For
as all Concretes may be converted into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſo Water may be converted into fixed
matter. As for Inſtance, Vegetables that
from a watery nouriſhment are become a
groſs and hard aliment taken into the ſtomach
of an Animal is by the ferment thereof turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a liquid Chyle, which by the ferment
of the Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is turned into a balſamick
blood, and from thence again into bones, fleſh,
or other groſs and fixed Subſtances.</p>
            <p>From the tranſmutations and reductions of
Matter into its priſtine form, may be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the truth of the Fourth Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> of
<hi>Epicurus,</hi> and <hi>Democritus.</hi> That <hi>Matter</hi> is the
firſt and only Principle, out of which all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
bodies are made. And according to the
divers figurations, motions, and fixation of
the Atoms or minute parts of matter, ſo are
bodies of this or that Species. I cannot cloſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65192:25"/>
with the opinion of ſome, that to matter
would add <hi>Chance</hi> for a Principle; as if the
glorious bodies of the Sun, Moon, Stars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
were made by Chance, or by an accidental
collection of Atoms, as if a Dog or other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
were but as a Clock, or other mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Engine: but that Matter was ſhaped
at firſt by the Divine <hi>Fiat,</hi> and is now meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphized
according to the Plaſtick power of
the <hi>Archeus,</hi> or Seminal Principles planted <hi>ab
origine</hi> by God Almighty; which by the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial
influences are ſet at work, and out of
convenient matter form to themſelves a Body.
We muſt not rely on Secondary Cauſes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
all the ſecrets of Nature, as Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> in

conſider, what is the Firſt Movent that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
Secondary Cauſes in action; we muſt
with <hi>Carteſius,</hi> §. 36. acknowledg God to be
the Univerſal and Primary Cauſe of motion.
Ingenious is his Phanſy, That God made all
the parts of matter equal in the beginning
both in magnitude and motion, which whilſt
moving by Attrition did break off their angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
parts, that became a ſubtile matter fit to
make the Sun and fixed Stars; but theſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Spherical <hi>globuli,</hi> were for the ſtructure
of the Heavens; but the parts of matter which
by their figures were unfit for motion, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
groſs and fit to make the Earth, Planets,
and Comets.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing I have diſowned imaginary Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
I ſhall enquire how far Experience
giveth light to this opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Indeterminate is the only Elementary
Principle <hi>ex Quo</hi> is made every compound
Body.</p>
            <p>If we take a ſurvey of the whole frame of
ſublunary Concretes, we ſhall find <hi>Matter</hi> of
it ſelf to be unconſined to any One Species:
but the ſame <hi>Matter</hi> according to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of Forms runneth through any Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and according to the diſpoſition of its
parts doth put on the forms of different Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
which gave occaſion to Philoſophers
ſo much to diſpute the number of Ingredients
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65192:26"/>
in a mixt Body, which really are but Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
things made out of <hi>Matter,</hi> that firſt
Principle of Concretes.</p>
            <p>From that Experiment of <hi>Mr. Boyle Scep.
Chym. p.</hi> 112. before mentioned, of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation
of a Vegetable nouriſhed only by
Water, out of which he procured (according
to ſome) the Five Chymical Principles, <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus,
Sal, Sulphur, Aqua, &amp; Terra;</hi> we may
conclude thus much, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Matter</hi> which
made up the body of Water was converted
into Salt, Sulphur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having proved before that a <hi>Succus</hi> or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is the immediate matter for nutrition of
Vegetables; Let us take for Example a <hi>Vine,</hi>
which requireth a great deal of moiſture, as
may be concluded from its haſty growth, and
bleeding of broken ſlips. The increaſe of its
bulk is by liquid Sap, which through different
ſtrainers and coagulation is turned into leaves,
branches, Grapes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The juyce of the
Grapes by fermentation will caſt a Tartar to
the ſides of the Veſſels, which by diſtillation
will yield a Salt and <hi>Terra damnata,</hi> the Wine
will yield a Phlegm and a Sulphureous Spirit;
and yet all from the Sap as the more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
matter. So that here was but one thing
in common, <hi>viz. Matter</hi> indeterminate to
this or that Species.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65192:26"/>
As the <hi>Leffas terrae</hi> is converted into Graſs,
ſo Graſs into Chyle, Blood, and after various
Alterations into the Fleſh of a Brute, whoſe
fleſh may be converted again into Chyle, Blood
and parts of a Man that did eate of that
Brute; and by the corruption of the humane
Carcaſe is turned again into Earth, which
may by Nature be again converted into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as well as by <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Alkaheſt, and ſo
paſs over a new Stage. The parts of this
Brute diſtilled would yield the Chymical
Principles, yea the <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> ſo far as they
are conſiſtent with truth; as may be eaſily
ſeen by the Diſtillation of the Horns, Hoofs,
Fleſh, and Blood of Animals. In all which
changes we ſhall find One ultimate reſult, <hi>viz.
Matter</hi> indeterminate to any One particular
Species.</p>
            <p>I ſhall eaſily grant, That a Body may be
made out of Spirit, Salt, Sulphur Phlegm,
and Earth; or of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
according to others; yet theſe are but <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementa
ſecundaria,</hi> ſeeing they admit of a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Reſolution, as well as a Tree or any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
body admiteth a Reſolution into theſe.
That cannot be accounted for a Firſt Element,
which deriveth its Original <hi>a Priori:</hi> as from
the configuration, diſpoſition, motion, or qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence
of the particles of Matter, not only
mixed bodies, but others more ſimple aſſigned
for Principles by Sects of Philoſophers may
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65192:27"/>
be derived. To inſtance in Particulars, How
that the parts of Matter free from coheſion
and as it were <hi>in fluore</hi> with perpetual motion
make Water; that the opace groſs fixed parts
of Matter make Earth, the agile Spherical
Particles in a raped motion make Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
would be beyond my intention. Only thus
much we find by experience; That in genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and corruption there is One ultimate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
from all compound bodies, which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
rightly called <hi>materia prima,</hi> out of
which all Natural bodies are firſt made, and at
laſt reſolved into. As for example; take a
Plant, ſuch as <hi>Mint, Pennyroyal, Bugle, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mularia,
&amp;c.</hi> by a Chymical Analyſis it may
be reſolved into <hi>Spirit, Salt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sulphur Phlegm,</hi>
or <hi>Water,</hi> and <hi>Earth;</hi> or according to ſome
Chymiſts that look a little higher, or to more
remote Principles, into <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and
<hi>Mercury</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> are but
Products of the other three Yet all theſe as
Dr. <hi>Sharrock</hi> by the encreaſe of Vegetables in
pure Water, and the foregoing Experiments
have proved, are but Water transformed.
And although Water is neceſſary to Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that all Aliment before aſſimulation
to its Subſtance muſt be converted into a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid,
yet Water cannot claim the Property
of a Firſt, but Secondary Element, ſeeing that
Water it ſelf is convertible into the Subſtance
of Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals, as theſe
are by <hi>Van Helmont</hi>'s Experiment into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65192:27"/>
So that the Ultimate reſult in all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal

conſtitutive Principle, from which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>I might cite alſo many more Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
and Poets, which I ſhall paſs by;
only taking notice of their Opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Seminal principles of Bodies lodged in
that undigeſted lump of Matter. All which I
ſuppoſe received their opinions from the
writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> from whom we are taught,
that God created all things, but ſome he
made actually exiſtent, other things he left to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65192:29"/>
be produced by the Seminal Principles, which
He planted in the Chaos, or confuſed Matter.
As we may ſee by <hi>Gen. 2. v. 5, God made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
plant of the field before it was in the eartb,
and every herb of the field before it grew,</hi> viz.
the <hi>ſemina</hi> of vegetables, which by the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>Fiat,</hi> ſo ſoon as the Matter was digeſted
into form, were ſet on work, and brought
forth according to the formative vertue of
the latent ſeeds. The Waters brought forth
Creatures abundantly after their kind, the
winged Fowl after his kind, the Earth brought
forth the living Creature after his kind, Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
and creeping things and Beaſt after his
kind; and of the duſt of the ground made
<hi>He</hi> Man. Upon all which we find a Divine
Impreſſion ſtamped or Generative faculty, by
which they might be <hi>fruitful and multiply,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earth before <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion
brought forth of its own accord graſs and
herbs for the Uſe of man, which we may well
believe to be from latent Seeds, which now
are more manifeſtly requiſite to continue the
<hi>species.</hi> After <hi>Adam</hi> had drew a curſe on the
ground, we ſtill find that the Earth ſhould
bring forth, but it ſhould be ſuch as were more
uſeleſs an unfit for meat, as thorns and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles:
but the more uſeful plants it ſhould
not, unleſs by humane labour and induſtry.

As God implanted various ſeeds of Herbs
in the earth, which as at firſt ſprung there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
ſo yet from ſeeds continue their <hi>ſpecies,</hi>
being ſet at work by the Divine <hi>Fiat</hi> ſo ſoon
as the celeſtial influences and appropriate ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
Cauſes are rightly applied with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Matter; ſo in like manner hath God
the Creator placed variety of Mineral ſeeds in
divers parcels of Earth, from which cometh
a Diverſity of Mineral glebes, as here Clay.
Marle, there Marcaſites of Iron, Alum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
as Dr. <hi>Jorden Nature. Bath. and Min. Wat. c.</hi> 7.
argueth, That <hi>Minerals have their Seeds to
perpetuate their ſpecies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that there are Metallick ſeeds in the
bowels of the Earth, may be concluded from
the Generation and Maturating of a crude
Mercurial and ſulphureous juice, until a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Metal is formed: As hath been proved <hi>p.</hi>
18. how the <hi>caput mortuum</hi> of Vitriol, expoſed
to open Air, will be again impregnated; and
freſh Ore of Tin or Lead, where 60 or 70
years before a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> was extracted, and old mines
repleniſhed with freſh Iron ſtones. All which
productions depend on the Seminal Principles
lodged in ſeveral parcels of Earth, which from
a ſucculent Matter from a Body according to
the Specification of the <hi>Archeus.</hi> The <hi>ſuccus</hi>
of the Earth by the operation of the Seminal
Agent, is at firſt converted into a crude Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
and embrionate Sulphur, which at length
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65192:30"/>
by maturation doth become a perfect Metal.
So from the Eſurine or common Salt of the
earth, according to the diverſity of Glebes, do
ariſe different Mineral Salts, ſuch as that of
Vitriol, Alum, Nitre, and <hi>Sal Gemma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Salts being diſſolved in ſpring-water
ſliding through the veins of the earth, and
meeting with a Vitriolick or Aluminous
glebe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth become a natural Menſtruum
to open the body of a <hi>Minera.</hi> Theſe Salts,
as ſo many Keys to unlock the Mineral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
make the current Springs impregnated
with the vertues of them; and hence is the
Original of Medicinal Waters.</p>
               <p>Againſt the opinion of an Univerſal or one
Common Salt of the Earth, out of which all
Mineral Salts, according to the different
Glebes, are made into different <hi>ſpecies,</hi> Dr.
<hi>Liſter, de font. med. c.</hi> 6. objecteth ſeveral
reaſons, and endeavoureth a confutation of
<hi>Helmont</hi>'s Aſſertion of an <hi>Eſurine or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal
Salt.</hi> His Reaſons are reduced to four Heads.</p>
               <p>1. The Eſurine Salt, as it doth participate
of no Quality, to aſſert the exiſtence thereof
is but a <hi>gratis dictum.</hi> 2. A <hi>Pyrites</hi> or <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſite</hi>
cannot perfect its vitriol under water.
3. It is ſcarce credible that a vein of Iron
can be corroded of that Eſurine Salt. 4. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol
is not made ſuddenly, or in a moment,
but by a gentle aſſiduous germination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:65192:30"/>
Againſt which reaſons I ſhall offer theſe
Experimental Obſervations, proving that
there is an Univerſal Salt or Common Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to them all.</p>
               <p>1. There is one thing in common among
them, becauſe of the Convertibility of one
Salt into another; as a Vitrioline by Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may be turned into an Aluminous Salt,
witneſs the making of <hi>Turbith Minerale</hi> thus.
Add four ounces of oyl of Vitriol to one ounce
of Mercury; by ſetting the mixture on a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive
furnace the Phlegm will be evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
but there will remain in the Bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
a Citrine powder from the Alkalizate
Mercury fixed by the acid parts of the oyl of
Vitriol. From this powder edulcorated by
waſhings of water, and diſtilled with Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
or Pot-aſhes, may be revived a current
Quickſilver, yea to its full weight as at firſt.
The water that by waſhings edulcorated this
powder boyled up, yieldeth an aluminous
Salt. Here Vitriolick ſalt is turned into
Alum, for the Mercury may be reſtored to
its full weight, ſo that the Vitrioline is the
only ſalt transformed This is mentioned by
Dr. <hi>Simpſon, Hydrol. Chym. p.</hi> 60. where an
Experiment of his own he giveth thus. <q>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill
oyl of Vitriol and common Salt with a
gentle heat in a glaſs body or Retort, you
will find a very volatile ſpirit of Salt will
come over the helm, which will fume ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,
the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> or remaining
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65192:31"/>
Salt being diſſolved gives a Salt exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
Alum.</q> To which I may annex that
Obſervation of Dr. <hi>Jorden, Natur, Bath. c.</hi> 7.
That in Diſtillation of oyl of Vitriol, the
Lute wherewith the glaſſes are joyned will
yield a perfect Alum. The affinity (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tranſmutability) of Vitriol and Alum
are ſo great, that he telleth us, it may be
doubted whether they are diſtinct ſpecies of
Salts.</p>
               <p>2. Set ſeveral plants in the ſame ſoyl, as
Scurvigraſs, Wormwood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation
ſhall yield different ſalts, as the
greateſt part of that of Wormwood will be a
fixed, but of Scurvigraſs a volatile ſalt. Which
variety of ſalts muſt proceed from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
fermentations and alterations of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive
ſucculent Matter. If it be <hi>objected,</hi>
that each plant attracteth a peculiar <hi>ſuccus,</hi>
whoſe particles are anſwerable to the pores of
the Vegetable, and ſo ſome Plants take in
more of the volatile, and others more of the
fixed ſalt. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſame Plants, as Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
Beans, yea I had almoſt ſaid All vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,
by diſtillation yield both volatile and
fixed ſalt, although they differ as to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
thereof. For the diviſion of Salts into
Fixed and Volatile, is only from the degrees
of volatization. The fixed or <hi>Alkali</hi> ſalt is
not eaſily ſublimed, but will endure calcination
in as much as it is deprived of ſpirits, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
with earth; but the <hi>volatile</hi> is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65192:31"/>
endowed with ſpirits, and may be eaſily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed:
either of which containing all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the Plant, may be called an Eſſential
Salt. Yet the proximate Matter before for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
might be the Common univerſal Salt,
determined by different Strainers and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Vegetables.</p>
               <p>3. The production of <hi>Sal foſſilis</hi> is from
the Acid of the Earth, inſinuating it ſelf into
the pores of ſtones that are an <hi>Alkali;</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once penetrated is united with the ſtony
parts into a ſaline Concrete, which from its
tranſparency is called <hi>Sal Gemma.</hi> Thus an
Acid of the Earth ſliding through mountains
of ſtone, have converted them almoſt all into
a foſſile Salt, as Authors of credit do teſtifie of
mountains in <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. That Salts have ſomething in common
among them, may be hence concluded. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> of <hi>Nitre,</hi> of
<hi>Alum,</hi> and of <hi>Sal Gemma,</hi> to the open air:
Each will center upon it the floating ſaline
particles of the Air, or elſe imbibe a ſaline <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
ſo as to become again impregnate with a
peculiar Salt. So that the ſaline particles are
indifferent to which kind they are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
by the latent Seminals.</p>
               <p>And that all Minerals, ſtony and ſaline con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions,
do come from a <hi>ſuccus,</hi> which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
congealed into a hard ſubſtance, may
be concluded from Animals that are found
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65192:32"/>
encloſed in ſtones, ſuch as a Toad in the
midſt of a Stone, a petrified Fiſh, a Spider in
Amber, ſo alſo Fljes, Worms, Ants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For
Stones and Minerals, whilſt in <hi>ſolutis principiis</hi>
or <hi>in ſucco,</hi> may environ an Animal as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying
juice doth a piece of wood, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
congealed will be as a coat of defence to
preſerve them from putrefaction, as <hi>Gilber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
ſpeaking of Amber hath well deſcribed it.

well conclude one Common Salt, indifferent

               <p>The ſecond argument againſt one chief Salt,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65192:32"/>
out of which others are formed, is taken from
the <hi>Pyrites,</hi> which (ſaith Dr. <hi>Liſter</hi>) cannot
perfect its Vitriol under water. But the
making of <hi>vitriolum Martis</hi> or <hi>Veneris</hi> doth
evince the contrary. For Vitriol being but a
Mineral Salt, that hath preyed on, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
with a Metal, as with Iron or Copper,
the Menſtruum may be aqueous, if there be a
convenient quantity of Salt therein, to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
with the diſſolved part of metal. In
making <hi>vitriolum Martis,</hi> water added to oyl
of Vitriol doth only weaken the Menſtruum,
that the more ſoluble parts of Iron may be
diſſolved and incorporated with the ſaline
parts of the liquor: for were the Menſtruum
too corroſive, it would inſinuate into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of <hi>Mars,</hi> and make an impure Salt or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol
of Iron.</p>
               <p>His arguments againſt the poſſibility of the
Eſurine ſalt diſſolving a vein of Iron, ſuppoſe
no diſtinction betwixt the crudity and matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the <hi>minera.</hi> Although <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> or
ſpirit of <hi>Nitre</hi> will not diſſolve Ocre nor the
<hi>Haematites,</hi> yet either will ſtrongly ferment
with filings of Iron, or the more maturate
parts of <hi>Mars.</hi> Although the <hi>Haematites</hi> be a
ſort of Iron-ſtone, and Ocre be the <hi>Terra me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallica,</hi>
yet thence it will not follow, that the
Menſtruum for Iron are the Menſtruums for
the <hi>Haematites,</hi> which many times is ſoft and
like clay, and the Ocre a meer metalline earth.</p>
               <p>For Bodies muſt have their proper Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65192:33"/>
which may undo the faſt and hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture
of ſome Bodies, but leave untouched
the ſofter <hi>compages</hi> of others: Witneſs, an
Aluminous liquor will corrode a bar of Iron,
but leave ſafe and ſound a piece of cloth, as
Dyers daily find by experience. So alſo by
the teſtimony of them, at the Alum-works,
a Lee made by the decoction of the calcined
<hi>minera</hi> of Alum, is boyled in a leaden Ciſtern
which it leaveth uncorroded; but a furnace
of Iron, or a plate thereof put into the boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
liquor is ſoon torn to pieces. So likewiſe
<hi>Aqua fortis</hi> will corrode a bar of Iron, but
leave entire a ball of ſoft Clay. As this Eſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
Acid doth prey upon a vein of Iron, it
doth incorporate with the more pure metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
parts, and make a Neutral Salt. To the
effecting of which a long tedious delay is not
requiſite, for we find by the making of <hi>vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
Martis,</hi> the ſaline parts of the Menſtruum
do ſoon inſinuate themſelves into the pores of
the metal. Whence <hi>Helmont: Constat martis
vitriolum ſale Eſurino embryonati ſulphuris &amp;
vena (non ferro) ferri, quam ſal eſurinum adhuc
volatile lambendo corroſit, in quo corroſionis actu
fit aliqualis diſſolutio ipſius venae, &amp; coagulatio
ſive fixatio ſalis volatilis.</hi> Helm. <hi>Parad.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>To the difference of Salts then in the bowels
of the earth, theſe three things do concur.
1. An Eſurine Acid, 2. Water to convey
this Acid to an appropriate Glebe, 3. a Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Glebe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:65192:33"/>
As Water impregnate with this Acid run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
through the ſubterreſtrial Channels, and
meeteth with a glebe of Alum, Nitre, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſites
of Iron or of Copper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to this or that ſpecifick Salt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Alum, Nitre, Sal Gemma, Vitriol of
Iron or Copper.</p>
               <p>The Eſurine Acid thus coagulated into
Salt, may by the ſubſequent ſtreams of water,
or by a free Current of the ſame, bring along

floating or diſſolved in it; the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in caſe the Minerals are in <hi>ſolutis princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piis</hi>

from a Nitrous glebe, it giveth a cold ſpring,
as many there are in <hi>England:</hi> if from an

For the <hi>Hungarian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> blew
Vitriol is digged up near the Copper-mines;
the <hi>Engliſh, Roman,</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Vitriol,
(which laſt partaketh of a little Copper) lie
near to Iron ſtones. All which without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
to the air will from their Marcaſites
yield their diſtinct ſorts of vitriol. And what
ſhould hinder the germination of vitriol un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ground, ſeeing that vitriol is but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
body, of an acid Salt and ſulphureous
Earth? The ſulphureous Earth is but the
Ocre or <hi>Terra metallica,</hi> that <hi>Mater ferri</hi> vel
<hi>Veneris,</hi> which receiveth the Acid, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth
the ſame according to the Power of
the <hi>Semen</hi> latent in the Earth, which may as
well convert the Acid of the Earth, as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line

for the diſſolution of the <hi>Pyrites</hi> in water, I
ſhall eaſily grant that much of its ſaline part
may be thus reſolved, eſpecially whilſt it is
near its firſt ſucculency; but thence ſee no

certainly there might be, by the help of an

Tis true, ſome ſteams will fly off from mineral

perceived, but theſe <hi>Aporrhea</hi> are but ſome
particles winding off, and are the effect of
fermentation or heat, yet cannot be collected
retaining the full nature of the mineral ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.
All mixt bodies are ſubject to change;
by internal or external ferments, and by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
agile parts and motion, many vapours, as

the ſubſtances whence theſe ſorts of Salts are
drawn. Waters current in their chan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and according to the diſſolved <hi>minera,</hi>
ſo Waters differ in their qualities.</p>
               <p>Upon the variety of Salts and Mineral
Earths dependeth variety of Springs. For
there are four ſorts of Salt commonly known
to us, according to Dr. <hi>Jorden</hi> and others,
viz. <hi>Alum, Vitriol, Nitre,</hi> and <hi>common Salt;</hi>
which others, and perhaps with as great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
reduce to three, <hi>Alum, Vitriol</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt,</hi> which laſt may be again divided into
<hi>Sal gemma</hi> or <hi>foſſilis, Fountain-ſalt,</hi> and <hi>Sal
Marine,</hi> becauſe theſe three ſorts partake
near of the ſame nature, and work almoſt the
like effects. Only the Sea-ſalt being diſſolved
in water hath loſt many of its ſharp points,
and conſequently is not ſo penetrating as <hi>Sal
foſſilis,</hi> from mountains and rocks of which,
according to moſt of our modern Authors,
the ſaltneſs of the Sea doth take its original.
An affinity betwixt theſe Salts Monſieur <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery</hi>

When <hi>Salt-peter</hi> is boiled a long time

nothing but a Salt like unto Sea-ſalt or <hi>Sal

is only a <hi>Sal gemma,</hi> fuller of ſpirits than the

               <p>NOw I ſhall proceed to Enquire, what
are the Ingredients of <hi>Ilmington-Spaw,</hi>
firſt taking notice of its Colour, which is
far more pale then Rock-ſpring water. With
Syrup of Violets it would turn green, like
Alkalizate Liquors with that ſyrup: with
Galls, to a Purple; like Martial Vitrioline
Waters: for Cuprous Vitrioline with Galls
turn muddy with a very little Purple or
Black; but of this more afterwards. Its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
being of a thick muddy conſiſtence, I
weighed (in a very dry Seaſon) a Pint of this
Spaw-water againſt a Pint of ordinary Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but the Spaw exceeded near half a
Drachm. Another time after a wet Seaſon
and when the Ocre was fallen an old Pint pot
of common Pump-water weighing 18 Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
did equalize (and if either, did turn the
Scales) the ſame quantity of the Spaw-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
which may caution us from prefixing a
determinate Weight to any Spring-water.
Variety in the Weight of Waters may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by comparing That Salt ſpring water
of <hi>Droit-wich</hi> with ſweet ſprings, yea to
him that compareth the Waters of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65192:37"/>
ſweet ſprings together, For the Eſurine
ſalt many times being carried along with the
water ſliding through its ſecret <hi>Meanders</hi> or
veins of the Earth; of which part inſinuateth
it ſelf into, and part corroding occurrent bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
it fretteth off fragments, ſuch as
<hi>fragmenta ferrea</hi> from Iron-ſtones, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
from ordinary ſtones, which are carried
along with the water, and lie latent to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
eye in its pores, but by Diſtillation, Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> will appear, Whence of neceſſity
followeth a great variety in weight, according
to the greater or leſs quantity of <hi>ſabulum</hi> or
fragments therein contained.</p>
               <p>Then I proceeded to enquire after the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
with which this Spring was impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.
And firſt I took about half a pint of
new milk, upon which in a Porringer I poured
this water freſh from the Spring-head, but
could not diſcern any coagulation; yea, for
any thing did appear, this mixture differed
not from a mixture of milk and ordinary
ſpring water. After four miles carriage of
the water, when the reddiſh Ocre began to
ſubſide, I poured upon warm milk from the
cow a pretty quantity of this water, and let it
ſtand at leaſt twelve hours; but neither in
this mixture, nor in milk and this Spaw-water
boiled together, did any <hi>Coagulum</hi> appear.
Hence I began to ſuſpect, that its brackiſh
taſte was not from an acid Salt; therefore on
this ſpring-water I inſtilled ſome oyl of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:65192:38"/>
but upon the inſtillation, and the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the water all night, a very ſmall curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
did enſue; only the mixture looked more
white than the Spaw-water it ſelf, which alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of colour proceeded from the oyl of
<hi>Tartar.</hi> Whereupon I concluded, that no
Acid ſalt was here predominant, yea rather
as ſuch, ſcarce diſcernable in this Spring; it
being, as I ſhall hereafter prove, far nearer to
an Alkali than to an Acid ſalt.</p>
               <p>Upon an Oaken leaf bruiſed I poured a pint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs
full of this Spring-water, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
it inclined to a Purple colour: I then
try'd it with Galls, and it turn'd firſt to a
Purple, but with an addition of more Galls
to a black. But deſiring more exactneſs, I
cauſed one ſingle grain of Galls finely powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be divided into twenty parts, another
grain into nineteen, another into eighteen
equal portions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon tryal I found, that
the eighteenth part of a grain did ſomething
incline a pint of this water to a Purple co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
as might be perceived in a chryſtal glaſs
ſet in a clear light; but the ſixteenth part of
a grain put into a pint of water, did preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cauſe a tincture plainly diſcernable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
to a purple; but the eighth part of a
grain fully turned a pint to a Purple, much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
in colour Syrup of Damask Roſes
mixed with ordinary Spring-water. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the more Galls were added, by ſo
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65192:38"/>
much the more it altered towards a black,
until it turned into a muddy inky Liquor.
Which Liquor by the inſtillation of ſpirit of
<hi>Vitriol</hi> was cleared, but by oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> or
ſpirit of <hi>Harts-horn</hi> was again muddied; with
ſpirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Aqua fortis,
&amp;c.</hi> became clear again: for what an Alkali
muddieth, an Acid again cleareth.</p>
               <p>Now conſidering the ſmall quantity of
Galls, with which a Pint of water was thus
tinged, I believe we may compare our new
found <hi>Spaw</hi> (in this particular) with any of
the Engliſh Medicinal waters, yea with the
<hi>German Spaws</hi> ſo much in requeſt.</p>
               <p>But it being ſufficiently proved by the
Learned Dr. <hi>Simpſon</hi> in his <hi>Hydrologia Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica,</hi>
that a ſolution of the <hi>Calx</hi> of Alum, or
of Alum-ſtones with the addition of Galls,
will turn to a deep Purple, and from thence
with more ſolution of Galls added becometh
blackiſh and opacous almoſt like Ink. Upon
which ſpirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> being poured, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
clear again; with oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> again
muddied, and with ſpirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> of <hi>Nitre,
Aqua fortis, &amp;c.</hi> reduced to its priſtine cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
He alſo in his <hi>Hydrological Eſſays</hi> write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
thus. <q>Not only Galls will ſtrike a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
tincture with the Alum-ſalt (got before
the addition of Kelp and Urine) diſſolved
in diſtilled or freſh ſpring-water, but alſo the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65192:39"/>
ſame may be done by other bodies, whoſe
texture of parts are congeneal; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the inner part of the Oak, the roots of
Tormentile, Avens, Biſtort, Clove-gillyflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and the flowers called <hi>Balauſtia.</hi> All
which like Galls will ſtrike a purple with
water wherein the Alum ſalt is diſſolved, yea
and will alſo become clear again by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling
a few drops of oyl of vitriol, and
with the oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> will become turbid
and muddy, &amp;c, <bibl>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I began to enquire farther into this <hi>Spaw,</hi>
upon conſideration that a Purple colour, and
from thence a dark muddy liquor like Ink,
might be made with Galls from another Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
than from a Vitriolick water or Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And that Vitriol diſſolved, by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Galls will ſtrike a good black, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
from the ordinary way of making
black writing Ink, Whereupon I compared
Aluminous waters and this Spring.</p>
               <p>I made a Solution of Mineral Alum with
fair w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter, which preſently upon the inſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did curdle Milk; but upon the mixture
of Milk and this Spring water no Coagulation
did enſue. And that Alum conſiſteth chiefly
of an Acid ſalt all-ſufficient to coagulate milk,
is apparent by the mixture of a Solution of
ſimple Alum ſalt, with a Solution of ſalt of
Tartar, Wormwood, or any Vegetable fixed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65192:39"/>
Salt; from whence will ariſe a turbid liquor
with Coagulations in it, which <hi>Coagula</hi> are
cauſed by the mutual conflict of different Salts,
deſtroying each other until a Third and Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
Salt reſult therefrom.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Aluminous Springs are purgative,
witneſs the <hi>Scarbrough</hi> Spaw, <hi>Epſom</hi> and <hi>Barnet</hi>
Waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but this near <hi>Ilmington</hi> worketh
moſt what by Urine. Yea perhaps (and truly)
I might conclude, That this <hi>Spaw</hi> in reſpect of
its mineral ingredients worketh not by
Siedge. I know it may be objected, That
ſome perſons drinking of this water do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
find a looſneſs, perhaps to the number of
four or five ſtools or more, To which I
might anſwer,</p>
               <p>1. That any ſimple Spring-water drank in
a large quantity, will purge by its own
weight: for as it lyeth heavy upon the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and inteſtines it oppreſſeth Nature,
whence the Periſtaltick motion is excited to
expell that which infeſts and is burdenſome;
and if the water doth much oppreſs the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
before it paſs through the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
is the effect according to Dr. <hi>Willis.

Minerals, as I ſhall more evince when I ſpeak
of its Eſſential parts. For</p>
               <p>2. If this <hi>Spaw water</hi> as ſuch, were Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
then it muſt have the ſame effects on all
perſons, allowing a proportionate quantity
according to the Conſtitution of the Party:
but that it is not, Experience teſtifieth. For
many find great Coſtiveneſs hereby, but a
great Secretion by Urine. Yea I have known
ſome perſons that have ventured upon five
Pints for the firſt Doſe to begin their Water-courſe;
yet inſtead of a Purge, found their

               </p>
               <p>3. To whom this Water becometh a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartick,
they muſt be either of a weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
ſoon oppreſt by a large quantity of
water, or elſe whoſe bodies abound with
ſharp humors (as Scorbutick perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) all-ſufficient
to produce a <hi>Diarrhoea</hi> or looſneſs
by a long irritation of the fibres: whence the
Periſtaltick motion being once excited, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65192:40"/>
as through its common Sink expelleth its
peccant matter. For if according to Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
not only the <hi>ſuccus Pancreaticus</hi> and <hi>Bilis,</hi>
but the ſerous humors alſo in their natural

out of the inteſtinal Glandules to make the
common <hi>Ductus</hi> ſlippery, and irritating the
fibres, do promote Purgation; much more
then according to <hi>Sylvius,</hi> when the Saline
Principle becomes too much exalted.</p>
               <p>To which I might add a fourth Cauſe, why
this <hi>Spaw</hi> ſhould become to ſome perſons, and
at ſome times, a Cathartick, <hi>viz.</hi> an Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to a Lask, whether it be from a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of Humors, Obſtructions of the Veſſels,

               <p>Beſides that, Alum is an Acid, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

which properties are not to be found in this
Spaw, comparatively more than in ordinary
Spring-water. I obſerved alſo, that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements
of thoſe that drank this water were
turned blackiſh, which is a conſequent to the
taking of Chalibeat Medicines, but not to the
drinking of Aluminous waters.</p>
               <p>For farther tryal I took about two Quarts

did make a great ebullition with fumes: quite
contrary to Alum, which maketh a plain ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcence

to be a Subalkalizate Acid, becauſe alſo
that ſpirit of Nitre and Mercury preſently
boyl up; it put me upon Enquiry, Whether
a Nitrous liquor was the Menſtruum to the
Mineral of this <hi>Spaw-water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by the way I ſhall propoſe one Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
taken notice of by Dr. <hi>Simpſon, Hydrol.
Eſſay p.</hi> 142. quite contrary to the received
opinion of vulgar Chymiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> That Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
as Nitre, or before it hath ſuffered the
force of fire, is not an Acid. For if Nitre were
an Acid, then it being put into boyling milk
would curdle it; that it will not, Experience
teacheth, yea no more than <hi>Sal Gemma,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of which do become acid until they have
undergone a fiery Tryal, whoſe ſpirits drawn
off will ſoon curdle milk. Which ſeemeth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65192:41"/>
to confirm that opinion of Monſieur <hi>Lemery</hi>
before mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> That Nitre is only a
<hi>Sal Gemma,</hi> fuller of ſpirits than the ordinary
<hi>foſſile Salt,</hi> becauſe when the ſpirits of Salt-peter
by boiling over a ſtrong fire are fled
away, there remaineth only a Salt reſembling
Sea-ſa;lt.</p>
               <p>That Nitre, before its particles are acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
by the ſtreſs of fire, is not acid, may
hence appear: becauſe it will make no Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
with a Lixivium of Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> nor
any other <hi>Alkali,</hi> which any Acid will do.
And the ordinary way of making <hi>Fixatio Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri,</hi>
by putting a burning coal into the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or Mortar wherein is Nitre, proveth; That
when the volatile parts are fled off, (as may
be perceived by the great detonation) <hi>Salt-peter</hi>
is become a plain <hi>Alkali</hi> ſalt.</p>
               <p>Neither for my part can I approve of <hi>Schro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s
Definition of <hi>Salt-peter. Sal Nitrum eſt

that Salt-peter yeildeth Red fumes or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
when its ſpirits are drawn over the
Helm, which ſeem inflammable and ſulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and that Nitre flung upon burning
coals will burn moſt vehemently, and with
great noiſe; and that the ſtrength of Gun-powder
proceedeth from the Elaſtick force of
Nitre, its ſpirits taking their Exploſion from
the inflammation. To which may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65192:42"/>
That Sulphur is the chief Principle

or earthen pot make <hi>Ignis Rotae,</hi> or the moſt
vehement fire that can be; yet the Nitre
without an addition of Sulphur ſhall not take
flame and burn, which muſt have been a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Conſequent were Inflammability ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
thereto. Let but a ſmall quantity
of Sulphur be added as that of a burning coal,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> with great impetuoſity the volatile parts
fly off; even as a great wind that increaſeth
the flame of combuſtible matter, but of it ſelf
is not capable of accenſion, ſo Nitre by its vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
parts like bellows doth blow up the
ſulphureous parts of a Coal that are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
matter of Flame. Were theſe Volatile
parts inflammable, then once accended, like
other combuſtible matter in a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
they would totally waſte. But in fixing
of Nitre it is obſerved, that as the burning
coals waſte, ſo the flame decays; but by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on freſh coals the flame is renewed, and
ſo until all the volatile parts of Nitre are
gone: as Monſieur <hi>Lemery</hi> well obſerved,
<hi>App. Cour. Chym Remar. on. fix. Nitr. p.</hi> 83. As
for the Red vapours yeilded in Diſtillation,
they are not without Sulphur capable of
flame, and the ſudden Exploſion thereof in
Gun-powder is from the quick accenſion of
Charcoal and Brimſtone, to which doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
the flatulent Exploſion of the volatile
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65192:42"/>
parts of Salt-peter in a rapid motion. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
againſt any ſulphureous principle of
<hi>Salt-peter</hi> might alſo be taken from the
Whiteneſs of the flame when mixed with Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
and from its cooling Quality, which is
contrary to the effect of a ſulphureous body.</p>
               <p>Upon farther Tryal I could not find Nitre
to be any Ingredient in this Spaw. For in
the whole Anatomy of this Water by Evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
Diſtillation, Cryſtallization, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
could not find the leaſt footſteps of Nitre,
much leſs any of its Salts ſhot into its uſual
<hi>Styria's.</hi> Beſides, the Powder left after Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
ſheweth its ſelf to be far different
from a Nitrous ſalt, as I ſhall hereafter prove.</p>
               <p>But obſerving this Water after its being
expoſed to the open air for ſome time, either
ſtagnating at the Spring-head, or elſe as it is
ſet in open veſſels hath a blewiſh <hi>Cremor</hi> ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
on the top or ſurface of the Water,
much reſembling waters that ſtand long upon
ſulphureous bogs; I began to enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this might not be a Sulphureous Spring,
like that at <hi>Knarsbrough,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>By an <hi>Analyſis</hi> of this Water into its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
not one grain of combuſtible Sulphur
is to be found. In its Diſtillation in cloſe ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
veſſels, the Water that firſt comes over is
inſipid, it will not ſtrike a Purple by an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Galls, ſo neither will the Spring-water
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65192:43"/>
when its Ocre is precipitated by being long
expoſed to the open air, neither will any Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous
Smell of the diſtilled Water ſtrike
the Noſtrils. What remains in the bottom
after Diſtillation, and alſo the Sediment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
after long ſtagnation, I tryed with
burning Coals and a red hot Iron, but could
not perceive the leaſt flagration. Now were
there any Sulphur, (I mean as to the body
thereof) it would ſhew its ſelf a combuſtible
matter on the Top after ſtagnation, like the
<hi>mare Asphalticum,</hi> and in <hi>Italy</hi> the Springs at
<hi>Maiamum, Saſſalo,</hi> and at the foot of <hi>Veſuvius,</hi>
with many more mentioned by Dr. <hi>Jorden,

Sulphur muſt ſubſide with the Vitrioline Ocre
of this Spring; for as the Water letteth fall
its vitrioline Ocre, ſo it becometh effete in its
vertues. But as no Oyl nor <hi>Bitumen,</hi> ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sulphur will mix <hi>per minima</hi> with Water;
its parts being heterogeneal to theſe of Oyl or
Sulphur: whence there can be no mixture un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
by a ferment. The <hi>Compages</hi> of the Water
then being diſſolved, and by letting fall its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioline
Ocre becoming effete and inſipid, the
Sulphur muſt have ſhew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:65192:43"/>
It may be then Queried, What maketh
this <hi>Cream</hi> on the top after ſtagnation, and
what is it that giveth a ſtrong Odour to this
ſtanding Water?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A blewiſh skin or <hi>Cremor</hi> is common
to all Vitrioline or other Mineral waters, and
to all waters that ſtand long upon a Bog:
which skin taken off, and put upon burning
coals, giveth a fetid ſmell. But as I have ſaid
before, Mineral Sulphur as to its body is not
here, How comes then this fetid ſmell? Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
may yeild a ſulphureous Cream and ſmell
two ways, <hi>First,</hi> when a bituminous matter
iſſueth forth with the Spring-water, as in the
Springs about the <hi>Mare Aſphalticum,</hi> at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne</hi>
in <hi>France,</hi> at <hi>Pitchford</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> and
at many places as we are informed by <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola,
de nat. eor. Eff, ex ter. lib. 1. and</hi> 2. For
the Watery and Oyly parts being heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal,
there can be no perfect Union; whence
the Oyl muſt either ſubſide, or elſe turn to a
Cream at the top. Or <hi>ſecondly,</hi> Waters may
get a ſulphureous Cream and Smell by putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
For Waters, but more eſpecially Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
by ſtanding in the air let fall their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients,
and caſt up ſulphureous particles to
the top. Becauſe the Air by its ferment diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
the <hi>Compages</hi> of Water, doth generate
a Sulphur <hi>de novo,</hi> as in long ſtanding Ditch-water;
or elſe doth cauſe the particles of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryonative</hi>
Sulphur, or Sulphur <hi>in fieri,</hi> to ſwim
at the top, (for combuſtible or Mineral Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65192:44"/>
I cannot find in this <hi>Spaw</hi>) as of water
ſtanding on Bogs, or black mooriſh ground.
So that this Water expoſed to the air, may by
a putrefactive ferment generate a ſulphureous
Cream <hi>de novo,</hi> or elſe caſt up its <hi>Embryona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
Sulphur, (all-ſufficient to cauſe the Cream
and Smell) which it hath got from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſites
of Iron or Vitriol, that are the main
Ingredient in this Spaw, as I ſhall anon prove.
And that <hi>Marcaſites</hi> of Vitriol do contain an
Embryonative Sulphur, take that Concluſion
deduced from Experiments by Dr. <hi>Simpſon,</hi>
                  <q>That the Marcaſites of Vitriol and Alum
have an <hi>Embryonative</hi> Sulphur connatural
with them, produced out of the ſame Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Seed; for inſtance, the Sulphur cruſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
by calcination of the Alum-ſtone;
and in the Vitriol Marcaſites I find, that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them into the fire, they burn of a blew
flame, and have a ſulphureous ſmell; in both
theſe the Sulphur is really anſwerable to the
common Sulphur or Brimſtone. <bibl>

               <p>But by way of Objection, there is an uſual
Obſervation, that may ſeem to prove the
common Mineral Sulphur, and not an Embry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate,
to be in this Spring, in caſe Marcaſites
of Iron do concur to the making up of this
<hi>Spaw,</hi> viz. many Iron-ſtones contain a plain
Brimſtone, as may clearly be diſcerned by the
naked eye, by the fetid ſmell and blew flame
in burning them at the Forge or Iron Mills.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:65192:44"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although there is found many
times among Iron-ſtones a plain Brimſtone,
yet we have no Demonſtrations to conclude
that it is here. But ſuppoſe that it ſhould be
among the Marcaſites, that are chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to the effecting this Mineral Spring;
yet Sulphur whether in its own proper Earth,
or Mineral veins, muſt have its proper <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi>
in order to its Diſſolution. Now an
Alkalizate Salt (and not an Acid) is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Menſtruum</hi> to open the body of Sulphur,
that it may ſhew it ſelf a part: but a Lixiviate
Salt I cannot perceive to be the Menſtruum to
unlock the <hi>Minera</hi> of this Spring, for then
muſt the Sulphureous part have plainly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
it ſelf by tinging of Silver and combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible
Cream, neither of which are here appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
And beſides, Lixiviate liquors are un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

moſt what of an Alkali Salt: upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
Chalybeat Preparations (wherein the
Body of Iron is to be opened) do require an
Acid Menſtruum; as the <hi>Crocus</hi> or <hi>Saffrons</hi> of
<hi>Mars</hi> with many more might teſtifie. For let
the Preparation of <hi>Crocus</hi> be performed by
expoſing the Iron for ſome time to the Dew
or Rain, or by ſpirit of Nitre, Sulphur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
yet ſtill by examination we ſhall find an Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
in the Diſſolvent, by which it is able to
corrode <hi>Mars.</hi> The Odour then and Cream
of this ſtagnating Water muſt be by its ſmall
quantity of <hi>Embryonate Sulphur</hi> brought along
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65192:45"/>
with the <hi>Mineral,</hi> and manifeſted by a putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

parts, or <hi>in ſucco primitivo,</hi> will ſooner ſhew it

               </p>
               <p>It being a conſequent to vitrioline Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to turn to a Purple by addition of Galls,
by addition of more Galls to turn dark, and
from thence to a thick muddy inky Liquor;
I began to Query, Whether this Spring was
vitrioline.</p>
               <p>As for Vitriol or Copperas I find it agreed
upon by the moſt eminent Authors, to be
made of an Acid Salt preying upon a Mineral,
whoſe Particles it combineth with into a cloſe
texture. So that a Mineral containing ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous
Earth, the Parts of Natural vitriol
may be concluded, An <hi>Eſurine</hi> or <hi>Acid Salt,
Metalline Particles,</hi> and a <hi>Sulphureous Earth.</hi>
According to the Diverſity of Minerals, on
which the Acid preyeth and combineth with,
ſo different Vitriols do ariſe. All which (as
yet known) may be reduced to two Heads,
<hi>viz, Vitriol of Iron,</hi> and <hi>Vitriol of Copper. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolum
album</hi> hath but little of the Metalline
part, and therefore by ſome is reckoned for a
diſtinct <hi>ſpecies.</hi> Becauſe of its Mildneſs, it
may with a little Preparation not only become
an Internal Remedy, witneſs the <hi>Sal Vitrioli
vomitivus,</hi> but alſo may be applied to tender
Parts, as it is uſual in Eye-waters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:65192:45"/>
Vitriol of <hi>Copper,</hi> called by ſome <hi>vitriolum
caeruleum</hi> from its blewiſh colour, by ſo much
the more it partaketh of Copper the more
blew it is, ſuch as the <hi>Hungarian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi>
Vitriol. Among the Particular ſorts of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol
of Copper there is difference, according
to the quantity of the Acid or Eſurine Salt,
and as it partaketh more or leſs of the Copper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vitriol</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> is commonly Greeniſh, as the
<hi>Goſlarick, Swediſh, Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ols.
Theſe partake moſt of <hi>Mars,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
are not ſo Cauſtick as them of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
for the more Copper the more Cauſtick
are the Vitriols, and by ſo much the more fit
for compoſition of Corroſive <hi>Menſtruums.</hi> As
for inſtance, the <hi>German</hi> greeniſh Vitriol, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
more of Iron than of Copper, is reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
among the vitriols of Iron; but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a ſmall quantity of Copper therein
comprehended, is found to be more Corroſive
than the ordinary green Vitriols; although
far ſhort of the Blew, whoſe Metalline parts
are Copper; yet I deny not, that there may
be a complication of Iron with Copper in the
ſame Marcaſite.</p>
               <p>As for the Red Vitriol our <hi>Druggiſts</hi> have
lately obtained from <hi>Germany,</hi> and by ſome
eſteemed as a diſtinct <hi>species</hi> of Vitriol, it
ſeemeth to be nothing but a <hi>Terra Vitriolica,</hi>
from which the Mineral Salt is ſeparated by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65192:46"/>
preterlabent Springs, or elſe is not as yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with an Eſurine Acid, but remains as
a <hi>Mater Vitrioli</hi> or proper Bed for its genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
By its aſpect it reſembleth the Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothar
of <hi>vitriol</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> which is rediſh, but
that of Copper like a yellow Oker,</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Natural vitriols already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
there are many Artificial; ſuch as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triols
adulterated (by way of cheat) in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Natural, as much is to counterfeit
the <hi>Roman</hi> Vitriol. By Solution, Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Cryſtallization, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may find a
great deal that paſſeth for true Natural Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triols
to be but Factitious adulterated Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
by addition of Salts made ſhoot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſtrange Cryſtals with variety of colours.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding that all the ſorts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Vitriol will ſtrike a Purple, and from
thence a muddy Inky liquor by a mixture of
Galls; yet I conclude the <hi>white Vitriol</hi> and
<hi>Vitriol</hi> of <hi>Copper</hi> not to have exiſtence in this
Spring, for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p>1. White vitriol is vomitive, witneſs the
<hi>Gilla vitrioli,</hi> ſo alſo is the vitriol of Copper,
yea excepting ſome Preparations of Mercury
the greateſt Emetick of Metals: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<hi>vitriol</hi> of <hi>Copper</hi> is a violent Cauſtick as
Chirurgical practice aſſureth us; neither of
which Properties do agree to this Spring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the red Oker that ſubſides out of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65192:46"/>
this ſtagnating water, and is to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the ſtones at the Spring-head in a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
quantity, doth exactly reſemble the
mineral Earth of Iron, and not of Copper;
which is carried along with the Metalline
parts diſſolved by the Eſurine Acid; which
Earth as the <hi>mater ferri</hi> becauſe of the body
of <hi>Mars</hi> in it, being preyed upon, doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as a <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> or Ruſtings of Iron.</p>
               <p>If it be Queried, Whether the Mineral of
this Water may not be <hi>Copper,</hi> but in ſo ſmall
a quantity, as not to have ſo powerful an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
as is required to an Emetick; like
ſpirit of vitriol although a Cauſtick, yet a
few drops may be ſafely taken inwardly,
when there is a large <hi>Latex,</hi> as it is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and with good ſucceſs in cooling Juleps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Spring is very ſtrong of the
Mineral, witneſs the Tincture with ſo ſmall a
quantity of Galls, (as before I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned)
any herein not any water in <hi>England</hi>
doth exceed; ſo that were it from an Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
or Purgative Mineral, as from Alum or
Copper, This muſt have been a Cathartick,
but we have no ſuch aſſurance from Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Beſides, were it from Copper a great
vomitive, then the Mineral being mixed in
a leſs quantity muſt purge by Stool; for as
Dr. <hi>Willis, Pharm. ration. ſect. 2. c. 1. de vomitione.</hi>
hath proved, When the irritation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtinal
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65192:47"/>
fibres is leſs than is required to cauſe
a Vomit, it worketh by Siedge. In vomiting
the Spaſms of the Fibres being violent, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is neceſſitated to evacuate the next way,
but leſs violent by the irritation of a Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
which is not of ſo quick an Operation,
nor to nauſeous and offenſive to the Stomach
as an Emetick; wherefore the Natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the fibres is not inverted, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<hi>uſque ad Anum</hi> to work by Stool. Now
had here been ſo much Copper as clearly to
have manifeſted it ſelf; this <hi>Spaw,</hi> if not an
Emetick, muſt have been a Cathartick, at
leaſt in an inferior degree.</p>
               <p>Upon conſideration that a Solution of <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi>
of <hi>Iron</hi> with Galls would ſtrike a Purple,
and from thence a black by addition of more
Galls; I began a compariſon betwixt this
Spring-water and vitriol of Iron, otherwiſe
called <hi>Sal Chalybis,</hi> made out of filings of Steel
and oyl of Vitriol.</p>
               <p>I took a Pint of fair Spring-water, in which
I diſſolved a quarter of a Grain of <hi>Sal Chalybis,</hi>
then I took a Pint of <hi>Spaw-water;</hi> into each
of them ſeverally put a quarter of a grain of
Galls finely powdered, and upon the mixture
both became Purple. The mixture with the
<hi>Sal Chalybis</hi> turned more to a blewiſh, but
that of the <hi>Spaw</hi> more to a rediſh Purple,
much reſembling fair water mixed with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Syrup of Damask Roſes. The diſſolution
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65192:47"/>
of the <hi>Sal Chalybis</hi> in fair water and the Spaw-water
had the ſame taſte, as near as Art
could imitate Nature. A ſmall variation in
Colour, and as little as may be, in taſte
may well be allowed, by reaſon of the rediſh
Oker contained in the Spaw, that upon ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Water will ſubſide, which muſt
needs cauſe it to incline ſomething more to a
right Purple, and to be ſomething more ſtyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
than the ſolution of <hi>vitriolum Martis,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
none of this red Oker<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neither can
it be expected, that the Spaw-water, after its
Oker is fallen, ſhould be of the ſame colour
with a ſolution of <hi>Sal Chalybis.</hi> For the Oker
that falleth is not a ſimple Earth, but carrieth
with it a great deal of the Mineral and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
parts; for in ſo much as the Oker falleth,
the Water looſeth its Tinging property, yea
degenerates from a Mineral water, and at
length becometh effete in its vertue.</p>
               <p>By addition of more Galls to the Solution
of <hi>Sal Chalybis</hi> and to the Spaw-water, both
began to turn to a dark, and at laſt to a black
inky Liquor. Then I poured into each a few
drops of ſpirit of Vitriol, and both returned
to their priſtine clarity; then I inſtilled upon
each a few drops of oyl of <hi>Tartar per Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium,</hi>
and again they became muddied, but
with ſpirit of Nitre both became clear again.
From whence I infer a Similitude betwixt
this Spaw-water and a Solution of <hi>Sal Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:65192:48"/>
or Vitriol of Iron, being alike in their va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>riation
of Colours, Precipitation, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to Clarity again.</p>
               <p>But before I ſhall proceed to more Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to prove a farther Similitude betwixt
this Spaw-water and vitriol of Iron, I ſhall
ſpeak ſomething as a <hi>Rationale,</hi> Why theſe
have alike Precipitation, Variation, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
which may farther illuſtrate an Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
betwixt them from the forementioned
Experiments.</p>
               <p>Why there is ſome difference in colour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a Solution of <hi>ſal Chalybis</hi> in fair water
which inclineth to a Blew, and this Spaw-water
(I mean when Galls are added to both)
which inclineth more to a Purple, as I ſaid
before is from the red Ocre in the Spaw-water.
For all Natural vitriol containeth in it a <hi>terra
Metallica,</hi> whoſe Colour may be changed into
a brown, black, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<hi>Analyſis</hi> of Vitriol by fire. But before any
Chymical Preparation of this Spaw-water its
Oker is red, as may appear by the Stagnation
of the water, to them that make Inſpection
at the Spring-head,</p>
               <p>Now if we look into the Nature of the thing,
we ſhall ſcarce find any or no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Spaw-water and a Solution of vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol
of Iron. For Blew and Purple are but a
Black in a remiſs degree; for proof hereof
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65192:48"/>
I could cite the Tryals of experienced Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
all-ſufficient to confirm the Aſſertion.
But inſtead thereof take one or two Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> that Blew and Purple do only differ
by addition of a little Red, Take a Blew, as
<hi>Indy-blew, &amp;c.</hi> ground into a fine powder;
which being divided into two parts, add to
one part a little Vermilion finely powdered,
and it giveth a Purple, by reaſon that the Blew
and the Red particles do refract their rays <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixtim,</hi>
which cannot be diſtinguiſhed but
by good Microſcopes. If this be the reſult
from dry Powders, much more then and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from diſtinction when Bodies are <hi>in flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ore,</hi>
and the Particles of one implexed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated
into the Pores and interſtices of the
other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Blew and Purple are but a
remiſs degree of Black, take this Obſervation
to the preſent buſineſs. By an addition of a
ſmall quantity of Galls to the Spaw-water, and
alſo to a Solution of vitriol of Iron doth ariſe
a Purple, and a Blew inclinable to a Purple,
even ſo it doth in making of Ordinary ink,
when to a ſolution of Vitriol there is made an
addition of a ſmall quantity of Galls, a Purple
is the Reſult, but by addition of more and
more Galls it turneth to a Black or inky Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.
So that Blew or Purple is but a <hi>medium</hi>
to a Black, for the ſame thing by variation
in its quantity maketh both.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:65192:49"/>
But let us ſuppoſe a difference in colour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Spaw-water and a Solution of <hi>ſal
Chalybis;</hi> yet that will rather prove a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Poſition of the Parts of Matter, cauſing a
different refraction of Light, than a Difference
in the Nature of the Subjects. For the ſame
Thing by altering the modification of its
Particles, may alter its Colour. So Syrup of
Violets, by inſtillation of a little <hi>Oleum Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri
per Deliquium,</hi> changeth from a Blew to a
famous Green, A few drops of ſpirit of Nitre
inſtilled on a conſiderable quantity of this
mixture, or on freſh Syrup, will change it into
a Carnation Red. But neither of theſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
had any reſemblance of Red, or Green,
before the Mixture, Divers changes in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
I could inſtance, made by inſtillation of
clear Liquors upon a Decoction of Logwood,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by mixture of Tinctures. By the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
practice of Dyers we are informed,
that the ſame thing <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> a Decoction of <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum</hi>
will produce a Green from a Yellow, and
a Ruſſet from a Red, only by a previous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
with Alum: Yea I could produce a
Liquor I have got from a vegetable, (which
Experiment I lighted upon by accident,
whilſt making ſome ſcrutiny into <hi>Colours</hi>) that
by inſtillation of another Liquor as clear as
rock-water, will ſtrike an excellent Scarlet;
which colour ſeemeth not to have the leaſt
footſteps in the ingredients before they are
mixed. Many ſuch like Obſervations, I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65192:49"/>
not, may be found by Tryal on mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
yea for ought I know to compare with
our <hi>Bow-dye,</hi> without the leaſt recourſe to
<hi>Chochineel.</hi> But this being to dive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto the
Dyer's Trade, I ſhall only take notice from
ſuch Experiments, That Colour dependeth
more on the Texture of Parts differently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
the Light, than from a difference in
Matter. So that a Blew or Purple will be no
Material difference betwixt a Solution ef Salt
of <hi>Mars</hi> and this Spaw-water, with Galls ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that this Oker is the main
occaſion thereof, may be hence concluded. I
made a Solution of Engliſh vitriol in fair wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which with a ſmall quantity of Galls did
ſtrike a Purple very near as deep as this
Spaw-water: but let vitriol be diſtilled, and
reunite all its parts except the <hi>Colcothar,</hi> and
with fair water and Galls you ſhall fail as to
the former Purple; and in all vitrioline So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
with Galls may be obſerved, The more
<hi>Terra Metallica</hi> the deeper the Purple.</p>
               <p>When Galls are added to this Spring-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and alſo to a Solution of <hi>Sal Chalybis,</hi> an
Alteration in Colour (as I ſaid before) and an
inky ſmell doth alſo enſue. The reaſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is this; An inky liquor or Ink (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
will ſmell as ſuch) is made by a ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of vitriol precipitated, or made opacous
by the addition of Galls; whoſe ſtiptick parts
do make <hi>Coagula</hi> with the vitriolick, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65192:50"/>
the vitriolick out of the former poſture,
and make them like ſo many confuſed Atoms:
they alſo fill theſe interſtices and pores of the
water, which before made a diaphanous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but is now become a turbid, confuſed, and
conſequently a blackiſh liquor. In the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way of making ink, Gum Arabick and
Sugar is added to the Galls and vitriol, by
reaſon they cauſe a thicker conſiſtence, and
their glutinous parts buoy up theſe confuſed
Atoms and <hi>Coagula,</hi> which by long ſtanding
would ſubſide, and ſo the Solution return dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous.</p>
               <p>The ſolution of vitriol of <hi>Mars</hi> and Spaw-water,
by inſtillation of ſpirit of Vitriol, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Nitre, or by other Acids, are reduced to
a clear conſiſtence; becauſe that ſpirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth work upon and ſcatter thoſe
confuſed Atoms and <hi>coagula</hi> made by the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol
and Galls, which the Galls had cauſed to
float up and down in a confuſed poſture.
Wherefore the Liquors return clear, the Acids
having expelled the ſtiptick and Alkalizate
Particles.</p>
               <p>By inſtillation of oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> theſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
become again turbid and muddy incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to an inky colour. For an <hi>Alkali</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates
and deſtroys an Acid, ſuch as ſpirit
of Vitriol, ſpirit of Nitre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and bringeth
into confuſion what an Acid had cleared, and
doth by deſtroying the Acid drive out its
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65192:50"/>
Particles from the interſtices and pores of the
water, and ſets them, with them of the Gall
as yet unprecipitated into confuſion; ſo that
the <hi>coagulum</hi> betwixt the vitriolick parts of
the Water and Galls reſumes it ſelf. Upon
the inſtillation of ſpirit of Nitre, both became
clear again, and with ſpirit of Harts horn
both again turbid and muddy, for the ſame
reaſons before alledged.</p>
               <p>Whence I infer a ſimilitude betwixt a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of Vitriol and this Spaw-water, as to
Precipitations and Reductions by the inſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Alkalizate and Acid Liquors or Salts.</p>
               <p>For farther tryal and proof that this <hi>Spaw</hi>
is vitrioline, and that only, I took two or
three quarts of this Spring-water, and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
it in an earthen veſſel <hi>ad ſiccitatem,</hi>
where it left behind a rediſh white powder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
on ſome of it I let fall a few drops of ſpirit of
Nitre, and immediately a great ebullition
with froth and fumes did ariſe with a ſenſible
efferveſcence. Upon the ſame quantity of
powder I let fall ſome ſpirit of vitriol, and
the like effect did enſue. I let ſtand a quart of
this ſpring-water in an open veſſel, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
quantity in a glaſs-bottle cloſely ſtoped;
out of both in a ſhort time I found precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
a rediſh ſediment, which being dryed
with the aforeſaid Acids did make an Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:65192:51"/>
I then forthwith made tryal with the ſame
Acid ſpirits and <hi>vitriol</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> or ſalt of Steel.
Upon a little vitriol of Iron I inſtilled a few
drops of ſpirit of Nitre, and an ebullition
with forth and fumes did ariſe, like as upon
the powder left after evaporation, and alſo
upon the ſediment of water with ſpirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.
Upon vitriol of Iron I let fall a few drops
of ſpirit of Vitriol, but could not perceive
any Luctation, either by ebullition, efferve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence,
exhalation, crepitation, or elevation.
But why ſpirit of vitriol ſhould not ferment
with vitriol of Iron, and yet ſhould ferment
with the powder left after evaporation of this
water, when, as I ſaid before, that the
ſtrength of this water conſiſts in a vitriol of
Iron with a <hi>terra metallica</hi> or Colcothar ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
to and precipitated with it; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is plain. In the making of <hi>ſal Chalybis</hi>
or vitriol of Iron with oyl of vitriol and file<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Steel, the oyl doth incorporate with
the Steel or Iron; and being a ſtrong Acid,
and indeed the moſt Cauſtick part of Vitriol
(and improperly called Oyl) doth ferment
with the Alkalizate parts of Iron; and from
the combining of theſe two different Salts a
<hi>neutrum quid,</hi> viz. <hi>vitriolum Martis</hi> comes.
Now the pores of Iron being fully ſaturated
with the Acid of Vitriol, upon a new inſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of more ſpirit or oyl no fermentation
follows; ſeeing the iron hath already as it
were imbibed as much of the Vitriol as it can,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65192:51"/>
there will not follow any fermentation. For
as Water worketh not upon Water, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpirit of Vitriol on ſpirit of Vitriol, the
ſame thing worketh not upon it ſelf: neither
can the oyl or ſpirit work again on the Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizate
parts of <hi>Mars,</hi> which are already ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
by the Acid of vitriol, and utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of making a new conflict with it; but
will with ſpirit of Nitre being a ſubalkalizate
Acid, becauſe the pores of <hi>ſal Chalybis</hi> are
open to it. But why then ſpirit of vitriol
ſhould make an Ebullition with the powder
left after evaporation, and upon the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is, becauſe the metallick particles
brought from the Marcaſites of Iron are not
fully ſaturated with the Eſurine Acids in the
water, which preyed upon the Marcaſites,
and brought with it fragments thereof;
whoſe pores are ſtill ſo diſpoſed, that Acids
may be able to cloſe, and by their violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
divide and as it were tear in pieces, until
the contrary ſalts have embraced each other,
and are united into a <hi>Tertium Quid</hi> or indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvable
Texture.</p>
               <p>For a farther compariſon betwixt this
Spring-water and a ſolution of Vitriol of
Iron I took a quantity of Milk, but by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with this Spring-water could find no coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation,
either with hot, cold, or boiling
Milk. Then I made a ſolution of <hi>ſal chalybis</hi>
with fair water, and mixed it with cold milk,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65192:52"/>
with milk warm from the cow, and alſo
boyled it with Milk; but neither of them
curdled, yea no more than fair Spring-water
and milk.</p>
               <p>But now it may be Queried, What is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the Acid, <hi>viz.</hi> the Eſurine acidity?
And how comes a Solution of vitriol of Iron
not to curdle Milk, when as oyl of vitriol go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
into its compoſition, which is an Acid;
and like other Acids as Vinegar, <hi>Aqua fortis,
&amp;c.</hi> will curdle Milk?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Eſurine ſalt of the Earth prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Metallick parts of the Marcaſites
of Iron, ſo alſo the oyl or ſpirit of vitriol in
making <hi>Sal Chalybis</hi> on the Iron or Steel; and
the vitriol on the oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> in making
<hi>Tartarum vitriolatum,</hi> viz. an Acid upon an
Alkalizate body. When they are in a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
quantity the conflict betwixt theſe
contrary Salts is great, but the Acid being in
a proportionate quantity cannot tear in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and ſhiver the Alkalizate into inviſible
Atoms, but fixeth its points in the pores of
the Alkalizate Matter; yet hath not power
to ſhatter it all to pieces, and free it ſelf from
Combinations: but the Parts of the Acid lie
ſheathed and loaded with the Alkali. So they
being cloſed together, do by their own weight
(eſpecially after the Liquor buoying them up
is weakened by Evaporation) fall down to
the bottom: and by their mutual conflict or
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65192:52"/>
ferment having broken off and dulled the
edges of each others Particles, and combined
together, do become a <hi>Neutral</hi> Salt.</p>
               <p>Some Authors have aſſerted, That from a
<hi>Tartarum vitriolatum</hi> put into a Retort, by
the force of fire may be drawn off a ſpirit of
vitriol again: as if the Salts claſping toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had not as it were deſtroyed each others
priſtine texture of parts, by breaking off and
dulling the edges of the ſaline Particles. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
Experience proveth, That what is
drawn over the Helm from <hi>Tartarum vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum,</hi>
is not a ſpirit like the oyl or ſpirit of
vitriol at the firſt. For the Taſte and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it plainly ſheweth, that the <hi>Alkalizate</hi>
ſalt of <hi>Tartar</hi> hath almoſt wholly taken off its
Acidity; yea I think I might poſitively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
That it is an impoſſibility from theſe
Neutral Salts, ſuch as <hi>Tartarum vitriolatum,
vitriolum Martis,</hi> &amp;c. to reſtore an Acid to
its priſtine luſtre and efficacy.</p>
               <p>I ſaid before, when the Acid and Alkalizate
Bodies are mixed in a proportionate quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
together: For the Acid in too great a
quantity diſſolves and deſtroys all theſe <hi>Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi>
that it made with the <hi>Alkali,</hi> when mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a ſmall quantity. Whilſt theſe Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are proportionate, the <hi>Alkalizate</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
maintained their part againſt the Acid,
ſo that both lay fixed and free from motion,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65192:53"/>
but by addition of more Acid its ſtrength is
increaſed, ſo as to ſcatter and diſſolve the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulation.
And this may be ſeen, as I inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
before, by inſtillation of ſpirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol
upon this <hi>Spaw-water</hi> or a Solution of
<hi>ſal Chalybis</hi> with Galls; wherein the vitrioline
parts of the Water with the Galls make <hi>coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula,</hi>
but by addition of more ſpirit of vitriol
or other Acid are ſcattered, that the Liquor
becomes again clear. The ſame reaſon is,
when the <hi>Alkali</hi> is too ſtrong for the Acid;
it deſtroys and expells the acid particles float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Liquor, and maketh them unable
to bear up a conflict. So alſo when Milk is
curdled by an Acid, the Acid hath entered the
Cheeſy part, and loſt its motion; but upon
the pouring on of more Acid the Cheeſy part
will be precipitated, but at laſt the Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will diſſolve away, and quite diſappear.
Many Inſtances I might produce, which I ſhall
paſs by, ſeeing they allow the ſame <hi>Rationale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As in the making of <hi>Tartarum vitriolatum</hi>
the Salts combine, and work themſelves into
a Neutral Salt, ſo alſo in this Spring-water;
where by an Eſurine acid Salt acuating the
Water is made a Solution of the <hi>Minera</hi> of
Iron, whoſe <hi>Alkalizate</hi> parts combined and
claſped with the Eſurine acid Salt, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>Neutral.</hi> Upon the inſtillation of a
contrary Salt, whether volatile or fixed <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali,</hi>
the Salts preſently make an aſſault upon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65192:53"/>
each other, and by their cloſing together and
taking off their edges by the ferment become
a <hi>third</hi> or <hi>Neutral</hi> Salt, In the conflict or
duel they thruſt forth and partly leave the
Mineral body diſſolved by the Eſurine Acid:
which precipitates to the bottom, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
down with it ſome of the Salts of the
<hi>Menſtruum.</hi> For more than a <hi>Colcothar</hi> muſt
be here ſeparated, becauſe of the ebullition
following an inſtillation of Acids thereon.</p>
               <p>But leaſt that it ſhould be imagined, that
there may follow a fermentation by inſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Acids, becauſe of the <hi>Alkali</hi> added to
make a Precipitation, but not belonging to it
as a Mineral Water; we muſt conſider, that a
precipitation may be made (beſides that by
droping thereon or mixing contrary Salts)
out of mineral Water three ways: 1. by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
to the air (which cauſeth a putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
ferment) the Mineral parts will ſubſide;
2. by heat, as in boiling, diſtilling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the
Ocre falls; 3. by motion <hi>ab extra,</hi> as by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Powder thus precipitated did
with Acids make a great ebullition, which
could not be from any Salts not belonging to
it as a Mineral. Wherefore the Sediment
thus precipitated is not a ſimple <hi>Colcothar,</hi>
but with the <hi>Colcotar</hi> do fall ſome of the Salts
of the <hi>Menſtruum:</hi> for by pouring on freſh
water, and dulcifying the Sediment, a Salt is
extracted from the <hi>Colcotar,</hi> that may by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporation,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65192:54"/>
Chryſtallization, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be brought
to a dry body, and exactly anſwereth <hi>ſal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybis</hi>
as to its Operation, Experiments, and
Effects.</p>
               <p>I diſtilled a conſiderable quantity of this
Water in a Glaſs Retort and Receiver cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
luted to it. The firſt Water that came
over the Helm I found by taking off the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
to be inſipid, which would not with
Galls, <hi>Balauſtia</hi> flowers, Avens, Biſtort roots,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> like vitrioline waters ſtrike a Purple.
Then I diſtilled off more inſipid Water, but
to the ſides of the Retort when cooled I found
ſticking a rediſh powder, like that I found by
Evaporation; the Reſidue of the Water in
the Retort by Evaporation <hi>ad ſiccitatem</hi>
yeilded more. Upon this Sediment dryed I
let fall a few drops of ſpirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi>
oyl of <hi>Sulphur per Campanam,</hi> and <hi>Aqua
fortis;</hi> an ebullition with a great efferveſcence
did immediately follow. But upon inſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of oyl of <hi>Tartar per Deliquium,</hi> ſpirit of
<hi>Harts-horn,</hi> or other <hi>Alkalizate</hi> Liquors, not
the leaſt ebullition or efferverſcence could be
perceived. From which Experiments, as alſo
from the former, may follow theſe two col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral
Concluſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That this <hi>Spaw</hi> like other Mineral
Waters by the precipitation of its Ocre or
Sediment doth loſe its tinging Property with
Galls, and alſo is weakened in its Operation.
And although ſome of the Salt yet remain
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65192:54"/>
diſſolved in the Water after the falling of the
Sediment, its former vigour and efficacy is
decayed; for by ſo much the Water hath let
fall of its Ocre and Sediment, (which as I
proved before is not a ſimple metallick earth,
but doth carry down with it ſome of the ſalts
of the <hi>Menstruum</hi>) by ſo much the water is
weakened, and by the falling of more Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
groweth weaker and weaker in its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> from the ebullition and efferve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence
of Acids poured upon this Powder left
after Evaporation, or precipitated by Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Heat, or Air; but upon inſtilling of oyl
of <hi>Tartar</hi> or other <hi>Alkalizate</hi> Salts no fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
follows; I conclude, that the Salt
in this Powder is rather Lixivial than Acid:
although it be (as I have hinted before) a
<hi>Neutral</hi> Salt from the combining of the Eſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
Acid in the Water and the <hi>Alkalizate</hi>
part of Iron, yet like <hi>Tartarum vitriolatum,</hi> or
<hi>vitriolum Martis,</hi> it inclineth much to an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas an Ebullition and Efferve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence
followed the inſtillation of Acids on
the precipitated Sediment, like as upon vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol
of Iron, or Tartar vitriolated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
that an efferveſcence and ebullition follows
the pouring of oyl of Vitriol on filings of
<hi>Mars</hi> in the making of <hi>ſal chalybis,</hi> and the
oyl of Vitriol upon the Tartar in making
<hi>Tartarum vitriolatum;</hi> both which Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65192:55"/>
like the ſediment of this Spaw will
ſtrongly ferment with <hi>Acids;</hi> I conclude it
is highly probable, that this Spring, when
firſt it becomes a Mineral water, (which is
whilſt the Eſurine Acid preyeth on the <hi>minera</hi>
of Iron) is hot: but by long running through
a Colander of earth or gravel loſeth its heat,
and becometh almoſt a cold Spring. Almoſt
I ſaid, for by comparing the water of this
Spaw with other ordinary Spring-water, but
eſpecially with a Rock-ſpring, a ſenſible
warmth may be diſcerned. And that the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcence
is ſcarce over at the Spring-head,
may be gathered from the Sparkling of the
Water in a glaſs, like bottled Sider newly
emptied: and, as I have it by good informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
doth much reſemble the <hi>German</hi> Spaw-water
ſealed up in bottles, and brought to
<hi>Leyden</hi> and ſeveral places in the <hi>Low-countries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I took about a Pint of <hi>Ilmington</hi> Spaw-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
freſh from the Spring-head, into which I
let fall a few drops of Oyl of <hi>Tartar per Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium,</hi>
which made a white Coagulation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed
through the whole body; but ſo ſmall,
that it was ſcarce diſcernable. I then made
a Solution of <hi>ſal chalybis</hi> with fair water, upon
which I droped ſome oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and found
a Coagulation in it exactly like the Spaw-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> The <hi>coagula</hi> in both
by an addition of ſpirit of Vitriol were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

but by <hi>Alkali's</hi> were reduced <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:65192:55"/>
Now it may be queſtioned, How come <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali</hi>
Salts, as oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> &amp;c. to make theſe
Coagulum's, when as ſpirit of Vitriol or other
Acids cauſe no Alteration?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are two ſorts of ordinary
<hi>Menſtruums</hi> for Bodies; Ordinary I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I muſt except <hi>Paracclſus</hi>'s <hi>Sal circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
and <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Liquor <hi>Alkaheſt,</hi> the grand
Solvents of Bodies into their firſt Principles.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Menſtruums</hi> impregnated with acid
Spirits or Salts, whether they be Natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,
ſuch as the Juice of Crabs, the ſowr juice
of Plants, the Acid of Marcaſites of Iron,
Alum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Artificially made from natural
Salts, as ſpirit of Vitriol, ſp. of Sulphur <hi>per
campanam,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Menſtruums</hi> endowed with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalizate</hi>
Salts, either fixed <hi>Alkali's,</hi> as ſalt of
Tartar, Wormwood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or volatile, as ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Urine, Harts-horn, or of the horns and
hoofs of Animals, Sage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some add a Third ſort of Menſtruum, <hi>viz.</hi>
a <hi>vinous Spirit,</hi> which is the common Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum
for making of Tinctures and Extracts,
becauſe it is apt to imbibe the ſulphureous
Principle from Compounds. But for my
part, I take a <hi>vinous Spirit</hi> not as a diſtinct
Menſtruum from the two former. For ſpirit
of Wine is nothing but an oyl highly advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by its volatile Salt, with a ſmall quantity
of Phlegm. The quantity of oyl is manifeſt
by its inflammability, for good rectified ſpirit
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65192:56"/>
of Wine once kindled will almoſt totally
conſume. In Diſtillation the volatile Salt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
in the ſulphureous parts ſtriving to
get free, doth tear and divide them, until
they be rarified into a Spirit: to which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a little phlegm, for the better ſeperation
of the Salts fermenting and exalting the oyl.
Now chiefly for its volatile Salt, ſpirit of
Wine is the Menſtruum in making the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
and Extracts of <hi>Senna, Rhubarb, Aloes,
Mirrh, Saffron, Hellebore,</hi> and of all dry Roots,
Seeds, Flowers, Woods, and Barks. For by
addition of volatile Salts the Extracts are
ſtronger, than when made with ſpirit of Wine
only.</p>
               <p>Having this premiſed, I may return to the
Queſtion thus; That upon the mixture of
Acid and <hi>Alkalizate</hi> Salts they ferment and
cloſe together in a Neutral Salt, (as I have
already intimated) and forſake or rather
thruſt forth the Metalline Body diſſolved and
buoyed up in the Menſtruum, which with
ſome of the Salts of the Liquor falls down to
the bottom. The Salts combined together
and floating up and down in the Menſtruum,
with ſome of the Mineral body as yet unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
do repreſent theſe <hi>Coagula:</hi> even
as oyl of Tartar poured upon a ſolution of
Vitriol made with fair Water, cauſeth a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of the Metalline and Colcotarine
Parts ſubſiding to the bottom, and Coagulums
of the contrary Salts for a time buoyed up
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65192:56"/>
in the Menſtruum. So oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> with
<hi>Ilmington</hi> Water maketh a white <hi>Coagulum,</hi>
becauſe it combineth with the Eſurine Acid of
the Water. But the Curdling is very ſmall,
becauſe of the ſmall quantity of Acid that
doth free, and as it were unſheath it ſelf from
the <hi>minera</hi> of Iron; or is yet lodged in the
pores of the Water, and is not as yet fixed and
joyned to the <hi>Alkalizate</hi> part of Iron,</p>
               <p>To try what figure the Salt bore that was
contained in this Water, I took about two
or three Gallons of the Water, and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
it <hi>ad ſiccitatem.</hi> At the bottom and
ſides of the veſſel I found a rediſh white Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which I dulcified with warm Water: And
there was left behind an inſipid Earth like red
Ocre or Colcotar. The Water I filtred, eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated,
and then ſet to chryſtallize, which
yeilded a Salt of an irregular figure: it was of
a paliſh colour, but as to its operation anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vitriol of Iron.</p>
               <p>It being aſſerted by ſome Authors (but the
Truth thereof I much queſtion) That many
Mineral Waters will looſe in Weight by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
by loſs of Spirits as They ſay; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(if at all) I ſuppoſe by an <hi>Aporrhea Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralis:</hi>
I filled a glaſs bottle with this Spaw-Water,
and ſtoped it up cloſe at the Spring-head,
where <hi>I</hi> weighed it with an exact pair
of Scales. After four or five Miles carriage
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65192:57"/>
I tryed and found it continue the ſame
weight. After it had ſtood a day or two, by
examination I found the weight not at all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed:
ſo that by this way, nor by Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
could I find any volatile ſpirits, wherein
the vertue of this Water conſiſts.</p>
               <p>The Bottle thus ſtoped I kept for a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
and then could perceive the Sediment
juſt begin to fall to the bottom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bottle carried with This, and left open
to the air, I found great part of the Sediment
fallen in twelve hours. Which confirms my
former Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That not only Heat,
Motion by carriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the Air alſo
precipitates its Sediment.</p>
               <p>Upon Tryal I found, that the Water out of
which the Ocre was fallen would not tinge
with Galls; but the Water kept cloſe ſtoped
for a fortnight did with Galls readily ſtrike a
Purple, and ſo would more or leſs, until the
<hi>Terra Metallica</hi> was all fallen.</p>
               <p>To ſum up then that which hath been laid
down, I may ſay of this Spring, as <hi>Helmont</hi>

                     <hi>As for the Notion of Fermentation take
this Definition.</hi> Fermentation is an intestine
motion of the Parts or Principles of a Body, with
an Inclination to its Perfection or to its Change.
<hi>By Change may be underſtood its Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or Diſſolution of its</hi> Compages, <hi>or</hi> muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio

                  <p>Upon conſideration that an entire Function
or Office of every Part in the Body is the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
or Product of <hi>Health,</hi> and that a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi>
is an Ill Conſtitution cauſing an impediment
to the Parts in their Function or Office, ſome
according to the diverſity of Functions have
made a diviſion of Diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>The Functions do either reſpect the Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Individual, or the Propagation
of the Species. Theſe that reſpect the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the Individual, are either <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
ſuch as Concoction of Aliments, Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſication,
Secretion of Excrements, Production
of Vital Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or elſe <hi>Animal,</hi> which do
reſpect the Senſitive part of the Creature, as
in its External or Internal Senſes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe that reſpect the Propagation of the
Species are peculiar to the Male or Female
Sex, and accordingly Authors have grounded
their Diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not proceed in this method, bnt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

take a Summulary of Diſtempers (ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for my preſent purpoſe) from the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or rather from the Depravations of
them in our body, knowing that a large
Explanation would raiſe a Tractate to a large
Volume.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the ingenious <hi>Franciſcus De le boe
Sylvius</hi> hath laid down the <hi>Dyſcraſia</hi> of
the <hi>Lympha,</hi> and of the <hi>Bilis</hi> for the two ſole
Cauſes of Fevers either Intermittent or Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual,
(under <hi>Lympha</hi> he comprehendeth <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Pancreaticus</hi> and <hi>Saliva</hi>) and aſcribeth
Chylification chiefly to the Salt in Spittle,
which by Maſtication is mixed with the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or is already conveyed into the ſtomach,
but alloweth of no ſtomachical Ferment, I
cannot aſſent to be his Proſelyte. For conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the ſtructure of the ſtomach, how that
its interior or nervous tunicle hath a <hi>Cruſta
villoſae</hi> or hairy ſcurf with a multitude of
Glandules to percolate and imbibe the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
derived from the Arteries and Nerves;
we may well ſuppoſe an acid Ferment either
implanted in, or derived to the ſtomach from
the ſame veſſels that the <hi>Saliva</hi> is. Beſides
this, <hi>Gliſſon, Willis, Diemerbroeck,</hi> yea authors
both ancient and modern afford us reaſons all-ſufficient
to believe a ſtomachical Ferment.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing an acid Ferment in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
or elſe in the Spittle and ſo the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65192:59"/>
to be only as a convenient Work-houſe;
it will be all one in a manner, as to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and Cures of Diſeaſes that ariſe from the
Depravation of the primary Ferment.</p>
                  <p>It will be too tedious and beyond my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to deſcribe the Modes of Fermentations
in humane bodies, I ſhall therefore content
my ſelf to enquire, 1. What are the Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Digeſtions of our bodies, and the Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of them; 2. The Diſtempers thence
ariſing; 3. Whether this <hi>Ilmington</hi> Spaw
will contribute to the Reſtoration or Cure of
the diſordered Digeſtions.</p>
                  <p>The Aliment in its way to Nutrition doth
undergo ſeveral alterations by the Ferments
of our bodies, it is ſeveral times percolated
and as it were ſtrained and purged from its
<hi>faeces,</hi> after the Changes it hath received, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Animal ſpirits, the Inſtrument of
Senſation, and the chief vehicle of the Soul,
are elaborated therefrom.</p>
                  <p>There are three Principal Digeſtions, <hi>viz.
Chylification, Sanguification,</hi> and <hi>Production of
Animal spirits.</hi> Beſides, there are others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to particular parts, ſuch as that of
the Spleen, Seminal veſſels and Prolifick parts,
the fermental Digeſtions of every particular
Part, by which it turneth the Nutritive juice
into its own likeneſs, as the ſaline and tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65192:60"/>
part of the Aliment into Bones, the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous
and oyly into Fat, the more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and balſamick parts (the ſaline and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous
being equally mixed) into Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
To which according to ſome may be added
the Ferment of the Reins for ſecretion of the
<hi>Serum;</hi> a Ferment of the <hi>Glandulae Renales;</hi>
and alſo in the Liver for a ſecretion of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
and ſerous Liquor through the Lymphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts.</p>
                  <p>The Ferment of the Renal Glandules is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuppoſed and conjectural; That of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
for ſeparation of the Choler, and that of
the Kidneys for ſeparating the ſerous humor
may with good reaſon be believed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural
and fictious. For when the blood is
rightly fermented and in its lax <hi>Compages,</hi> the
Liver is ſufficient without any innate ferment
to tranſcolate the Choler through its Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
Subſtance, as <hi>Malpighius de Hep.</hi> hath
Obſerved. So alſo are the Kidneys by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
of <hi>Bellinus de Ren:</hi> without any
ſpecifick ferment; yea any more then is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to the blood in its Natural <hi>Craſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chylification I conceive to be chiefly from
the Ferment of the Stomach, although other
Things concur thereto. How Chylification
is performed <hi>Diemerbroeck Anat. Corp. Hum.
Lib. 1. Cap.</hi> 6. hath excellently well deſcribed.
Which in ſhort is thus.</p>
                  <p>The Meat whilſt maſticated doth inbibe the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65192:60"/>
                     <hi>Saliva</hi> or Spittle, which not only ſoftens but
impregnates the Meat with a Fermentative
Quality (that is chiefly by the Salt therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained)
Unto which concureth the Drinks of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
endowed with acrimonious fermentative
Particles. The Stomack receiveth and by
contraction of its Fibres cloſely embraceth the
meat thus prepared, and communicateth the
fermentative juices from the Coat of the
Stomack; to which do concur the Reliques
left after former Digeſtions, which by ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Stomack like an old Leaven are
brought to an Acidity. The Acid Particles
excited by the Heat of the Stomack and adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
parts do enter the Pores of the Aliment,
and ferment with its Saline and Spirituous
Parts, until it be diſſolved and eliquated into
Milky Cream or Chyle: which by Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Stomachical fibres is ſent through
the <hi>Pylorus</hi> into the Guts, where it receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
another Ferment by the mixture of the
<hi>Bilis</hi> and <hi>Succus Pancreaticus;</hi> by which the
thinner Parts are ſeparated from the thicker
and received or rather ſqueezed by the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaltick
Motion into the Orifices of the Lacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Veſſels, but the thicker and groſs ejected
by Stool. This Precipitation and Separation
<hi>Sylvius</hi> compareth to a Solution of Vitriol in
fair Water, which by the mixture of Salt of
Tartar, preſently leteth its Sulphureous and
dreggy Parts ſubſide.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:65192:61"/>
I ſhall not then like ſome take the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chylification in the Inteſtines to be a
ſecond Digeſtion diſtinct from the former;
but rather a Perfection and Depuration of the
concocted Aliment or Chyle. Neither ſhall
I make that little alteration or rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
to Sanguification, which the Chyle
by mixture of the <hi>Lympha</hi> receiveth from the
Meſenterical Glandules and <hi>Ductus Thoracicus</hi>
before its ingreſs into the jugular Veins to be
a third Digeſtion, and diſtinct from Chylifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and Sanguification, but as a Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to the Latter with a convenient Vehicle.</p>
                  <p>The acrimonious Particles of the <hi>Saliva</hi>
ſwallowed, and the Acid Stomachical Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Reliques of Aliment of former
Digeſtions ſticking to the Coats of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
and brought to Acidity, finding no
Aliment to prey upon, do moleſt and irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Stomack; which moleſtation being
impreſt upon the Nerves of the Sixt, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> the Eighth Pair; and
by theſe communicated to the Brain, doth
excite a deſire of Eating or Hungering after
Meat, to imbibe the ferment gnawing on the
Stomack.</p>
                  <p>As for the Colour of the Chyle; or why
Mutton, Beef, Bread, Herbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eaten
together ſhould be turned into a white Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
Subſtance. Or why the Aliment ſhould
not retain its priſtine Colour, I conceive to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65192:61"/>
be as thus. The Saline and Sulphureous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
with which our uſual Aliment doth
abound, being well diſſolved and mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
do by the Acid Ferment acquire a
white Colour. Even as in making of <hi>Lac
Sulphuris,</hi> the <hi>Flos Sulphuris</hi> and Salt of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>
by boyling together turn the Water to a
dark Red, but by inſtillation of Vinegar
turneth to a white. So every Liquid impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
with a Sulphur and an Alkalizate Salt,
but more eſpecially when the Salt is volatile;
or with a Salt well implexed in, and diſſolved
with the Sulphur, by addition of an acid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
becometh white, as may be ſeen in the
making of Reſinous Extracts of Vegetables,
or by mixing ſpirit of Benjamin, ſpirit of
Harts-horn, of Soot, or ſuch like ſpirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
with volatile Salt, with an acid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
or fair Water.</p>
                  <p>The Chyle having paſſed the Stomach into
the Inteſtines, the purer part is received into
the Lacteal veſſels, (and perhaps ſome of the
more Spirituous parts into the Meſenterical
veins, by reaſon of the ſudden refection after
eating and drinking by thoſe that are through
labour and travel wearied) which convey it
to the Meſenterical or <hi>Aſellius</hi> his <hi>Pancreas;</hi>
and from thence is conveyed by the <hi>Ductus
Thoracicus</hi> into the Subclavian vein, where by
the way it is mixed with the <hi>Lympha</hi> brought
by the Lympheducts, which is not as an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65192:62"/>
Liquor, but ſerveth for a vehicle to the
Chyle, and by its ſaline Particles doth prepare
it for Sanguification.</p>
                  <p>The Chyle having once entered the <hi>ſubcla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi>
vein is mixed with the recurrent venal
blood, and by the <hi>vena cava</hi> is conveyed to
the Heart, where is chiefly made the <hi>ſecond Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion</hi>
or <hi>Sanguification.</hi> But firſt entering the
right ventricle of the Heart, from thence it
paſſeth through the <hi>Arteria Pulmonaris</hi> called
alſo <hi>vena Arterioſa</hi> into the Lungs. From
whence it is reduced to the left ventricle of
the Heart by the <hi>vena Pulmonaris</hi> or <hi>Arteria
venoſa,</hi> in the <hi>Diaſtole</hi> or laxation of the
Heart it enters the left Ventricle, but by its
Contraction or <hi>Syſtole</hi> is ſent forth into the
<hi>Aorta,</hi> and by It is carried to the whole body.
But the reſidue after Nutrition is reduced by
the veins to the right ventricle of the Heart,
from whence again it begineth its Circulation.
This is the Natural courſe in adult perſons,
but in the <hi>foetus</hi> or <hi>Embryo</hi> it is ſomething dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Embryo</hi> having not attained to Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
nor to a perfection of its Lungs, the
Blood cannot Circulate as in adult Animals.
Wherefore Nature hath provided two veſſels
in a <hi>foetus</hi> that afterward grow obſolete and
uſeleſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>foramen ovale</hi> and <hi>canalis Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terioſus.</hi>
The <hi>Foramen Ovale</hi> is placed under
the right Auricle of the Heart, and uniteth
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65192:62"/>
the <hi>vena cava</hi> to the <hi>vena Pulmonaria.</hi> The
Uſe of it is, to carry the Blood that doth
not enter the Right ventricle into the <hi>vena
Pulmonaria,</hi> that it may enter the left ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the Heart. The <hi>Canalis Arterioſus</hi> unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Arteria Pulmonaris</hi> to the great <hi>Aorta:</hi>
whoſe Uſe is, to convey the blood that hath
paſſed through the Right ventricle, and is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by the <hi>Syſtole</hi> into the great <hi>Artery,</hi> ſo
that it ſlideth by the left ventricle. By which
we may obſerve, That the blood in its Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
always entereth the Heart, but in an
<hi>Embryo</hi> paſſeth through only one ventricle.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid before that Sanguification is chiefly
performed in the Heart: for it may with
good reaſon be queſtioned, Whether the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcence
of the blood (the Accenſion, or
<hi>flamma vitalis,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> would have it) be
from the Heart, or rather from the Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its contrary Principles, and according
to others <hi>Sanguis ſanguificat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Lower cap. 2. de corde.</hi> abſolutely deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
any Ferment to be placed in the Heart.
He telleth us, The Heart oweth its Heat to
the Blood, and not the Blood to the Heart;
yea that the Blood by its heat doth actuate
and enliven our bodies, and that Nature
hath not beſtowed more heat upon the heart
than upon other Muſcles: but it hath a more
brisk and lively heat than other parts of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65192:63"/>
body, becauſe it is in a continual motion, and
ſo much ſurrounded with adjacent parts. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth its Action differ from the Action of
other Muſcles. And <hi>cap.</hi> 5. he telleth us, The
Chyle is turned into blood by the vital ſpirit
and other of its active Principles, which from
the firſt Mixture with Chyle do work upon it
until it be refined, until the ſaline ſulphureous
and ſpirituous Particles be ſet at liberty from
the feculent, and aſſociated to them of the
Blood.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> that exquiſite Searcher into the

aſſert, That the blood was generated and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65192:63"/>
moved by the heart, but the heart and blood
were originally by the Vivifick ſpirit or juice,
which remaineth in the blood after its firſt
production, and is the cauſe of its future gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
ſeeing that the Womb by its heat
doth excite the Vivifick Spirit of the Seed,
and put it in action, which frameth the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

So that the <hi>Quickening</hi> Spirit making the firſt

the Blood is generated after, and by the Heart,
and not by the Viviſick ſpirit; which (ſaith
he) inhering in all parts of the body, quickens
and diſpoſeth them to their proper functions.

                     <hi>The Learned Dr.</hi> Willis <hi>telleth us,</hi> Natura

                  <p>Variety of Opinions there are about the

of its Motion are agreed upon to be the

                     </gap> the main Query or
thing ſought after.</p>
                  <p>Some like Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> ſuppoſe the motion
of the heart to depend upon the influx of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits into the Nerves and Fibres, which
make a Contraction as in other Muſcles. Others
ſuppoſe it to depend on the Dilatation of the
Blood in the Ventricles of the Heart. Others
like <hi>Franciſcus de Le Boe Sylvius</hi> think to go
a middle way, and make it depend partly on
the Influx of Animal Spirits, and partly on
the Dilatation of the Blood. Others to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on a <hi>Materia Subtilis,</hi> that ſubtile Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſuppoſed to be in continual motion, and
to move all Bodies more or leſs, according
as it hath more free or difficult paſſage through
the Pores of them. Others ſuppoſe the heart
not to move the blood, neither the heart to
be moved by the Animal Spirits, nor by a
ſubtile Matter, but by the Vivifick Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding
in the blood, and is the cauſe of its
Generation. But <hi>Maurocordatus</hi> not approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the above-recited Opinions ſuppoſeth
the motion of the heart to depend on the
reſpiration of the Lungs, and the reſpiration
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65192:64"/>
of the Lungs to depend on the motion of the
heart; as if the Heart and Lungs did put their
help in hand to each others Motion.</p>
                  <p>To run through each Opinion apart, and
to recite the Reaſons laid down for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, would be too tedious and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my propoſed Subject. I ſhall therefore
lay down ſome Experimental Obſervations as
Mathematical <hi>Data,</hi> and ſee what Collateral
Concluſions about <hi>Sanguification</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> of
the Heart may be thence deduced.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> I took out the Hearts of two
young Puppies about a Fortnight old, and cut
off their Nerves to prevent all influx of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits, and ſeparated the Coherent
Parts. I cut open the Ventricles of one of
the Hearts, and let out all the blood therein
contained. The Hearts I expoſed to the open
Air upon a cold Trencher, which did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
beating with a regular <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtole</hi>
as long as warmth continued. When
their Motion had almoſt ceaſed I breathed
upon them, and perceived their motion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruted
by the warmth of the breath. When
their motion again began to abate, by pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on warm Water I renewed the ſame. Thus
they continued until the Natural Heat was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
expired; which was near upon Three
Quarters of an Hour after the firſt expoſing
out of the Body to the Air. The like Effect I
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65192:65"/>
found upon the Hearts of Frogs, Tortoiſes
and ſeveral young Animals. Yea I cut out
the Heart of a young Puppy and of a Frog,
and divided them into ſeveral pieces, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
a Motion in a <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole</hi> for
ſome Minutes to continue in each part thus
ſeparated; and that the pricking them with
a Needle did much excite decaying Motion.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> A Girl about Fifteen years of
age, by a Pen-knife had an Artery cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the Wriſt of her hand. With con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Applications by a Chyrurgion the
Blood was ſtoped, but in his abſence the Girl
had plucked off the <hi>Eſchar;</hi> ſo that preſently
followed a great effuſion of blood from the
Artery. At the return of the Chyrurgion,
with whom I was alſo called; I perceived that
ſhe had loſt almoſt the whole maſs of Blood
of her body. In the time of her bleeding
(which was the greateſt part of a Day) her
Friends about her had given her Sack and
Caudle to keep up her decaying ſtrength.
At our coming we found, That which the
Artery ſent forth did more reſemble the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
then Blood (and ſo it had been for ſome
hours by the relation of her Attendants) for
it was ſo pale and watery, that it would not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting
a Handcherchief red. Her Pulſe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
had ſmall remiſſion. I admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered
to her Cordials with Spirits to buoy up
declining Nature; but before the Chyrurgion
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65192:65"/>
ſtoped the Blood, ſhe died: which was about
One Quarter of an Hour after our arriving
thither.</p>
                  <p>To this I may adjoyn a like obſervation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by Dr. <hi>Lower, de Cord. motu, cap.</hi> 2. the
Sum is thus. <q>A Youth about ſixteen years
old bled for two days without intermiſſion
or ceaſing. [The occaſion of it is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.]
His attendants and friends gave him
broth to refreſh and recruit his Vitals, which
he eagerly ſupped down. His flux of blood
now and then thereby increaſed, but at
length the whole Maſs was almoſt evacuated.
That which run out was pale and watery, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Colour nor Nature of blood, but
was more like the Broth adminiſtred, which
he drank much of. The flux ſo continued
for a day or two, but the Heart in the mean
time retained its Pulſation. At laſt the flux
was ſtoped, the Party recovered his health,
and became a ſtout ſtrong fellow.</q> This he
relateth from a Phyſitian of Credit.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> in the forecited
Chapter giveth us an Experiment of his own.
He <q>drew out of the jugular vein of a Dog
about half of his blood, injecting the like
quantity of Ale and Wine mixed into his
Crural vein. This he continued by turns
until a paler tincture inſtead of the blood iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
out of the vein, like water wherein
fleſh hath been waſhed, or like Claret diluted
with much water.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:65192:66"/>
4. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> I ſhall in the next place lay
down the Obſervation of Dr. <hi>Harvey, de gen.
Anim. Exerc.</hi> 16. The <hi>Bulla</hi> or <hi>Punctum ſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi>
(which ſaith he maketh the Heart) is made
before the Brain, that elaborateth the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirits. The ſame alſo doth <hi>Langly Obſ.
gen. Anim.</hi> affirm, and common Experience
teacheth it. So that although it be queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Whether or no the Blood be formed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Heart, yet it is certain that the <hi>Bulla
ſaliens</hi> is formed before the Brain.</p>
                  <p>From which Experimental Obſervations I
ſhall gather theſe Concluſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> the motion of the Heart <hi>in fieri</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

of the Heart, for according to the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
and <hi>third Obſervations,</hi> That which came
from the Arteries was far enough from Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion,
being pale and dilute like broth, and
(as Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> intimateth) was far from the
colour and nature of Blood. From the two
Obſervations before cited from Dr. <hi>Lower,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Gibſon,</hi> in the <hi>Anat. Hum. Bod. Epitom. l. 2.
c.</hi> 5. concludeth a full confutation of that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65192:66"/>
Opinion, <hi>viz. Pulſation is from Ebullition and
Accenſion of Blood in the ventricles of the Heart.</hi>
Which may be farther denied by the <hi>first
Obſervation,</hi> for the blood was all poured out
of the ventricles of the Puppie's heart, ſo that
there was none left to make either Ebullition
or Accenſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Neither could the Pulſe be from a
continued influx of Animal ſpirits from the
Brain. For according to the firſt Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
All influx of Spirits was ſtoped; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Puppie's and Frog's Hearts were cut
off from their Nerves, by which the ſpirits
do flow, if any at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Neither can it be from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
of the Lungs; for by the <hi>firſt Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
the Hearts of them Animals cut off
from the Lungs, much more the pieces, did
yet continue Beating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And in an <hi>Embryo</hi>
there is Pulſation of the <hi>Bulla ſaliens</hi> before
the Lungs are formed, and long before they
have any Reſpiration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Neither from the impreſſion of
Subtile Matter, for that concludeth for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
but not a particular motion; nor why
the Heart ſhould keep a Regular <hi>Syſtole</hi> and
<hi>Diaſtole.</hi> Becauſe the ſubtile Matter being in
continual motion, would preſs againſt all the
fibres at all times; ſo that the Heart would
remain either in a <hi>Syſtole,</hi> or a <hi>Diaſtole.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
as <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> argueth, This ſubtile
Matter would reſtore the motion of the heart
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65192:67"/>
whiſt warm, and ſo always recover life in
creatures that are ſtrangled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Neither can it be from the vivifick
ſpirit in the blood; for by the <hi>firſt Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
The Pulſe continued after the blood was
poured out of the ventricles, and a ſtop put
to all influx of freſh blood. And by <hi>Obſerv. 2.
and</hi> 3. its proved, That when the whole maſs
of blood was almoſt emptied, and the reſt
watery and dilute, the heart retained its Pulſe;
yet the vivifick ſpirit of the blood muſt have
been for the greateſt part evacuated with the
blood.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now proceed to lay down, what I
gueſs to be the genuine cauſe of <hi>Sanguification</hi>
and <hi>Motion</hi> of the Heart, although this may
be accounted one of Nature's Secrets, and too
abſtruſe for Us peremptorily to determine.
And <hi>firſt</hi> for Sanguification.</p>
                  <p>In the begining of Conception, the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
part of the Seed by heat is excited and
collected into the <hi>Punctum</hi> or <hi>Bulla ſaliens</hi>
from this Spirit as from a Fermentative ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
by the <hi>vis Plaſtica</hi> or <hi>Archeus</hi> are all
the Parts of the body deduced. For according
to Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi>'s Obſervation, the <hi>Bulla ſaliens</hi>
is firſt formed, from which are derived San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guincous
fibres, and one part after another
framed, until the whole <hi>Compages</hi> of the Body
is perfected. Whether according to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65192:67"/>
of Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> the blood be firſt
made, and the Heart afterwards for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Blood, or, according to <hi>Diemer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broeck,</hi>
the Heart be made before the firſt
Blood, it is not very material. For on both
ſides it is concluded, That the <hi>vivifick spirit</hi>
of the <hi>Semen</hi> is the firſt Former either of
Blood or Heart. This <hi>Spirit</hi> having got ſome
Blood for his Vehicle, and being by Heat
ſtirred up and dilated, doth enlarge its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micile
the <hi>Punctum ſaliens;</hi> for being too
cloſe pent up doth endeavour for an eruption
by particular aſſaults, which is the firſt cauſe
of Pulſation. As the Ferment is increaſed by
the addition of new Matter from the <hi>Colliqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum
Seminis</hi> at firſt, and other Matter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards;
ſo the vivifick Spirit doth farther
dilate it ſelf in the blood, uutil it hath formed
the Veins and Arteries for its Channels, and
as a Workman, according to the Divine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
ſtamped at firſt by God Almighty on
blind Matter, or by the Direction of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,</hi>
(as <hi>Helmont</hi> calls it, but as for the Name
of that Directive Power call it as you pleaſe)
hath made every part of the whole Body.
This vivifick acrimonious Spirit doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forme out of convenient Matter, but alſo
inhere in the Parts formed, more or leſs, and
giveth to every Part a peculiar Property or
<hi>Ferment,</hi> as That of the Stomach for <hi>Chylifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
That of the Heart for <hi>Sanguification, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:65192:68"/>
But ſuppoſe that the firſt blood ſhould be
formed before the <hi>Punctum Saliens,</hi> and the
Heart contribute nothing thereto. Yet it
muſt be granted that Things proceed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in Adult Animals, then they do at the
firſt formation. As for Inſtance; There is
Motion before the Brain or Nerves are form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet none now deny that Office to the
Brain of elaborating the Animal Spirits that
ſerve for Motion. The <hi>Embryo</hi> is nouriſhed
and encreaſed before the Stomach and other
parts ſerving for Concoction are made; yet
after they are made in a perfect <hi>Foetus</hi> and in
adult Perſons, none except through a Spirit
of Contradiction will deny them to ſerve for
Concoction; ſo that the Heart by his Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
Spirit implanted therein may ſerve
for <hi>Sanguification,</hi> which I imagine to be as
thus.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as the Chyle is mixed with the
Blood, the Vital Spirit and other active Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
do work upon the Chyle to aſſimilate it
to its own nature. By the Stomachical Ferment
the <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Chyle are
almoſt ſet at liberty from the groſſer parts
of the Aliment; ſo that the Active Principles
of the Blood ſoon add to their Exaltation.
When the Chyle with the Venal blood is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the right ventricle of the Heart, the
Heart addeth a new Ferment thereto, and
ſendeth it into the Lungs, where it receiveth a
farther Alteration from the Nitrous Particles
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65192:68"/>
of the Air admited by Inſpiration, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
there mixed with its <hi>Compages,</hi> where
the blood alſo receiveth from the Air its flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Colour: As may be ſeen by ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
of Dr <hi>Lower's,</hi> and alſo by expoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Venal blood to the open Air, for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
part next the air will be of a florid
Red, but the under part of a Blackiſh colour.
Let the blackiſh part be turned to the air,
and its <hi>ſuperficies</hi> will be of a light red<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the
left ventricle of the heart it receiveth a more
perfect mixture, and entereth the <hi>Aorta</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the form of Blood, and is of a Scarlet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
until the air is tranſpired through the
pores of the skin. But Chyle is not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and exactly aſſimilated to the blood, until
it hath run through many Circulations.</p>
                  <p>The moſt ſubtile and acrimonious part of
the vivifick ſpirit planted in the heart from
its original giveth its Ferment, by which the
humors receive an Efferveſcence and Dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(if capable thereof) and more or leſs as
they are inclinable thereto. Even as Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder
that of it ſelf hath no heat, but by
fire doth ſoon dilate and hath a great efferve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence:
So doth the blood by the ferment of
the heart, and by the dilatation of the blood
the ſides of the ventricles of the heart are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted,
and the fibres of the heart are irritated
and provoked to expel the oppreſſing blood.
After the expulſion the Heart remains in its
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65192:69"/>
                     <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> until by a ſupply of freſh blood there
is a new Dilatation and then a <hi>Syſtole.</hi> But
to a <hi>Systole,</hi> beſides the vivifick Spirit inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in the Heart, the Animal ſpirits as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Muſcular motion are called in to help,
ſuppoſing a free paſſage; for elſe what mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſo many Nerves derived to the Heart.</p>
                  <p>The Hearts of Puppies, Frogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cut
from their bodies, and the ventricles emptied
from blood, will keep (as long as natural
warmth) their Pulſation. Becauſe the vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
acrimonious ſpirit placed in the Heart,
by heat is ſet on work to ferment and dilate
the blood contained in the Pores and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
of the fleſhy ſubſtance of the Heart, and
by irritation of the fibres is made a <hi>Syſtole</hi> and
then a <hi>Diastole</hi> until the blood contained in
the Pores do ſuffer a new Dilatation; to
which both vital and Animal ſpirits as yet
unſpent, that will make a tremulous motion
for ſome time after the death of an Animal, do
concur.</p>
                  <p>The Third principal Fermental <hi>Digeſtion</hi>
is That of the Brain, which is well appointed
with blood-veſſels, that ſerve as Channels to
convey Matter to every part of the <hi>Cerebrum</hi>
and <hi>Cerebellum.</hi> Nature hath ſo provided for
a ſupply of Matter, That as Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> hath
obſerved, <hi>Non modò arterias cum venis, verùm
quod rarius &amp; ferè ſingulare eſt, arterias cum
arteriis; nempe arterias Carotides unius lateris
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65192:69"/>

blood thus conveyed by the Carotidal and
Vertebral arteries, the purer and more ſubtile
Spirituous part is carried into the Brain by
the winding Meanders of the Arteries, whilſt
the Groſſer part is abſorbed and carried back
by the Veins, and the <hi>Serum</hi> imbibed by the
Glandules and Lympheducts, in order to be
reſtored to a freſh Circulation. The manner
how the Animal ſpirits are produced Dr.

As in making highly rectified ſpirit of Wine

the moſt Subtile ſpirit (as it were diſtilled)
can paſs through the Cortical ſubſtance of the
Brain. This Liquor thus diſtilled doth obtain
a higher degree of perfection, becauſe the
Brain abounding with a volatile Salt doth
much exalt theſe diſtilled Spirits; ſo that they
are as it were endowed with a Ferment, and
by their volatile Salt penetrate like Spirit of
Harts horn, more than Spirit of Wine.</p>

ſo the Nervous Juice is as an Active Form in

for this Opinion; for in a <hi>Palſie,</hi> wherein the

it ſeems irrational; that the ſame juice ſhould
be carried to and fro through the ſame veſſels,
and that an Acid juice (for ſuch is that of the
Spleen) ſhould be ſuppoſed to be a vehicle
for the Animal Spirits that are a volatile <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali.</hi>
The proper Uſe then I imagine as thus.</p>
                  <p>The Spleen by its Ferment placed therein
<hi>ab origine,</hi> doth with the Nervous juice depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited

even as by mixture with other <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalis</hi>

reduced from the Spleen by the <hi>Ramus spleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>

                  <p>An Acid Ferment may well be ſuppoſed in
the Spleen from its natural ſtructure; which
is chiefly made up of membranous Cells like
the holes of a Hony-comb, about which the
ends of the blood-veſſels are twiſted like the
Tendrils of a Vine. Now here the Glandules,
as in other parts of the body, may be well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to contain an Acid juice, and may the

                  <p>It is beyond my intention to take upon me

But this we may lay down as a Truth, <hi>viz.</hi>
That the <hi>Archeus</hi> in the firſt formation hath

                  <p>AS from the fermental <hi>Digeſtions</hi> in their
full vigour and luſtre the Organs have
that which is requiſite to their functions, and
conſequently Health is entire; ſo from their
diminution and depravation Diſtempers take
their Original. The Concoction of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and other fermental Digeſtions of the
body may ſuffer by the inordinate Uſe of the
<hi>Sex Non-naturalia;</hi> but I ſhall take a ſhort
ſurvey of Diſeaſes as they are immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the diſordered Ferments.</p>
                  <p>The Stomachical Ferment may be vitiated,
ſo as to leave a twofold Errour on the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>viz. Crudity</hi> and <hi>Over-acidity,</hi> which
concur to laying the foundation of many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.
In this ſenſe I mean, <hi>viz.</hi> That All
Diſeaſes cannot be immediately derived from
This, or the Other particular ferment, but
that the Generality of Diſtempers owe their
original to the Error of Fermental Digeſtions,
the one many times concurring as a Procatar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
and another as a Proximate cauſe.</p>
                  <p>When the Stomachical ferment is debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
the Aliment receives an imperfect
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65192:72"/>
Concoction; whence a <hi>flatus</hi> is excited and a
Pain in the Stomach, with an inclination to
vomiting and abhorrence of Dyet. If it paſs
thus crude through the <hi>Pylorus</hi> into the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,
it lays a foundation of a <hi>Diarrhoea,
Worms, Obstruction</hi> of the <hi>Miſentery,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>An Error in the firſt Concoction cannot be
corrected in the ſecond; wherefore the crude
Alimentary juice being conveyed through
the Lacteal and Thoracical veſſels, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
to the Heart, doth cauſe a ſpurious and
febrile conflict with the Principles of Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
and according to the quantity of
the depraved Aliment, that in 24 or 48 hours
<hi>&amp;c</hi> doth riſe <hi>ad turgeſcentiam,</hi> and able to
vie (as it were) with the blood, ſo it giveth
the difference betwixt Quotidian, Tertian, or
Quartan Agues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ſeveral modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have obſerved. And as it is a cauſe of
Intermittent, ſo alſo it layeth a foundation of
Continual fevers, according as the Principles
of the blood by this depraved Ferment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
too much exalted. For if the Spirituous
part be highly inflamed, then a <hi>febris Synochus</hi>
or <hi>Ephemera;</hi> if the Sulphureous part be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted,
or a Putrefaction of Humors in the
blood-veſſels, then a Putrid fever; if a conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<hi>Miaſma</hi> be added, then a Malignant fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
ſuch as the Plague, ſmall Pox, Meaſles,
But whether this vitiated Juice be made ſo
by the vitiated <hi>Bilis</hi> and <hi>Lympha,</hi> as <hi>Sylvius de
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65192:73"/>
le boe</hi> would have it, is not to my purpoſe to
diſpute.</p>
                  <p>If the vitiated <hi>Succus Nutritius</hi> arrive to
the Brain, and by Obſtruction of the Pores
hindereth the Third Digeſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> the ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borating
of Animal Spirits, or ſtop their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or ſubvert the volatizing Ferment of
the Brain, it cauſeth an <hi>Apoplexie, Lethargy,
Coma,</hi> or <hi>Carus.</hi> And according as the Nerves
are obſtructed, and the Spirits with their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle
the <hi>ſuccus Nervoſus</hi> defiled and ſtoped in
their paſſage, thence a <hi>Palſie</hi> great or leſs.
And as the vitiated juice hath paſſed the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
ſubſtance of the Brain, and is confuſed
with the Animal ſpirits, ſo as to cauſe an irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Nerves and exploſion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal

                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe Diſtempers the depraved Ferment
of the Spleen doth contribute; for when the
bilious Particles are not evacuated, but by
long fermentation become retorrid and groſs,
then the Melancholy aduſt terreſtrious blood
ſubverteth the refined Texture of the Animal
ſpirits, and bringeth on them a mighty gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineſs,
whence <hi>Melancholy Phancies;</hi> and as
it impreſſeth its <hi>labes</hi> on the Spirits and <hi>Genus
Nervoſum,</hi> ſo it concurreth to <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi>
Fits, and many Nervous diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Every part in the body receiving a <hi>Succus
Nutritius</hi> from the blood is deprived of its
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65192:73"/>
due nouriſhment, when the fermental Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are deficient, and the Aliment unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
inſtead then of aſſimilating the <hi>ſuccus

doth inſtead of aſſimilation cauſe <hi>Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humations,

                  <p>As the too much debilitated, ſo alſo the too
great or over-acidity of the Stomachical fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will be as a Ground-work for many
Enormities. A proportionate Acidity (as I
intimated before) is a cauſe of Digeſtion; ſo
too great, and eſpecially when alienated from
its natural <hi>Craſis,</hi> is a cauſe of Coagulation,
Precipitation, and Fixation, and conſequently
of Indigeſtion. Beſides the <hi>Appetitus Caninus</hi>

as of <hi>Sampier, Cucumbers,</hi> &amp;c. whoſe Pores
are filled with the points of the acid Particles

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65192:74"/>
neither are the fermentative particles of the
Stomachical Digeſtion admited to enter, and
raiſe a luctation with the active principles of
the Aliment, whoſe parts are as it were linked

that the Stomachical ferment cannot tear

                  <p>Not only the debilitated (as I ſaid before)

Fluidity to its <hi>Compages,</hi> and from thence

the <hi>Dropſie,</hi> and not as <hi>Sennertus,</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the footſteps of ancient Phyſitians, laying
it upon an ill Conſtitution of the Liver, would
have it. For on all hands it being allowed to
be from a Non-ſeparation or an Abundance of
Serous Humors retained in the body, want of a
due Ferment (to the deſtroying of which an
exorbitant Acidity will in no ſmall meaſure
concur) as well as an Obſtruction in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
or <hi>viſcera,</hi> may much contribute thereto.
For when the Saline and Sulphureous particles
are deficient in their due ſtate and proportion,
either by want of Aliment, or by conſuming
Chronical Diſeaſes, or by a depraved Stoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical
Ferment communicating it ſelf to the
Alimentary juice received into the blood, or
by want of a due acceſs of Air, or by a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of heterogeneous things with the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
then the blood becomes too much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Crocus Martis aperitivus cum ſulphure</hi> is
made by applying a Butt of Brimſtone to a
hot Bar of Iron, or by calcining the Filings of
Iron with Sulphur in an earthen pot or Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible.
In either way the Acids of Sulphur do
penetrate the body of <hi>Mars,</hi> ſo as in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to carry off much of the ſulphureous
parts of Iron, but by the addition of the acid
parts of Sulphur to much increaſe the Saline.
Some of the Sulphureous do yet remain, is
apparent by the ſetid ſavour in Belchings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the taking of this <hi>Crocus.</hi> That the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
part is increaſed, is clear; becauſe the
Weight of the Iron will be increaſed by the
Preparation. For Sixteen ounces of good
Iron, by weighing after the Operation is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65192:80"/>
ended, will yield Eighteen or Nineteen (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Calcination be vehement, which is
needleſs) of <hi>Crocus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is an excellent Preparation, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
good effects upon a twofold account,
<hi>viz.</hi> 1. becauſe of its <hi>Sulphur,</hi> 2. its <hi>Salt.</hi>
The Sulphur will enrich and add a new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to a cold watery blood, ſo that in the <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris
alba, Pica,</hi> and <hi>Leucophlegmatia,</hi> it will
reduce the pale-faced Patient to a florid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion;
becauſe of its Salt it is a good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oppilative,
as in Uterine obſtructions and
thoſe maladies peculiar to the Female ſex,
and in the <hi>Dropſie</hi> may be of good uſe becauſe
of its vitriolick Stipticity, that bindeth up
the laxity of veſsels and other parts.</p>
                  <p>In the making of <hi>Crocus Martis cum aceto,</hi>
the Sulphureous parts are almoſt ſeparated,
inſomuch that after it is ſwallowed down it
yieldeth but a weak ſulphureous ſavour. But
by addition of the Acid parts of Vinegar, the
Saline Principle of <hi>Mars</hi> is ſo much exalted
and advanced ſo near an Acid; that by inſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of other Acids it will ſcarce make any
efferveſcence or ebullition at all, yea weaker
than <hi>Crocus cum Sulphure,</hi> that maketh a far
leſs ebullition with <hi>Acids</hi> than plain <hi>filings</hi> of
<hi>Iron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Crocus</hi> in the Preparation having loſt
much of its Sulphur, is unfit for uſe when the
blood is too low, or depauperated in its Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65192:80"/>
Sulphur; as in diſeaſes proceeding
from a wateriſh blood, or from phlegmatick
Obſtructions. But where the blood is retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
or aduſt, this <hi>Crocus cum Aceto</hi> by its Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Principle being cool and aperient is of
good uſe, as in <hi>Hypochondriacal</hi> diſtempers,
<hi>Carbuncled</hi> faces, and to aſtringe a laxed blood-veſſel,
becauſe of the ſaline ſtiptick Principle
implexed in the Terreſtrious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Crocus Martis cum Aqua</hi> is made by expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Plates</hi> or <hi>Filings</hi> of Iron to the <hi>Rain</hi> or
<hi>Dew,</hi> until it hath contracted a Ruſt, which
collected is called <hi>Crocus Martis cum Aqua,</hi> or
<hi>ferri Rubigo.</hi> This <hi>Crocus</hi> conſiſteth of the
ſulphureous, ſaline, and terreſtrious parts
combined together; yea indeed it is the very
ſubſtance of Iron, having its pores much open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Diſſolvent or Saline parts of <hi>Water;</hi>
which not only maketh its Pores more open,
but by combining with it maketh this <hi>Crocus</hi>
an excellent Aperient medicine, whoſe Deop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilative
vertue chiefly dependeth on this
Salt.</p>
                  <p>The Sulphur of Iron being retained in this
Preparation renders it a fit ferment for blood,
whoſe active Principles are weak and faint:
And the Saline part (being exalted by That
of the Diſsolvent <hi>Water</hi> that much laxeth the
body of <hi>Mars</hi>) renders it a good Aperient in
Obſtructions, as of the Liver, Spleen, Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
Lacteal veſsel, or Womb with its cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:65192:81"/>
Crude <hi>filings of Iron</hi> taken inwardly may be
diſſolved by the Acid ſtomachical Ferment,
as by extraneous Acid Menſtruums, which
may be concluded from the fetid ſtrong ſcent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Smell, and the blackneſs of their Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that take it unprepared. But then it
muſt be a ſtrong robuſt Conſtitution, able to
bear the Iron in its ſolid ſubſtance; but in
Conſtitutions where the acid ſtomachical fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is weak, there is danger, leſt that the
<hi>Filings</hi> ſhould remain undiſsolved and cauſe
Obſtructions, or elſe grating on the Tunicles
of the Inteſtines cauſe wracking Torments.
Beſides, the Sulphureous part of <hi>filings</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi>
unprepared will more increaſe the Ferment of
the Blood than the Saline ſtiptick can repreſs;
which maketh it unfit for Uſe in hot Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
or in Diſtempers proceeding from
a wracking fiery Blood. And if the Filings of
<hi>Iron</hi> be of ſo hard a Diſsolution, much more
theſe of <hi>Steel</hi> whoſe ſubſtance is more faſt and
compact, and pores more cloſed, that its
Diſsolution muſt be more difficult.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Crocus Martis aſtringens</hi> is made by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cining
of <hi>Filings</hi> or <hi>Plates</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> in a ſtrong
fire, which carrieth away the ſaline and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous
parts that made it an Aperient me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.
Some waſh the Iron, in order to the
Preparation, with fair Water or Vinegar;
which not only with frequent Waſhings may
carry away much of the droſsy impurities,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65192:81"/>
but alſo take away or at leaſt deſtroy much
of its volatile Salt and ſoluble Parts, that
muſt afterwards by the violence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ire have
been conſumed or elſe diſpoſed for a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The terreſtrious part of the Iron being
deprived of the active Principles (for by a
ſtrong Calcination thoſe few that remain are
become fixed) it imbibeth the ſaline igneous
Particles, which remain fixed therein. And
being much deprived of its Salt that renders
it a Deoppilative, it is become a proper
Aſtringent to be uſed in a <hi>Diarrhoea, Breaking
of a vein, Flux of Haemorrhoids, immoderate
Lunar evacuation in women,</hi> &amp;c. for beſides
the Aſtringency it is endowed with, it will
imbibe much of the exorbitant Acidity of
our bodies, ſeeing it is deprived much of its
Saline principle.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Tinctura Martis,</hi> made with <hi>Rust</hi> or <hi>Fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

beſides the diſſolved <hi>Mars,</hi> the Tartar is alſo
a great Aſſiſtant, eſpecially in diſeaſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from an acid Humor. Whence it
may be of good effect in a <hi>Cach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Honey, juice of the White-wine Grapes
throughly brought to maturity, and the juice
of Lemons, hath its aperient faculty not only
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65192:82"/>
from the Iron, but alſo from the ſaline part
of the Menſtruum. Now this Menſtruum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not very corroſive, doth diſſolve only the
ſaline and ſoluble parts of <hi>Mars,</hi> but leaveth
the groſs and terreſtrious parts behind. So
that the ſaline parts of Iron impregnated with
the Eſſential ſalts of the Menſtruum, maketh
it a good Opener of Obſtructions, ſuch as
thoſe of the Liver, Spleen, Meſentery, or of
the other <hi>viſcera</hi> of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi>

Flowers, which being diſſolved in water
will with oyl of <hi>Tartar</hi> or ſpirit of Salt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack
be precipitated in form of a Powder
called <hi>Mars Diaphoreticus;</hi> which taketh its
Sudoriſick quality from the volatile penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
parts of Salt Armoniack, carried with and
fixed in the Chalybeat particles in Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Theſe volatile Salts will ſoon open the
Pores of our bodies, eſpecially ſeeing they
carry with them Chalybeat Particles all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to cut tough viſcous humors obſtructing
the Pores or Paſsages.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Vitriolum</hi> or <hi>Sal Martis</hi> is made from
the parts of Iron diſsolved in an Acid Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum,
ſuch as oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> oyl of <hi>Sulphur,
Aqua fortis,</hi> &amp;c. but moſt commonly with
oyl of ſpirit of Vitriol, which giveth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
to the Compoſition: yet if we
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65192:82"/>
look into the nature of the thing, we may form
a like Compoſition of other Acids, with oyl
of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> ſpirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> &amp;c. as well as with
oyl or ſpirit of Vitriol, only changing the
name into <hi>Mars ſulphuratus</hi> or <hi>Sal Martis cum
Sulphure, cum Nitro,</hi> &amp;c. In the making of
<hi>Sal Martis</hi> with oyl of Vitriol, and Iron either
filed or in its groſs ſubſtance, ſome Chymiſts
will add an equal weight of ſpirit of Wine to
the oyl of Vitriol, or elſe two pounds of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Water to one pound of good ſpirit of
Vitriol. The reaſon of it is, becauſe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Wine by its Alkalizate Salt, or elſe the
Water may dilute and weaken the oyl or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of vitriol, that it may not incorporate
with the main body of <hi>Mars,</hi> but with the
ſaline and more ſoluble parts; that there may
be gained a more pure Salt, freed from moſt
of the ſulphureous and terreſtrious parts of
Iron. In the Diſsolution the ſaline parts of
the Menſtruum do joyn with theſe of <hi>Mars,</hi>
and in the mutual conflict of Fermentation
they take off and dull the edges of each other,
and by combining together become a Neutral
Salt.</p>
                  <p>In this Preparation the ſulphureous and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrious
parts of Iron are ſeparated from the

from ſuch a Dyſcraſie of the Blood it
may be of excellent uſe.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Ilmington water</hi> (as I have proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Salt preying upon a <hi>Minera</hi> of Iron, which by
working upon and combining with each other
do become a <hi>vitriolum Martis.</hi> I ſhall then

to our Country in reſpect of its Medicinal
vertue, and then lay down ſome <hi>Cautions</hi>
and <hi>Rules</hi> to be obſerved by the Drinkers of
this Chalybeat Water.</p>
                  <p>After a ſhort Account in the foregoing Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Diſeaſes, how they may be derived
from the Depraved digeſtions of our body; I
ſhall now conſider, how far this <hi>Ilmington
Spring</hi> will conduce to the Reſtoration of the
<hi>loſt</hi> or <hi>vit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:65192:83"/>
                     <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> being cauſed by a Dyſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
of the blood, either when its ſaline or
ſulphureous parts are too predominant, may
be much corrected or curbed by this Chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat
Spring: In as much as the Mineral Salt
is herein become near a plain <hi>Alkali,</hi> and will
penetrate to the <hi>ſecond Digeſtion,</hi> is able to
correct the ſowr ſaltiſh Blood. And being
freed from the ſulphureous parts of Iron, will
much correct the ſulphureo-ſaline Dycraſie,
when the blood like Wine is become over-fermented
or fretted. This <hi>Spring</hi> being a
great <hi>Diuretick,</hi> will help to carry off that
which is ſuperfluous, and being a good Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient
in obſtructions of the Spleen may correct
its vitiated acid Ferment, that with other
Enormities may concur to alter the ſweet
balſamick temper of the Blood.</p>
                  <p>But conſidering that a Crude Digeſtion or
ſpurious Acid Ferment of the Stomach doth
many times as a Procatartick Cauſe lay a
foundation of the Scorbutick Ferment; this
Water muſt be aſſiſted with Purgatives to
carry off the recremental <hi>Sordes</hi> of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and other Digeſtions, (more eſpecially
for Cautions hereafter laid down,) and be
alſo aſſiſted with ſome peculiar Medicine to
reſtore the blood to its ſweet and well-poiſed
Temparament, according to the Cauſe from
whence the <hi>Dyſcraſie</hi> took its Original: which
requireth the Advice of a skilful Phyſician.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:65192:84"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Spleen by a Specifick Ferment
conduceth to a Secretion of <hi>Bilis,</hi> but if by
Obſtruction or Depravation it be deficient in
its fermental Operation, the blood not purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from its <hi>ſordes</hi> doth become obſcure and
muddy, ſo that the Animal Spirits thence ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated
are neither pure nor refined, but
dark and gloomy fit for melancholy Phanſies.
From a long ſupply of ſuch feculent blood are
the Spirits ſpoiled, and Hypochondriacal
Fitts and Melancholy take their growth.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Spaw-water,</hi> containing a <hi>vitriolum
Martis,</hi> is a good Deoppilative in Splenical
obſtructions, for being of a penetrating na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is good for theſe abſtruſe Receſſes. By
the Reaction and Combination of the acid
ſalt of the Menſtruum with the Alkalizate of
<hi>Mars</hi> is made a <hi>Neutral Salt,</hi> but moſt inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to an Alkali, Whence it may be of good
uſe to correct the ſpurious acid Ferment of
the Spleen but now communicated to the
blood.</p>
                  <p>By reſtoring the Spleen to his natural Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in deſtroying that ſpurious Acidity, by
opening Obſtructions, and its Diuretick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
carrying off many of the feculent parts,
the blood may be freed from the opace Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
ſteams that defile the Brain, the
workhouſe of Imagination and Judgment, and
ſo be reſtored to its natural <hi>Craſis.</hi> But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
obſerve, That this Water muſt be helped
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65192:84"/>
with Purgatives to cleanſe the blood from its
<hi>faeces,</hi> leſt that inſtead of being an Aperient it
ſhould prove to be an Obſtructer, eſpecially
in the Extremities of the ſmall Capillary veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
where the Blood in its Circulation is
hindred by a viſcous dreggy Matter; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Catharticks, where other Digeſtions are
deficient in their office, <hi>Specificks</hi> muſt alſo be
applied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the <hi>Dropſie</hi> conſiſteth in a dilute
watery blood, or rather in a Non-ſeparation
of <hi>Serum</hi> or Urinous <hi>Latex</hi> that regurgitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
into the blood-veſſels, until it be laid
down in the Habit of the body, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with a <hi>flatus.</hi> The loſs of ſecretion of
this <hi>Latex</hi> is frequently from the want of a
Ferment in the bood, which chiefly depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on the Saline Principle as the main cauſe
of laxing the <hi>Compages</hi> of the blood for the
ſeparation of Serous Humors. Beſides the
loſs of a Ferment, Obſtructions in the Urinous
veſſels and Lympheducts many times do lay a
foundation to the ſtructure of a <hi>Dropſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ilmington-Spaw</hi> may be uſeful in this caſe
upon a threefold Account. 1. Although <hi>ſal
Chalybis</hi> be freed from the ſulphureous parts
of that Mineral, and conſequently is not (as I
ſaid before) proper by it ſelf in <hi>Cachexies</hi> and
cold Phlegmatick Diſtempers; yet it doth
mightily take off the ſpurious Acidity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65192:85"/>
laxeth the too ſtrict <hi>compages</hi> of the blood.
And this Salt coming nigh to an Alkali is a
great Diuretick, fit to carry off the ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
Matter. 2. The ſaline Particles
with their Edges will cut the viſcous Matter
obſtructing the veſſels, which many times put
a ſtop <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o the <hi>Latex</hi> in its proper Paſſages.
3. It being a Stiptick Medicine may be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
to reſtore the debilitated Membranous
parts too much laxed by the ſtagnating water.
All which Properties do exactly correſpond
with the Indications of Cure of the <hi>Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</hi>
Yet we muſt neceſsarily allow <hi>Specificks</hi>
and other Medicines <hi>intermixtim</hi> applied, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the Patient is this or the other way
inclined.</p>
                  <p>But withal take notice, That what is here
ſpoken muſt be underſtood of a <hi>Dropſie</hi> in its
firſt growth; for otherwiſe the gulping down
of three or four Quarts of Water will help to
ſwell up the debilitated parts, and add a great
Oppreſſion to decaying Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> from <hi>Gravel-stones</hi> in the Reins
and Bladder, and alſo the <hi>Strangury</hi> and <hi>Dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury</hi>
we may be relieved by drinking of this
<hi>Spaw-water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> in as much as it will deſtroy that
exorbitant Acid combining with the Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
recrements into <hi>Gravel-ſtones</hi> in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinary
Paſsage, and alſo as a Subalkalizate
take off that acrimonious Humor which cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a ſharp fretting Urine. Beſides taking off
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65192:85"/>
that ſharp Humor, that giveth increaſe to
theſe ſtony Concretions and fretting Urine,
it being drank in a large quantity, and a great
Diuretick, it will keep the Current open and
lax the Urinary veſſels, ſo as to carry off much
of the feculent Matter, and like a Brook with
a Current-ſtream take with it ſome ſandy
Concretions, which in our Bodies we call
Sliping of a Stone.</p>
                  <p>Whether or not a <hi>Calculus</hi> may be diſſolved
whilſt in the Kidneys or Bladder, is not to my
purpoſe here to enquire; for I look upon it
to be beyond the vertue not only of This, but
of all other Chalybeat Waters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> the <hi>Jaundice</hi> proceeding not only
from an Obſtruction of the Hepatick veſſels
by tough viſcous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>umors, Scirrous Tumors,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but alſo by the Saline and Sulphureous
or Bilious parts of the blood, too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
and indiſpoſed for a Separation, but
diſperſed over the whole body. As it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
frequently after immoderate drinking of
Wine or ſtrong Liquors, that too highly fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Blood; ſo that the acrious particles
remain unſeparated, and ſhew themſelves by
a yellow Tincture of the skin.</p>
                  <p>For the Cure of the <hi>Jaundice</hi> we may have
recourſe to this <hi>Spaw,</hi> and that upon account
of anſwering theſe two Indications. 1. It o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
Obſtructions derived from impediments
in the ſecond Digeſtion, and ſo may reduce
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65192:86"/>
the Choledochal veſſels to their proper functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
2. The <hi>Vitrlolum Martis</hi> in this Water
by its Stiptick Vitriolick Salt will take off
theſe high flown acrious Particles that make
too ſtrong a Ferment, and whirl about theſe
aduſt Cholerick parts, which by a due fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and lax <hi>compages</hi> of the blood ſhould
have been thence ſeparated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> the Lunar Evacuation of Blood in
the female Sex is checked in its natural courſe
by Obſtructions in the Uterine Sanguinary
veſſels by viſcous tough Humors, Tumors,
or when their Orifices are cloſed by Cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The blood ſtopped in this Critical Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doth regurgitate by the veins up again
into the body; from whence follows a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation
of the vital Ferment, and thence
frequently a Crudity of Humors cauſing the
<hi>Green-ſickneſs, Cachexie,</hi> &amp;c. And if by ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
in the veſſels the blood hath acquired
a virulent acrimony, ſo as to oppreſs the vital
Spirits, then <hi>Syncopes, Faintings,</hi> &amp;c. but if it
reach the Animal Spirits, then <hi>Epilepſies,</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterical
Fits, and ſuch like Diſeaſes will make
their Aſſault.</p>
                  <p>In Diſeaſes thus proceeding (for theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
may alſo otherways take their Riſe,
as from paſſions of the Mind Hyſterical Fitts,
from loſs or defilements of the Spirits <hi>Lipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymia,
Syncope,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>Ilmington-Spaw</hi> is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Uſe. For it will open Obſtructions,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65192:86"/>
ſterge the excremental <hi>ſordes,</hi> and take off
the ſpurious Acidity that is many times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
in the blood, and may adhere to the
Orifices of the Uterine veſſels, that often cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the <hi>Febris alba</hi> to be of ſo difficult Cure in
ſome young women. <hi>Sal Chalybis</hi> being freed
from the ſulphureous part of Iron, it will not
be amiſs to add ſome <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> or other
prepared Medicine, that by its ſulphureous
Particles may increaſe the Sanguinary Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Cachexie, Green ſickneſs,</hi> &amp;c. by which
the Cure will be facilitated, and the pale-faced
Patient brought to a lively Complexion.</p>
                  <p>But if there is a virulent Acrimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
then a more Appropriate medicine is
alſo requiſite; for this <hi>Spaw</hi> will not reach
the remote receſſes of the <hi>Genus Nervoſum.</hi> So
that Specificks of a penetrating nature and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
to correct the Enormities of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions
ſubſequent to the Stomachical, with
Catharticks to purge off the <hi>faeces</hi> and dregs of
our Bodies, muſt neceſſarily be required.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> this <hi>Spaw-water</hi> drank will help
to cleanſe and purifie the Blood, and may be
uſed with good ſucceſs in Diſtempers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from a ſaline acrious Humor, or fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but cannot reduce the coagulated Salts from
the <hi>Synodia</hi> of the Joynts, nor correct the
ſpurious Acidity that hath reached the <hi>Genus
Nervoſum,</hi> when the <hi>Gout</hi> attended with dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Symptoms doth appear.</p>
                  <p>Neither can this Chalybeat water reach the
Morbiſick Diſpoſition or Seminal <hi>Idea</hi> of the
<hi>Gout</hi> (more eſpecially in perſons to whom it
is Hereditary) which only wanteth an Acid
ferment to bring this latent Enemy upon the
open Stage. This latent Seed will ſhew it ſelf
in growth as often as it is excited by Saline
Agents, ſuch as Salt-beef, Stale beer, French
Wines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which morbid <hi>Idea</hi> firſt laid by
the <hi>Archeus,</hi> is beyond the Power of any Spaw-water
or Chalybeat, but requireth more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                  <p>This <hi>Spaw</hi> aſſiſted with Catharticks will

It may be uſed with good ſucceſs in obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                  <p>
                     <hi>Van Helmont</hi> (in the place before cited)
determineth the <hi>Spaw-waters</hi> in the Sphere of
their Activity. <hi>Poteſtas Aquarum non tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendat
Hypochondrium. Non enim ſupra Renes,
ad Cor videlicet, Pulmonem, aut Cerebrum A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae
attingunt: quocirca etiam affectibus illis
ex idiopathia genuinis niſi per accidens ſuccur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt
Spadanae.</hi> And a little after, <hi>nec Potae Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danae
in Epidemicis, Endemicis, &amp; Astralibus
morbis, ut ſunt Peſtis, Pleuritis, Prunella, &amp;c.
neque conferunt plurimum quibus venenum ſubest,
vel aſſumptum vel intus genitum vel contagio par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipatum,
neque in morbis Tincturae, quales ſunt
Lepra, Lues Veneris, Morphea, Cancer, Epilepſia,
&amp;c.</hi> But for my part, I cannot adhere to his
Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>we muſt not expect Cure of
Diſeaſes that proceed from a higher Rank than
the</hi> viſcera <hi>of the</hi> Abdomen: For it muſt needs
be granted, that <hi>Diureticks</hi> enter the Blood-veſſels,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65192:88"/>
and the blood in its Circulation doth
paſs through the Heart, yea like a Torrent
waſheth all parts of the Body. Yea we are
not ſure of any veſſels to convey this Water
drank or ſerous Humors from the Stomach or
Interſtices immediately to the Kidneys, but
before it can enter the blood-veſsels muſt be
conveyed above the <hi>Hypochondrium,</hi> and by
the Circulating blood may be hurried to all
parts of the body, until by Tranſpiration,
Sweat, or Urine it is ſeparated: and whilſt
mixed with the Blood may by its Active prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Salt and Sulphur working upon the
blood alter its depraved <hi>Craſis,</hi> and reſtore it
to a well-poiſed Temperament. But though
it may with the blood be carried to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Parts from the Heart, yet thence it will
not follow, that this Spaw-water is able to
reach and cure the Maladies of the <hi>Brain</hi> and
<hi>Genus Nervoſum.</hi> For beſides the Contrariety
of its Saline Principle to that of the Brain, a
Watery blood is an unfit Subject for the ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borating
of Animal ſpirits. When inſtead of
pure Blood a deluge of Water is ſupplied by
the Arteries, the Brain ſeemeth as it were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed,
and Nature to ſuffer: as may
be concluded from the frequent obſervation
of Water-drinkers, that after large quantities
taken do feel a dulneſs and heavineſs of Head,
ſtupidity, and other infirmities incident to
the Brain, and its <hi>Appendices</hi> the Nerves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the previous inclination of the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65192:88"/>
Patient, either towards a <hi>Palſie, Lethargy, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexie,</hi>
&amp;c, But this happeneth uſually
when the <hi>Water-drinkers</hi> proceed headlong,
without preparing their Bodies, or being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
in their Water-courſe, or taking Purges
to carry off the Water lodged long in the
blood, and the <hi>faeces</hi> that may cauſe Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
or conſidering their Habit of Body
and Inclination. Upon which accounts they
may as ſoon drink for their Ruine as for the
reſtoration of Health. Which may be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by way of Caution, but more of This in
the next Section.</p>
                  <p>Inſtances might be produced of ſeveral
Perſons, that by drinking Chalybeat Waters
have found relief from an <hi>Aſthma, Epilepſie,
Palſie,</hi> and many Diſtempers derived from a
Pravity of the Brain and Nerves. But then as
<hi>Helmont</hi> rightly adviceth, we muſt diſtinguiſh
Diſeaſes and their Cure by their true Cauſes.
For Example, upon obſtruction of the <hi>Menſes</hi>
in women there may enſue an <hi>Epilepſie, Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
or <hi>Palſie,</hi> and the <hi>Spaw water</hi> by provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Menſtrual Courſe may free the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
yet we muſt not recommend the <hi>Spaw-water</hi>
as a uſual Specifick to cure the <hi>Epilepſy,
Apoplexie, Aſthma,</hi> or <hi>Palſy;</hi> for what is done
as a Procatartick Cauſe, and upon a ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Conſequence cannot be a Specifick, nor
anſwer the Primary Intentions of Cure. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
then muſt we ſtear our courſe, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65192:89"/>
act with reſpect to the true Cauſe. For theſe
Diſtempers proceeding from an ill-affected
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terus,</hi> are far different from theſe that are
common to both Sexes.</p>
                  <p>Whatever <hi>Helmont</hi>'s Spaws might be
(which, ſaith he, took their vertue from an
Eſurine Acid and a diſsolved <hi>Minera</hi> of Iron)
as to Uſe <hi>in morbis Tincturae,</hi> under which he
comprehendeth the <hi>Leproſy, Morphy,</hi> &amp;c. I
ſhall not take upon me to determine: but yet
do ſee no reaſon why this at <hi>Ilmington</hi> may not

                  <p>I Shall now proceed to propoſe a method to
be obſerved by the Drinkers of this Spaw-water;
which I ſhall do, <hi>Firſt,</hi> by way of
Caution, ſhewing ſome ill Conſequences to
the raſh undertaking a Water-courſe; <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
by laying down ſome Rules how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
theſe inconveniences, and to drink the
Water with good Effect,</p>
                  <p>I might refer the Reader to <hi>Van Helmont
Parad. ſext. de Aq. Spad.</hi> and many other
Eminent Authors, that have given good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
for the right Uſe of Chalybeat Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
But this <hi>Section</hi> is chiefly deſigned for
the Poor Countrymen, who moſt commonly
are incapacitated to apply themſelves to ſuch
Authors: yet were their Abilities ſo great,
different Springs do require different Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
eſpecially this <hi>Spaw,</hi> that is ſo highly
impregnated with a Mineral. Beſides, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
many poor People reſort to the
<hi>Spring,</hi> that could not require the Advice,
much more the Attendance of a Phyſician ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
upon meer Charity; yet they boldly
undertook the drinking of a large quantity of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65192:90"/>
this Spaw-water, without preparing their
Bodies, yea for any Diſtemper; neither with
Advice nor Phyſick, but proceeded with their
own confidence, or rather Ignorance, and
might as well have drank for the Deſtruction
as Preſervation and recovery of their Health.
For upon raſh Undertakings in this kind, theſe
Ill conſequencies may enſue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> this <hi>Spaw-water</hi> containing in it a

got the beſt part of a Spoonful of an Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

what may be the Reſult from Obſtructions

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Too frequent drinking of this
<hi>Spaw</hi> and alſo of other Mineral waters in a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65192:91"/>
large quantity, and eſpecially when not taken
<hi>gradatim,</hi> will relax the fibres of the Stomach,
extend the veſſels and other membranous
parts, upon the Relaxation of the Stomachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

upon the Extenſion of the blood-veſſels, Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheducts
and Membranous parts, will follow

                     </gap> Diſtempers according to the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Habit of the body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Water like moſt other Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolick
will cauſe a <hi>Vertigo</hi> or light giddineſs
in the Head, eſpecially in them that unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
drink it to the quantity of three or four
Quarts at the firſt onſet. Not only a <hi>Vertigo</hi>
but alſo a <hi>Lethargie, Apoplexie,</hi> or other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalick
Diſtempers, cauſed by an oppreſſion
of the Brain and ſtoppage of the Animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
may enſue the taking of a large quantity,
when neither <hi>faeces</hi> nor the reſtagnating wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
are carried off</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore propoſe this Method to
the Drinkers of this <hi>Spaw water,</hi> for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
of theſe Enormities; yet ſhall not be
Dogmatical, but leave the Phyſician to direct
his Patient according to the Indication of the
Diſtemper, and thereby directing his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
And</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Purge off the Recremental <hi>ſordes</hi> of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65192:91"/>
the Stomach and Inteſtines; but rather (if
the habit of body and ſtrength will bear it)
begin with a Vomit: Such as a Doſe of <hi>Sal
Vitrioli;</hi> the Quantity is uſual from One ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to Four, but may be increaſed or d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>miniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
according to the condition of the Patient.
This Medicine I propoſe, becauſe it uſually
worketh both by Vomit and Siege; and not
only cleanſeth the <hi>viſcera</hi> of the <hi>Abdomer,</hi> but
alſo by its <hi>Stipticity</hi> will notably fortifie the
membranous fibres of the Stomach againſt
Relaxation, that often enſueth upon drinking
large Draughts of Water, and alſo it will
help to reduce the fibres to their proper ſtate
when too much extended, and conſequently
are weak and unfit to embrace the Aliment
taken in at the mouth. The fibres of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and Inteſtines being well fortified will
the better contain a large quantity of Water
without Relaxation, and by the Periſtaltick
motion of the Guts the Lacteal veſſels will
ſooner imbibe the Water when their Orifices
are ſcoured and like the little holes in a cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Strainer. Yet other Catharticks accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iug
to the particular caſe of the Patient may
be requiſite.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Then begin to drink of the Spaw-water.
They of an ordinary Conſtitution
may begin with a Pint, but they of a ſtronger
with a Quart or three Pints, and ſo increaſe
each morning a Pint until they come <hi>gradatim</hi>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:65192:92"/>
unto four Quarts, which may be the meaſure
for a ſtrong Conſtitution; and as ſome few
may exceed, ſo many may fall ſhort of it.
Thus may they continue in their Water-courſe
for a Month, and ceaſe <hi>gradatim</hi> as
they increaſed at firſt, leſt there ſhould be left
a diſtention of the fibres and membranes.</p>
                  <p>But withal obſerve, That the Water muſt
not be drank to its full Doſe at once, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with walking up the Hill, or moderate
Exerciſe after every full Draught; that it
may have time to ſearſe through the Drinkers
body, eſpecially until it begineth to ſhew it
ſelf by its Diuretick faculty. For the ſudden
drinking of a large quantity will cauſe a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtention
of the Stomach, with cruel <hi>Tormina</hi>
or Gripings in the bowels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thlrdly,</hi> In caſe the Water lieth long and
heavy on the Stomach and Inteſtines, and at
laſt worketh off in a Diarrhe or looſneſs, it
ſignifieth the body to be unprepared, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
Obſtructions in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſenteryor <hi>viſcera:</hi>
which requireth a Preparation by ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oppilative
Pills or Medicine, with convenient
Solutives to carry off the feculent Matter.
But in theſe caſes I cannot lay down any one
Preſcription general ſerving for particular
Perſons, that according to their Diſtempers
muſt have different Directions from their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:65192:92"/>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe of the great quantity of
Ocre or Vitriolick Earth contained in this
Spring water, let the Drinkers hereof ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to take at leaſt twice a week a Doſe of
Phyſick to carry off the filth of the water, free
the Stomach and Inteſtines from incruſtation
of the Earthy ſediment, and the veſſels from
Obſtructions. But the Water-drinkers muſt
forbear the <hi>Spaw</hi> on the days he deſigneth for
Purgation; except he take ſuch a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Pills <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on the over-night, or very
early in the morning, only to keep his body
from being Coſtive. For which purpoſe <hi>Van
Helmont</hi> recommendeth a Doſe of <hi>Ruffy Pills</hi>
(the Doſe may be from a Scruple to a
Drachm) taken three days together in the
morning before drinking of the waters. This
he adviſeth for the <hi>German</hi>-Spaw, <hi>Pauhont</hi>
and <hi>Savenir,</hi> whoſe Mineral Ingredients are
like this at <hi>Ilmington,</hi> though not ſo highly
impregnated as this new found <hi>Spaw. Ruffy
Pills</hi> may be of good uſe to purge off the filth
of the <hi>viſcera,</hi> and alſo the ſediment of the
Water, and being gentle in operation may be
taken on the over-night, or in the morning
deſigned for drinking the Water. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Obſervations of Phyſitians, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
the beſt method will be, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Pills (or Phyſick in ſuch form that the
Patient ſhall like beſt) of Deoppilating In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
and Antiſcorbutick, or with ſuch
Specificks that may anſwer the Indication of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65192:93"/>
Patients Diſtemper, but yet with ſuch purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Ingredients that may make the body ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble
to the number of three or four Stools,
and may be taken through the Water courſe,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> For a more ſpeedy paſſage of this
Water through the body, let the Drinkers
take a Glaſs or two of good White or Rheniſh
Wine, about an hour or ſomething longer
time after the full Doſe of Water is drank.
This is convenient, but eſpecially for them,
upon whoſe Stomachs and <hi>viſcera</hi> the water
lieth long and heavy; and if the water lieth
ſtill lodged in the veſſels and habit of body,
Catharticks and Diureticks may be helpful.</p>
                  <p>As the waters drank in a regular courſe will
increaſe (but eſpecially for a time) the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
after meat, or Hunger; ſo an irregularity
in Diet in a Water-courſe will not only take
off the Appetite, but may alſo lay a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many Diſtempers, yea may produce
more Evils than the Water is able to correct.
Wherefore I ſhall propoſe ſome Obſervables
about Diet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Faſt at leaſt two or three hours after
drinking the Waters, that they may have
time to paſs off but by eating too ſoon may
hinder the Digeſtive Ferments in their Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
or mix with the Chyle and ſo be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
into the Habit of the body, and leave
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65192:93"/>
much of the feculent <hi>ſordes</hi> in the remote
parts, that may endanger the Drinker with a
Fever Dropſie, Scurvy, or Obſtructions very
difficult of Cure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take that Advice of <hi>Helmont de
Aq Spad. Parad. 6. ſect. 5. Spadanas bibenti

                        </gap>.</hi> Whereby Moderation in
Eating and Drinking is recommended, leſt
that by over-glutting the ſtomachical and

which of neceſſity muſt cauſe future Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
For in moſt caſes over-charging Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will pluck down Health faſter, than the
Phyſitian is able to repair.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Meat well ordered and of an eaſie
digeſtion, muſt be obſerved in all theſe Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Phyſick. For well known it is, that
Salt meats and Seamens fare will alter the
ſweet Temper of the Blood into a ſaline ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick
Ferment; which, if continually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
will be able to withſtand the Operation
of a <hi>Vitriolum Martis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Drink is to be of a middle
ſort; not too ſmall and thin to depauperate
and dilute the blood, nor too ſtrong to over-ferment
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65192:94"/>
it; not too ſtale and ſharp to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
an Exotick Acidity, nor too muddy to
fill the veſſels with a <hi>faeces;</hi> but rather clear
mellow Ale, and now and then a Glaſs or two
of good Wine, that will be a convenient Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle
for the dry Aliments, and fit to renew
the ſweet Balſamick temper of the Blood.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all I ſhall adviſe the Drinkers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to uſe ſuch Specificks in their Water-courſe,
as ſhall be peculiar to their Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;
beſides Solutive Pills to carry off the
<hi>ſordes,</hi> that the depraved Ferments of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

remain ſafe and ſound.</p>
