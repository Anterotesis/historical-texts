            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN
ENQUIRY
INTO THE
Present State of AFFAIRS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>1. SINCE the Subject that is now undertaken,
is of such vast consequence both to the Quiet
of the Nation in General, and to the settling
of the Conscience of every man in it, it
shall be treated with all possible plainness,
and with that simplicity of Stile, which may shew
that the Writer intends rather to convince than to
amuse or mislead his Reader. It is certain, That the
Reciprocal Duties in Civil Societies, are Protection
and Allegiance; and wheresoever the one fails wholly,
the other falls with it. This is so true, that in the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Government which is founded on the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I mean the Authority of a Father over his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
if after a long course of rough and barbarous
usage, a Father goes about to destroy his Children,
they owe him no other regard, but that of a due
care of his Person; for since their being was conveyed
to them through him, they are for ever bound to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that Life which gave beginning to theirs; but as
to their Service and Obedience, they are without doubt
absolved, when a Father ceases to be a Father by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
an Enemy. This is much more true with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to every Form of Political Government, in
which there is a mutual tye of Protection and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64575:3"/>
according to that System of Government gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans, chap.</hi> 13.
in the first seven verses.</p>
            <p>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers: for
there is no power but of God. The powers that be, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
of God.</p>
            <p>2. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the
ordinance ef God: and they that resist, shall receive to
themselves damnation.</p>
            <p>3. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the
evil. Wilt thou not be afraid of the power? do that which
is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same.</p>
            <p>4. For he is the minister of God to thee for good: but
if thou do that which is evil, be afraid: for he beareth
not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger
to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</p>
            <p>5. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, nor only for
wrath, but also for conscience sake.</p>
            <p>6. For, for this cause pay you tribute also: for they are
Gods ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</p>
            <p>7. Render therefore to all their dues, tribute to whom
tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear,
honour to whom honour.</p>
            <p>In these Words we have the Duty of the Magistrate,
as well as the Obedience of the Subject, set forth, and
so mixt together, that we must conclude, that upon
the total failing of the one, the other does likewise
cease.</p>
            <p>2. I suppose few will dispute the matter of Fact, that
the King being pushed on by his Zeal for a Religion
that must, by its nature, first deceive, and then destroy
us, was subverting this Establishment both with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to our Religious, and to our Temporal Concerns;
and that as this was carried on a great way, even to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64575:3"/>
the Subversion of our Government and Laws, so it
must have ended at last in the total Ruin of both, and
in the exchanging that Independent Freedom, which is
the present Glory, as well as the Security of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
into a Subjection to a Foreign and Antichristian
Yoke. This being confessed by those for whom this
Paper is written, it were needless, and might seem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious
to set about the proving of it. In a word, That
which ought to have been our Security, was become our
greatest Danger; as if the Cannon of a Fort that ought
to point at the Enemy, were turn'd on the Inhabitants;
in which case, how absolute soever the Authority of a
Governor may be, yet as soon as it appears that the
Bulwarks, instead of being the Defences of the City,
are become Batteries to ruin it, Nature will lead to a
short way of Arguing: And all men will forget that
one is their Governour, when they clearly see that he
intends to turn their Destroyer.</p>
            <p>3. A King's deserting his People, and withdrawing
both his Person and his Seals, by which the Peace, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Order of the Nation are preserved, does cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
warrant them to look to their own safety and
preservation; and when they are obliged to do this by
ways and methods that are inconsistent with His Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and that are so many Crimes if they stood still
under any engagements to him, then they must be
considered as acquitted from all their ties to him. It
is the Great Seal that is the dead Spring of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the King's Presence, or the Presence of any
that are Deputed by him gives life to it: when then
this disappears, and the King withdraws himself, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
naming any Persons to Represent him, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is certainly laid down and forsaken by him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
if any Eminent present Danger, or just fear (tho
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64575:4"/>
a King can never be decently suspected of that) had
driven the King away, it might seem a little too hard
to urge this too much. But when a Treaty was set on
foot, and when by the Proposals which the Prince had
made, and that came to the King the night before he
left <hi>Whitehal,</hi> the Power both Civil and Military, the
Army, the Fleet, the Forts, and the Revenue, were still
left in his Hands, and that the Prince's Army was not
to come within 30 Miles of him, and that the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Nation was refer'd to a Parliament (which
was that which the King seemed to desire, by his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Declaration, tho he shew'd his Averseness by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
the Writs) and when all that was proposed,
that can be called hard, was only the executing the
Law against Papists that were in Employments, the
giving the City of <hi>London</hi> some quiet from their just
Fears, and the assigning the Pay for the Prince's Army;
all this being laid together, it is plain that the King had
no just visible cause of fear upon him; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the withdrawing himself, was the forsaking of his
People, which put them on the necessity of looking to
their own safety in the best manner they could.</p>
            <p>4. It seems plain, that our Allegiance being our tye
to the King, according to the constitution of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
it is either entirely dissolved, or it subsists
still in its full vigour and force: If it is entirely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
then we are under no obligations to the King;
and if that bond is once untied, so that our Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are freed from it, it will be a hard task to persuade
men, that they ought to return to it again: If it stands
in its full force, then we ought to recall the King,
imploring only his Pardon for what is past, without
entering upon any previous Treaty, or presuming to
offer any Articles to him. If it is said, that the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64575:4"/>
tho it still remains, yet is under a suspension;
as in the Case of an Infant or a Mad-man, in which a
Guardian may be necessary for the Administration of
the Government, tho the Right and Dignity is still in
the Person of the King; and that therefore, tho the
King's misguided Zeal may have rendered him unfit to
Govern, yet the Title and Dignity of a King ought
still to be preserved, even when the Regency may be
put in other hands. To this it is to be opposed, That
in case of Infancy, or Lunacy, the incapacity to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
is transient in the one, and so pitiable in the other,
that this will not afford an Argument in favour of an
Incapacity that is affected and culpable: Besides, in
those Cases, there is no danger to the Government, by
any struggle between the King and the Regent; which
cannot be avoided where a King is of Age, and under
no other distemper, but that which is the effect of his
Religion. In this Case a Contest is inevitable: A King
without Power cannot be much at his ease; and his
struggle for it must either end in the overthrowing the
Regency, if not in the Assassinating the Regent; or in
the Imprisonment of the King, which must needs have
such fatal consequences, that it is not to be imagined
that any of the King's Children, in whom Piety and
Nature work, can ever engage into a state of Life that
gives them so melancholly a Prospect: Besides, that the
Name and Title of <hi>KING</hi> carry a sound with them
that strikes the People; And if now, after all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
that the Nation is under at present, it is yet
thought fit to let the Title and Dignity remain in the
King, it will be natural for all men, when that sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is over, to soften, and to think that things have
been carried too far: And since no Government is
secure from Accidents, and free from all the subjects of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64575:5"/>
discontent, it is not unreasonable to foresee, that the
leaving any Root in the ground, may occasion a new
Spring at some distance of time, when past Errors may
be forgot, and the present Accidents may give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
turn to mens thoughts. We are likewise as much
bound by the Oath of Allegiance to maintain the King's
State, and all his Prerogatives, as his Title and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
It will look like the condemning our own Actions,
to allow him the Honour, and to take from him the
Power of a King; so that if the Oath may be slacken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in one Point, I do not see why it must of necessity
bind us in another. In a word, we do either too little
or too much, if we allow him to be King, and do not
likewise vest him with the whole extent of the Royal
Authority.</p>
            <p>5. In all Settlements, it is very natural for men to look
for good Security, especially for those, who being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come out of a Storm, have the terror of it still on
their thoughts; now what Security can be proposed in
any Treaty with the King? We see what insignificant
things Promises and Oaths are, when Popery is in the
other Scale; and to trust any more, is too impudent a
Proposition, to apprehend that any one should insist
upon it. As for all Limitation by Laws, when that for
the Test-Act, which was penn'd with all possible Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
has been broke through by a pretended Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing-Power,
it is a vain thing to trust such Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
against an ungovern'd Zeal, which when whetted
with Resentment must act with so much the more
Rigor and Fury. We have also many Instances in
our own time, to shew us how little regard is to be
had to all the Offers that are made in general
Terms, in order to the gaining of a great Point, which
being once gained, those Offers are no more thought of.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64575:5"/>
To make way for the late King's Restauration, nothing
was so much talked of, as the Terms on which he should
be restored, but the Point was no sooner gain'd than
the Terms were not only forgot, but all things were
carried higher than before. And a few years ago when
the Nation was set on the Bill of Exclusion, all those
who opposed it were framing Schemes of limiting a
Popish Successor; but that Storm was no sooner wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd,
than a Party was form'd that carried their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
so far, that instead of Limitations, all the chief Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities
and Fences of our Government were thought
the only proper Sacrifice to atone for the guilt of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
the Exclusion. So if a Treaty were once
opened, and the King were to be brought back again, on
what terms soever it might be, we should probably see
the whole design of Popery and Arbitrary Government
return upon us with more fury than ever: and we
should find our selves in no possibility of resisting it, or
being redeemed from it; for this Deliverance was no
such easy Performance as to make us think that such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
could ever be compassed, or that God will work
new Miracles for our Preservation, after we had thrown
our selves back into that miserable Condition out of
which he has rescued us.</p>
            <p>6. If it be insisted on that the Oaths of Supremacy
and Allegiance are conceived in such terms, that there
is no breaking thro' them; and that we have sworn
that we shall never take Arms against the King; that
we have renounced the Position, as traiterous, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a distinction between the King's <hi>Person</hi> and his
<hi>Power;</hi> in short, that we are under the most express ties
that can be put in words, never to rebel against the King,
nor to shake off his Authority. To all this it is to be
answered, That the end and design of those Oaths was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64575:6"/>
to secure us against the danger of Popery, as any one
may see in the Acts by which they were imposed: And
tho all these Oaths are still to the King; yet that is to a
Prince who subsists upon Law, and rules by Law; and
therefore if the King ceases to be King, by subverting
our Constitution first, and deserting us next, then all
our Oaths fall to the ground: as the Matrimonial Oath,
tho made for term of Life, yet is capable of being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
when that which is the Essence of the Bond is
broke. And if the King ceases to be a King, then the
<hi>next Heir becomes the only lawful and rightful King:</hi> and
if the next is a <hi>Femme Covert,</hi> then by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which creates a Communication of all the Rights
of the Wife to the Husband, this is likewise commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,
so that here we may have still a <hi>lawful and
rightful King.</hi> And after all, it is plain that if any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
of the Regal Authority be imposed on the
King, as the condition upon which only he can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
this very Imposition is as real a breach of the
Oath, as a total shaking him off. This makes a vast dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the King's <hi>Person</hi> and his <hi>Power,</hi> tho
that is a Point expresly renounc'd in the Oaths that we
swear; so that it is plain after all, that if the Oath of
Allegiance binds us still, it binds us to a great deal more
than those that are for treating seem willing to allow.</p>
            <p>7. All the Schemes that may be offered of securing
us by a Treaty with the King, have such visible Defects
in them, that Men who are accustomed to examine
things, cannot be deceived by them. We have had it
given for Law of late, too often to forget it, that all
Acts of Parliament that are to the <hi>Disherison of the
Crown,</hi> are null and void of themselves: So here all
the Securities that can be offered us, are swept away at
once. We can have no legal Parliament without swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64575:6"/>
first the Oath of Allegiance to the King; and what
a scorn is put on God and Religion if one swear this
Oath to the King after he is reduced to that naked State
to which these Treaters pretend to bring him. Nor can
the Nation have any Security by Law, either for what
is done, or for what may remain yet to be done, but by
Acts that are past by <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons.</hi> Men
are to be pardoned if they are uneasy, till they have
the utmost Security that the Constitution can give them.
And after all whosoever is the <hi>King for the time being,</hi>
he has the Law so entirely of his side, that tho during
the present Fermentation the force of this is not percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,
yet it is a Cruelty not to be easily forgiven to keep
a Nation too long in so dangerous a Condition.</p>
            <p>8. But after all some Men plainly say, <hi>the King can
do no Wrong,</hi> that his Ministers are only accountable
for all the Ill he had done; and that the Prince in his
Declaration has laid the Blame of all that for which he
engaged in this great Design on the evil Counsellors
about the King, on whom the Punishment ought to fall,
and not on the King himself, whose Person is exempt
from Censure. To all which this is to be answered,
that the Maxim, <hi>The King can do no Wrong,</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to a sense very different from that which was at
first intended by it; for the meaning of it is only this,
That the King's Power cannot go so far as to support
him in the doing of any Injustice or Wrong to any,
according to that Chapter in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> by which
all Commissions granted against Law, are declared to
be null and void: for this is the true meaning of that
Maxime. But there is no reason to carry this so far as
that if Kings will strain their Authority visibly, to do
the highest Wrongs possible, they were in no way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
for it. Whatsoever has been done in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64575:7"/>
and has never been condemned by any subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
one, is a part of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> since
then two of our Kings, <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> the
<hi>2d,</hi> have been judged in Parliament for their Mal-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration,
and since these Judgments have never
been vacated by any subsequent Parliaments, those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
are a part of our Law. And though perhaps
there have been more express Definitions made of late
in Favour of the Crown than ever were in former
times, yet as long as those Proceedings remain upon
Record, it is plain that this great Right of the English
Nation of preserving it self in cases of extream Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
against the violent Invasions that the Crown may
make upon it, is still entire and in force. But after all
it will be readily yielded, that as the Life of a Father
is never to be attempted on by his Children, how great
soever their Provocations may be; so the King being
made the Political Father of the Country, his Person
ought still to be sacred. But when the Root of the
King's overturning our Laws is his being so entirely
devoted to his Religion, and to the Order of the Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its,
how decent soever it might be for the Prince to lay
the Blame of all on his evil Councellors, yet it will be
an unreasonable Piece of Tenderness in the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
of the Kingdom not to lay the Blame of things
where it ought to be laid.</p>
            <p>9. Either all thoughts of treating with the King,
or all Enquiries into the Birth of the pretended Prince
of <hi>Wales</hi> are to be laid aside. The King has gone so
far in what he has averred, with relation to that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that it is impossible to judg it an Imposture
without giving him a large share in it; and no
Man can think that it is possible to maintain the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Decencies of Respect to the King, if any steps
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64575:7"/>
are made in that matter: for even an Enquiry into
it is the calling his Honour into question, in so sensible
a point that no Man that can make a Discovery is
safe to make it, nor are any safe who pretend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
it, as long as there are any thoughts of treating
with him; which will never be believed to be quite
laid down, as long as the Title of King is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be still in him. Men that condemn the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
in Government committed by him, may flatter
themselves with the possibility of his pardoning them;
but there is no Mercy where the Matter is personal, in
which his Honour is so immediately concerned, and
where a Judgment against the Child casts so black and
so indelible a Stain on himself.</p>
            <p>10. If Articles are prepared to be offered to the
King, they will be either such as he will probably grant,
or such that it cannot in reason be expected that he
should grant them. The former is not to be supposed;
for such a stripping himself of Power, as seems neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to give us any tolerable Security, is that which
we ought not to imagine he will grant: and it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to the World a triumphing over him in his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
if we make a shew of treating with him,
when it is visible before-hand that the Demands
which must be made him are such, that he cannot in
Honour grant them, nor we in Reason expect them
from him. When Matters are brought to that pass at
which they are at present; it is more suitable to the
Dignity and Wisdom of the Nation to act frankly and
above-board, than to think to varnish them over with
some outward Appearances. In such cases, any other
way of proceeding has not that Air of Greatness and
Openness which is necessary upon such occasions. A
great deal of time will be lost in preparing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64575:8"/>
and a Treaty being once entertained, many
may be practised on, and either be corrupted or destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And perhaps the half of the Articles will be drop'd
in the Treaty, or the whole will be given up by the
King in less time than was imployed in preparing any
one of the Articles. The very talk of a Treaty will
keep the Minds of many in Agitation and suspence:
Some that are now desperate with relation to the King,
may enter into a separate Treaty with him: and an
inconstant Multitude will be too much tempted to run
as fast to him as ever they shewed Zeal against him.
That these are not imaginary Dangers is visible to all
that have conversed much in History, or have observed
the varieties of Mens Thoughts with relation to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Affairs, and considered how little is to be built on
any present Heats, how fervent and how universal soever
they may seem to be, and how soon a Nation may be
apt to run even out of one Extream into another, and
therefore the keping thing still in a loose and unsettled
State is the hazarding the whole matter, and the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the risk of a Relapse, which will be much more
dangerous than the former Disease was, unless the King
of <hi>France,</hi> who has the King now in his Power, will
be pleased to mediate for us, out of his tried Love to
us and our Religion.</p>
            <p>11. The clear and natural method of proceeding upon
this Occasion, is, First, To state this Nation as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Kingdom, that is incompatible with Popery or
a Popish King; of which Opinion many were before
the King came to the Crown; and he has so managed
the Matter since, that he has convinced the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it at last. Here a view may be taken of the
Course of his Government, in those things that have
been Notorious and Publick, without entring into such
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64575:8"/>
Specialties as will need proof, and by consequence
take up time; and in conclusion it is to be set forth,
that he has quitted the Realm in a Storm, and has left
the Nation to shift for it self; and has both deserted
the Government in general, and abandoned even those
who had stuck to him, and were ready to have sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
all for him in particular. And that the last Act
of his Authority might be long remembred, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
his Army to be disbanded; which (since it was
to be done without paying or disarming the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers)
was the letting loose of so many Armed Men,
under the greatest temptation to live like <hi>Banditti</hi> and
Robbers in the Nation. Upon all this it is natural to
declare the Throne void; and that the King has fallen
from all Right to it. In all that I have said concerning
his Desertion, I limit my Reflections to his first leaving
of <hi>Whitehall;</hi> for the Accident at <hi>Feversham,</hi> and what
followed after that, cannot be called a Return to his
People; and since the Seals never appeared, and the
King never spake of a Parliament, nor altered his
Measures in any thing, but still prosecuted his first
Design by his second Escape, his deserting is still to be
dated from his first going from <hi>White-Hall;</hi> and he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given that just Advantage against himself, which
came after all that series of Injustice and Violence
that had gone before it, no Man can think that it was
not very fitting to carry it as far as it would go, and
not to treat with him any more upon the foot of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
him King.</p>
            <p>12. When all this is laid together, it is not to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
that considering Men can be shocked with those
Prejudices that arise, rather out of the sound of some
ill understood Words, than out of any real and forcible
Arguments, and it can least of all be imagined, that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64575:9"/>
the great and learned Body which has so triumphed
over Popery in their late Contests with it, should now
let themselves be so misled with the narrow Notions of
an unbounded Loyalty, as to oppose or even dislike such
a compleat Settlement, as the present Exigence of our
Affairs requires. Their Worth, the Courage that
they shewed against Popery, and their Readiness to
have been made Sacrifices in that noble Resistance
which they both made and maintained to the last, has
indeed raised them above Censure, and all severe Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
But it cannot but lessen the Esteem that is
due to any, though it does not detract from their
Worth, if they will still pursue a point that is liable to
such great and just Exceptions. No Body can think
they are in Love with Popery, or fond of coming
again under Father <hi>Peter</hi>'s Ministry: but Men that
see through all the Reasons that are offered for Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and foresee the fatal Consequences that must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it, will be tempted to think that some Men, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have not strength of thought enough to examine
this whole matter more impartially, or that having once
declared themselves of a contrary Opinion, they cannot
conquer Nature so far, as to do that which will import
a Confession of their once having been in an Error.</p>
