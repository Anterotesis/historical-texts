         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is high time to search in what corner
of the Church the fire is kindled, being
crept so far, as that with the verie smoke
the consciences of diuers are smothered.
It is found that certaine <hi>Martins,</hi> if no
miscreants in religion (which wee may
suspect) yet without doubt maleco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tents
(which wee ought to feare) haue throwen fire, not into the
Church porch, but into the Chauncell, and though not able
by learning and iudgement to displace a Sexton, yet seeke to
remooue Bishops. They haue scattered diuers libels, all so
taunting and slanderous, as it is hard to iudge, whether their
lyes exceed their bitternesse, or their bitternesse their fables.</p>
            <p>If they be answered by the grauitie of learned Prelates,
they presentlie reply with railings; which argueth their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to be as farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the truth of deuotion, as their writings
from mildnes of spirit. It is said that camels neuer drinke,
til they haue troubled the water with their feete, &amp; it seemes
these <hi>Martins</hi> cannot carouse the sapp of the Church, till by
faction they make tumults in religion. Seeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either they
expect no graue replie, or that they are settled with railing
to replie; I thought it more conuenient, to giue them a whisk
with their owne wand, than to haue them spurd with dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
learning.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scithian</hi> slaues, though they bee vp in armes, must
bee tamde with whippes, not swords, and these mutiners in
Church matters, must haue their mouthes bungd with iests,
not arguments.</p>
            <p>I seldome vse to write, and yet neuer writ anie thing, that
in speech might seeme vndecent, or in sense vnhonest; if here
I haue vsed bad te<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>mes, it is because they are not to bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
with good tearmes: for whatsoeuer shall seeme lauish
in this Pamphlet, let it be thought borrowed of <hi>Martins</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb facs="tcp:12610:5"/>
These <hi>Martins</hi> were hatcht of addle egges, els could
they not haue such idle heads. They measure conscience by
their owne yard, and like the theeues, that had an yron bed,
in which all that were too long they would cut euen, all that
were too short they would stretch out, and none escapte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rackt
or vnsawed, that were not iust of their beds length: so
all that are not <hi>Martins,</hi> that is, of their peeuish mind, must
be measured by them. If he come short of their religion, why
he is but a colde Protestant, hee must bee pluckt out to the
length of a Puritane. If any be more deuout than they are,
as to giue almes, fast, and pray, then they cut him off close by
the workes, and say he is a Papist. If one be not cast in <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi>
mould, his religion must needes mould. He saith he is a
Courtier, I thinke no Courtier so peruerse, that seeing the
streight rule of the Church, would goe about to bend it. Jt
may be he is some Iester about the Court, and of that I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
because I know all the fooles there, and yet cannot gesse
at him. What euer he be, if his conscience be pind to his cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance,
J will account him more politicke than religious,
and more dangerous for ciuill broyles, than the Spaniard
for an open warre. I am ignorant of <hi>Martin</hi> and his main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer,
but my conscience is my warrant, to care for neither.
For I knowe there is none of honour so carelesse, nor any in
zeale so peeuish, nor of nature any so barbarous, that wil suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor
those that be suckers of the Church, a thing against God
and policie; against God, in subuerting religion; against po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,
in altering gouernment, making in the Church, the
feast of the <hi>Lapithees,</hi> where all shall bee throwne on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
head, because euerie one would be the head. And these
it is high time to tread vnder foote: for who would not
make a threshold of those, that go about to make the Church
a barne to thresh in. <hi>Itaque sic disputo.</hi>

but there was a little wag in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> that swore
by Saint <hi>Seaton,</hi> he would so swinge him with Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logismes,
that all <hi>Martins</hi> answeres should ake. The
vile boy hath manie bobbes, and a whole fardle of
fallacies. He begins,
<q>
                  <l>Linquo coax ranis, cros coruis, vanaque vanis.</l>
                  <l>Ad Logicam pergo, quae Mart'ins non timet ergo.</l>
               </q>
And saies, he will <hi>ergo Martin</hi> into an ague. I haue
read but one of his arguments.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Tiburne stands in the cold,</l>
               <l>But <hi>Martins</hi> are a warme furre:</l>
               <l>Therefore Tiburne must be furd with
<hi>Martins.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>O (quoth I) boy thou wilt be shamed; tis nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in moode nor figure: all the better, for I am in
a moode to cast a figure, that shall bring them to
the conclusion. I laught at the boye, and left him
drawing all the lines of <hi>Martin</hi> into sillogismes,
uerie conclusion beeing this, <hi>Ergo Martin</hi> is to bee
hangd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12610:6"/>
Nay, if rime and reason bee both forestalde, Ile
raile, if <hi>Martin</hi> haue not barrelde vp all rakehell
words: if he haue, what care I to knocke him on
the head with his owne hatchet. He hath taken vp
all the words for his obscenitie: obscenitie? Nay,
now I am too nice; squirrilitie were a better word:
well, let me alone to squirrell them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martin,</hi> thinkst thou, thou hast so good a wit, as
none can outwrangle thee? Yes <hi>Martin,</hi> wee wil
play three a vies wits: art thou so backt that none
dare blade it with thee? Yes <hi>Martin,</hi> we will drop
vie stabbes. <hi>Martin</hi> sweares I am some gamester.
Why, is not gaming lawful? I know where there
is more play in the compasse of an Hospitall, than
in the circuite of <hi>Westchester.</hi> One hath been an old
stabber at passage: the One that I meane, thrust a
knife into ones thigh at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the quarrel was
about cater-tray, and euer since he hath quarrelled
about cater-caps.</p>
            <p>I thought that hee which thrust at the bodie in
game, would one daie cast a foyne at the soule in
earnest. But hee workes closelie and sees all, hee
learnd that of old <hi>Vydgin</hi> the cobler; who wrought
ten yeares with spectacles, and yet swore he could
see through a dicker of leather. He hath a wanton
spleene, but we will haue it stroakt with a spurne,
because his eies are bleard, he thinkes to bleare all
ours; but let him take this for a warning, or else
looke for such a warming, as shall make all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices
as like wood, as his spittle is like woodsere.
Take away the Sacke, and giue him some Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom
<pb facs="tcp:12610:7"/>
water, his conscience hath a colde stomacke.
Cold? Thou art deceiued, twil digest a Cathedral
Church as easilie, as an Estritch a two penie naile.</p>
            <p>But softe <hi>Martins,</hi> did your Father die at the
<hi>Groyne?</hi> It was well groapt at, for I knewe him
sicke of a paine in the groyne. A pockes of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
(quoth <hi>Iulian Grimes</hi> to her Father) when al
his haires fell off on the sodaine. Well let the olde
knaue be dead. Whie are not the spawnes of such
a dog-fish hangd? Hang a spawne? drowne it; alls

            <p>Ye like not a Bishops rochet, when all your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
handkerchers were made of his sweete harts
smocke. That made you bastards, and your dad a
cuckold, whose head is swolne so big, that he had
neede sende to the cooper to make him a biggin:
and now you talke of a cooper, Ile tell you a tale of
a tubb.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Sudburie,</hi> where the Martin-mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers swarmd
to a lecture, like beares to a honnie pot: a good ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

that could haue done a worse act if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
had not been neere, askt his sweete sister, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lecherie in her conscience were a sinne? In
faith (quoth she) I thinke it the superficies of sinne,
and no harme if the tearmes be not abusde. for you
must say, vertuousty done, not lustily done. Fie, this
is filthie ribaldry. O sir, ther is no mirth without ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldrie,

<pb facs="tcp:12610:7"/>
She is dead:<note place="margin">They are not so many, thei are all Centimani, an hundred hands a peeces so that in all they are but one thousand.</note> the diuell shee is. You are too broad

haue twentie hundred thousand handes to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

&amp; hire one that shall so translate you out of French
into English, that you will blush and lie by it. And
one will we coniure vp, that writing a familiar E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
about the naturall causes of an Earthquake,
fell into the bowells of libelling, which made his
eares quake for feare of clipping; he shall tickle you
with taunts; all his works bound close, are at least
sixe sheetes in quarto, &amp; he calls them the first tome
of his familiar Epistle: he is full of latin endes, and
<pb facs="tcp:12610:8"/>
worth tenne of those that crie in London, <hi>haie ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

wil be massacred: if the toy take him to close with
thee, then haue I my wish, for this tenne yeres haue
I lookt to lambacke him. Nay he is a mad lad, and
such a one as cares as little for writing without
wit, as <hi>Martin</hi> doth for writing without honestie;
a notable coach companion for <hi>Martin,</hi> to drawe
Diuinitie from the Colledges of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
to Shoomakers hall in Sainct <hi>Martins.</hi> But

            <p>There came to a Duke in <hi>Italie,</hi> a large lubber
and a beggerlie, saying hee had the Philosophers
<pb facs="tcp:12610:9"/>
Stone, and that hee could make golde faster, than
the Duke could spend it; The Duke askt him, why
hee made none to mainteine himselfe? Because
quoth he, I could neuer get a secret place to worke
in; for once I indeuoured, and the Popes holinesse
sent for me, whom if he had caught, I should haue
been a prentice to mainteine his pride. The Duke
minding to make triall of his cunning, &amp; eager of
golde, set to him worke closely in a vault, where it
was not knowen to his neerest seruants. This Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumist,
in short time consumed two thousande
pound of the Dukes gold, and brought him halfe a
ducket: whie (quoth the Duke) is this all? All
quoth he my Lord, that I could make by Art. Wel
said the Duke, then shalt thou see my cunning: for
I will boile thee, straine thee, and then drie thee,
so that of a lubber, that weighed three hundred

            <p>There was a libeller, who was also a coniurer,
so that whatsoeuer casting of figures there was, he
deceiued them; at the last, one as cunning as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
shewed, wher he sate writing in a fooles coate,
&amp; so he was caught and whipt. <hi>Martin,</hi> there are
figures a flinging, &amp; ten to one thou wilt be found
sitting in a Knaues skinne, and so be hangd.</p>
            <p>Hollow there, giue me the beard I wore yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.
O beware of a gray beard, and a balde head:
for if such a one doo but nod, it is right dudgin and
deepe discretion. But soft, I must now make a

            <p>There is small difference between Swallowes &amp;
<hi>Martins,</hi> either in shape or nature, saue onely, that

but I cannot continue this stile, let me fal into

            <p>
               <hi>It was one of your neast, that writt this for a

            <p>How now holie <hi>Martin,</hi> is this good wooing?
If you prophane the Scriptures, it is a pretie wit; if
we but alledge Doctors to expound them, wee are
wicked If <hi>Martin</hi> oppresse his neighbor, why hee
saith, it is his conscience; if anie else doo right, it is
extremitie. <hi>Martin</hi> may better goe into a brothell
house, then anie other go by it; he slides into a bad
place like the Sunne, all others stick in it like pitch.
If <hi>Martin</hi> speake broad bawdrie, why all the crue

not sweare, but with indeede, in sooth, &amp; in truth,
hee'le cogge the die of deceipt, and cutte at the

brought in, at least three figures in that line, besides

            <p>One there was, and such a one as <hi>Martin</hi> would

Christ had giuen his master a quittaunce, the same

            <p>Now to the two bastards, what were you twins?
It shuld seeme so, for there we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but a paire of sheeres

            <p>There was one endited at a Iaile deliuerie of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie,
<pb facs="tcp:12610:12"/>
for taking vp an halter by the high way. The
Iurie gaue verdit and said guiltie. The Iudge an

taking vp a penie halter, and bad them consider,
what it was to cast awaie a man. Quoth the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
we haue enquired throughly, and found there
was a horse tied to the halter. I marie (quoth the
Iudge) then let him be tied to the halter, and let the
horse goe home. <hi>Martin,</hi> a Monarch in his owne
moyst conceit, and drie counsell, saies he is enuied
onelie, because he leuelleth at Bishops; &amp; we say as
the Iudge saith, that if there were nothing else, it
were hard to persecute them to death; but when
we finde that to the rule of the Church, the whole
state of the Realme is linckt, &amp; that they filching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Bishop by Bishop, seeke to fish for the Crown,
and glew to their newe Church their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
we must then say, let Bishops stand, &amp; they
hang; that is, goe home. Looke howe manie tales
are in this booke, so manie must you abate of an
hundred in the next booke, reckon this for one.</p>
            <p>There came by of late a good honest Minister,
with a cloake hauing sleeues: ah (quoth a Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist,
sitting on a bulke in Cheapside) he is a knaue I
warrant you, a claspe would become one of his
coate to claspe his cloak vnder his chinne. Where
tis to be noted, that they come in with a sleeuelesse
conscience, and thinke it no good doctrine, which
is not preached with the cloak cast ouer each shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
like a rippier.</p>
            <p>Twas a mad knaue and a Martinist, that diuided
<pb facs="tcp:12610:12"/>
his sermon into 34. parts for memorie sake, and
would handle but foure for memorie sake, and
they were, why Christ came, wherefore Christ
came, for what cause Christ came, and to what end
Christ came; this was all for memorie sake. If
that <hi>Martin</hi> could thatch vp his Church, this mans
scabship should bee an Elder, and Elders they may
bee, which being fullest of spungie pith, proue euer
the driest kixes. For in time you shall see, that it is
but a bladder of worldlie winde which swells in
their hearts, being once prickt, the humour will
quicklie be remoued. O what a braue state of the
Church it would be for all Ecclesiasticall causes to
come before Weauers and Wierdawers, to see
one in a motlie Ierkin and an apron to reade the
first lesson. The poore Church should play at vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
game, for it should loose al by the <hi>Elder</hi> hand.
Nay Mas <hi>Martin,</hi> weele make you deale, shuffle as
well as you can, we meane to cut it.</p>
            <p>If you had the foddring of the sheep, you would
make the Church like <hi>Primero,</hi> foure religions in
it, and nere one like another. I cannot out of his
gaming humour. Why? Is it not as good as <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi>
dogged humour, who without reuerence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
or exception, vseth such vnfitting tearmes, as
were hee the greatest subiect in England hee could
not iustifie them.</p>
            <p>Shut the doores (sirs) or giue me my skimmer,
<hi>Martins</hi> mouth had sod vnskimde these twelue
months, and now it runnes ouer; yet let him alone,
he makes but porredge for the diuell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12610:13"/>
His Elderberines though it be naught worth,
yet is it like an elderberrie, which being at the ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of a perfect black, yet brused staines ones hands
like bloud. They pretending grauitie in the rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of their zeale, bee they once wrung, you shall
finde them lighter than feathers. Thats a simile for
the slaues. Nay, Ile touch them deeper, and make
them crie, O my heart, there is a false knaue among
vs.</p>
            <p>Take away this beard, and giue me a pikede
vaunt, <hi>Martin</hi> sweares by his ten bones: nay, I will
make him mumpe, mow, and chatter, like old Iohn
of Paris garden before I leaue him.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Martin</hi> will fight Citie fight, wee challenge
him at all weapons, from the taylors bodkin to the
watchmans browne bil. If a field may be pitcht we
are readie: if they scratch, wee will bring cattes: if
scolde, we will bring women: if multiplie words,
we will bring fooles: if they floute, we will bring
quippes: if dispute the matter, we will bring schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers:
if they buffet, we will bring fists. <hi>Deus bone,</hi>
what a number of we will brings be here? Nay, we
will bring <hi>Bull</hi> to hang them. A good note &amp; signe
of good lucke, three times motion of <hi>Bull.</hi> Motion
of <hi>Bull?</hi> Why, next olde <hi>Rosses</hi> motion of Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
<hi>Buls</hi> motion fits them best. <hi>Tria sequuntur tria,</hi>
in reckoning <hi>Bull</hi> thrise, me thinkes it should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
hanging. O bad application<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bad? I doo not
thinke there can be a better, than to applie a knaues
necke to an halter. <hi>Martin</hi> cannot start, I am his
shadowe, one parte of the day before him, another
<pb facs="tcp:12610:13"/>
behinde him; I can chalke a knaue on his backe
thrice a weeke, Ile let him bloud in the combe.</p>
            <p>Take heed, he will pistle thee. Pistle me? Then
haue I a pestle so to stampe his pistles, that Ile beate
all his wit to powder. What will the powder of
<hi>Martins</hi> wit be good for? Marie blowe vp a dram
of it into the nostrels of a good Protestant, it will
make him giddie; but if you minister it like <hi>Tobacco</hi>
to a Puritane, it will make him as mad as a <hi>Martin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Goe to, a hatch before the doore, <hi>Martin</hi> smels
thee, and wil not feare thee; thou knowest how he
deales with the Archbishop and a Counseller, hee
will name thee and that broadlie. Name me? Mary
he and his shall bee namefied, that's it I thirst after,
that name to name, and knowing one another, wee
may in the streetes grapple; wee except none: wee
come with a verse in our mouthes, courage in our

               <hi>Martins</hi> conscience hath a periwig; therefore to
good men he is more sower than wig: a Lemman
will make his conscience curd like a Posset. Now
comes a biting speach, let mee stroake my beard
thrice like a Germain, before I speak a wise word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martin,</hi> wee are now following after thee with
hue and crie, &amp; are hard at thy heeles; if thou turne
backe to blade it, wee doubt not but three honest
men shall bee able to beate sixe theeues. Weele
teach thee to commit sacriledge, and to robbe the
Church of xxiiij. Bishops at a blowe Doost thinke
that wee are not men <hi>Martin,</hi> and haue great men
<pb facs="tcp:12610:14"/>
to defend vs which write? Yes, although with thy
seditious cloase, thou would'st perswade her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
that most of the Gentlemen of account and
men of honour, were by vs thought Puritanes.
No, it is your poore Iohns, that with your painted
consciences haue coloured the religion of diuers,
spreading through the veynes of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
like poyson, the doggednes of your deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
which entring in like the smoothnes of oyle
into the flesh, fretteth in time like quicksiluer into
the bones.</p>
            <p>When children play with their meate, tis a signe
their bellies are full, &amp; it must be taken from them;
but if they tread it vnder their feete, they ought to
be ierkt. The Gospell hath made vs wantons, wee
dallie with Ceremonies, dispute of circumstances,
not remembring that the Papists haue been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
roddes for vs this thirtie yeares; wee shall bee
swing'd by them, or worse by <hi>Martin,</hi> if <hi>Martins</hi>
bee worse. Neuer if it, for they bee worse with a
witnesse, and let the diuell be witnesse. Wee are so
nice, that the Cap is a beame in our Church, the
booke of Common Praier a milstone, the <hi>Pater
noster</hi> is not well pend by Christ. Well, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is but policie, or policie scarce religious.</p>
            <p>If a Gentleman riding by the way with twentie
men, a number of theeues should by deuise or force
binde all his seruants; the good Iustice of Peace
would thinke he should bee robd. When Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
rancke robbers of the Church shall binde the
legges and armes of the Church, me thinkes the

supreme head of the Church should looke pale.</p>
            <p>They that pull downe the bells of a steeple, and
say it is conscience, will blow vp the chauncell to
make it the quintessence of conscience. Bir Ladie,
this is a good settled speech, a Diuine might haue
seemd to haue said so much. O sir, I am nor al tales,

if <hi>Martin</hi> knock the bone he shall find mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
&amp; if he looke for none, we'le knock the bone
on his pate, and bring him on his marie bones.</p>
            <p>I haue yet but giuen them a fillip on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,
Ile fell it to the ground hereafter. Nay, if they
make their consciences stretch like chiuerell in the

            <p>There is a good Ladie that lent one of these
Martinists fortie pounds, and when at the daie shee
required her money, <hi>Martin</hi> began to storme, aud

of <hi>Westminster</hi> to take forfeitures. Theyle not sticke
to out-law a mans soule, and serue it presently with
an execution of damnation, if one denie them to

they say, they haue <hi>Timothie</hi> his weake stomacke,
which Saint <hi>Paule</hi> willeth to warme with wine.</p>
            <p>They haue sifted the holie Bible, and left vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
as they say, but branne; they haue boulted it
ouer againe and againe, and got themselues the fine
meale; tis meale indeede, for with their wresting
and shuffling holie Writ, they finde all themselues
good meales, and stand at liuerie as it were, at other

            <p>Her sacred Maiestie hath this thirtie yeares,
with a setled and princelie temper swayed the
Scepter of this Realme, with no lesse content
<pb facs="tcp:12610:16"/>
of her subiects, than wonder of the world. GOD
hath blessed her gouernment, more by miracle tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by counsaile, and yet by counsaile as much as can
come from policie. Of a State taking such deepe
roote, as to be fastened by the prouidence of God,
the vertue of the Prince, the wisedome of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers,
the obedience of subiects, and the length of
time; who would goe about to shake the lowest
bough, that feeles in his conscience but the least
blessing. Heere is a fit roome to squese them with
an Apothegme.</p>
            <p>There was an aged man that liued in a well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Common-wealth by the space of threescore
yeares, and finding at the length that by the heate
of some mens braines, and the warmnes of other
mens bloud, that newe alterations were in ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering,
aud that it grewe to such an height, that all
the desperate &amp; discontented persons were readie
to runne their heads against their head; comming
into the midst of these mutiners, cried as loude as
his yeares would allow; Springalls and vnripened
youthes, whose wisedomes are yet in the blade,
when this snowe shall be melted (laying his hand
on his siluer haires) then shal you find store of durt,
and rather wish for the continuance of a long frost,
than the comming of an vntimely thaw. Ile mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
this.</p>
            <p>Ile warrant the good old man meant, that when
the ancient gouernment of the state should be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by faction, or newe lawes brought in that were
deuised by nice heads that there should followe a
<pb facs="tcp:12610:16"/>
foule and slipperie managing; where if happelie
most did not fall, yet all would bee tired. A settled
raigne is not like glasse mettal, to be blowne in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
length or fashion of euerie mans breath, and
breaking to be melted againe, &amp; so blowne afresh;
but it is compared to the fastning of the Cedar, that
knitteth it selfe with such wreaths into the earth,
that it cannot be remooued by any violent force of
the aire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martin,</hi> I haue taken an inuentorie of al thy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuill
and rakehell tearmes, and could sute them in
no place but in Bedlam and Bridewell, so mad they
are, and so bad they are, and yet all proceedes of the
spirit. I thinke thou art possest with the spirites of
<hi>Iacke Straw</hi> &amp; the Black-smith, who, so they might
rent in peeces the gouernment, they would drawe
cuts for religion.</p>
            <p>If all be conscience, let conscience bee the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of your building, not the glasse, shew effects
of conscience, mildnesse in spirit, obedience to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
loue to thy brethren. Stitch charitie to thy
faith, or rip faith from thy works.</p>
            <p>If thou wilt deale soberlie without scoffes, thou
shalt be answered grauely without iests, yea and of
those, whom thou canst not controll for learning,
nor accuse for ill life, nor shouldst contemne for au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorie.
But if like a restie Iade thou wilt take the
bitt in thy mouth, and then runne ouer hedge and
ditch, thou shalt be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as <hi>Prosper</hi> broke his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,

and so haue thy head runne against a stone wall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12610:17"/>
If thou refuse learning, and sticke to libelling; if
nothing come out of those lauish lips, but taunts
not without bitternesse, yet without wit; rayling
not without spite, yet without cause, then giue me
thy hand, thou and I will trie it out at the cucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoole.
Ile make thee to forget Bishops English, and
weep Irish; next hanging there is no better reuenge
on <hi>Martin,</hi> than to make him crie for anger; for
there is no more sullen beast, than a he drab. Ile
make him pull his powting croscloath ouer his
beetle browes for melancholie, and then my next
booke, shall be <hi>Martin</hi> in his mubble fubbles.</p>
            <p>HEre I was writing <hi>Finis</hi> and <hi>Funis,</hi> and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to lay it by, till I might see more kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
filde in: within a while appeared olde
<hi>Martin</hi> with a wit worn into the socket, twinkling
and pinking like the snuffe of a candle; <hi>quantum
mutatus ab illo,</hi> how vnlike the knaue hee was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
not for malice but for sharpnesse.</p>
            <p>The hogshead was euen come to the hauncing,
and nothing could be drawne from him but dregs:
yet the emptie caske sounds lowder than when it
was ful; and protests more in his waining, than he
could performe in his waxing. I drew neere the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
soule, whom I found quiuering in two sheetes
of protestation paper. O how meager and leane
hee lookt, so creast falne, that his combe hung
downe to his bill, and had I not been sure it was
the picture of enuie, I shoulde haue sworne
<pb facs="tcp:12610:17"/>
it had been the image of death, so like the verie A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomie
of mischiefe, that one might see through
all the ribbes of his conscience, I began to crosse
my selfe, and was readie to say the <hi>Pater noster,</hi> but
that I knewe he carde not for it, and so vsed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wordes, but <hi>abi in malam crucem,</hi> because I
knewe, that lookt for him. I came so neere, that I
could feele a substantiall knaue from a sprites sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe.</p>
            <p>I sawe through his paper coffen, that it was but
a cosening corse, and one that had learnde of the
holie maid of Kent, to lie in a trance, before he had
brought foorth his lie; drawing his mouth awrie,
that could neuer speake right; goggling with his
eyes that watred with strong wine; licking his lips,
and gaping, as though he should loose his childes
nose, if he had not his longing to swallowe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
and swelling in the paunch, as though he had
been in labour of a little babie, no bigger than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;
but truth was at the Bishoppes trauaile: so
that <hi>Martin</hi> was deliuered by sedition, which pulls
the monster with yron from the beastes bowells.
When I perceiued that he masked in his rayling
robes, I was so bolde as to pull off his shrowding
sheete, that all the world might see the olde foole
daunce naked.</p>
            <p>Tis not a peniworth of protestation that can
buy thy pardon, nor al worth a penie that thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimest.
<hi>Martin</hi> comes in with bloud, bloud, as
though hee should bee a martir. <hi>Martins</hi> are mad
martirs, some of them burnt seauen yeares agoe,
<pb facs="tcp:12610:18"/>
and yet aliue. One of them lately at <hi>Yorke,</hi> pulling
out his napkin to wipe his mouth after a lie, let
drop a surgeans caliuer at his foote where he stood;
these fellowes can abide no pompe, and yet you see
they cannot be without a little squirting plate: rub
no more, the curtall wrinches.</p>
            <p>They call the Bishops butchers, I like the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phore
wel, such calues must be knockt on the head,
and who fitter than the Fathers of the Church, to
cut the throates of heresies in the Church. Nay,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue no propertie of sheepe but bea, their
fleece for flockes, not cloath, their rotten flesh for
no dish, but ditches; I thinke them woorth neither
the tarring nor the telling, but for their scabbed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to bee thrust from the pinfolde to the scaffold,
and with an <hi>Habeas corpus</hi> to remooue them from
the Shepheards tarre-boxe, to the hangmans bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get.</p>
            <p>I but he hath sillogismes in pike sauce, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that haue been these twentie yeres in pickle.
I, picke hell, you shall not finde such reasons, they
bee all in <hi>celarent,</hi> and dare not shewe their heads,
for wee will answere them in <hi>ferio</hi> and cut their
combes. So say they, their bloud is sought. Their
bloud? What should wee doo with it, when it
will make a dogge haue the toothach to eate the
puddings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martin</hi> tunes his pipe to the lamentable note
of <hi>Ora whine meg.</hi> O tis his best daunce next sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the sheetes; but hee good man meant no
harme by it. No more did one of his minions,
<pb facs="tcp:12610:18"/>
that thinking to rap out an oath and sweare by his
conscience, mistooke the word and swore by his
concupiscence; not vnlike the theefe, that in stead
of God speede, sayd stand, and so tooke a purse for
God morowe.</p>
            <p>Yet dooth <hi>Martin</hi> hope that all her Maiesties
best subiects will become Martinists; a blister of
that tongue as bigge as a drummes head; for if
the Queenes Maiestie haue such abiects for her
best subiects, let all true subiects be accompted ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</p>
            <p>They that teare the boughs, will hew at the
tree, and hauing once wet their feete in factions,
will not care how deepe they wade in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Martin</hi> had racked ouer his protestation
with a Iades pace, hee runnes ouer his fooleries
with a knaues gallop, ripping vp the souterlie
seames of his Epistle, botching in such frize iestes
vppon fustion earnest, that one seeing all sortes
of his shreddes, would thinke he had robd a tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
shop boord; and then hee concludes all dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedlie,
with Doctor <hi>Bullens</hi> dogge <hi>Spring,</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that there is not a better Spanniell in
England to spring a couie of queanes than <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee sliues one, has a fling at another, a long tale
of his talboothe, of a vulnerall sermon, and of a
fooles head in souce. This is the Epistle which he
woonders at himselfe, and like an olde Ape
hugges the Vrchin so in his conceipt, as though
<pb facs="tcp:12610:19"/>
it should shew vs some new tricks ouer the chaine,
neuer wish it published <hi>Martin,</hi> we pittie it before
it comes out. Trusse vp thy packet of flim flams, &amp;
roage to some countrey Faire, or read it among
boyes in the belfrie, neuer trouble the church with
chattering; but if like dawes, you will be cawing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Churches, build your nests in the steeple, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
not the quier.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martin</hi> writes merely, because (hee saies) people
are carried away sooner with iest than earnest. I,
but <hi>Martin</hi> neuer put Religion into a fooles coate;
there is great oddes betweene a Gospeller, and a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller.</p>
            <p>If thy vaine bee so pleasaunt, and thy witt so
so nimble, that all consists in glicks and girds; pen
some play for the Theater, write some ballads for
blinde <hi>Dauid</hi> and his boy, deuise some iests, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
another <hi>Scogen;</hi> so shalt thou haue ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t inough
for all thy vanities, thy Printer shall purchase, and
all other iesters beg.</p>
            <p>For to giue thee thy due, thou art the best died
foole in graine that euer was, and all other fooles
lacke manie graines, to make them so heauie.</p>
            <p>There is not such a mad foole in Bedlam, nor
such a baudie foole in Bridewell, nor such a dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
foole in the stockes, nor such a scolding foole
on the cuckingstoole, nor such a cosening foole on
the pillerie, nor such a roaging foole in the houses
of correction, nor such a simple foole kept of alms,
nor such a lame foole lying in the spittle, nor in all
the world, such a foole, all. Nay for fooles set down
<pb facs="tcp:12610:19"/>
in the scriptures, none such as <hi>Martin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What atheist more foole, that saies in his heart,
<hi>There is no God?</hi> What foole more proud, that
stands in his own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit? What foole more coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
than he, that seekes to tedd abroad the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
goods with a forke, and scratch it to himselfe
with a rake.</p>
            <p>Thou seest <hi>Martin</hi> with a little helpe, to the foure
&amp; twentie orders of knaues, thou maist solder the
foure and twentie orders of fooles, and so because
thou saist thou art vnmarried, thou maist commit
matrimonie, from the heires of whose incest, wee
will say that which you cannot abide, <hi>Good Lord
deliuer vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this veyne bleede but sixe ounces more, I shall
proue a pretie railer, and so in time may growe to
bee a proper Martinist. Tush, I doo but licke ouer
my pamphlet, like a Beares whelpe, to bring it in
some forme; by that time he replies, it will haue
clawes and teeth, and then let him looke to bee
scratcht and bitten too.</p>
            <p>Thou seest <hi>Martin</hi> Moldwarpe, that hetherto I
haue named none, but markt them readie for the
next market: if thou proceed in naming, be as sure
as thy shirt to thy knaues skinne, that Ile name
such, as though thou canst not blush, because thou
art past shame, yet they shall bee sorie, because they
are not all without grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pasquil</hi> is comming out with the liues of the
Saints. Beware my Comment, tis odds the margent
shall be as full as the text. I haue manie sequences
<pb facs="tcp:12610:20"/>
of Saints; if naming be the aduantage, &amp; ripping vp
of liues make sport, haue with thee knuckle deepe,
it shall neuer bee said that I dare not venter mine
eares, where <hi>Martin</hi> hazards his necke.</p>
            <p>Now me thinkes <hi>Martin</hi> begins to stretch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
like an old fencer, with a great conscience for
buckler, and a long tongue for a sword. Lie close
you old cutter at the locke, <hi>Nam mihi sunt vires, &amp;
mea tela nocent.</hi> Tis ods but that I shall thrust thee
through the buckler into the brain, that is through
the conscience into the wit.</p>
            <p>If thou sue me for a double maime, I care not
though the Iurie allow thee treble damages, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
amount to much, because thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science is with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
wit, and thy wit without conscience, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
both, not worth a penie.</p>
            <p>Therefore take this for the first venew, of a
yonger brother, that meanes to drie beate those of
the <hi>Elder</hi> house. <hi>Martin,</hi> this is my last straine for
this fleech of mirth. I began with God morrowe,
and bid you God night. I must tune my fiddle, and
fetch some more rozen, that it maie squeake out
<hi>Martins</hi> Matachine.</p>
