            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>BEing to appear anew in the World, it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that I should say something concerning these ensuing Trisles, which I shall endeavour to do with as much briefness, as I did before what I last pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in this kind.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but the Reader will think me guilty of an high presumption in adventuring upon a Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>The Art of Poetry,</hi> after two such great Hands as have gone before me in the same attempts: I need not acquaint him, that I mean <hi>Ben Johnson,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Roscommon,</hi> the one being of so establish'd an Authority, that whatever he did is held as Sacred, the other having lately performed it with such admirable success, as almost cuts off all hope in any after Pretenders of ever coming up to what he has eone. How be it, when I let him know, that it was a Task imposed upon me, and not what I voluntarily engaged in; I hope he will be the more favourable in his Censures. I would indeed very willingly have wav'd the undertaking upon the forementioned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and urged it as a reason for my declining the same, but it would not be allowed as sufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse me therefrom. Wherefore, being prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make an Essay. I fell to thinking of some course; whereby I might serve my self of the Advantages; which those that went before me; have either not
<pb facs="tcp:104609:3"/>
minded, or scrupulously abridged themselves of. This I soon imagined was to be effected by putting <hi>Horace</hi> into a more modern dress, than hitherto he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in, that is by making him speak, as if he were living, and writing now. I therefore resolved to alter the Seene from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and to make use of <hi>English</hi> names of Men, Places, and Customs, where the Paralel would decently permit, which I conceived would give a kind of new Air to the Poem, and render it more agreeable to the rellish of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age.</p>
            <p>With these Considerations I set upon the Work, and pursued it accordingly. I have not, I acknowledg, been over-nice in keeping to the words of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, for that were to transgress a Rule therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Nevertheless I have been religiously strict to its sense, and express'd it in as plain, and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible a manner, as the Subject would bear. Where I may be thought to have varied from it (which is not above once or twice, and in Passages not much material) the skilful Reader will perceive 'twas necessary for carrying on my proposed design, and the Author himself, were he again alive, would (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) forgive me. I have been careful to avoid stiffness, and made it my endeavour to hit (as near as I could) the easie and familiar way of writing, which is peculiar to <hi>Horace</hi> in his Epistles, and was his proper Talent above any of mankind. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, 'tis humbly submitted to the judgment of the truly knowing, how I have acquitted my self herein. Let the success be what it will, I shall not however wholly repent of my undertaking, being (I
<pb facs="tcp:104609:3"/>
reckon) in some measure recompenced for my pains by the advantage I have reaped of fixing these admirable Rules of Sense so well in my memory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Satyr</hi> and <hi>Odes</hi> of the Author, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low next in order, I have translated after the same libertine way. In them also I labour'd under the disadvantages of coming after other persons. The <hi>Satyr</hi> had been made into a Scene by <hi>Ben Johnson,</hi> in a Play of his, called the <hi>Poetaster.</hi> After I had finished my imitation thereof, I came, to learn, that it had been done likewise by Dr. <hi>Sprat,</hi> and since I have had the sight of it amongst the Printed Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations of <hi>Horace'</hi>s Works. The <hi>Odes</hi> are there done too, but not so excellently well, as, to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage any farther endeavours. If these of mine meet with good entertainment in the world, I may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps find leisure to attempt some other of them, which at present suffer as much from their Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as the Psalms of <hi>David</hi> from <hi>Sternhold</hi> and <hi>Hopkins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two sacred <hi>Odes</hi> I designed not to have made publick now, forasmuch as they might seem unfit to appear among Subjects of this nature, and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to come forth apart hereafter in company of others of their own kind. But, having susser'd Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of them to straggle abread in Manuscript, and remembring the Fate of some other Pieces of mine, which have formerly stoln into the Press without my leave, or knowledg, and be exposed to the world abominably false and uncorrect; to prevent the same misfortune likely enough to befal these, I have been persuaded to yield my consent to their Publishing
<pb facs="tcp:104609:4"/>
amongst the rest. Nor is the Printing of such Miscella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies altogether so unpresidented, but that it may be seen in the Editions of Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cowley'</hi>s Works, whether done by their own appointment, or the sole direction of the Stationer's, I am not able to determine.</p>
            <p>As for the two Essays out of <hi>Greek,</hi> they were occasioned by a report, that some persons found fault with the roughness of my Satyrs formerly published, tho, upon what ground they should do it, I could be glad to be informed. Unless I am mistaken, there are not many Lines but will endure the reading with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shocking any Hearer, that is not too nice, and censorious. I confess, I did not so much mind the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as the Sense and expressiveness of my words, and therefore chose not those, which were best disposed to placing themselves in Rhyme, but rather the most keen, and tuant, as being the most sutable to my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And certainly no one that pretends to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the several Colours of Poetry, would expect that <hi>Juvenal,</hi> when he is lashing of Vice and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, should flow so smoothly, as <hi>Ovid,</hi> or <hi>Tibullus,</hi> when they are describing Amours and Gallantries, and have nothing to disturb and ruffle the evenness of their Stile.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, to shew that the way I took, was out of choice, not want of judgment, and that my Genius is not wholly uncapable of performing upon more gay and agreeable Subjects, if my humour inclined me to exercise it, I have pitch'd upon these two, which the greatest men of sense have allowed to be some of the softest and tenderest of all Antiquity. Nay, if we
<pb facs="tcp:104609:4"/>
will believe <hi>Rapine,</hi> one of the best Criticks which these latter Ages have produced; they have no other fault, than that they are too exquisitely delicare for the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Postoral, which should not seem too laboured, and whose chief beauty is an unaffected air of plainness and simplicity.</p>
            <p>That, which laments the Death of <hi>Adonis</hi> has been attempted in <hi>Latine</hi> by several great Masters, namely, <hi>Vulcanius, Douza,</hi> and <hi>Monsieur le Fevre.</hi> The last of them has done it Paraphrastically, but left good part of the Poem toward the latter end untouch'd, perhaps because he thought it not so capable of Ornament, as the rest. Him I chiefly chose to follow, as being most agreeable to my way of translating, and where I was at a loss for want of his guidance, I was content to steer by my own Fancy.</p>
            <p>The Translation of that upon <hi>Bion</hi> was begun by another Hand, as far as the first fifteen Verses, but who was the Author I could never yet learn. I have been told that they were done by the Earl of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi> but I could not well believe it, both because he seldom medled with such Subjects, and more especially by reason of an uncorrect line, or two to be found amongst them, at their first coming to my hands, which never us'd to flow from his excellent Pen. Conceiving it to be in the Original, a piece of as much Art, Grace, and Tenderness, as perhaps was ever offered to the Ashes of a Poet, I thought fit to dedicate it to the memory of that incomparable Person, of whom nothing can be said, or thought so choice and curious, which his Deserts do not surmount. If it be thought mean to have borrowed the sense of another to praise him
<pb facs="tcp:104609:5"/>
in, yet at least it argues at the same time a value and reverence, that I durst not think any thing of my own good enough for his Commendation.</p>
            <p>This is all, which I judg material to be said of these following Resveries. As for what others are to be found in the parcel, I reckon them not worth menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning in particular, but leave them wholly open and unguarded to the mercy of the Reader; let him make his Attaques how, and where he please.</p>

Whatever Precepts you pretend to give,</l>

                  <l>And strait his Genius, which before did seem</l>
                  <l>Bound up in Ice, and frozen as the Clime,</l>
                  <l>By its warm force, and friendly influence thaw'd,</l>
                  <l>Dissolv'd apace, and in soft numbers flow'd:</l>

Such welcome here, dear Sir, your Letter had</l>
                  <l>With me shut up in close constraint as bad:</l>
                  <l>Not eager Lovers, held in long suspence,</l>
                  <l>With warmer Joy, and a more tender sense</l>
                  <l>Meet those kind Lines, which all their wishes bless,</l>
                  <l>And Sign, and Seal deliver'd Happiness:</l>
                  <l>My grateful Thoughts so throng to get abroad,</l>
                  <l>They over-run each other in the crowd:</l>
                  <l>To you with hasty flight they take their way,</l>
                  <l>And hardly for the dress of words will stay.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Yet pardon, if this only fault I find,</l>
                  <l>That while you praise too much, you are less kind:</l>
                  <l>Consider, Sir, 'tis ill and dang'rous thus</l>
                  <l>To over-lay a young and tender Muse:</l>
                  <l>Praise, the fine Diet, which we're apt to love,</l>
                  <l>If given to excess, does hurtful prove:</l>
                  <l>Where it does weak, distemper'd Stomachs meet,</l>
                  <l>That surfeits, which should nourishment create.</l>
                  <l>Your rich Perfumes such fragrancy dispense,</l>
                  <l>Their sweetness overcomes, and palls my sense;</l>

On my weak head you heap so many Bays,</l>
                  <l>I sink beneath 'em, quite oppress'd with Praise,</l>
                  <l>And a resembling fate with him receive,</l>
                  <l>Who in too kind a triumph found his Grave,</l>

                  <l>They void 'em dribling, and in pain they write,</l>
                  <l>As if they had a Strangury of Wit:</l>
                  <l>Your Pen uncall'd they readily obey,</l>
                  <l>And scorn your Ink should flow so fast as they:</l>
                  <l>Each strain of yours so easie does appear,</l>
                  <l>Each such a graceful negligence does wear,</l>
                  <l>As shews you have none, and yet want no care.</l>
                  <l>None of your serious pains or time they cost,</l>
                  <l>But what thrown by, you can afford for lost:</l>

If such the fruits of your loose leisure be,</l>

                  <l>While silly I all thriving Arts refuse,</l>

                  <l>From your kind hand I should receive a cure:</l>
                  <l>When (lo!) instead of healing Remedies,</l>
                  <l>You cherish, and encourage the Disease:</l>
                  <l>Inhumane you help the Distemper on,</l>
                  <l>Which was before but too inveterate grown.</l>

                  <l>A rash and vent'ring fool in Poetry.</l>
                  <l>Poets are Cullies, whom Rook Fame draws in,</l>

                  <l>But, when they hit, and most successful are,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Oft (I remember) did wise Friends dissuade,</l>
                  <l>And bid me quit the trifling barren Trade.</l>
                  <l>Oft have I tried (Heav'n knows) to mortifie</l>
                  <l>This vile, and wicked lust of Poetry:</l>
                  <l>But still unconquer'd it remains within,</l>
                  <l>Fix'd as an Habit, or some darling Sin.</l>
                  <l>In vain I better studies there would sow,</l>
                  <l>Often I've tried, but none will thrive, or grow:</l>
                  <l>All my best thoughts, when I'd most serious be,</l>
