            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Majesties feet, beseeching you to prosper such a blessed Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
till it attain success: We must needs beleeve, that when
your Majesty took our Consent to a Lyturgy to be a foundation
that would infer our Concord, you meant not that we should
have no Concord, but by consenting to this Lyturgy, without
any considerable Alterations.</p>
            <p>And when you comforted us with your Resolutions to draw
us together, by yeelding on both sides in what we could, you
meant not that we should be the boat to lay the banks that
should not stir; and when your Majesty commanded us by
Letters Patents to meet about such Alterations as are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
or expedient for giving satisfaction to tender Consciences,
and the restoring and continuing of Peace and Unity, we
rest assured, that it was not your sense that those tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
were to be forced to practice all which they judged
unlawful, and not so much as a Ceremony abated them; or
that our Treaty was only to convert either party to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of another; and that all our hopes of Concord and Liberty
consisted only in disputing the Bishops into Non-conformity, or
coming in every Ceremony to their minds.</p>
            <p>Finally (for your Majesty, under God, is the protection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your people flye, and as the same necessity still remains
which drew forth your Gracious Declaration) we most Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and Earnestly beseech your Majesty, that the benefit
of the said Declaration may be continued to your people, and
in particular, that none be punished or troubled for not using
the Common-Prayer, till it be effectually reformed, and the
Addition made, as there exprest. We crave your Majesties
Pardon for the tediousness of this Address, and shall wait in
hope, that so great a Calamity of your people as will follow
the loss of so many able, faithful Ministers, as the rigorous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
would cast out, shall never be recorded in the History
of your Reign, but that these impediments of Concord being
forborn, your Kingdom may flourish in Piety and Peace, that

            <p>Whereas by our Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the 25 of <hi>October</hi> last concerning Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
affairs, we did (amongst other things)
express our esteem of the Liturgy of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> contained in the Book of Common-prayer;
and yet since we find exceptions made
against several things therein, we did by our said
Declaration declare we would appoint an equal
number of Learned Divines, of both perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to review the same: we therefore in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of our said will and intent, and of our
continued and constant care and study for the
peace and unity of the Churches within our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and for the removal of all exceptions &amp;
difference, and the occasions of such differences
and exceptions from among our good subjects,
for or concerning the said <hi>Book</hi> of Common-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or any thing therein contained, do by these
our letters patents require, authorize, constitute
and appoint you the said, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to advise upon and
review the said Book of Common-prayer, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the same with the most ancient Liturgies
<pb facs="tcp:102298:4"/>
which have been used in the Church in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
and purest times. And to that end, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
and meet together, from time to time, and
at such time within the space of four Kalendar-months
now next ensuing, in the Masters lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Savoy in the Strand in the County of
<hi>Middlesex,</hi> or in such other place or places as to
you shall be thought fit and convenient, to take
into your serious and grave consideration the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
directions and rules, forms of prayer, and
things in the said Book of Common-prayer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and to advise, consult upon and about the
same, and the several objections and exceptions
which shall now be raised against the same, and
(if occasion be) to make such reasonable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
alterations, corrections, and amendments
therein, as by and between you the said Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
Bishops, Doctors, and Persons hereby requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and authorized to meet and advise as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
shall be agreed upon to be needful and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,

when you the said Arch-Bishop, Bishops, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
and Persons authorized and appointed by
these our letters patents to meet, advise and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
upon and about the premises as aforesaid,
shall have drawn your consultations to any reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
and determination which you shall agree
upon as needful or expedient to be done for the
altering, diminishing or enlarging the said Book
of Common-prayer, or any part thereof, That
then forthwith you certifie and present to us in
writing under your several hands the matters
and things whereupon you shall so determine,
for our approbation; and to the end the same or
so much thereof as shall be approved by us, may
be established, and forasmuch as the said Arch-Bishop
and Bishops have several great charges
to attend, which we would not dispense with, or
that the same should be neglected upon any
great occasion whatsoever, and some of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of great Age and infirmities, may not be able
constantly to attend the execution of the service
and authority hereby given and required by us,
in the meeting and consultation aforesaid; We
will therefore, and hereby require you the said
Dr. <hi>Earles,</hi> &amp;c. to supply the place and places
of such of the Arch-Bishop and Bishops (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the said <hi>Edward</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich)</hi>

            <p>ACknowledging with all humility and thankfulness, His

to very many of his Loyal Subjects, as well in
His Majesties most gracious Declaration, as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in this present Commission, issued forth in
pursuance thereof; Wee doubt not but the Right Reverend
Bishops, and all the rest of His Majesties Commissioners intrusted
in this work, will, in imitation of His Majesties most prudent and
Christian Moderation and Clemency, judge it their duty (what
wee finde to bee the Apostles own practice) in a special manner
to bee tender of the Churches peace, to bear with the infirmities
of the weak, and not to please themselves, nor to measure the
consciences of other men by the light and latitude of their own,
but seriously and readily to consider and advise of such expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
as may most conduce to the healing of our breaches, and
uniting those that differ.</p>
            <p>And albeit wee have an high and honourable esteem of those
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102298:7"/>
godly and learned Bishops, and others, who were the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers
of the Publick Liturgy, and do look upon it as an excellent

made her first step out of such a mist of Popish Ignorance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
wherein it formerly was involved; Yet considering
that all humane works do gradually arrive at their maturity, and
perfection; and this in particular being a work of that nature,
hath already admitted several Emendations since the first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling
thereof.</p>
            <p>It cannot bee thought any disparagement or derogation either
to the work it self, or to the Compilers of it, or to those who
have hitherto used it, if after more than an hundred years, since
its first composure, such further <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emendations be now made
therein, as may bee judged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> necessary for satisfying the scruples
of a multitude of sober persons, who cannot at all (or very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
comply with the use of it, as now it is, and may best sute
with the present times after so long an enjoyment of the glorious
light of the Gospel, and so happy a Reformation. Especially
considering that many godly and learned men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have from the
beginning all along earnestly desired the alteration of many
things therein, and very many of His Majesties pious, peaceable,
and loyal Subjects, after so long a discontinuance of it, are more
averse from it than heretofore. The satisfying of whom (as far as
may bee) will very much conduce to that peace and unity which
is so much desired by all good men, and so much indeavoured
by His Most Excellent Majesty.</p>
            <p>And therefore in pursuance of this His Majesties most gracious
Commission, for the satisfaction of tender consciences, and the
procuring of peace and unity amongst our selves, wee judge meet
to propose,</p>
            <p>First, That all the Prayers, and other materials of the Liturgy
may consist of nothing <hi>doubtful or questioned</hi> amongst pious,
learned, and Orthodox persons inasmuch as the professed end of
composing them is for the declaring of the <hi>unity and consent</hi> of all
who joyn in the publick worship; it being too evident that the
limiting of Church-Communion to things of <hi>doubtful disputation,</hi>
hath been in all ages the ground of Schism and Separation accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the saying of a learned person.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:102298:7"/>
To load our publick forms,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hales.</hi>
                  </note> with the private fancies upon
which wee differ, is the most Soveraign way to perpetuate
Schism to the worlds end. Prayer, Confession, Thanksgiving,
Reading of the Scriptures, and administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the plainest, and simplest manner, were matter enough
to furnish out a sufficient Liturgy, though nothing either of
private Opinion, or of Church-pomp, of Garments, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
gestures, of Imagery, of Musick, of matter concerning
the dead, of many superfluities which creep into the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Decency,</hi> did interpose it self. To
charge Churches and Liturgies with things unnecessary, was the
first beginning of all Superstition, and when scruple of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
began to be made or pretended, then Schism began to
break in. If the special Guides and Fathers of the Church would be
a little sparing of incumbring Churches with superfluities, or
not over-rigid, either in reviving Obsolete Customes, or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
new, there would be far less cause of Schism, or Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and all the inconvenience were likely to ensue, would be
but this, they should in so doing yeeld a little to the imbecillity
of their inferiours; a thing which St. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to do: Mean while, wheresoever false or suspected Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
are made a peece of Church-Liturgy; hee that separates is
not the Schismatick: for it is alike unlawful to make Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of known, or suspected falshood; as to put in practise unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
or suspected actions.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>2. Further, we humbly desire that it may be seriously considered,
that as our first Reformers out of their great wisdome, did at
that time so compose the Liturgy, as to win upon the Papists,
and to draw them into their Church-Communion, by varying as
little as they well could, from the <hi>Romish</hi> forms before in use; so
whether in the present constitution, &amp; state of things amongst us,
wee should not according to the same Rule of Prudence and
Charity, have our Liturgy so composed, as to gain upon the
judgements and affection of all those who in the substantials of
the Protestant Religion are of the same perswasions with our
selves: Inasmuch as a more firm union and consent of all such,
as well in Worship, as in Doctrine, would greatly strengthen the
Protestant interest against all those dangers and temptations
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102298:8"/>
which our intestine Divisions and Animosities do expose us unto,
from the common Adversary.</p>
            <p>3. That the Repetitions, and Responsals of the Clerk and
People, and the alternate reading of the Psalms and Hymns which
cause a confused murmure in the Congregation, whereby what
is read is less intelligible, and therefore unedifying, may be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
The Minister being appointed for the people in all publick
services appertaining unto God, and the Holy Scriptures, both
of the Old and New Testament, intimating the peoples part in
publick prayer to be only with silence and reverence to attend
thereunto, and to declare their consent in the cloze, by saying
<hi>Amen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. That in regard the Letany (though otherwise containing in
it many holy petitions) is so framed, that the petitions for a
great part are uttered only by the people, which wee think not
to be so consonant to Scripture, which makes the Minister the
mouth of the people to God in prayer, the particulars thereof
may be composed into one solemn prayer to be offered by the
Minister unto God for the people.</p>
            <p>5. That there be nothing in the Liturgy which may seem to
countenance the Observation of <hi>Lent,</hi> as a <hi>Religious Fast;</hi> the
example of Christs fasting forty daies and nights, being no more
imitable, nor intended for the imitation of a Christian, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other of his miraculous works were, or than <hi>Moses</hi> his forty
daies fast was for the Jews: And the Act of Parliament 5. <hi>Eliz.</hi>
forbidding abstinence from flesh to bee observed upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a politick consideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and punishing all those who
by preaching, teaching, writing, or open speeches, shall notifie
that the forbearing of flesh, is of any necessity for the saving of
the soul, or that it is the service of God, otherwise, than as other
politick Laws are.</p>
            <p>6. That the Religious Observation of Saints-daies appointed
to be kept as Holy-daies, and the Vigils thereof without any
foundation (as wee conceive) in Scripture, may be omitted. That
if any be retained, they may be called <hi>Festivals,</hi> and not <hi>Holy-Daies,</hi>
nor made equal with the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> nor have any peculiar
service appointed for them, nor the people bee upon such daies
forced wholly to abstain from work; And that the names of all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102298:8"/>
others now inserted in the Calender which are not in the first and
second books of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, may be left out.</p>
            <p>7. That the gift of Prayer, being one special Qualification for
the work of the Ministry bestowed by Christ in order to the Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of his Church, and to bee exercised for the profit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
thereof, according to its various and emergent necessity; It
is desired, that there may bee no such imposition of the Liturgy,
as that the exercise of that gift bee thereby <hi>totally excluded</hi> in any
part of publick worship. And further, considering the great age
of some Ministers, and infirmities of others, and the variety of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
services oft-times concurring upon the same day, whereby
it may bee inexpedient to require every Minister, at all times to
read the whole; It may bee left to the discretion of the Minister,
to omit <hi>part of it,</hi> as occasion shall require: which liberty wee
finde to bee allowed even in the first Common Prayer-Book of
<hi>Edward.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>8. That in regard of the many defects which have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in that version of the Scriptures, which is used throughout
the Liturgy (manifold instances whereof may bee produ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, as
in the Epistle for the first <hi>Sunday</hi> after <hi>Epiphany,</hi> taken out of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
12. 1. Bee yee changed in your shape;</hi> And the Epistle for the
<hi>Sunday</hi> next before <hi>Easter,</hi> taken out of <hi>Philippians 2. 5. Found in
his Apparel as a man,</hi> as also the Epistle for the fourth <hi>Sunday</hi> in
<hi>Lent,</hi> taken out of the fourth of the <hi>Galathians, Mount Sinai is
Agar in Arabia, and bordereth upon the City which is now called Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
The Epistle for St. <hi>Matthews</hi> day taken out of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Epistle of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the 4th. <hi>Wee go not out of kind.</hi> The
Gospel for the second <hi>Sunday</hi> after <hi>Epiphany,</hi> taken out of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of <hi>John, When men bee drunk.</hi> The Gospel for the third
<hi>Sunday</hi> in <hi>Lent,</hi> taken out of the 11th. of <hi>Luke, One house doth fall
upon another.</hi> The Gospel for the Annunciation, taken out of the
first of <hi>Luke, This is the sixth month which was called barren]</hi> and
many other places) wee therefore desire instead thereof the New
Translation allowed by Authority may alone bee used.</p>
            <p>9. That inasmuch as the holy Scriptures are able to make us
wise unto salvation, to furnish us thorougly unto all good works,
and contain in them all things necessary, either in Doctrine to be
beleeved, or in Duty to bee practised; whereas divers chapters of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102298:9"/>
the Apocryphal Books appointed to bee read, are charged to bee,
in both respects, of dubious and uncertain credit: It is therefore
desired, that nothing bee read in the Church <hi>for Lessons,</hi> but the
holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament.</p>
            <p>10. That the Minister bee not required to rehearse any part
of the Liturgy at the Communion-Table, save only those parts
which properly belong to the Lords Supper; and that at such
times only when the said holy Supper is administred.</p>
            <p>11. That as the word <hi>(Minister)</hi> and not <hi>Priest,</hi> or <hi>Curate,</hi> is
used in the <hi>absolution,</hi> and in divers other places; it may through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Book bee so used instead of those two words: and
that instead of the word <hi>Sunday,</hi> the word <hi>Lords-Day,</hi> may bee
every where used.</p>
            <p>12. Because singing of Psalms is a considerable part of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
worship, wee desire that the Version set forth and allowed to
bee sung in Churches, may bee amended, or that wee may have
leave to make use of a purer Version.</p>
            <p>13. That all obsolete words in the Common-Prayer, and such
whose use is changed from their first significancy (as <hi>Aread)</hi>
used in the Gospel for the <hi>Monday,</hi> and <hi>Wednesday</hi> before <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
[Then opened hee their wits]</hi> used in the Gospel for <hi>Easter
Tuesday, &amp;c.</hi> may bee altered unto other words generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and better understood.</p>
            <p>14. That no portions of the Old Testament, or of the Acts
of the Apostles, be called <hi>Epistles,</hi> and read as such.</p>
            <p>15. That whereas throughout the several offices, the phrase is
such as presumes all persons (within the Communion of the
Church) to bee <hi>regenerated, converted,</hi> and in an actual state of
Grace (which had Ecclesiastical Discipline been truly and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
executed, in the exclusion of scandalous and obstinate sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
might bee better supposed: But there having been, and still
being a confessed want of that (as in the Liturgy is acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
it cannot bee rationally admitted in the utmost latitude of
Charity.) Wee desire that this may bee reformed.</p>
            <p>16. That whereas orderly connection of Prayers, and of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Petitions and Expressions, together with a competent
length of the forms used, are tending much to Edification, and to
gain the reverence of people to them. There appears to us too
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102298:9"/>
great a neglect of both, of this order, and of other just Laws, of
Method.</p>
            <div type="topic">
               <head>Particularly.</head>
               <p>1. The Collects are generally short, many of them consisting
but of one, or at most two sentences of Petition; and these gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ushered in with a repeated mention of the Name and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of God, and presently concluding with the Name and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of Christ; whence are caused many unnecessary intercisions
and abruptions, which when many Petitions are to bee offered
at the same time, are neither agreeable to Scriptural Examples,
nor suited to the gravity and seriousness of that holy duty.</p>
               <p>2. The Prefaces of many Collects have not any clear and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
respect to the following Petitions; and particular Petitions
are put together, which have not any due order, nor evident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
one with another, nor suitableness with the occasions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they are used, but seem to have fallen in rather <hi>casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
than from an orderly contrivance.</p>
               <p>It is desired, that instead of those various Collects, there may
bee one Methodical and intire form of Prayer composed out of
many of them.</p>
               <p>17. That whereas the Publick Liturgy of a Church should in
reason comprehend the sum of all such sins as are ordinarily to
bee confessed in prayer by the Church, and of such petitions and
thanksgivings as are ordinarily by the Church to bee put up to
God, and the Publick Catechisms, or Systems of Doctrine, should
summarily comprehend all such Doctrines as are necessary to be
beleeved, and these explicitly set down: The present Liturgy as
to all these seems very defective.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="topic">
               <head>Particularly.</head>
               <p>1. There is no preparatory Prayer in our addresse to God for
Assistance or Acceptance; yet many Collects in the midst of the
Worship have little or nothing else.</p>
               <p>2. The Confession is very defective, not clearly expressing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
sin, nor sufficiently enumerating actual sins, with their
aggravations; but consisting only of generals: Whereas Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
being the exercise of Repentance, ought to bee more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:102298:10"/>
3 There is also a great defect as to such forms of publick praise
and Thanksgiving, as are suitable to Gospel-worship.</p>
               <p>4 The whole body of the Common-prayer also consisteth very
much of meer generals: as, <hi>(To have our prayers heard,) To bee
kept from all evil, and from all enemies, and all adversity, that wee
may do Gods will;</hi> without any mention of the particulars in which
these generals exist.</p>
               <p>5 The Catechisme is defective as to many necessary Doctrines
of our Religion: some even of the <hi>essentials</hi> of Christianity not
mentioned except in the Creed, and there not so explicite as ought
to bee in a Catechisme.</p>
               <p>18 Because this Liturgie containeth the imposition of divers
Ceremonies which from the first Reformation have by sundry
Learned and Pious men been judged unwarrantable, as</p>
               <p>1 That Publick Worship may not bee celebrated by any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
that dare not wear a Surpless.</p>
               <p>2 That none may Baptize, nor bee Baptized, without the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient
image of the Cross, which hath at least the semblance of a
Sacrament of Humane Institution, being used as an ingageing
signe in our first and solemne Covenanting with Christ, and the
duties whereunto wee are really obliged by Baptisme, being
more expresly fixed to that airy sign than to this holy Sacrament.</p>
               <p>3 That none may receive the Lords Supper that dare not
kneel in the act of receiving; but the Minister must exclude all
such from the Communion: although such kneeling not only
differs from the practice of Christ and of his Apostles, but (at
least on the Lords day) is contrary to the practice of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, for many hundred years after, and forbidden by
the most Venerable Councils that ever were in the Christian
world. All which Impositions, are made yet more grievous, by
that <hi>subscription</hi> to their <hi>lawfulness,</hi> which the Canon exacts, and
by the heavy punishment upon the <hi>non</hi>-observance of them which
the Act of Uniformity inflicts.</p>
               <p>And it being doubtful whether God hath given power unto
men, to institute in his Worship such mystical Teaching signs,
which not being necessary <hi>in genere,</hi> fall not under the Rule of
<hi>doing all things decently, orderly,</hi> and to <hi>edification,</hi> and which
once granted will upon the same reason, open a door to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102298:10"/>
Imposition of Numerous Ceremonies of which St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
complained in his daies; and the things in controversie
being in the judgement of the Imposers confessedly <hi>indifferent,</hi>
who do not so much as pretend any real goodness in them of
themselves, otherwise than what is derived from their being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and consequently the Imposition ceasing, that will cease
also, and the Worship of God not become <hi>indecent</hi> without
them.</p>
               <p>Whereas on the other hand in the judgement of the Opposers
they are by some held sinful, and unlawful in themselves, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
very inconvenient and unsuitable to the simplicity of
Gospel-Worship, and by all of them very grievous and burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
and therefore not at all fit to bee put in ballance with the
Peace of the Church, which is more likely to be promoted by
their removal, than continuance: Considering also how tender
our Lord and Saviour himself is of weak Brethren, declaring it
much better for a man to have a mill-stone hanged about his
neck, and bee cast into the depth of the Sea, than to offend one of
his little ones: And how the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> (who had as great a
Legislative Power in the Church, as any under Christ) held him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
obliged by that Common Rule of Charity, not to lay a
stumbling block, or an occasion of offence before a weak Brother,
chusing rather not to eat flesh whiles the world stands (though in
it self a thing lawful) then offend his Brother for whom Christ
died: Wee cannot but desire that these Ceremonies may not be
imposed on them, who judge such Impositions a Violation of the
Royalty of Christ, and an impeachment of his Laws as in insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
and are under the holy awe of that which is written, <hi>Deut.
12. 32. (What thing soever I command you, observe to do it) Thou
shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it)</hi> but that there may bee
either a total abolition of them, or at least such a liberty, that
those who are unsatisfied concerning their lawfulness or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency,
may not bee compelled to the practice of them, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
to them. But may bee permitted to enjoy their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
Function, and Communion with the Church without
them.</p>
               <p>The rather because these Ceremonies have for above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years been the fountain of manifold evils in this Church
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102298:11"/>
and Nation, occasioning fad divisions between Ministers and
Ministers, as also between Ministers and People, exposing many
Orthodox, Pious, and Peaceable Ministers, to the displeasure of
their Rulers, casting them on the edge of the penal Statutes, to
the loss not only of their Livings and Liberties, but also of their
opportunities for the service of Christ, and his Church; and
forcing people, either to worship God in such a manner as their
own consciences condemn, or doubt of, or else to forsake our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
as thousands have done: And no better fruits than
these can bee looked for from the retaining and imposing of these
Ceremonies, unless wee could presume, that all His Majesties
Subjects should have the same subtilty of judgement to discern
even to a Ceremony, how far the power of man extends in the
things of God, which is not to bee expected, or should yeeld Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to all the Impositions of men concerning them, without
inquiring into the will of God, which is not to bee desired.</p>
               <p>Wee do therefore, most earnestly entreat the Right Reverend
Fathers and Brethren, to whom these Papers are delivered, as
they tender the glory of God, the honour of Religion, the Peace
of the Church, the service of His Majesty in the accomplishment
of that happy Union, which His Majesty hath so abundantly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
his desires of, to joyn with us in importuning his most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Majesty, that his most gracious indulgence, as to these Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
granted in his Royal Declaration may bee confirmed
and continued to us and our posterities, and extended to such as
do not yet enjoy the benefit thereof.</p>
               <p>19. As to that Passage in His Majesties Commission, where
wee are authorized, and required to compare the present Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
with the most antient Liturgies which have been used in the
Church, in the purest and most primitive times: Wee have in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to His Majesties Commission, made enquiry, but cannot
finde any Records of known credit, concerning any intire forms
of Liturgy, within the first three hundred years which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
to bee, as the most Primitive, so the purest ages of the
Church: Nor any Imposition of Liturgies upon any National
Church for some hundreds of years after: Wee finde indeed
some Liturgical forms Fathered upon St. <hi>Basil,</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and
St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> but wee have not seen any Copies of them, but such
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102298:11"/>
as give us sufficient evidence to conclude them either wholly spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
or so interpolated, that wee cannot make a judgement
which in them hath any Primitive Authority.</p>
               <p>Having thus in <hi>general</hi> expressed our desires, wee come now
to <hi>particulars,</hi> which wee finde numerous, and of a various na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
some wee grant are of inferiour Consideration, verbal ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that material (which were they not in the Publick Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of so famous a Church, wee should not have mentioned) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
dubious and disputable, as not having a clear foundation in
Scripture for their warrant: but some there bee that seem to bee
corrupt, and to carry in them a repugnancy to the Rule of the
Gospel; and therefore have administred just matter of Exception
and offence to many, truly religious, and peaceable; not of a
private station only, but learned and judicious Divines, as well
of other Reformed Churches, as of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ever
since the Reformation.</p>
               <p>Wee know much hath been spoken and written by way of
Apology, in answer to many things that have been objected;
but yet the doubts and scruples of tender consciences still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
or rather are increased. Wee do humbly conceive it
therefore a work worthy of those wonders of Salvation, which
God hath wrought for His Majesty now on the Throne, and for
the whole Kingdome, and exceedingly becoming the Ministers
of the Gospel of Peace, with all holy moderation and tenderness,
to indeavour the removal of every thing out of the Worship of
God, which may justly offend or grieve the spirits of sober and
godly people. The things themselves that are desired to bee
removed, not being of the foundation of Religion, nor the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials
of Publick Worship, nor the removal of them any way
tending to the prejudice of the Church or State; Therefore
their continuance, and rigorous Imposition, can no waies be able
to countervail the laying aside of so many pious and able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and the unconceivable grief that will arise to multitudes of
His Majesties most loyal and peaceable Subjects, who upon all
occasions are ready to serve him with their prayers, estates, and
lives. For the preventing of which evils, wee humbly desire that
these particulars following, may bee taken into serious and tender
Consideration.</p>

delivered then the other parts of the Catechism, in short Answers fitted to

of the Creed, the Commandments, and the Lords Prayer.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Whether it were not convenient to add (what seems to be

not onely an Answer to our Exceptions against the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Liturgie; but also several Concessions, wherein you seem
willing to joyn with us in the Alteration and Reformation of it: Our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
were so far raised, as that we promised our selves to find your
Concessions so considerable, as would have greatly conduced to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our much-to-be-lamented Divisions, the setling of the Nation in Peace,
and the satisfaction of tender Consciences, according to his Majesties most
gracious Declaration, and his Royal Commission in pursuance thereof:
But having taken a survey of them, we finde our selves exceedingly disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and that they will fall far short of attaining those happy Ends,
for which this Meeting was first designed; as may appear both by the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the Concessions, and the inconsiderableness of them, they being for
the most part Verbal and Literal, rather then Real and Substantial; for
in them you allow not the laying aside of the reading of the <hi>Apocrypha</hi>
for Lessons, though it shut out some hundreds of Chapters of Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
and sometimes the Scripture it self is made to give way to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphal</hi>
Chapters. You plead against the addition of the <hi>Doxologie</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102298:23"/>
unto the Lords Prayer. You give no liberty to omit the too frequent repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> nor of the Lords Prayer in the same publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
nor do you yeild that the <hi>Psalms</hi> be read in the new Translation, nor
the word <hi>[Priest]</hi> to be changed for <hi>[Minister</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,]</hi> though both
have been yeilded unto in the <hi>Scotish Liturgie.</hi> You grant not the omission
of the Responsals, no not in the <hi>Letany</hi> it self, though the Petitions be so
framed, as the People make the Prayer, and not the Minister; nor to read
the Communion-Service in the Desk, when there is no Communion;
but in the late Form instead thereof, it is enjoyned to be done at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
though there be no <hi>Rubrick</hi> in the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> requiring
it. You plead for the Holiness of <hi>Lent,</hi> contrary to the Statute. You
indulge not the omission of any one Ceremony. You will force men to kneel
at the Sacrament, and yet not put in that excellent <hi>Rubrick</hi> in the <hi>v.</hi> and
<hi>vi.</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. which would much conduce to the satisfaction of many
that scruple it. And whereas divers Reverend Bishops and Doctors, in a
Paper in print before these unhappy Wars began, yeilded to the laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of the Cross, and the making many material alterations; you, after
twenty years sad calamities and Divisions, seem unwilling to grant what
they of their own accord then offered. You seem not to grant that the
clause of the fourth Commandment in the Common-Prayer-Book, <hi>(The
Lord blessed the seventh day)</hi> should be altered according to the <hi>Hebr.</hi>
Exod. 20. <hi>The Lord blessed the Sabbath day.</hi> You will not change
the word <hi>Sunday</hi> into the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> nor adde any thing to make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between Holy-days that are of Humane Institution, and the Lords
Day, that is questionless of Apostolical practice. You will not alter <hi>Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sin</hi> in the Letany into <hi>Heynous Sin,</hi> though it hints to us that some sins
are in their own nature Venial; nor that Answer in the Catech. of <hi>Two
Sacraments onely generally necessary to salvation,</hi> although it inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
that there are other New Testaments Sacraments, though <hi>Two</hi>
onely necessary to Salvation. You speak of singing <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by Authority, by way of contempt, calling them <hi>Hopkins</hi> Psalms:
And though singing of Psalms be an Ordinance of God, yet you call it
one of our principal parts of Worship, as if it were disclaimed by you.
And are so far from countenancing the use of conceived Prayer in the
publick Worship of God, (though we never intended thereby the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of set Forms) as that you seem to dislike the use of it even in the
Pulpit, and heartily desire a total restraint of it in the Church. You will
not allow the omission of the <hi>Benedicite,</hi> nor a Psalm to be read instead
of it; nor so much as abate the reading of the Chapters out of the Old
<pb facs="tcp:102298:23"/>
Testament and the <hi>Acts,</hi> for the Epistles: But rather then you will gratifie us
therein, you have found out a new Device, that the Minister shall say (for
the Epistle) you will not so much as leave out in the Collect for <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas-day</hi>
these words <hi>(this day)</hi> though at least, it must be a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
and cannot be true <hi>stylo veteri, &amp; novo.</hi> In publick Baptism
you are so far from giving a Liberty to the Parent to answer for his own
Child, (which seems most reasonable) as that you force him to the use
of Sureties, and cause them to answer in the name of the Infant, that he
doth believe, and repent, and forsake the Devil and all his works; which
doth much f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vour the <hi>Anabaptistical</hi> Opinion for the necessity of an actual
profession of Faith and Repentance in order to Baptism. You will not
leave the Minister in the Visitation of the Sick, to use his judgement or
discretion in absolving the sick person, or giving the Sacrament to him,
but enjoyn both of them, though the person to his own judgement seem
never so unfit: neither do you allow the Minister to pronounce the Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
in a Declarative and Conditional way, but absolutely, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionately.
And even in one of your Concessions, in which we suppose
you intend to accommodate with us, you rather widen then heal the breach;
for in your last <hi>Rubr.</hi> before the <hi>Catech.</hi> you would have the words thus
altered, <hi>That children being baptized, have all things necessary for
salvation; and dying before they commit any actual sin, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
saved, though they be not confirmed:</hi> Which Assertion,
if understood of all Infants, even of Heathen, is certainly false; and if
onely of the Infants of Christians, is doubtful, and contrary to the
judgement of many learned Protestants, and will give little satisfaction to
us or others: some more we might name, which for brevities sake we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
All which considered, we altogether despair of that happy success
which Thousands hope and wait for from this his Majesties Commission;
unless God shall incline your hearts for the Peace and Vnion of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to a more considerable and satisfactory alteration of the Liturgie. In
which that we may the better prevail, we here tender a Reply to your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
both against our general and particular Exceptions; of which we
desire a serious perusal, and candid interpretation. We have divided
both your Preface and Answer into several Sections, that so you might
more easily understand to which of the particulars both in the one and in
the other our Reply doth refer.</p>

That passed between the
COMMISSIONERS
Appointed by his Majesty for the
Alteration of the
Common-Prayer, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THe strain of these Papers we fear is like to perswade
many that your designe is not the same with ours.<note place="margin">Reply.</note>
Being assured, that it is our Duty to do what we
can to the peace and concord of Believers, especially
when we had the past and present Calamities of these
Nations to urge us, and his Majesties Commands
and gratious Promises to encourage us, we judged the fittest means
to be by making known the hindrances of our Concord, and without
reviving the remembrance of those things that tend to exasperate,
to apply our selves with due submission to those that may contribute
much to our recovery; and without personal reflections, to propose
the Remedies which we knew would be most effectual, and humbly
and earnestly to petition you for your consent. But in stead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
or amicable Debates in order to the removal of our differences,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102298:25"/>
we have received from you a Paper abounding with sharp Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as if your work were to prove us bad, and make us odious; which
as it is attempted upon mistake, by unrighteous means, so were it
accomplished, we know not how it will conduce to the Concord
which ought to be our common end. If we understand Christs
Commission, or the Kings, and our duty as Christians, or as Ministers,
our work now assigned us, was not to search after, and aggravate the
faults of one another, (though of our own in season we are willing to
hear) but to review the Liturgie, and agree upon such alterations,
diminutions and enlargements as are needful to our common unity
and peace. What is amiss in us, we shall thankfully accept your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
assistance to discover; but we take not that for the Question
which his Majesty called us to debate, nor do our judgements or
dispositions lead us to Recriminations, nor to cast such impediments
in the way of our desired accord: And were it not that our Calling,
and our Masters work are concerned somewhat in our just Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we should not trouble you with so low, so private and unnecessary
a work, but leave such Causes to the righteous Judge, who will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
impartially, infallibly and finally decide them.</p>

               <p>BEfore we come to the Proposals,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> it will be perhaps necessary to say a
word or two to the <hi>Preface,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> wherein they begin with a thankful
acknowledgement of his Majesties most Princely condescention; to which
we shall onely say, That we conceive the most real Expression of their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
had been an hearty complyance with his Majesties earnest and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
request for the use of the present Liturgie, at least so much of it as
they acknowledge by these Papers to be lawful: how far they have in this
expressed their thankfulness, the world sees, we need not say.]</p>
               <p>1. AS we hope it is no matter of offence to acknowledge his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
gratious condescention;<note place="margin">Reply.</note> so when his Majesty by his
Declaration hath granted us some liberty as to the use of the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
before the alteration, and hath by his Commission engaged us in
a Consultation for the alteration of it; we conceive our Brethren
(nor the world, to whose observation they appeal) had no warrant to
censure us as unthankful to his Majesty, because of our present for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
to use it, or part of it, before the intended alteration; at least
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102298:25"/>
till they had heard us speak for our selves, and render an account of
the reasons of our forbearance, and they had gone before us more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarily
in their own obedience to his Majesties Declaration. As to
our own Consciences, if we thought not the Common-Prayer-Book
to be guilty of the general and particular faults which we have laid
open to you, we durst not have found fault with it: and while we
took it to be a defective, disorderly and inconvenient mode of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
it would be our sin to use it of choice, while we may prefer a more
convenient way, what ever we ought to do in case of necessity, when
we must worship God inconveniently, or not at all. And as to our
people, for whose edification and not destruction we have our power
or offices, we have taken that course, as far as we are able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
which most probably tended to their good, and to prevent their
hurt and separation from the Church: and consequently, that course
which did most conduce to his Majesties ends, and to his real service,
and the Churches peace: none of which would be promoted by our
obtruding that upon our people, which we know them unable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest,
or by our hasty offending them with the use of that, which we are
forced to blame, and are endeavouring to correct and alter. And we
see not how it can be justly intimated that we use no part of it, when
we use the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Commandments,</hi> the <hi>Psalms,</hi>
the <hi>Chapters,</hi> and some other parts; and how much more you expect
we should have used, that we might have escaped this brand of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
we know not. But we know that Charity suffereth long,
and thinketh no evil, <hi>(1 Cor. 13 4, 5.)</hi> and that we have not attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to obtrude any mode of Worship on our Brethren, but desired
the liberty to use things of that nature as may conduce to the benefit
of our Flocks: And as we leave them to judge what is most benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to their own Flocks, who know them, and are upon the place;
so it is but the like freedome which we desire: We are loath to hurt
our people knowingly. The time is short; if you will answer our
reasonable Proposals, it will not be too late at the expiration of our
Commission, or the date of the reformed Liturgie, to use it: greater
liberty hath been used about Liturgies in purer times of the Church,
with less offence and accusation.</p>
               <p>[It can be no just cause of offence to mind them of their duty,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> as they do
us of ours;<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> telling us, It is our duty to imitate the Apostles practise in a
special manner; to be tender of the Churches peace, and to advise of such

Expedients, as may conduce to the healing of breaches, and uniting those
that differ: for preserving of the Churches peace we know no bettter nor
more efficatious way then our set Liturgie, there being no such way to keep
us from Schism, as to speak all the same thing, according to the Apostle.]</p>
               <p>If you look to the time past,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> by our <hi>Duties</hi> we suppose you mean
our <hi>Faults;</hi> for it is not <hi>Duty</hi> when it's past: If you in these words
respect onely the time present and to come, we reply, 1. The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
we are assured will not be a less, but a more probable means of
Concord after the desired Reformation then before; the defects and
inconveniences make it <hi>less fit</hi> to attain the end. 2. VVhether the
Apostle by <hi>[speaking the same thing,]</hi> did mean either <hi>[all using this
Liturgie of ours,]</hi> or <hi>[all using any one form of Liturgie as to the
words]</hi> may easily be determined. This is of much later date, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you will denominate the <hi>whole</hi> form of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and some
little parts. And those that affirm, that the Apostles then had any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
must undertake the task of proving it, and excusing the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
for loosing and dis-using so precious a Relict; which if preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
would have prevented all our strifes about these things. And in
the mean time they must satisfie our Arguments for the Negative:
as, 1. If a Liturgie had been indited by the Apostles for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
being by universal Officers inspired by the Holy Ghost, and so
of universal use, it would have been used and preserved by the Church
as the Holy Scriptures were. But so it was not. <hi>Ergo,</hi> no such Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
was indited by them for the Churches. 2. If a prescript
form of words had been delivered them, there would have been no
such need of exhorting them to <hi>speak the same thing,</hi> for the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
would have held them close enough to that. And if the meaning
had been <hi>[see that you use the same Liturgie,]</hi> some word or other to
some of the Churches would have acquainted us with the existence of
such a thing; and some reproofs we should have found of those that
used various Liturgies, or formed Liturgies of their own, or used
extemporary Prayers; and some express Exhortations to use the
same Liturgie or Forms: but the holy Scripture is silent in all those
matters. It is apparent therefore that the Churches then had no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie,
but took liberty of extemporate Expressions, and spoke in the
things of God, as men do in other matters, with a natural plainness
and seriousness, suiting their Expressions to the subjects and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And though Divisions began to disturb their Peace and holy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102298:26"/>
Orders, the Apostle in stead of prescribing them a form of Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine
Services for their unity and concord, do exhort them to use
their gifts and liberties aright, and speak the <hi>same thing</hi> for <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
avoiding Disagreements, though they used not the <hi>same
words. 3. Just. Martyr, Tertull.</hi> and others sufficiently inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
to us, that the Churches quickly after the Apostles, did
use the personal Abilities of their Pastours in Prayer, and give us
no hint of any such Liturgie of Apostolical fabrication and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and therefore doubtless there was nothing, for it could
not have been so soon lost or neglected. 4. It is ordinary with
those of the contrary Judgement, to tell us that the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Gifts of the Primitive Christians, were the reason why
there were no prescribed forms in those times, and that such
Liturgies came in upon the ceasing of those Gifts: and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.
describeth a way of publick worshipping, unlike to prescript
forms of Liturgie: so that the matter of Fact is proved and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed.
And then how fairly the words of the Apostle, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them <hi>[to speak the same thing,]</hi> are used to prove that he
would have them use the same Forms or Liturgie, we shall not
tell you by any provoking Aggravations of such abuse of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
And indeed for all the miraculous Gifts of those times,
if prescript Forms had been judged by the Apostles to be the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
means for the concord of the Churches, it is most probable
they would have prescribed such: considering, 1. That the
said miraculous Gifts were extraordinary, and belonged not to
all, nor to any at all times; and therefore could not suffice for
the ordinary publick Worship. 2. And those Gifts began even
betimes to be abused, and need the Apostles Canons for their
regulation, which he giveth them in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. without a
prescript Liturgie. 3. Because even then divisions had made not
onely an entrance, but an unhappy progress in the Churches;
to cure which, the Apostle exhorts them oft to Unanimity and
Concord, without exhorting them to read the same, or any
Common-Prayer-Book. 4. Because that the Apostles knew
that perilous times would come, in which men would have
itching ears, and would have heaps of Teachers, and would be
self-willed, and unruly, and divisions, and offences, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
would encrease: and <hi>ergo,</hi> as upon such fore-sight they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited
the holy Scriptures to keep the Church in all Generatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from errour and divisions in points of Doctrine; so the same
reason and care would have moved them to do the same to keep
the Churches in unity in point of VVorship, if indeed they had
taken prescribed Forms to be needful to such an Unity: They
knew that after their departure the Church would never have
the like advantage, infallible, authorized and enabled for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the universal Law of Christ: And seeing in those parts
of VVorship, which are of stated use, and still the same, Forms
might have suited all Ages as this Age, and all Countries as this
Country (in the substance) there can no reason be given, why
the Apostles should leave this undone, and not have performed
it themselves, if they had judged such Forms to be necessary, or
the most desirable means of unity. If they had prescribed them,
1. The Church had been secured from errour in them. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
had been preserved from divisions about the lawfulness
and fitness of them, as receiving them from God. 3. All
Churches and Countries might had one Liturgie, as they have
one Scripture, and so have all spoke the same things. 4. All
Ages would have had the same without innovation, (in all the
parts that require not alteration) whereas now on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
1. Our Liturgies being the Writings of fallible men, are
lyable to errour, and we have cause to fear subscribing to them,
as having nothing contrary to the Word of God. 2. And mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Humane Institution have become the matter of scruple
and contention. 3. And the Churches have had great diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Liturgies. 4. And one Age hath been mending what they
supposed they received from the former faulty, and imperfect:
So that our own which you are so loath to change, hath not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
yet three Generations. And it is most evident, that the
Apostles being entrusted with the delivery of the entire rule of
Faith and Worship, and having such great advantages for our u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and peace, would never have omitted the forming of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
of universal usefulness, to avoid all the foresaid inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
if they had taken this course of unity to be so needful or
desirable as you seem to do. Whereas therefore you say you
know no better or more efficatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s way then our Liturgie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
We reply, 1. The Apostles knew the best way of unity, and of
speaking the same thing in the matters of God: But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
knew not our Liturgie, (nor any Common-Prayer-Book,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102298:27"/>
for ought hath yet been proved.) <hi>Ergo,</hi> the said Liturgie is not
the best way of unity, or speaking the same thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. The
Primitive Church in the next Ages after the Apostles, knew the
best way of unity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they knew not our Liturgie. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
our Liturgie (not known till lately) is not the best way of unity.
If it be said that our Liturgie is ancient, because the <hi>Sursum Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> &amp;c. are ancient: We answer, If indeed it
be those ancient sentences that denominate our Liturgie, we
erave the Justice to be esteemed Users of the Liturgie, and not to
suffer as Refusers of it, as long as we use all that is found in it of
such true antiquity.</p>
               <p>[This experience of former and latter times hath taught us,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> when
the Liturgie was duly observed,<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> we lived in peace; since that was laid

as fancies: we have had continual dissention, which variety of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices

not onely to maintain, but to prefer his own way before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
whence we conceive there is no such way to the preservation of
peace, as for all to return to the strict use and practise of the Form.]</p>
               <p>Pardon us while we desire you to examine whether you speak
as members that suffer with those that suffer,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> or rather as insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the calamities of your Brethren, that is as uncharitable:
you say you lived in peace, but so did not the many thousands
that were fain to seek them peaceable habitations in <hi>Holland,</hi> and
in the deserts of <hi>America;</hi> nor the many thousands that lived in
danger of the High-Commission, or Bishops Courts at home, and
so in danger of every malitious Neighbour that would accuse
them of hearing Sermons abroad, when they had none at home;
or of meeting in a Neighbors house to pray, or of not kneeling in
the receiving of the Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We would not have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
you of these things, but that you necessitate us by pleading
your peace in those days as an Argument for the imposing of the
Liturgie. 2. Might not <hi>Scotland</hi> as strongly argue from this <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
against the Liturgie and say, [Before the Liturgie was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
on us, we had peace, but since then we have had no peace?]
3. When the strict imposing of the strict use and practise of these
Forms was the very thing that disquieted this Nation, (taking in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102298:28"/>
the concomitant Ceremonies and Subscription) when this was
it that bred the divisions which you complain of, and caused the
separations from the Churches, and the troubles in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
it is no better arguing to say, We must return to the strict
use of that Form if we will have peace, then it was in the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
to say, <hi>[We will worship the Queen of Heaven, because then we
had peace and plenty,]</hi> when that was it that deprived them of
peace and plenty; (we compare not the Causes, but the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:)
nor is it any better Argument then if a man in a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
or Ague, that catcht it with voracity or intemperance, should
say, [While I did eat and drink liberally, I had no Dropsie or
Ague, but since my appetite is gone, and I have lived temperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I have had no health; <hi>Ergo,</hi> I must return to my intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
as the onely way to health.] Alas! Is this the use that is
made of all our experiences of the causes and progress of our
Calamities? What have you and we, and all smarted as we
have done, and are you so speedily ready to return to the way
that will engage you in violence against them that should be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to live in peace? If the furnace that should have refined
us, and purified us all to a greater height of love, have but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
us to greater wrath, wo to us, and to the Land that bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us. What doleful things doth this prognosticate you, that
Prisons, or other penalties, will not change mens Judgements:
And if it drive some to comply against their Consciences, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
their Souls, and drive the more conscientious out of the
Land, or destroy their bodies, and breed in mens mindes a root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
opinion, that Bishops that are still hurting and afflicting them,
(even for the things in which they exercise the best of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and cautelously to avoid sin against God) are no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Friends or Edifiers, but Destroyers; alas! who will have
the gain of this? O let us no more bite and devour one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
lest we be devoured one of another, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 15. or Christ be
provoked to decide the Controversie more sharply then we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
or expect. 4. But really, hath liberty to forbear the Liturgie
produced such divisions as you mention? The licence or conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
that was granted to Hereticks, Apostates, and foul-mouthed
raylers against the Scripture, Ministry, and all Gods Ordinances,
indeed bred confusions in the Land; but it is to us matter of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
to observe (clean contrary to your intimation) how
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102298:28"/>
little discord there was in Prayer, and other parts of Worship a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all the Churches throughout the three Nations, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
in Doctrine, and that forbore the Liturgie. It is wonderful
to us in the review to consider, with what love, and peace, and
concord, they all spoke the same things that were tied to no Form
of words, even those that differed in some points of Discipline,
even to a with-drawing from local Communion with us, yet
strangely agreed with us in Worship. And where have there been
less Heresies, Schisms, then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where there was no such
Liturgie to unite them? If you tell us of those that differ from
us in Doctrine, and are not of us, it is as impertinent to the point
of our own agreement in VVorship, as to tell us of the Papists.</p>
               <p>[And the best expedients to unite us all to that again,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> and so to peace,
are,<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> besides our Prayers to the God of peace, to make us all of one mind
in an house, to labour to get true humility, which would make us think
our Guides wiser, and fitter to order us then we our selves; &amp; Christian
charity, which would teach us to think no evil of our Superiors, but to
judge them rather careful Guides and Fathers to us: which being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
nothing can be imagined justly to hinder us from a ready com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
to this method of service appointed by them, &amp; so live in unity]</p>
               <p>Prayer and Humility are indeed the necessary means of peace:<note place="margin">Reply.</note>
But if you will let us pray for peace in no words but what are
in the Common-Prayer Book, their brevity and unaptness, and
the customariness, that will take off the edge of fervour with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, will not give leave (or help sufficient) to our souls
to work towards God, upon this subject, with that enlarged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
copiousness and freedome as is necessary to due fervour. A
brief transient touch, and away, is not enough to warm the heart
aright; and cold Prayers, are like to have a cold return; and
therefore even for peace sake, let us pray more copiously and
heartily then the Common-Prayer-Book will help us to do.
And whether this be that cause, or whether it be that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book
hath never a Prayer for it self, we finde that
its Prayers prevail not to reconcile many sober, serious persons
to it, that live in faithful fervent Prayer. 2. And for Humility,
we humbly conceive it would most effectually heal us, &amp; by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Pastors of the Church to know that they are not to rule
the flocks as Lords, but as ensamples; not by constraint, but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102298:29"/>
willingly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2, 3. and it would cause them not to think so
lightly of themselves, and so meanly of their Brethren, as to judge
no words fit to be used to God in the publick Worship, but what
they prescribe, and put into our mouths; and that other men are
generally unable to speak sensibly or suitably, unless they tell us
what to say; or that all others are unfit to be trusted with the
expressing of their own desires: Humility would perswade the
Pastors of the Church at least to undertake no more then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
did, and no more to obtrude or impose their own words
upon all others in the publick Worship: if they found any unfit to
be trusted with the expression of their minds in publick Prayer,
they would do what they could to get meeter men in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and till then, they would restrain, and help such as need it;
and not upon that pretence, as much restrain all the ablest Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
as if the whole Church were to be nominated, measured, or
used according to the quality of the most unworthy. And it is
also true, that humility in private persons and inferiours, would
do much to our peace, by keeping them in due submission and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and keeping them from all contentions and divisions,
which proceed from self-conceitedness and pride. But yet, 1. The
humblest, surest Subjects may stumble upon the scruple, whether
Bishops differ not from Presbyters onely in degree, and not in
order or office, (it being a Controversie, and no resolved point
of Faith even among the Papists, whose Faith is too extensive,
and favor too Ecclesiastical, ambition too great) and consequently
they may doubt whether men in the same order, do by Divine
appointment owe obedience unto those that gradually go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them. 2. And they may scruple whether such making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the Governours of their Brethren, make not themselves
in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eed of a different order of office, and so encroach not on the
authority of Christ, who onely maketh Officers purely Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
and whether it be no disloyalty to Christ to own such Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.
3. And among those Divines that are for a threefold Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,
(besides that of Presbyters, who are <hi>Episcopi Gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is)</hi> viz.
general unfixed Bishops, like the Evangelists or Apostles, (in their
measure) and the fixed Bishops of Parochial Churches, that have
Presbyters to assist them, to whom they do preside, and also the
Presidents of larger Synods; yet is it a matter of very great
doubt, whether a fixed Diocesan being the Pastor of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102298:29"/>
Churches, having none under him, that hath the power of
Jurisdiction or Ordination, be indeed a Governor of Christs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
or approbation; and whether Christ will give us any
more thanks for owning them as such, then the King will give us
for owning a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Usurper. Humility alone will not seem to subject
these men to such a Government. 4. And though their <hi>coercive
Magistra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ical power</hi> be easily submitted to, as <hi>from the King,</hi> (how
unfit Subjects soever Church-men are of such a power) yet he
that knoweth his superiours best, doth honour God more, and
supposeth God more infallible then man, and will feel himself
most indispensibly bound by Gods commands, and bound not to
obey man against the Lord. And whereas there is much said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the peoples taking on them to judge of the lawfulness of
things commanded them by superiours, we add, 5. That humble
men may believe that their superiours are fallible; that it is no
impossibility to command things that God forbids; that in such
cases, if we have sufficient means to discern the sinfulness of such
commands, we must make use of them, and must obey God rather
then men; that when the Apostles acted according to such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
<hi>Act.</hi> 4. 19. and <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three VVitnesses, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.
&amp; 3. they all exercised a judgment of discerning upon the matter
of their superiours commands; that not to do so at all, is to make
Subjects Brutes, and so no Subjects, because not rational free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
or to make all Governours to be Gods: and lastly, that it
will not save us from Hell, nor justifie us at Judgement for sinning
against God, to say that superiours commanded us; nor will it
prove all the Martyrs to be sinners and condemned, because they
judged of their superiours commands, and disobeyed them. All
which we say, to shew the insufficiency of the Remedy here by you
propounded, (the humility of Inferiours) unless you will also
add your help; without obedience there is no order or lasting
concord to be expected: And by abasing the eternal God, so far
as to set him and his Laws below a creature, under pretence of
obedience to the creature, no good can be expected, because no
peace with heaven; without which, peace with men is but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy,
hastning each party to destruction: and therefore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
obedience must be given onely to God the absolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.
In all this we suppose that we are all agreed: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
6. and lastly, we must say that the way to make us think
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102298:30"/>
the Bishops to be so wise, and careful Guides and Fathers to us,
is nor for them to seem wiser then the Apostles, and make those
things of standing necessity to the Churches unity, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
never made so; nor to forbid all to preach the Gospel, or
to hold Communion with the Church, that dare not conform to
things unnecessary. Love and tenderness are not used to express
themselves by hurting and destroying men for nothing; and to
silence and reject from Church-Communion for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and in the mean time to perswade men that they love them, is
but to stab or famish all the sick persons in the Hospital or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,

whose throats are too narrow to swallow so big a morsel as we
send them; and when we have done, to tell them, the onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
is for them to believe we love them, and are tender of
them. And who knows not that a man may think well of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
that yet may question whether all that he teacheth or
commandeth him, be lawful?</p>
               <p>[If it be objected,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> That the Liturgie is in any way sinful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
for us to joyn with,<note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> it is but reason that this be first proved evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
before any thing be altered: it is no Argument to say, That
multitudes of sober pious persons scruple the use of it, unless it be
made to appear by evident reasons, that the Liturgie gave the just
grounds to make such scruples. For if the bare pretence of scruples
be suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cient to exempt us from Obedience, all Law and Order is gone.]</p>
               <p>To this passage we humbly crave your consideration of these
Answers:<note place="margin">Reply.</note> 1. VVe have not onely said, that sober pious Persons
scruple the Liturgie, but we have opened to you those defects
and disorders, and corruptions, which must needs make the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of it unlawful, when God might be more fitly served. 2. It
is strange that you must see it first evidently proved unlawful for
men to joyn with the Liturgie, (you mean, we suppose, to joyn
with you in the using of it, or when you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e it) before you will
see reason to alter any thing in it: What if it be onely proved
unlawful for you to impose it, though not for others to joyn with
you when you do impose it, is this no reason to alter it? Should
you not have some care to avoid sin your selves, as well as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
others from it? An inconvenient mode of VVorship is a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102298:30"/>
sin in the Imposer, and in the Chuser, and voluntary User, that
might offer God better, and will not, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13, 14. And yet it may
not be onely lawful, but a duty to him that by violence is necessitated
to offer up that or none. And yet we suppose the Imposers should
see cause to make an Alteration. If you lived where you must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Lords Supper sitting, or not at all, it's like you would be of
this mind your selves. 3. Why should it be called [A bare pretence
of Scruples?] as if you searched the hearts, and knew (not only that
they are upon mistake, but) that they are not real, when the persons
not onely profess them real, but are willing to use all just means that
tend to their satisfaction: they study, read, pray, and will be glad of
Conference with you, at any time, upon equal terms, if they may be
themselves believed. 4. Even groundless scruples about the matter
of an unnecessary Law, which hath that which to the weak both
is and will be an appearance of evil, may be sufficient to make it the
Duty of Rulers to reverse their impositions, though they be not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to justifie the Scrupulous. 5. If a man should think that he
ought not to obey man even when he thinketh it is against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God, though he be uncertain, (as in case of going on an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questioned
Warfare, or doing <hi>Doegs</hi> execution, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> yet it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, that [all Law and Order is gone,] as long as all Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
stand that are visibly subservient to the Laws of God, and to his
Soveraignty, or consistent with them, and when the Subject sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
to suffering where he dare not obey.</p>
               <p>[On the contrary we judge,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> that if the Liturgie should be altered as is
there required,<note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> not onely a multitude, but the generality of the soberest and
most loyal Children of the Church of <hi>England</hi> would justly be offended,
since such an alteration would be a virtual Concession that this Liturgie
were an intolerable burden to tender consciences, a direct cause of Schism,
a superstitious usage, (upon which pretences it is here desired to be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
which would at once both justifie all those which have so obstinately
separated from it, as the onely pious, tender-conscienced men, and condemn
all those that have adhered to that, in conscience of their duty and loyalty,
with their loss or hazard of estates, lives and fortunes, as men superstitious,
schismatical, and void of Religion and Conscience. For this reason, and

                  </gap>se that follow, we cannot consent to such an alteration as is desired, till
these pretences be proved, which we conceive in no wise to be done in these
Papers; and shall give Reasons for this our Judgement.]</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:102298:31"/>
If the Liturgie should be altered,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> as is here required, and desired by
us, that it could be no just offence to the generality (or any) of the
soberest and most loyal Children of the Church, (as you speak) is
easie to be proved, by laying together the considerations following:
1. Because it is by themselves confessed to be alterable, as not having
it self its formal Constitution, till less then two hundred years ago.
2. And themselves affirm it to be not necessary to salvation, but a thing
indifferent, while they exclude all higher institutions from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Church. 3. They confess it lawful to serve God without
this Liturgie, without which he was served by other Churches above
1460 years, and without which he is now served by other Churches,
when the contrary minded doubt whether with it he be lawfully ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
4. Those that desire the alteration, desire no more then to serve
God as the Churches did in the days of the Apostles, that had their
most infallible conduct. 5. And they offer also such Forms as are
more unquestionable as to their congruency to the Word of God, and
to the nature of the several parts of Worship. 6. And yet though
they desire the surest concord, and an universal Reformation, they
desire not to impose on others what they offer, but can thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a Liberty to use what is to their own Consciences most unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionably
safe, while other men use that which they like better. So
that set all this together, with the consideration of the necessity of
the preaching the Word, and Communion that is hereupon denyed,
and you may see it proved, That to have such a Liturgie so altered,
that is confessed alterable, for so desirable an end, for the use onely of
those that cannot well use it, without urging others to any thing that
they do themselves account unlawful, cannot be a matter of just of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to the generality of sober Children of the Church, nor to any
one. And as to the reason given, it is apparently none: For, 1. Of
those that scruple the unlawfulness of it, there are many that will not
peremptorily affirm it unlawful, and condemn all that use it, but they
dare not use it doubtingly themselves. 2. When our Papers were
before you, we think it not just that you should say that it's here desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be altered, on the pretence that it is a direct cause of Schism,
and a superstitious usage: Have we any such expressions? If we
have, let them be recited; if not, it is hard that this should even by
you be thus affirmed as is said by us, which we have not said. VVe
have said, [That the Ceremonies have been the Fountain of much
evil, occasioning divisions, but not what you charge us to have said

in words or sence. 3. And may not you alter them without appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
or seeming to approve the reason upon which the alteration is
desired, when you have so great store of other reasons? The King
in his Declaration is far enough from seeming to own the Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the things which he was pleased graciously to alter so far as is
there exprest. If a Patient have a conceit that some one thing would
kill him, if he took it, the Physitian may well forbear him in that one
thing, when it is not necessary to his health, without owning his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
against it. If his Majesty have Subjects so weak as to contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
things indifferent, and if both sides erre, one thinking them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and the other sinful; may he not gratifie either of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
seeming to approve their errour? By this reason of yours he is
by other men in such a case necessitated to sin; for if he settle those
things which some count necessary, he seems to approve of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that they are necessary; if he take them down when others call
them sinful, he seems to own their charge of the sinfulness. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he needeth not to do either; he may take them down, or leave
them indifferent; professedly for unity and peace, and professedly
disown the Errours on both sides. We are sorry if any did esteem
these Forms and Ceremonies any better then mutable indifferent
Modes and Circumstances of Worship; and did hazard estate or life
for them as any otherwise esteemed: And we are sorry, that by our
Divisions the Adversary of Peace hath gotten so great an advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, as that the <hi>Argument</hi> against necessary charitable forbearance
is fetch'd from the interest of the reputation of the contending Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that things may not be abated to others which you confess are
indifferent and alterable, and which many of them durst not use,
though to save their lives. And this because it will make them
thought the pious, tender conscienc'd men, and make others thought
worse of. But with whom will it have these effects? Those that you
call the generality of the sober loyal children of the Church, will
think never the worse of themselves, because others have liberty to
live by them, without these things: and the rest, whose liberties you
deny, will think rather the worse of you, then the better, for denying
them their liberty in the worshipping of God. You undoubtedly
argue here against the interest of Reputation, which you stand for:
Your Prefaces to your Indulgencies, and your open Professions; and
(if you will needs have it so) your own Practises, will tell the world
loud enough, that the things which you adhered to with so great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102298:32"/>
are still lawful in your Judgement, and it will be you honour,
and adde to your reputation, to abate them to others, when it is in
your power to be more severe. And if you refuse it, their sufferings
will tell the world loud enough, that for their parts they still take
them to be things unlawful. As for the Reasons by them produced
to prove them sinful, they have been publickly made known in the
Writings of many of them; in <hi>Ames</hi> his fresh suit against the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and in the Abridgement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in <hi>Bradshaws, Nicolls,</hi> and
other mens Writings.</p>
               <p>[To the first general Proposal,<note place="margin">Answer. <hi>Prop. a.</hi> 1.</note> we answer: That as to that part of it
which requires that the matter of the Liturgie may not be private opinion
or fancy,<note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> that being the way to perpetuate Schism; the Church hath been
careful to put nothing into the Liturgie, but that which is either evidently
the Word of God, or what hath been generally received in the Catholick
Church; neither of which can be called private opinion: and if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
can be proved, we wish it out of the Liturgie.]</p>
               <p>VVe call those Opinions which are not determined Certainties;<note place="margin">Reply.</note>
and though the greater number should hold them as Opinions, they
are not therefore the Doctrines of the Church, and therefore might
be called private Opinions: but indeed we used not the word, (that
we can finde:) the thing that we desired, was, that the materials of
the Liturgie may consist of nothing doubtful, or questioned among
pious, learned and Orthodox persons.] We said also, That the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Church-Communion to things of doubtful disputation, hath
been in all Ages the ground of Schism and Separation, (which is not
to say, that the Liturgie it self is a superstitious usage, or a direct
cause of Schism.) And we cited the words of a learned man, (Mr.
<hi>Hales)</hi> not as making every word our own, but as a Testimony <hi>ad
hominem,</hi> because he was so highly valued by your selves, (as we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
and therefore we thought his words might be more regarded
by you then our own. 2. Where you say, [That the Church hath been
careful to put nothing in the Liturgie, but that which is either evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
the Word of God, or that which had been generally received
in the Catholick Church:] VVe reply, 1. VVe suppose there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or nothing now controverted between us, which you will say is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
the VVord of God, either the Forms or Ceremonies, or any
of the rest. 2. If by [in the Church,] you mean [not by the Church,]
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102298:32"/>
but by any part in the Church; how shall we know that they did
well? And if by [the generality] you mean not All, but the Greater
part, you undertake the proof of that which is not easie to be proved;
it being so hard to judge of the majority of Persons in the Catholick
Church, in any notable differences. VVe do take it for granted that
you limit not the Catholick Church, as the Papists do, to the Confines
of the Roman Empire; but indeed we can onely wish, that your As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
were true, while we must shew it to be untrue, if you speak of
the Primitive Church, or of an universality of time, as well as place;
(if not, it's more against you, that the Primitive Catholick Church
was against you.) The very thing in question that containeth the rest,
[That it's needful to the peace of the Church, that all the Churches
under one Prince should use one Form of Liturgie,] was not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Catholick Church, nor by the generality in it; when it is
so well known that they used diversitie of Liturgies and Customes in
the Roman Empire. The generality in the Catholick Church recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not the Lords Supper kneeling, at least on any Lords days, when
it was forbidden by divers general Councils, and when this prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was generally received as an Apostolical tradition: VVe have
not heard it proved, that the Surplis or Cross, as used with us, were
received by the universal Church: it is a private Opinion not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Catholick Church, that [It is requisite that no man should
come to the holy Communion, but with a full trust in Gods mercy,
and with a quiet conscience,] though it be every mans duty to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>pro statu viatoris,</hi> yet it is not requisite that no man come till he be
perfect. He that hath but a weak Faith, (though not a full trust) must
come to have it strenghtened: and he that hath an unquit conscience,
must come to receive that mercy which may quiet it. It is a private
Opinion, and not generally received in the Catholick Church, [That
one of the people] may make the publick Confession at the Sacrament
in the name of all those that are minded to receive the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
It is a private, and not generally received distinction, that the
Body of Christ makes clean our bodies, and his Blood washeth our
souls. It is a doubtful Opinion, to speak easily, that when the Lords
Supper is delivered with a Prayer not made in the Receivers name,
but thus directed to him by the Minister, [The Body of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> preseve thy body and soul,] it is so intolerable a thing
for the Receiver not to kneel in hearing the prayer, that he must
else be thrust from the Communion of the Church, and yet that no
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102298:33"/>
Minister shall kneel that indeed doth pray: But he may pray standing,
and the Hearers be cast out for standing at the same words. It is not
a generally received, but a private Opinion, [That every Parishioner
(though impenitent, and conscious of his utter unfitness, and though
he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e in despair, and think he shall take his own damnation) must be
forced to receive thrice a year; when yet even those that have not
[A full trust in Gods mercy,] or have not [a quiet conscience,] were
before pronounced so uncapable, as that none such should come to
the Communion.] Abundance more such Instances may be given,
to shew how far from truth the Assertion is, that [The Church hath
been careful to put nothing into the Liturgie, but that which is either
evidently the Word of God, or which hath been generally received in
the Catholick Church,] unless you speak of some unhappy unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful
Carefulness. But we thankfully accept of your following words,
[And if the contrary can be proved, we wish it out of the Liturgie,]
which we intreat you to pefso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m, and impartially receive our proofs.
But then we must also intreat you, 1. That the Primitive Churches
Judgement and Practise may be preferred before the present decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
much corrupted State. And 2. If Gods Law rather then the
sinful practises of men breaking that Law, may be the Churches Rule
for Worship: For you call us to subscribe to <hi>Art.</hi> 19. that [As the
Church of <hi>Jerusalem, Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> hath erred, so also the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath erred, not onely in their living, and manner of
Ceremonies, but also in matters of Faith: and saith <hi>Rogers,</hi> in <hi>Art.
20.</hi> They are out of the way, which think that either one man, as the
Pope, or any certain Calling of men, as the Clergie, hath power to
decree and appoint Rites or Ceremonies, though of themselves good,
unto the whole Church of God, dispersed over the universal world.]
And indeed, if you would have all that corruption brought into our
Liturgie, and Discipline, and Doctrine, which the Papists, Greeks, and
others that undoubtedly make up the far greater number of the now
universal Church do use; you would deserve no more thanks of God
or man, then he that would have all Kings, and Nobles, and Gentry
levelled with the poor Commons, because the latter are the greater
number; or then he that would have the healthful conformed to the
sick, when an Epidemical Disease hath made them the Majority; or
then he that would teach us to follow a multitude to do evil, and to
break more then the least Commands, because the greater number
break them. We pray you therefore to take it for no justification of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102298:33"/>
any uncertain or faulty passage in our Liturgis, though the greater
number now are guilty of it. 3. And we must beseech you, if the
Churches Judgement or Practise must be urged, that you would do
us the justice as to imitate the ancient Churches in you sense of the
quality, and the mode and measure of using and imposing things, as
well as in the materials used and imposed. Consider not onely [whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you finde such things received by the ancient Churches,] but
also consider how they were received, esteemed and used; whether
as necessary or indifferent; as points of Faith, or doubtful Opinion;
whether forced on others, or left to their free choice. If you finde,
that the generality of the Antient Churches received the White Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
after Baptism, and the tasting of Milk and Honey, as Ceremonies
freely, though generally used; you should not therefore force men
to use them. If you finde, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ennium,</hi> or of
Angels corporeity was generally received as an Opinion, it will not
warrant you to receive either of them as a certain necessary truth. If
you finde, that the general Councils forbad Kneeling in any Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on the Lords days, but without force against Dissenters; you
may not go deny the Sacrament to all that kneel, nor yet forbid them
to keel in praying. So if you finde some little parcels of our Liturgie,
or some of our Ceremonies used as things indifferent, left to choice,
forced upon none, but one Church differing from another in such u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
or observances, this will not warrant you to use the same things
as necessary to order, unity or peace, and to be forced upon all: use
them no otherwise then the Churches used them.</p>
               <p>[We heartily desire,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> that according to this Proposal, great care may be

               <p>The desire of your hearts is the grief of our hearts;<note place="margin">Reply.</note> the Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Prayer by a publick person, according to a publick rule,
for a publick use, are not to be rejected as private Conceptions: We
had hoped you had designed no such innovation as this in the
Church: VVhen we have heard any say that it would come to this,
and that you designed the suppression of the free Prayers of Ministers
in the Pulpit, suited to the variety of the subjects and occasions, we
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102298:34"/>
have rebuked them as uncharitable in passing so heavy a censure on
you: And what would have been said of us a year ago, if we should
have said that this was in your hearts? Nothing will more alienate
the hearts of many holy prudent persons from the Common-Prayer,
then to perceive that it is framed and used as an Instrument to shut
out all other Prayers, as the Ministers private Conceptions. Such an
end and designe, will make it, under the notion of a means, another
thing then else it would be, and afford men such an Argument against
it, as we desire them not to have: but we hope you speak not the
publick sense. As the Apostles desired (as aforesaid) that all would
speak the same things, without giving them (that ever was proved) a
Form of words to speak them in; so might we propose to you, that
uncertain opinions be made no part of our Liturgie, without putting
all their words into their mouthes, in which their desires must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.
Your hearty desire, and the reason of it, makes not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
extemporary Prayer, but all prepared or written Forms or
Liturgies that were indited onely by one man, and have not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
antecedently of others. And do you think this was the course
of the Primitive times? <hi>Basil</hi> thus used his private Conceptions at
<hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sarea,</hi> and <hi>Greg. Thaumaturgus</hi> before him at <hi>Neocesarea,</hi> and all
Pastors in <hi>Justin Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Tertullians</hi> days. And how injurious
is it to the Publick Officers of Christ, the Bishops and Pastors of the
Churches, to be called private men? who are publick persons in the
Church, if they be not? Every single person is not a private person,
else Kings and Judges would be so. And have you not better means
to shut out private opinions, then the forbidding Ministers praying in
the Pulpit, according to the variety of subjects and occasions? You
have first the Examination of persons to be ordained, and may see that
they be able to speak sense, and fit to manage their proper works with
judgement and discretion, before you ordain them; And some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
may be put in a man in his proper calling and work, to which
he is admitted with so great care, as we hope (or desire) you will
admit them. If you are necessitated to admit some few that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious,
or unmeet, we beseech you (not onely to restore the many
hundred worthy men laid by, to a capacity, but that you will not so
dishonour the whole Church, as to suppose all such, and to use all as
such, but restrain those that deserve restraint, and not all others for
their sakes: And next, you have a Publick Rule (the holy Scripture)
for these men to pray by. And if any of them be intolerably guilty
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102298:34"/>
of weaknesses or rashness, or other miscarriages, the words being spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in publick, you have witnesses enow, and sure there is power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in Magistrates and Bishops to punish them; and if they prove
incorrigible, to cast them out. In all other Professions these means
are thought sufficient to regulate the Professors. His Majesty thinks
it enough to regulate his Judges, that he may chuse able men, and fit
to be trusted in their proper work; and that they are respo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sible for
all their male-administrations, without prescribing them Forms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
which they may not speak any thing in their Charge. Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
being first tryed, and responsible for their doings, are constantly
trusted with the lives of high and low, without tying them to give no
counsel or medicine but by the prescript of a Book, or determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Colledge. And it is so undeniable, that your reason makes
more against Preaching, and for onely reading Homilies, as that we
must like it the worse, if not fear what will become of Preaching also.
For, 1. It is known that in Preaching a man hath far greater oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
and liberty to vent a false or private opinion, then in Prayer.
2. It is known <hi>de eventu,</hi> that it is much more ordinary. And if
you say, [That he speaks not the words of the Church, but his own,
nor unto God, but man, and therefore it is less matter:] We answer,
It is as considerable, if not much more, from whom he speaks, then to
whom he speaks as the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

3. 19, 20. And it is as a higher, so a more reverend thing to speak in
Gods Name to the people, then in the peoples name to God; and to
speak that which we call Gods Word, or Truth, or Message, then that
which we call but our own desire: we make a God a lyar, or corrupt
in his words, if we speak a falshood in his Name; we make but our
selves lyars, if we speak a falshood to him in our names: the former
therefore is the more heynous and dreadful abuse, and more to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided:

we will not say of your designe, as hoping you intend not to make us

beseech you that you will be pleased to repent of these desires, and not
to prosecute them, considering that to avoid a lesser evil (avoidable by
safer means) you will bring a far greater evil on the <hi>Churches,</hi> and such
as is like to strip these Nations of the glory in which they have excelled
the rest of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even a learned, able, holy Ministry, and a people
sincere, and serious, and understanding in the matters of their salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For, 1. As it is well known that an ignorant man may read
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102298:35"/>
a Prayer and Homily as distinctly and laudably as a learned Divine,
and so may do the work of a Minister, if this be it; so it is known that
mans nature is so addicted to ease and sensual diversions, as that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
will make no better preparations, when they find that no
more is necessary, when they are as capable of their places and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
if they can but read, and are forced upon no exercise of their
parts, which may detect and shame their ignorance, but the same
words are to be read by the ablest and ignorantest man: it is certain
that this will make multitudes idle in their Academical Studies, and
multitudes to spend their time idly all the year, in the course of their
Ministry: and when they have no necessity that they are sensible of,
of diligent studies, it will let loose their f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eshly voluptuous inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and they will spend their time in sports, and drinking, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and idleness; and this will be a Seminary of Lust: or they will
follow the world, and drown themselves in Covetousness and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and their hearts will be like their studies. As it's the way to
have a holy able Ministry, to engage them to holy studies, to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
on Gods Law day and night; so it's the way to have an ignorant,
prophane and scandalous Ministry, (and consequently Enemies to
serious Godliness in others) to impose upon them but such a work,
as in ignorance and idleness they may perform as well as the judicious
and the diligent. If it be said, [That their parts may be tryed and
exercised some other way:] We answer, Where should a Ministers
parts be exercised, if not in the Pulpit or the Church, and in Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising,
in private Baptism and Communion, and in the visitation of
the sick? their work also is such as a School-boy may do as well as
they, their ignorance having the same Cloak, as in publick. If it
be said, [That a Ministers work is not to shew his parts:] We answer,
But his Ministerial work is to shew men their sins, and to preach the
wonderful mysteries of the Gospel, to help men to search, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Scriptures, and to search, and to know their hearts, and to
know God in Christ, and to hope for the glory that is to be revealed;
and fervently to pray for the success of his endeavours, and the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of the Gospel on the people, and chearfully to praise God for
his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>arious benefits; which cannot be done without Abilities. A
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hysitians work is not to shew his parts ultimately, but it is to do that
for the cure of diseases which without parts he cannot do; and in
the exercise of his parts, (on which the issue much depends) to save
mens lives. The ostentation of his good works, is not the work of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102298:35"/>
a good Christian; and yet he must so let his light shine before men,
that they may see his good works, and glorifie God. And undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
experience tells us, That God ordinarily proportioneth the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
and blessing to the skill, and holiness, and diligence of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and blesseth not the labours of ignorant, ungodly Drones, as
he doth the labours of able faithful Ministers. And also that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest
way to bring the Gospel into contempt with the world, and
c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>use all Religion to dwindle away into Formality first, and then to
Barbarism and Brutishness, is to let in an ignorant, idle, vicious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
that will become the peoples scorn: Yea, this is the way to
extirpate Christianity out of any Country in the world, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying
apace, when men grow ignorant of the nature and reasons of
it, and unexperienced in its power and delightful fruits, and when the
Teachers themselves grow unable to defend it. And we must adde,
That whatsoever can be expected duely to affect the heart, must keep
the intellect, and all the faculties awake in diligent attention and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise:
And in the use of a Form, which we have frequently heard
and read, the faculties are not so necessitated and urged to attention,
and serious exercise, as they be when from our own understanding we
are set about the natural work of representing to others what we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
and feel. Mans minde is naturally sloathful, and will take its
ease, and remit its seriousness longer then it is urged by necessity, or
drawn out by delight: When we know beforehand, that we have
no more to do, but read a Prayer or Homily, we shall ordinarily be in
danger of letting our minds go another way, and think of other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and be senceless of the work in hand. Though he is but an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
that is carried on by no greater motive then mans observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and approbation; yet is it a help not to be despised, when even a
necessity of avoiding just shame with men, shall necessarily awake our
invention, and all our faculties to the work, and be a concurrent help
with spiritual motives. And common experience tells us, That the
best are apt to loose a great deal of their affection by the constant use
of the same words or forms. Let the same Sermon be preached an
hundred times over, and try whether an hundred for one will not be
much less moved by it, then they were at first. It is not onely the
common corruption of our nature, but somewhat of innocent infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
that is the cause of this. And man must cease to be man, or to
be mortal, before it will be otherwise. So that the nature of the
thing, and the common experience of our own dispositions, and of

the effect on others, assureth us, that understanding serious Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
is like to be extinguished, if onely Forms be allowed in the

thing that pretends to help the tongue, while we are sure it ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

world, perswading us of the harmlessness of such a course, that can so
far un-man us, as to make us dis-believe both our own experience,
and common observation of the effects on others. Yet we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that some Forms have their laudable use, to cure that errour and
vice that lyeth on the other extream. And might we but sometimes
have the liberty to interpose such words as are needful to call home
and quicken attention and affection, we should think that a convenient
conjunction of both might be a well-tempered means to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
constitutions of most. But still we see the world will run into
extreams, whatever be said or done to hinder it. It is but lately that
we were put to it, against one extream, to defend the lawfulness of a
Form of Liturgie; now the other extream it troubleth us, that we are
forced against you, even such as you, to defend the use of such Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Pastors of the Churches, as are necessarily varied according
to subjects and occasions, while you would have no Prayer at all in
the Church, but such prescribed Forms. And why may we not adde,
That whoever maketh the Forms imposed on us, if he use them, is
guilty as well as we of praying accordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And that we never said it proved from Scripture, that Christ appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any to such an Office, as to make Prayers for other Pastors and
Churches to offer up to God: and that this being none of the work
of the Apostolical, or common Ministerial Office in the Primitive

We are agreed in one Rule of Faith, in one holy Scripture, and
one Creed, and differ not (you say) about the Doctrinal part of the
39 Art. And will not all this seem to tell you who are Orthodox? If
you are resolved to make all that a matter of Contention which we
desire to make a means of Peace, there is no remedy while you have
the Ball before you, and have the Wind and Sun, and the power of
contending without controul. But we perceive, [That the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
consent of Antiquity,] must go into your definition of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox;
but how hard it is to get a reconciling determination, what
Ages shall go with you, and us, for the true Antiquity, and what is
necessary to that consent that must be called Catholick, is unknown to
none but the unexperienced. And indeed we think a man that
searcheth the holy Scripture, and sincerely and unreservedly gives
up his Soul to understand, love and obey it, may be Orthodox,
without the knowledge of Church-History: we know no univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Law-Giver, nor Law to the Church, but one, and that Law is
the sufficient Rule of Faith, and consequently the test of the truely
Orthodox, though we refuse not Church-History, or other means
that may help us to understand it. And to acquaint you with what
you do not know, we our selves (after many Pastors of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Churches) do question your Liturgie, as far as is expressed in
our Papers: And we profess, [to adhere to Scripture, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

If you will say, that our pretence and claim is unjust, we call for your
Authority to judge our hearts, or dispose us from the number of the
Orthodox, or else for your proofs to make good your accusation.
But however you judge, we rejoyce in the expectation of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

assent in the close, by saying <hi>Amen:</hi> if they mean that the people in publick
Services must onely say this word <hi>Amen,</hi> as they can no where prove it in
the Scriptures, so it doth certainly seem to them, that it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
for they directly practise the contrary in one of their principal parts
of Worship, singing of Psalms, where the people bear as great a part as
the Minister. If this may be done in <hi>Hopkins,</hi> why not in <hi>Davids</hi>
Psalms? If in Metre, why not in Prose? if in a Psalm, why not in a
Letany?]</p>
               <p>What is most for edification,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> is best known by experience, and by
the reason of the thing: for the former, you are not the Masters of
all mens experience, but of your own, and others that have acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
you with the same, as theirs: We also may warrantably profess
in the name of our selves, and many thousands of sober pious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that we experience that these things are against our edification;
and we beseech you do not by us, what you would not do by the
the poor labouring servants of your family, to measure them all their
dyet for quality or quantity, according to your own appetites, which
they think are diseased, and would be better, if you work'd us as hard
as they: and we gave you some of the Reasons of our Judgement:
1. Though we have not said that the people may not in Psalms to
God concur in voice, (we speak of Prayer which you should have
observed) and though we onely concluded it agreeable to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-practise,
for the people in prayer to say but their <hi>Amen;</hi> yet
knowing not from whom to understand the will of God, and what is
pleasing to him, better then from himself, we considered what the
Scripture saith of the ordinary way of publick Worship; and finding
ordinarily that the people spoke no more in prayer (as distinct from
Psalms and Praise) then their <hi>Amen,</hi> or meer consent, we desired
to imitate the surest pattern. 2. As we finde that the Minister is the
mouth of the people to God in publick, (which Scripture, and the
necessity of order do require;) so we were loath to countenance the
peoples invading of that sacred Office, so far as they seem to us to do:
1. By reading half the Psalms and Hymnes: 2. By saying half the
Prayers, as the Minister doth the other half: 2. By being one of
them the mouth of all the rest in the Confession at the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
4. By being the onely Petitioners, in the far greatest part of all
the Letanie, by their <hi>[Good Lord deliver us,]</hi> and <hi>[We beseech thee to
hear us, good Lord;]</hi> while the Minister onely reciteth the matter of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102298:39"/>
the matter of the prayer, and maketh none of the Request at all; we
fear lest by parity of reason the people will claim the work of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and other parts of the Ministerial Office: 3. And we menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
that which all our ears are witnesses of, that while half the
Psalms and Hymns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are said by such of the people as can say them,
the murmur of their voices in most Congregations is so unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
and confused, as must hinder the edification of all the rest; for
who is edified by that which he cannot understand? We know not
what you mean by citing 2 <hi>Chron. 7. 1, 4. Ezra</hi> 3. 11. where there is
not a word of publick prayer, but in one place of an Acclamation, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an extraordinary sight of the glory of the Lord, which made them
praise the Lord, and say, <hi>[He is good, for his mercy is for ever;]</hi> when
the prayer that went before was such as you call [A long tedious
prayer,] uttered by <hi>Solomon</hi> alone, without such breaks and discants.
And in the other places is no mention of prayer at all, but of singing
praise; and that not by the people, but by the Priests and Levites,
saying the same words, <hi>[For he is good, for his mercy endures for ever
towards Israel:]</hi> The people are said to do no more then shout with
a great shout, because the foundation of the House was laid; and if
shouting be it that you would prove, it's not the thing in Question.
Let the ordinary mode of praying in Scripture be observed, in the
prayers of <hi>David, Solomon, Ezra, Daniel,</hi> or any other; and if they
were by breaks, and frequent beginnings and endings, and alternate
Interlocutions of the people, as yours are, then we will conform to
your mode, which now offends us; but if they were not, we beseech
you reduce yours to the examples in Scripture: we desire no other
rule to decide the Controversie by. As to your Citation, 1 <hi>Socrat.</hi>
there tells us of the alternate singing of the <hi>Arrians</hi> in the reproach
of the Orthodox, and that <hi>Chrysostome</hi> (not a <hi>Synod)</hi> compiled Hymns
to be sung in opposition to them in the streets, which came in the end
to a Tumult and Bloudshed. And hereupon he tells us of the original
of alternate singing, <hi>viz.</hi> a pretended Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that heard
Angels sing in that order. And what is all this to alternate Reading,
and praying, or to a Divine Institution, when here is no mention of
reading or praying, but of singing Hymns; and that not upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Apostolical Tradition, but a Vision of uncertain credit? <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odore</hi>
also speaketh onely of singing Psalms alternately, and not a word
of reading or praying so; and he fetcheth that way of singing also as
<hi>Socrat.</hi> doth, but from the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and not from any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102298:39"/>
Doctrine or Practise of the Apostles: and neither of them
speaks a word of the necessity of it, or of forcing any to it: so that all
these your Citations, speaking not a word so much as of the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in question, are marvellously impertinent. The words <hi>[Their
Worship,]</hi> seem to intimate that singing of Psalms is part [of our
Worship,] and not of yours: we hope you disown it not; for our
parts we are ashamed of it. Your distinction between <hi>Hopkins</hi> and
<hi>Davids</hi> Psalms, as if the metre allowed by Authority to be sung in
Churches, made them to be no more <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms, seemeth to us
a very hard saying. If it be because it is a Translation, then the prose
should be none of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms neither, nor any Translation be the
S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ripture. If it be because it is in metre, then the exactest Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in metre should be none of the Scripture. If because it's done
imperfectly, then the old Translation of the Bible, used by Common-Prayer-Book,
should not be Scripture. As to your reason for the
supposed priority, 1. Scripture-examples telling us, that the people
had more part in the Psalms, then in the Prayers or Reading, satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
us, that God and his Church then saw a disparity of Reason.
2. Common Observation tells us, That there is more order, and less
hinderance of Edification in the peoples singing, then in their read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and praying together vocally.</p>
               <p>[It is desired that nothing should be in the Liturgie,<note place="margin">Answer. N. Sect. 1.</note> which so much as
seems to countenance the observation of Lent as a Religious Fast; and
this as an expedient to peace: which is in effect to desire, that this our
Church may be contentious for peace sake, and to divide from the Church-Catholick,
that we may live at unity among our selves: For St. <hi>Paul</hi>
reckons them amongst the lovers of contention, who shall oppose themselves
against the custome of the Churches of God. That the religious observation
of Lent was a custome of the Churches of God, appears by the testimonies
following, <hi>Chrys. Ser. 11. in Heb. 10. Cyrill. Catec. myst. 5. St. Aug.
Ep. 119, ut 40 dies ante Pascha observetur, Ecclesiae consuetudo ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boravit:</hi>
and St. <hi>Hierom ad Marcell,</hi> says, it was <hi>secundum traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem
Apostolorum:</hi> This Demand then tends not to peace, but Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The fasting forty days may be in imitation of our Saviour, for all
that is here said to the contrary; for though we cannot arrive to his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
abstaining wholly from meat so long; yet we may fast forty days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
either <hi>Cornelius</hi> his fast, till three of the Clock after noon, or Saint
<hi>Peters</hi> fast, till noon; or at least <hi>Daniels</hi> fast, abstaining from meats and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102298:40"/>
drinks of delight; and thus far imitate our Lord.]</p>
               <p>If we had said that the Church is contentious if it adore God in
kneeling on the Lords Days,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> or use not the White Garment, Milk
and Honey after Baptism, which had more pretence of Apostolical
tradition, and were generally used more anciently then Lent, would
you not have thought we wronged the Church? If the purer times
of the Church have one custome, and latter times a contrary, which
must we follow? or must we necessarily be contentious for not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
both? or rather, may we not by the example of the
Church that changeth them, be allowed to take such things to be
matters of Liberty, and not Necessity? If we must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the custom of other Churches in such things, or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious,
it is either because God hath so commanded, or because
he hath given those Churches authority to command it: If the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
then what Churches or what Ages must we conform to? If all
must concur to be our pattern, it will be hard for us to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with them so far as to know of such concurrences: And in our
Case we know that many do it not. If it must be the most, we would
know where God commandeth us to imitate the greater number,
though the worse; or hath secured us that they shall not be the worst?
or why we are not tyed rather to imitate the purer Ages then the
more corrupt? If it be said, that the Church hath authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
us; we desire to know what Church that is, and where to be
sound and heard, that may command <hi>England,</hi> and all the Churches
of his Majesties Dominions. If it be said to be a General Council,
1. No General Council can pretend to more Authority then that of
<hi>Nice,</hi> whose 20th Canon, back'd with tradition and common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
now binds not us, and was laid by without any Repeal by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Councils. 2. We know of no such things as General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
at least that have bound us to the religious observation of Lent.
The Bishops of one Empire could not make a General Council.
3. Nor do we know of any such power that they have over the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Church, there being no visible Head of it, or Governours to
make universal Laws, but Christ, (as <hi>Rogers</hi> on the 20th Article
fore-cited shews) our 21th Article saith, That [General Councils
may not be gathered together without the Commandment and Will
of Princes:] And doubtless all the Heathens and Mahometans, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102298:40"/>
all the contending Christian Princes, will never agree together (nor
never did) to let all their Christian Subjects concur to hold a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council. It saith also, [And when they be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(for as much as they be an Assembly of men, whereof all be
not governed with the Spirit and Word of God) they may erre, and
sometimes have erred, even in things pertaining unto God: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
things ordained by them, as necessary to salvation, have neither
strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken
out of the Holy Scriptures.] And if they may erre in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
unto God, and ordained by them as necessary to salvation,
much more in lesser things. And are we contentious if we erre not
with them? Our 39 Article determineth this Controversie, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
[It is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all
places one, or utterly like; for at all times they have been divers,
and changed according to the diversitie of Countries, times, and
mens manners, so that nothing be ordained against Gods Word.]
And after, [Every particular, or National Church, hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to ordain, change, or abolish Ceremonies, or Rites
of the Church, ordained onely by Mans Authority, so that all
things be done to edifying:] They that believe not this, should
not subscribe it, nor require it of others. As for the Testimonies
cited by you, they are to little purpose: We deny not not that the
custome of observing Lent, either fewer days or more, was as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
as those Authors. But first, That Lent was not known or kept
in the second or third Ages, you may see as followeth, <hi>Tertul. de

of the kind of Fast it self: for some think they should fast one day,
some two, others more: some measure their day by forty hours of

as is most like, propagated to posterity the custome which they retain,
as brought in by a certain simplicity, and private will; and yet all
these lived peaceably among themselves, and we keep peace among
our selves; and the difference of Fasting is so far from violating the
consonancy of Faith, as that it even commendeth it.] Thus <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>

But when you come to describe your Fast, you make amends for the
length, by making it indeed no Fast; [To abstain from meats and
drinks of delight:] where neither the thing nor the delight is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to further us in our duty to God, is that which we take to be
the duty of every Christian all the year, as being a part of our morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and self-denial, who are commanded to crucifie the flesh, and
to make no provision to satisfie the lusts of it, and to subdue our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
but when those meats and drinks do more help then hinder
us in the service of God, we take it to be our duty to use them,
unless when some other accident forbids it, that would make it
otherwise more hurtful. And for fasting till Noon, we suppose
it is the ordinary way of dyet to multitudes of Sedentary persons,
both Students, and Trades-men, that find one meal a day sufficient for
nature: If you call this fasting, your poor Brethren fast all their life
time, and never knew that it was fasting; But to command hard La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
to do so, is but to make it a fault to have health, or to do
their necessary work. We beseech you bring not the Clergie under
the suspition of Gluttony, by calling our ordinary wholsome tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
by the name of fasting. Sure Princes may feed as fully and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully
as we; yet <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Wo to thee, O Land, when thy
King is a Child, and thy Princes eat in the morning. Blessed art thou,
O Land, when thy King is the Son of Nobles, and thy Princes eat in due
season, for strength, and not for drunkenness;]</hi> For meer sensual delight
it is never lawful; And when it is for strength, it is not to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,

Fast, but onely provide for the maintenance of the Navy, and of Fishing

must not so interpret one Act, as to contradict another, being still in force

               <p>If when the express words of a Statute are cited,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> you can so easily
put it off, by saying (it does not forbid it) and you dare not think
that a Parliament did intend to forbid that which Christ his Church
hath commanded,) and (you must not interpret it as contradicting
that Act which confirms the Liturgie,) we must think that indeed we
are no less regardful of the Laws of the Governours than you. But
first, we understand not what authority this is that you set against the
King and Parliament, as supposing they will not forbid what it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
You call it Christs Church, we suppose you mean not Christ
himself, by his Apostles infallibly directed and inspired. If it be the
National Church of <hi>England,</hi> they are the Kings Subjects; and why
may he not forbid a Ceremony which they command? or why should
they command it if he forbid it? If it be any Forreign Church,
there's none hath power over us. If it be any pretended head of the
Church universal, whether Pope or general Council, having power
to make Laws that bind the whole Church, it is a thing so copiously
disproved by Protestants against both the Italian and French Papists,
that we think it needless to confute it, nor indeed dare imagine that
you intend it. We know not therefore what you mean; But whatever
you mean, you seem to contradict the forecited Article of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> that makes all humane Laws about Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Church to be unchangeable, by each particular National
Church; And that it is not necessary that Ceremonies or Traditions
be in all places one, or utterly like.) We most earnestly beseech you
be cautious how you obtrude upon us a Forreign Power, under the
name of Christs Church, that may command Ceremonies which
King and Parliament may not forbid; whether it be one man or a
thousand, we fear it is against our Oathes of Allegiance and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie,
for us to own any such Power. And (not presuming upon
any immodest challenge) we are ready in the defence of those
Oathes, and the Protestant Religion to prove against any in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
conference, that there is no such power; and for the Statutes
let the words themselves decide the Controversie, which are these:</p>

and mixture which we move for, is so far from making all the
Lyturgy void, that it would do very much to make it attain its end,
and would heal much of the distemper which it occasioneth, and
consequently would do much to preserve the reputation of it. As
for instance, if besides the Forms in the Lyturgy, the Minister
might, at Baptism, the Lords Supper, Marriage, &amp;c. interpose
some suitable Exhortation or Prayer, upon special occasion, when
he finds it needful: should you deny this at the visitation of the
sick, it would seem strange; and why may it not be granted at other
times? It is a matter of far greater trouble to us, that you would
deny us and all Ministers the Liberty of using any other Prayers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Lyturgy, than that you impose these.</p>

Your Argument from the <hi>Abuse,</hi> against the <hi>Use,</hi> is a palpable falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which cast out Physitians in some Countries, and rooted up
Vines in others, and condemneth the reading of the Scriptures
in a known tongue among the Papists. If the Apostles (that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
then so much of divisions, and Preaching false doctrine, and
in envy, and strife) had thought the way of cure had been in sending
Ministers about the world with a Prayer-book or Sermon book, and
to have tyed them only to read, either one or both of these,
no doubt but they would have been so regardful of the Church, as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102298:44"/>
to have composed such a Prayer-book or Sermon book themselves,
and not left us to the uncertainties of an Authority not infallible,
nor to the divisions that follow the impositions of a questionable
Power, or that which unquestionably is not universal, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can procure no universal Concord. If one man among <hi>you</hi> draw
up a Form of Prayer, it is his single conception; and why a man
as learned and able, may not be trusted to conceive a Prayer for the
use of a single Congregation, without the dangers mentioned by
you, as one man to conceive a Prayer for <hi>all the Churches in a
Diocess,</hi> or a <hi>Nation,</hi> we know not. These words <hi>[that the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
is greater than the pretended good]</hi> seem to express an unjust ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
of ordinary conceived Prayer, and a great undervaluing
of the benefits: If you would intimate that the Crimes expressed
by you are <hi>ordinarily</hi> found in Ministers Prayers, we that hear such
much more frequently than you, must profess we have not found it
so (allowing men their different measures of exactness, as you have
even in writing.) Nay, to the praise of God we must say, that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of <hi>private men</hi> can ordinarily pray, without any such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
as should nauseate a sober person; and with such seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and aptness of expression, as is greatly to the benefit and
comfort of our selves when we joyn with them. And if such general
accusations may serve in a matter of publick and common fact,
there is no way for the justification of the Innocent: And that it is
no such <hi>common Guilt,</hi> will seem more propable to them that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that such <hi>conceived Prayers,</hi> both <hi>prepared,</hi> and <hi>extemporate,</hi> have
been ordinarily used in the Pulpits in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> before
our dayes till now, and there hath been power enough (in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and others before the Wars) to punish those that speak ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously,
seditiously, impiously, or blasphemously: And yet so few
are the instances (even where jealousie was most busie) of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
punished, or once accused of any such fault in Prayer, as that
we find it not easie to remember any considerable number of them;
there being great numbers punished for not reading the Book for
playing on the Lord's dayes, or for Preaching too oft, and such
like, for one that was ever questioned for such kind of praying.
And the <hi>former</hi> shewed that it was not for <hi>want of will</hi> to be severe,
that they spared them as to the <hi>later.</hi> And if it be but few that are
guilty of any intolerable faults of that nature in their Prayers, we
hope you will not go on to believe that the mischiefs that come by
the failings of those few, are far greater than the benefit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102298:44"/>
Prayer by all others: We presume not to make our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences
the measure of yours, or other mens; you may tell us what
doth most good or hurt to your selves, and those that have so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
their experiences to you: But we also may speak our
own, and others that have discovered them to us; and we must se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
profess, that we have found far more benefit to our selves, and
to our Congregations (as far as our Conference and Converse with
them, and our observation of the effects alloweth us to discern)
by <hi>conceived Prayers,</hi> than by the <hi>Book of Common Prayer:</hi> we find
that the <hi>benefit</hi> of <hi>conceived Prayers</hi> is to keep the mind in serious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and to awaken the affections, and make us fervent and
importunate. And the <hi>inconvenience,</hi> is, that some weak men are
apt, as in Preaching and Conference, so in Prayer, to shew their
weakness, by some unapt expressions or disorder; which is an evil
no way to be compared with the fore-mentioned good, considering
that it is but in the weak, and that if that weakness be so great as
to require it, Forms might be imposed on those few, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
them on all for ther sakes, (as we force not all to use specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
or Crutches, because some are pur-blind or lame,) and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that God heareth not Prayers for the Rhetorick, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Cadencies and neatness of expressions, but will bear more
with some incuriosity of words (which yet we plead not for) than
with an hypocritical, formal, heartless, lip-service; for he <hi>knoweth
the meaning of the Spirit,</hi> even in the <hi>groans,</hi> which <hi>are not uttered</hi>
in words. And for the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> our observation telleth us,
that though <hi>some</hi> can use it judiciously, seriously, and we doubt not
profitably, yet as to the <hi>most</hi> of the vulgar, it causeth a relaxing of
their attention and intention, and a lazy taking up with a Corps or
image of devotion, even the service of the lips, while the heart is
little sensible of what is said: And had we not known it, we
should have thought it incredible, how utterly ignorant abundance
are of the sense of the words which they hear and repeat themselves
from day to day, even about Christ himself, and the essentials of
Christianity: It is wonderful to us to observe that rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
can so commonly separate the <hi>words</hi> from all the <hi>sense</hi> and
<hi>Life.</hi> So great a help or hinderance even to the understanding, is
the <hi>awakening,</hi> or <hi>not awakening</hi> of the <hi>affections,</hi> about the things of
God: And we have already shewed you many <hi>unfit expressions</hi> in the
<hi>Common Prayer Book,</hi> especially in the Epistles and Gospels, through
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102298:45"/>
the faultiness of your Translation, as <hi>Eph. 3. 15. [Father of all
that is called [Father in Heaven and Earth]</hi> and that <hi>Christ was found
in his apparel as a man]</hi> [that <hi>Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>is</hi> Agar <hi>in</hi> Arabia, <hi>and
bordereth upon the City now called</hi> Jerusalem] <hi>Gal. 4. 25. [This is the
sixth Month which is barren] Luke 1. [And when men be drunk] Joh.</hi> 2.
with many such like; which are parts of your <hi>publick Worship:</hi> and
would you have us hence conclude, that the <hi>mischiefs of such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi>
are greater than all the <hi>benefits</hi> of that Worship? And yet
there is this difference in the Cases, that <hi>weak and rash Ministers</hi>
were but here and there one, but the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> is the Service
of <hi>every Church</hi> and <hi>every day:</hi> Had we heard any in extemporary
Prayers use such unmeet expressions, we should have thought him
worthy of sharp reprehension, yea, though he had been of the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or weaker sort. Divers other unfit expressions are mentioned,
in the exceptions of the late Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> and Primate
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and others (before spoken of) and there is much in the
prejudice, or diseased curiosity of some Hearers, to make words seem
idle, impertinent, or ridiculous, which are not so (and which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they understand not): some thought so of the inserting in the
late Prayer Book, the private opinion of the souls of the departed,
praying for us, and our praying for the benefit of their Prayers. As
for the <hi>Security</hi> which you call for, (though, as is shewed, <hi>you</hi> have
given <hi>us none at</hi> all against such errors in your <hi>Forms,</hi> yet) we have
before shewed you, that you have as much, as among imperfect
men can be expected: The same that you have, that Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
shall not murder men, and that Lawyers and Judges shall
not undo men, and that your Pilot shall not cast away the Ship:
you have the power in your hands, of taking or refusing, as they
please or displease you; and of judging them by a known Law, for
their proved miscarriages, according to the quality of them; and
what would you have more?</p>

then the Churches thought not our Lyturgy to be necessary to their

Scripture (they being also bound with our Bibles) is such a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

not against it. To say that the People are secured by the Churches

be disregardable, and till you have proved that the Minister is to
tell the People at the reading of ever such Chapter, that it is <hi>but
Apocriphal,</hi> and that the People all understand Greek, so well as to
know what <hi>Apocriphal</hi> signifieth. The more sacred and honourable
are these Dictates of the holy Ghost recorded in Scripture, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is the sin by reading the Apocripha, without sufficient distinction
to make the People believe, that the Writings of man are the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and Laws of God: And also we speak against the reading of
the Apocripha, as it excludeth much of the Canonical Scriptures,
and taketh in such Books in their steads, as are commonly reputed
fabulous. By thus much you may see how you lost your Answer by

we desire it may be forborn. That all the Primitive Church used
when there was no Communion in the Sacrament, to say Service at
the Communion Table, is a crude Assertion, that must have better
proof before we take it for convincing; And it is not probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had a Communion every Lords day; And if this be not
your meaning, you say nothing to the purpose: To prove they used it
when there was a Communion, is no proof that they used it when
there was none: And you your selves disuse many things more Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
practised then this can at all be fairly pretended to have bin:
The Council of <hi>Nice</hi> gives no such golden Rule as you mention;
A Rule is a general, applyable to particular Cases; The Council
onely speakes of one particular. <hi>[Let the ancient Custom continue in
Aegypt, Lybia, and Pentapolis, that the Bishop of Alexandria have
the Power of them all.]</hi> The Council here confirmeth this particular
Custom, but doth not determine in general of the Authority of
Custom. That this should be called a <hi>Catholick usage,</hi> shewes us
how partially the word <hi>(Catholick)</hi> is sometime taken: And that this
much cannot be granted us, lest we advantage the Enemies of the
Church, doth make us wonder whom you take for its Enemies, and
what is that advantage which this will give them; But we thank
you that here we find our selves called <hi>Brethren,</hi> when before we
are not so much as spoken to, but your speech is directed to some
other (we know not whom) concerning us. Your reason is that which
is our reason to the contrary; you say <hi>[the Priest standing at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
Table, seems to give us an invitation to the Holy Communion,</hi> &amp;c.]
What! when there is no Sacrament by himself or us intended? no
warning of any given? no Bread and Wine prepared? Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
God is not mocked. Therefore we desire that there may be
no such Service at the Table, when no Communion is intended,
because we would not have such grosse dissimulation used in so Holy
things, as thereby to seem (as you say) to invite Guests when the
Feast is not prepared, and if they came we would turn them empty
away. Indeed, if it were to be a private Masse, and the Priest were
to receive alone for want of Company, and it were really desired
that the People should come, it were another matter. Moreover
there is no Rubrick requiring this Service at the Table when there's
no Communion.</p>

cannot <hi>take them in that order:</hi> But that none of all your Prayers
should be formed to that perfect Rule; that your Letany which is
the comprehensive Prayer, and that the body of your dayly Prayers
(broken into severy Collects) should not (as set together) have any
considerable respect unto that order, nor yet to the order which
reason, and the nature of the thing requireth, (which is observed in

tossed in mens mouths, even in Prayer it self: and that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102298:49"/>
Tautologies and vain repetitions, are not the better, but the worse,
because <hi>Gods Name</hi> is made the matter of them: Is it not you that
have expressed your offence (as well as we) against those weak
Ministers that repeat too frequently the Name and Attributes of
God, in their extemporary Prayers? and is it ill in them? and is
the same, and much more, well in the Common Prayer? Oh, have
not the Faith of Worship of our Glorious God, in respect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
Let not that be called rediculous, idle, impertinent, or worse
in one, which is accounted commendable in others. Do you think
it were not a faulty crossing of the mind, and Method of Jesus
Christ, if you should make six Prayers of the six Petitions of the
Lords Prayer, and set the Preface and Conclusion unto each. As,
<hi>[Our Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy Name, for thine is
the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c.] and so on all the rest. Yet we know that the same
words may be oft repeated (as <hi>David</hi> doth <hi>Gods enduring mercy)</hi>
without such Tautological vanity, when it is not from <hi>emptiness,</hi>
or neglect of <hi>order,</hi> or <hi>affectation;</hi> But in Psalms, or Hymnes, where
affections are to be elevated by such Figurative Elegancies, and
strains, as are best beseeming Poetry or rapture, we are not against
such Repetitions. But if we may (according to the Common Prayer
Book) begin, and end, and begin, and seem to withdraw again, and
make a Prayer of every Petition or two, and begin and end every
such Petition, with Gods Name, and Christs Merits, as making up
half the Form, or neer; nothing is an affected, empty tossing of
Gods Name in Prayer, if this be not? We are perswaded if you
should hear a man in a known extemporary Prayer do thus, it would
seem strange and harsh, even to your selves.</p>

and vain repetitions: For, what need you more than <hi>[Lord

Sin, and a general Prayer for Mercy, which comprehend all the
particulars of the Peoples Sins and wants. We gave you our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which you answer not. Confession is the exercise of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and also the helper of it; and it is no true Repentance which
is not particular, but only general. If you say, you repent that you
have sinned, and know not wherein, or do not repent of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
sin, you do not indeed repent; for sin is not existent, but
in the individuals: And if you ask for Grace, and know no what
Grace, or desire no particular Grace, indeed you desire no Grace
at all. We know there is time and use for <hi>general Confessions</hi> and
<hi>Requests;</hi> but still, as implying particulars, as having gone before
or following; or at least it must be supposed that the People under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the particulars included, and have inward Confessions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of them; which cannot here be supposed, when they are not
at all mentioned, nor can the People generally be supposed to have
such quick and comprehensive minds; nor is there leisure to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
such particular Repentance or desire, while a general is named.
And we beseech you, let the Scripture be judge, whether the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
and Prayers of the Servants of God have not been parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular?
As to your Objection or Reason, we answer. 1. There are
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102298:50"/>
general Prayers, <hi>with the particular</hi> or <hi>without them.</hi> 2. There are
particular Confessions and Prayers, <hi>proper to some few</hi> Christians,
and there are others <hi>common to all:</hi> It is <hi>these</hi> that we expect, and
not the <hi>former.</hi> 3. The Churches Prayers must be suited to the <hi>Body</hi>
of the Assembly, though perhaps some <hi>one</hi> or <hi>few,</hi> may be in a state
not fit for such expressions. What a lamentable Lyturgy will you
have, if you have nothing in it, but what every one in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
may say as true of, and suitable to themselves? Then you
must leave out all thanksgiving, for our Justification and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Sins, and Adoption, and title to Glory, &amp;c. because many
in the Assembly are Hypocrites, and have no such mercies; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more that are sincere, are mistaken in their own Condition, and
know not that they have the mercies which they have, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dare not give thanks for them, lest they speak an untruth. Then
the Lyturgy that now speaks, as in the persons of the sanctified,
must be changed, that the two fore-mentioned sorts (or the later at
least) may consent; and when you have done, it will be unsuitable to
those that are in a <hi>better</hi> state, and have the knowledge of their
Justification. This is the Argument which the Sectaries used against
singing of <hi>David's</hi> Psalms in the Congregations, because there is
much in them that many cannot truly say of themselves: But the
Church must not go out of that way of Worship prescribed by God,
and suited to the state of the ordinary sort of spiritual worshippers,
because of the distempers, or super-eminent excellencies of some
few. It were easie to go over <hi>David's</hi> Psalms, and your own Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
and shew you very much, that by this Argument, must be cast
out. He that finds any passage unsuitable to himself, is not to speak
it of himself.</p>

that to the persons baptized (in whose persons only our Prayers are offered

there remains in the Regenerate, some reliques of that, which are to be
bewailed; the Church in her Confession acknowledgeth such desires of our
own hearts, as render us miserable by following them; That there is no
health in us; That without Gods help our frailty cannot but fall; That
our mortal nature can do no good thing without him, which is a clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement

confess, that he was born in Iniquity, and conceived in Sin, and
was by nature a Child of Wrath, and that by one man sin entered
into the World; and that Judgement came on all men to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
&amp;c. The pardoned may confess what <hi>once they were,</hi> and
from what Rock they were hewn; even actual sins must be confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
after they are forgiven (unless the <hi>Antinomians</hi> hold the truth
against us in such points) 2. All is not false Doctrine that crosseth
mens private opinions, which you seem here to obtrude upon us.
We know that the Papists (and perhaps some others) hold that all
the baptized are delivered from the guilt of Original Sin: But (as
they are in the dark, and disagreed in the application of it, so) we
have more reason to incline to either of the ordinary opinions of
the Protestants, than to this of theirs. 1. Some learned Protestants
hold, that visibly all the baptized are Church-Members pardoned
and justified; which is, but that they are probably justified indeed,
and are to be used by the Church (upon a judgement of Charity) as
those that are really justified; but that we have indeed no <hi>certainty</hi>
that they are so, God keeping that as a secret to himself concerning
individuals, till by actual Faith and Repentance, it be manifest to
themselves. Another opinion of many Protestants is, that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that are Children of the Promise, or that have the conditions
of pardon and justification in the Covenant mentioned, are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that pardon by Baptism: And all such are pardoned, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
in a state of justification and salvation thereupon. And that
the Promise of pardon is made to the faithful and their Seed, and
therefore that all the faithful and their Seed in infancy, have this
pardon given them by the promise, and solemnly delivered them,
and sealed to them by Baptism, which investeth them in the benefits
of the Covenant: but withal, that 1. The professed Infidel and his
Seed, as such, are not the Children of the Promise, and therefore if
the Parent ludicrously or forcedly, or the Child by error be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
they have not thereby the pardon of their sins before God.
2. That the Hypocrite, that is not a true Believer at the heart,
though he profess it, hath no pardon by Baptism before God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not an Heir of the Promise, nor yet any Infant of his as such:
But though such are not pardoned, the Church that judgeth by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
taking Professors for Believers, must accordingly use them
and their Seed. 3. But though the Church judge thus charitably, of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102298:51"/>
each Professor in particular, till his Hypocrisie be detected, yet
doth it understand that Hypocrites there are, and still will be in the
Church, though we know them not by name; and that therefore
there are many externally baptized, and in Communion, that never
had the pardon of sin indeed before God, as not having the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Promise of pardon; such as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was: We
have less reason to take this Doctrine for false, than that which
pronounceth certain pardon and salvation to all baptized Infants
whatsoever. And were we of their Judgement, we should think it
the most charitable act in the world, to take the Infants of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
and baptize them; and if any should then dispatch them all
to prevent their lapse, they were all certainly saved. We hope by
<hi>[some Reliques]</hi> you mean that which is truly and properly Sin: for
our parts, we believe according to the 9th. Article <hi>[That Original
Sin standeth in the corruption of the nature of every man, whereby man
is far gone from original Righteousness, and inclined to evil: And that
this infection of nature doth remain in the Regenerate. And though there
is no Condemnation against them that believe and are baptized, yet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscense
and Lust hath of it self the nature of sin]</hi> You say <hi>[the Church
acknowledgeth such desires,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Devices</hi> and <hi>desires</hi> are <hi>Actual</hi> sins,
and not <hi>Original,</hi> which consisteth in <hi>privation,</hi> and <hi>corrupt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The next words <hi>[There is no Health in us]</hi> it seems the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
that put it into the Lyturgy misunderstood; but however you
seem here plainly, by your misinterpretation, to misunderstand it.
<hi>Nulla salus in nobis,</hi> is spoken <hi>actively,</hi> and not <hi>possessively,</hi> or <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively.</hi>
The plain sense is, <hi>there is no Help, Deliverance,</hi> or <hi>Salvation
in our selves;</hi> we cannot help our selves out of this misery, but must
have a better Saviour. As Christ is oft called <hi>our Salvation,</hi> so we
are denyed to be <hi>our own:</hi> So that <hi>yet</hi> here is no Confession at all of

three, the Surplice, the sign of the Cross, and kneeling; these are the yoak,
which if removed, there might be peace. It is to be suspected, and there
is reason for it, from their own words, that somewhat else pinches, and
that if these Ceremonies were laid aside, and these or any other Prayers,
strictly enjoyned without them, it would be deemed a burden intollerable;
it seems so by N. 7. where they desire, that when the Lyturgy is altered,
according to the rest of their Proposals, the Minister may have liberty to
add, and leave out, what he pleases; yet because the imposition of these
Ceremonies, is pretended to be the insupportable grievance, we must of
necessity, either yeeld that demand, or shew them reason why we do not;
and that we may proceed the better in this undertaking, we shall reduce
the sum of their Complaint, to these several Heads, as we find them in

                  <p>[Before we give particular Answers to these several Reasons, it will be
not unnecessary to lay down, some certain general Premises, or Rules,
which will be useful in our whole discourse. First, That God hath not
given a Power onely, but a Command also of imposing whatsoever shall be
truely decent, and becoming his Publick Service, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. After
St. <hi>Paul</hi> had ordered some particular Rules for Praying, praising, prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying,

<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> in a fit Scheme, Habit, or Fashion, Decently; and that there
may be Uniformity in those Decent performances, let there be a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Rule
or Canon for that purpose.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Repl.</note> As to your first Rule, we answer. 1. It is one thing to impose
in <hi>general</hi> that all be <hi>done Decently, and in Order;</hi> This Cod himself
hath imposed by his Apostle: And its another thing to impose in <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi>
that this or that be used as Decent and Orderly. Concerning
this we add, It is in the Text said <hi>[let it be done:]</hi> but not [let it be
imposed,] yet from other Scriptures we doubt not but more Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Decency and Order, as derermined time, place, Utensils,
&amp;c. which are common to things Civil, and Sacred, (though not the
Symbolical Ceremonies which afterwards we confute) may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
with the necessary cautions, and Limitations afterwards
laid down. But 1. That if any Usurpers will pretend a Power
from Christ to impose such things on the Church, though the things
be lawful, we must take heed how we acknowledge an Usurped
Power by formal obedience. 2. A just Power may impose them, but
to just ends: as the preservarion, and success of the Modified wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
or Ordinances: And if they really conduce not to those ends
they sin in imposing them. 3. Yet the Subjects are bound to obey a
true Authority in such impositions, where the matter belongs to
the Cognizance and Office of the Ruler; and where the mistake is
not so great as to bring greater mischiefs to the Church, then the
suspending of our Active obedience would do. 4. But if these
things be determined under pretence of Order, and Decency, to the
plain destruction of the Ordinances Modified, and of the intended
end, they cease to be <hi>means,</hi> and we must not use them. 5. Or if
under the names of things <hi>Decent,</hi> and of <hi>Order,</hi> men will meddle
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102298:53"/>
with things that belong not to their Office, as to institute a new wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
for God, new Sacraments, or any thing forbidden in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Prohibition of adding, or diminishing; this is an usurpation, and
not an Act of Authority, and we are bound in obedience to God, to
disobey them. 6. Where Governours may command at <hi>set times,</hi>
and by <hi>proportionable penalties</hi> enforce, if they command when it will
destroy the end, or enforce by such penalties as dest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oy, or crosse it,
they greatly sin by such Commands. Thus we have more distinctly
given you our sense, about the matter of your first Rule.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Repl.</note> Your second Rule also is too crudely delivered, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must adde: 1. A Judgement is a Sentence, in order to
some Execution; and Judgements are specified from the ends, to
which they are such means; When the question is either, [what
Law shall be made, or what penalty shall be exercised?] the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
is the only judge, and not the Bishop or other Subject. In
the first he exercises his <hi>judicium discretionis,</hi> in order to a
<hi>publick Act.</hi> In the second he exerciseth a <hi>publick Judgement:</hi>
When the question is, [what order <hi>pro tempore</hi> is fittest in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials
for this present Congregation?] the <hi>proper Presbyters</hi> or
<hi>Pastors</hi> of that Congregation, are the <hi>Directive Judges,</hi> by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.
3. The Magistrate is Ruler of these <hi>Pastors,</hi> as he is
of the Physicians, Philosophers, and other Subjects. He may make
them such general Rules, especially for restraint, to goe by, as may
not destroy the exercise of their own Pastoral power: As he may
forbid a Physitian to use some dangerous Medicine on his Subjects,
and may punish him when he wilfully killeth any of them: But
may not on that pretence appoint him <hi>what,</hi> and <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>when,</hi> and
to <hi>whom</hi> he shall administer, and so become Physician himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
4. When the question is, [Who shal be excluded from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of a particular Church?] The Pastors of <hi>that Church</hi> (or
Congregation) are the first proper Judges. 5. When the question
is, [Who shall be excluded from, (or received into) the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the associated Churches, of which we are naturally capable
of Communion?] The associated Pastors or Bishops of these Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in Synods, are Judges; Beyond this there are no Judges.</p>

                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:102298:54"/>
6. When the question is, [Whether the Laws of Magistrates, or
Canons of Bishops, are agreeable or not to the Word of God, and
so the obedience is lawful or unlawful?] the Consciences of each
individual Subject is the Judge, <hi>per judicium discretionis,</hi> as to his
own practice; And if men had not this judgement of discerning,
but must act upon absolute implicite obedience; then first, man were
ruled as unreasonable; Secondly the Magistrate were made a God,
or such a Leviathan, as <hi>Hobbs</hi> describeth him; Thirdly, And then
all sin might lawfully be committed, if commanded: But we are
assured none of this is your sense.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Repl.</note> To your third Rule we adde; It is first considerable, <hi>what
the thing is?</hi> and then, <hi>how it is apprehended?</hi> if it be <hi>really lawful,</hi>
and well commanded, and to be obeyed, it is no ignorance, doubt or
errour of the Subject, that can exempt him from the duty of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
But it may ensnare him in a certainty of sinning, whether he
obey, or disobey: For as God commandeth him to obey, and also
not to do that which man commandeth, when God forbiddeth it;
So he obligeth the erronious, first to lay down his errors, and so to
obey. But if a thing be forbidden of God, and commanded of man,
and one man erroniously thinks it lawful, and that he should obey,
and another is in doubt between both, it is neither a duty, nor lawful
for either of them here to obey: For mans errour changeth not Gods
Laws, nor disobligeth himself from obedience; But this mans duty
is both, to lay by that errour, and to refuse obedience: But if the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
be only of the <hi>order</hi> of such a persons duty: We answer; If the
thing be <hi>really lawful,</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> a <hi>duty,</hi> then he that doubteth or
erreth, should if possible suddenly lay by his errours or doubt, and
so obey: But if that cannot be, he should first goe about the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
means, for his better information till he be resolved, and so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey.
And so on the contrary, if really the thing commanded be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
if he be sure of it, he must resolve against it; if he hesitate,
he is not therefore allowed to do a thing forbidden, because he is
ignorant: For his ignorance is supposed culpable it self; but he is first
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102298:54"/>
to consult and use the best means, for his Instruction, till he know
the truth, and in the mean time to suspend his Act. But yet because
of humane frailty, between several faults, we must consider when
we cannot avoid all as we would, in what order most <hi>safely</hi> to watch
and to avoid them. And so when I have done my best, and cannot
discern whether a Command be just, and the thing lawful or not;
If it hath the face of Idolatry, Blasphemy, or some h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inous Sin,
that is commanded; and our disobedience have the appearance, but
of an effect of involuntary Ignorance, it is more excusable in us to
fear the greater sin, and so to suspend till we are better satisfied, than
to do that which we suspect, to be so hainous a Sin, though indeed
it prove no sin; So on the contrary, if our obedience be like to
bring Infamy or Calamity on the Church, and our Obedience ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be but about a very small sin, if we doubt of it, it is more
excuseable to obey, than to disobey, though both be faulty, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the thing to be indeed unlawful, and we discerne it not. So that
your Rule of obeying, where you are not as sure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is an unsure
Rule, unless as we have fullier cautioned it.</p>

that he hath commanded you, for these ends! how happy would
you make your selves, and these poor afflicted Churches. But as
to the instance of your Rule, we answer. 1. VVhen the <hi>indecency</hi>
and <hi>disorder</hi> is so smal, as that it will not crosse the ends, so much as
our <hi>disobedience</hi> would, we are here so far <hi>more comfortable,</hi> and <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than you,</hi> as that <hi>we</hi> would even in Gods worship, do some things
<hi>indecent</hi> and <hi>disorderly,</hi> rather than disobey. And so should you do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than <hi>destroy</hi> your <hi>Brethren,</hi> or <hi>hinder</hi> that <hi>peace,</hi> &amp; <hi>healing</hi> of the
Church. For <hi>Order</hi> is for the <hi>thing ordered,</hi> and not contrarily. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
there is much disorder lies in the Common-Prayer-Book, yet
we would obey it, as far as the ends of our calling do require. It
wouldbe <hi>undecent</hi> to come without a Band, or other handsome Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into the Assembly; yet would we obey, if it were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
us, rather than not worship God at all.</p>
                  <p>We are as confident that Surplices, and Copes are <hi>undecent,</hi> and
kneeling at the Lords Table is <hi>disorderly,</hi> as you are of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
And yet if the Magistrate would be advised by us (supposing
himself addicted against you) we would advise him to be more
charitable <hi>to you,</hi> than you here advise him to be <hi>to us:</hi> We would have
him, if your Conscience require it, to forbear <hi>you</hi> in this <hi>undecent</hi>
and <hi>disorderly</hi> way; But to speak more distinctly. 1. There are some
things <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>orderly,</hi> when the <hi>opposite species</hi> is not <hi>undecent</hi> or
<hi>disorderly.</hi> 2. There are some things <hi>undecent,</hi> and <hi>disorderly,</hi> in a
<hi>small</hi> and <hi>tollerable</hi> degree: And some things in a <hi>degree intollerable.</hi>
1. VVhen things decent are commanded, whose opposites would
not be at all undecent, their Charity and Peace, and Edification, may
command a Relaxation, or rather should at first restrain from too
severe Impositions: As it is decent to wear either a Cloak or a
Gown, a Cassock buttoned, or unbuttoned, with a Girdle or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;
to sit, stand, or kneel in singing of a Psalm; to sit or stand in
hearing the Word read or preached, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. VVhen a Circumstance
is <hi>undecent</hi> or <hi>disorderly,</hi> but in a tolerable degree, to an Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<hi>Obedience,</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> or <hi>Edification,</hi> may commaud us to do
it, and make it not only lawful, but a duty <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> while
the preponderating Accident prevaileth. Christs instances goe at
least as far as this, about the Priests in the Temple breaking the
Sabbath blamelesly, and <hi>David's</hi> eating the Shew-bread, which was
lawful for none to eat ordinarily, but the Priests: And the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102298:55"/>
rubbing the ears of <hi>Corne: [I will have mercy and not Sacrifice]</hi>
is a lesson that he sets us to learn, when two duties comes together,
to preserve the greater, if we would escape sin; And sure to keep
an able Preacher in the Church, or a private Christian in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
is a greater duty, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> than to use a Ceremony,
which we conceive to be decent; It is more orderly to use the <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
translation</hi> of the Scripture, than the <hi>worse,</hi> as the Common-prayer-book
doth; and yet we would have no man cast out for using
the worse: It is more orderly, decent, and edifying for the Minister
to read all the Psalms, than for the people to read each second verse;
And yet we would not cast out men from the Church or Ministry
meerly for that disorder, It is more orderly, and decent to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in divine worship, than covered: And yet rather than a
man should take cold, we could allow him to hear a Chapter or
Sermon covered: why not much more, rather than he should
be cast out. But let us come to the Application, <hi>It is no undecent
disorderly worshiping of God, to worship him without our Crosse, Surplice,
and kneeling in the reception of the Sacrament.</hi> 1. If it were, then
Christ and his Apostles had worshipped undecently and disorderly;
And the Primitive Church that used not the Surplice, nor the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient
Image of the Crosse in Baptism (but in an unguent) yea the
Church for many hundred years, that received the Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
kneeling. 2. Then if the King, Parliament, and Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should change their Ceremonies, it seems you would take your
selves bound to retain them; for you say you must not worship God
undecently: But that they may be changed by Authority, our Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
determine, and therefore Charity may well require the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to change them without any wrong to the worship of God.
3. VVe appeal to the common judgement of the Impartial, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the nature of the thing, there by any thing that tels them, that
it is undecent to <hi>pray without Surplice in the reading place,</hi> and not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent</hi>
to <hi>pray without in the Pulpit?</hi> And that it is undecent to <hi>Baptize
without Crossing,</hi> and not to receive the <hi>Lords Supper without:</hi> And
that it is undecent for the Receiver to take the Lords Supper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
kneeling, and not for the Minister to give it him standing, that
prayeth in the delivery.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Rep.</note> To your first Answer we reply. 1. We suppose you speak of
a <hi>moral Goodness;</hi> and if they are such indeed, as are within <hi>their
power</hi> and <hi>really good,</hi> that is, of their own nature, <hi>fitter than their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites,</hi>
they may be imposed by just Authority, by equal means,
though not by usurpers, nor by penalties that will do more harm than
the things will do good. 2. <hi>Signs that signifie nothing,</hi> we understand
not: It is one thing to <hi>be decent,</hi> and another <hi>[to signifie something
that is decent;</hi> what you mean by <hi>that,</hi> we know not. The <hi>Cross</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
our <hi>not being ashamed to profess the Faith of Christ crucified,</hi>
&amp;c.] do you call that <hi>something [that is decent?]</hi> It is <hi>something ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi>
to Salvation. 3. Signes are exceeding various: At present
we use but two distinctions. 1. Some are Signs <hi>ex primaria inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
iustitnentis,</hi> purposed, and primarily instituted to signifie (as
an Escucheon, or a Sign at an Inne door in common matters; and
as the Sacrament and Cross in sacred matters) and some are Signs
but consequently secondarily, and not essentially, as intended by
the Institutors (so Hills and Trees may shew us what a Clock it is,
and so every Creature signifieth some good of Mercy or Duty, and
may be an Object of holy Meditation; so the colour and shape of
our Cloaths may mind us of some good, which yet was none of the
primary or proper end of the Maker or Wearer.) 2. Signes are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>arbitrary expressions of a mans own mind, in a matter where he is
left free;</hi> or they are <hi>Covenanting Signes between us and God in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace, to work Grace on us, as moral Causes, and to engage
us Sacramentally to him.</hi> Such we conceive the Cross in Baptism to
be. The Preface to the Common Prayer Book saith <hi>[They are apt
to teach and excite,</hi> &amp;c.] which is <hi>a moral operation of Grace;</hi> and the
Canon saith <hi>[It is an honourable badge, whereby the Infant is dedicated
to him that dyed on the Cross]</hi> we are signified with it <hi>[in token, that
hereafter we shall not be ashamed to confess the Faith of Christ crucified,
and manfully to fight,</hi> &amp;c.] now if a thing may be commanded meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a <hi>decent Circumstance of Worship,</hi> yet it is unproved that a thing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102298:56"/>
in its nature as instituted, and in the primary intention, is thus <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally
to dedicate and engage us in Covenant to God,</hi> by signifying
the Grace and Duty of the Covenant be lawfully cammanded by
man. 1. Decent Circumstances are necessary <hi>in genere.</hi> There <hi>must</hi>
be <hi>some fit time, place, gesture, vesture</hi> (as such) <hi>utensils,</hi> &amp;c. But
that there be <hi>some such dedicating ingaging Signs, in our Covenanting</hi>
with God, signifying the Grace of the Covenant, and our state and
duty as Soldiers under Christ (besides Gods Sacraments) this is not
<hi>necessary in genere,</hi> and therefore it is not left to man to determine
<hi>de specie.</hi> 2. If there be any reason for this use of the Cross, it must
be such as was in the Apostles dayes, and concerneth the universal
Church in all ages and places, and then the Apostles would have
taken care of it. Thus much here in brief of Signes; and more anon,
when you again call us to it.</p>

                  <p>[To the second,<note place="margin">Ans. 2. Ans.</note> That it is not a violation of Christs Royalty, to make
such Laws for decency, but an exercise of his Power and Authority
which he hath given to the Church, and the disobedience to such Commands
of Superiours, is plainly a violation of his Royalty; As it is no viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Kings Authority, when his Magistrates command things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Laws, but disobedience to the Command of those injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of his Deputies, is violation of his Authority. Again, it can be
no impeachment of Christs Laws, as insufficient, to make such Laws for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
since our Saviour, as is evident by the Precepts themselves, did not
intend by them to determine every minute and circumstance of time, place,
manner of performance, and the like; but only to command in general the
substance of those Duties, and the right ends that should be aimed at in
the performance, and then left every man in particular (whom for that
purpose he made reasonable) to guide himself by Rules of reason for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Services; and appointed Governours of the Church, to determine
such particularities for the publick. Thus our Lord commanded Prayers,
Fasting, &amp;c. But for the times and places of performance, he did not
determine every of them, but left them to be guided as we have said. So
that it is no impeachment of his Laws, as insufficient, to make Laws for
determining those particulars of decency, which himself did not, as is plain
by his Precepts, intend to determine, but left us Governours for that
purpose, to whom he said <hi>[As my Father sent me, even so send I you,
and let all things be done decently, and in order]</hi> of whom he hath
said to us, <hi>[Obey those that have the oversight over you]</hi> and told us,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102298:57"/>
that if we will not hear his Church, we must not be accounted as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
but Heathens and Publicans; And yet nevertheless they will not
hear it, and obey it in so small a matter, as a Circumstance of time, place,
habit, or the like, which she thinks decent and fit, and yet will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the best Christians, and tell us that it is the very awe of Gods
Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 32. that keeps them from obedience to the Church in
these Commands; not well considering that it cannot be any adding to the
Word of God, to command things for order and decency, which the Word
of God-commands to be done, so as they be not commanded as Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Word, but as the Laws of men; but that is undeniable adding to the
Word of God, to say, that Superiours may not command such things which
God hath no where forbidden, and taking from the Word of God, to deny that
Power to men, which Gods Word hath given them.]</p>

Magistrates or Ministers <hi>de specie,</hi> and to do this according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rule of Scripture, and in order to the main end, and not against
it) is not against the Royalty or Will or Christ; but to make new
dedicating Covenanting Symbols, to signifie the Doctrine of the
Covenant of Grace, and solemnly engage us unto God, and place
these in the publick Worship, which are not meer Circumstances,
but substantial Institutions, not necessary <hi>in genere</hi> (that there should
be any such at all, besides Gods Sacraments) we fear this is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Royalty of Christ, and a reflection on his Laws, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient.
For, 1. If it belong to the Power proper to Christ, then
it is a violation of his Royalty, for any man to exercise it; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the Power proper to Christ, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. The Minor is
proved thus: If it belong to the universal Head, or Ruler of the
Church, as such; then it belongs to the Power proper to Christ;
(for we are ready to prove there is now under him, no universal
Head or Ruler, personally, or collectively and civilly one) But, &amp;c.
If in the Reason of it, it should be the matter of an universal Law,
if any, then it should be the work of the universal Law-giver, if
any: But, &amp;c. If in the Reason of it, it be equally useful to the
Church, universal as to any particular Church, or Age, then it
should according to the reason of it, be the matter of an universal
Law, if of any: But, &amp;c. It hath the <hi>same aptitude,</hi> to engage us
to a duty of <hi>universal necessity,</hi> and hath <hi>no reason proper to this Age,</hi>

such things: To do all things decently and orderly, and to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is no giving of power on that pretence, to make new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting
dedicating Signs: To do Gods work decently, &amp;c. is not
to make more such of our own heads; it's but the right modify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the work already set us. And to do all decently, orderly, and
to edification, was a duty in <hi>Moses</hi> time, when yet such things as
these in question might not be added by any but God: (when we say
<hi>by God,</hi> we mean by his inspired Instruments; and when we say <hi>by

Or, if we were to put on an <hi>Helmet,</hi> and other <hi>Armour,</hi> in

in the sense, as the word was used of old, when it signified a
Soldiers solemn listing, or covenanting with his Commander. Thus
by distinguishing decent and orderly modes, and Circumstances
necessary <hi>in genere,</hi> from new Ordinances, even solemn dedicating,
covenanting, or such like mystical Signs; we have shewed you what
we grant, and where you fail, and what is indeed a wrong to Christ,
and an accusation of his Laws, and what not? and how unjust your
following accusation of us is (who never yet told you, we <hi>would be

But suppose there be any so scrupulous, as not satisfied with what
hath been written, the Church may still without sin, urge her Command
for these decent Ceremonies, and not be guilty of offending her weak Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

for subscribing that all these are lawful, and for swearing obedience

yet of no more force with us that come after them; but whatever

the Ministry or Church-Communion) that will not wear this or that,
or bow thus or thus, or look this way or that way, or say this word
or that word; and when we have laid such a needless snare, we
will uncharitably cry out [that the <hi>world will be brought into Confusion,
because men that list not to obey, would have the Laws abrogated]</hi> where
hath Christ set you to <hi>make such Laws?</hi> Is it not work enough for
us and you, to obey the Laws that he hath made? why made <hi>he</hi> none
for Postures, and Vestures, and Words, and Teaching Signs of this
nature, if he would have had them? If he had not told us, that there
is <hi>one Law-giver, one Lord;</hi> and that his Word is able to make us
wise unto Salvation; and that he would lay no greater burden on us,
than <hi>necessary things,</hi> and would not have us despise or judge each
other on such occasions: If he had but told us, that he left any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
after his inspired Apostles, for the making of Ceremonies, or
new Laws of Worship, or Teaching engaging Signs for the Church,
we would as gladly understand and obey his Will in these things, as
you. What hurt is it to us, to use a Cross or other Ceremony, if it
were not for fear of disobeying God? Enforce Gods Law upon us,
as zealously as you will, and see if we will disobey it: But that the
world shall run into confusion, rather than we shall leave to serve
God, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did, without Crossing, Surplices, and kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Sacrament, and then that we shall be reproached as the
Cause of all, by our disobedience: God hath told the world by his
Word, and will tell them by his Judgements, that this is not his
way to Unity and Peace. As to your Argument, from your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
<hi>weakness,</hi> we say, 1. It is not <hi>your strength</hi> to slight <hi>it,</hi> or <hi>them;</hi>
nor is it <hi>their weakness,</hi> that they are willing to be <hi>esteemed weak.</hi> The
Apostle called those <hi>weak,</hi> that placed a necessity in indifferent
things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and not those that understood their indifferency.
But the truth is, the nature of things indifferent, is not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by all on either side; some may think evil of some things
that deserve it not, and in this they are weak, though in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

the worst, that you your selves can charitably suppose: you can say
no more of them, but that they are weaker, that is, <hi>in this know less
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102298:59"/>
then you:</hi> though perhaps <hi>we</hi> may take them to be stronger, that is
to be more in the right; yet are we not so confident, as to censure
you or others; but speak of things difficult, and doubtful, as they
are. But how <hi>prove</hi> you that we would <hi>take it ill, to be our selves, or
have those we speak of accounted ignorant</hi> in such things as these? use
us no worse then the <hi>ignorant</hi> should be used. And till you would
turn a man out of the Ministry, or Church, for being <hi>ignorant</hi> of the
nature of a <hi>Ceremony</hi> (which never was in his Creed, the Decalogue
or Scripture) deal not so by <hi>us,</hi> that would be wiser if we knew how;
That all our ignorance is our own fault we deny not; But it is an
excesse of confidence, and uncharitableness, to tell us that there
is so very much written as may satisfie any man [that <hi>hath a mind to be
satisfied]</hi> when we professe in his sight that knoweth the hearts, that
we <hi>have a mind to be satisfied,</hi> and would know the truth, at what
rate soever if we knew how: what would you have us to do that we
do not, to be satisfied? Do we not read as much for Ceremonies,
as the dissenters use to do against them? many Books against them
are yet uuanswered: as we never shuned any Publick or private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with any of you, and such reasonings are not like to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us. If you will be the Judges of your Brethrens hearts, and say
it <hi>is not tenderness of Conscience,</hi> but <hi>stubbornness,</hi> we shall refer
that to the day, when your hearts, and ours shall all be opened.
Must none be tender Conscienced, that dare not venture to obey you
in such things? when you may with undoubted safety forbear the
imposing of your Ceremonies, and so forbear the casting out of your
Brethren, if you will not, who shews less tenderness of <hi>Conscience?</hi>
That the scandal is taken, and not given, is still the thing in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as to many things: And if it were no just occasion of offence,
yet you ought not to lay that which others weakness will turn into
a stumbling block, <hi>unnecessarily</hi> before them. If the Apostles Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                     <note place="margin">Repl.</note> But because at our last Meeting, it was said with so much
confidence by one, that the Case in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and 15. was nothing to
ours, we shall here say the more to what you say, that <hi>Pauls</hi> not
eating flesh is nothing to the purpose: your reasons are, 1. Because
he speakes of nothing commanded by God, or his Church. 2. Nor
of any thing of Decency, or significancy to serve in the Church.
To the first we have often told you, that which is undeniable, 1. That
<hi>Paul</hi> was a Governour of that Church himself, that had no Superior
to con trole him: If you say then, that he wrote not as a Governor;
we Answer, yes: for he wrote as an Apostle, and wrote that
Epistle that was to be a standing Law, or Canon to them; If this
be no act of his Office, and Authority, there was none such;
And then you must say the like of all the rest of the Epistles.
2. Moreover as <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Apostle excludeth</hi> all such impositions, so
he wrote to all the <hi>Resident Pastors</hi> that were at Rome, for he wrote
to the <hi>whole Church:</hi> and therefore these commands extend to the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi>
that they <hi>make not</hi> such things the matter of Contempt or
Censures, or any uncharitable course, but <hi>bear with one another in</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:102298:60"/>
them. Will you call men obstinate self-offenders, that differ from
you, when you have no better Answers then these to the plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions
of the holy Ghost? what we speak of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 15. we speak
also of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. And 3. It is to the <hi>Rulers</hi> of the Church that <hi>we</hi>
are speaking, and it is they that answer us: And shall the <hi>Rulers</hi>
say <hi>[if it were not a thing commanded we might bear with you]</hi> when it
is <hi>themselves</hi> that command them <hi>Ecclesiastically;</hi> and we intreat
them but to forbear that, and to concur with us in Petitioning the
<hi>King</hi> to forbear commanding them <hi>coercively;</hi> who no doubt will
easily forbear it, if they do their part. 4. Yea <hi>a fortiore</hi> it layeth
a heavier charge on such <hi>Governours</hi> then others. If it be so hainous
a Sin as <hi>Paul</hi> maketh it to <hi>censure,</hi> or <hi>despise</hi> one another, for meats
and dayes, and such like things, how much more to <hi>Excommuuicate,
silence,</hi> and <hi>undo</hi> one another? and deprive thousands of Souls of
the Preaching of the Gospel, that <hi>consented not</hi> to their Pastor's non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity?
5. <hi>Paul</hi> letteth you know, that those things are not the
Center or <hi>matter</hi> of our <hi>necessary Concord,</hi> but of <hi>mutual forbearance,</hi>
and therefore condemneth all that will make them <hi>necessary to our
Unity, Ministry,</hi> or <hi>Communion.</hi> 6. And the <hi>difference</hi> is wholly to
the <hi>advantage</hi> of <hi>our</hi> Cause; for those that <hi>Paul</hi> spoke to, were not
come so high as to go about to <hi>force others</hi> to do as they did, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to <hi>despise</hi> them for not doing it. 2. And therefore to the second
Reason we answer. 1. If the things had been <hi>different,</hi> yet so was
<hi>Pauls Injunction</hi> different from <hi>our request;</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> goeth so high as
to command them to <hi>deny their own Liberty,</hi> in not eating lawful
meats <hi>themselves,</hi> least they offend, and hurt their Breth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>we</hi> are now but desiring you, that you would not <hi>force others</hi>
to do that which they take to be a sin, and that with penalties that
fall heavier on the <hi>Church,</hi> then <hi>on them; They</hi> had on both sides
fairer pretences then <hi>you</hi> have: The Cases before us to be compared
are four; the Case of the <hi>refusers of meats and observers of dayes
then:</hi> The Case of the <hi>users of those meats, and not observers of those
dayes:</hi> The Case of <hi>our imposers:</hi> And the Case of <hi>non-conformists:</hi>
The pretence that <hi>their refusers of meats had,</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. was, that
being <hi>offered to Idols,</hi> they thought it made them <hi>partakers of the
Idolatry;</hi> and so they sinned through weakness in being offended at
others, and censuring them that used their Liberty: And had <hi>they</hi>
not here a fairer pretence for their offence and censures, then <hi>you</hi>
for your impositions? <hi>You</hi> cannot shew half so great an appearance
of <hi>good</hi> in the things <hi>commanded,</hi> as <hi>they</hi> could do of <hi>Evil</hi> in the things
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102298:60"/>
for which they were <hi>offended.</hi> And the <hi>offended censurer</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.
had <hi>this</hi> pretence, that the thing was forbidden in <hi>Gods own Law,</hi>
even the meats which he refused; and the dayes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmanded which
he observed: And he knew not that the Law in these matters of
Order and Ceremony was abrogated (which <hi>Peter</hi> himself was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of, when he refufed to eat things common and unclean:) But
<hi>you</hi> have no pretence of <hi>Gods own command</hi> for the matter of your <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,</hi>
as these men had for the matter of their <hi>offence,</hi> and <hi>censure:</hi>
so that <hi>here</hi> you are on the worser side. And for the <hi>other party,</hi> that
in 1 Cor. 8. <hi>abused their Liberty:</hi> and Rom. 14. <hi>despised their Brethren,</hi>
they had a double pretence: one was, that it was <hi>their Liberty;</hi> and if
every scrupulous party should drive them from their lawful <hi>meat,
and drink,</hi> they knew not whither they might drive them: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was, that the <hi>Law was abrogated by Christ;</hi> and therefore if they
complyed in practice with the scrupulous, or did not shew their
difference, they might seem to be guilty of the <hi>restoring of the Law,</hi>
and complying with the <hi>Jewes</hi> and the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that <hi>both</hi> then were
enemies to the Church, and agreed in this; had not these men now
a fairer pretence for eating, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. and for the dissent shewed,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. then you ever yet produced for forcing others from Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
and Church, (or into sin, and Hell, if they will obey you
against their Consciences) and all for that which you never pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to shew a command of God for? And others shew you (as they
think) Scripture, and Councils, and Custom against: To tell us then
that <hi>Paul</hi> spake of things <hi>[not Decent and Significant]</hi> is (pardon our
plainness) to say much less then nothing: For it was not against <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing</hi>
that <hi>Paul</hi> spake, but <hi>using,</hi> and <hi>not using, censuring</hi> and <hi>despising;</hi>
and their Arguments were (suitable to their Cause) of another kind
of moment, than <hi>Decency</hi> or <hi>Indecency, Significancy</hi> or <hi>Insignificancy,</hi>
even from supposed <hi>Idolatry rejecting Gods Law,</hi> and <hi>complying
with Jews, and Hereticks, in restoring the Law,</hi> and casting away
the <hi>Liberties</hi> purchased by Christ, even in their private eating, and
drinking. To be no more tedious now, we humbly offer in any way
convenient to try it out, with the Reverend Brother that so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
asserted the disparity of the cases; and to prove, that <hi>these
Scriptures most plainly condemn your impositions now in qnestion;</hi> though
we should have thought, that one impartial reading of them might end
the controversie, and save the Church and you from the sad effects.
As to that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. we answer, 1. It is uncertain whether the
word <hi>[Custom]</hi> refer to the matter of <hi>Hair,</hi> or to <hi>contention:</hi> so many
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102298:61"/>
Expositors judge, q. d. <hi>[the Churches of God are not contentious]</hi>
2. Here is no <hi>Institution</hi> (muchless by fallible men) of new <hi>Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Dedicating, or Teaching Symbols, or Ceremonies;</hi> nor is here any
<hi>unnecessary thing enjoyned,</hi> but that which <hi>nature,</hi> and the <hi>Custom</hi> of
the Country had made <hi>so decent,</hi> as that the opposite would have
been <hi>abusively indecent:</hi> This is not <hi>your Case.</hi> A <hi>Cross</hi> or <hi>Surplice</hi> is
not <hi>decent</hi> by <hi>nature,</hi> or <hi>common reputation,</hi> but by <hi>Institution</hi> (that
is, not at all; for if it be not instituted, because decent, it will not
be decent, because instituted) nor are these so decent, as the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to be indecent. The <hi>Apostles</hi> worshipped God as decently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them, as <hi>you</hi> do with them: The Minister prayeth in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi>
as decently <hi>without</hi> the Surplice, as in the <hi>Reading place with it.</hi> 3.
<hi>Paul</hi> doth but exhort them to this <hi>undoubted Comeliness</hi> (as you may
well do, if men will do any thing, which nature or common reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
makes to be slovenly, unmannerly or indecent, as being
covered in Prayer, or singing Psalms, or any such like; about
which we will never differ with you:) But even <hi>here,</hi> he talks not
of <hi>force,</hi> or <hi>such penalties</hi> as tend to the greater hurt of the Church,
and the ruin of the person.</p>

then the party that is most <hi>lustful, ambitious, covetous,</hi> and
<hi>licentious,</hi> are likest to be most the Cause. And for <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness,</hi>
we should take it for a great attainment of our ends, if

And for <hi>our selves,</hi> we shall take your Admonitions or Severities
thankfully, when ever we are convicted by you, of any such sins.
We are loth to enter upon such Comparisons, between the Ministers

and pluralities of the Clergy; yea, who would be glad on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half

leave to Preach to their Flocks for nothing. We say your intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
maketh us lift up our hands and hearts to Heaven, and think,
O what is man! what may not by some History be told the World!
O how desirable is the blessed day of the righteous universal Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

to be judged of man! We hope upon pretence of not suffering us
to deceive the People, you will not deny <hi>liberty to Preach the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
saving Truths</hi> of the Gospel, considering how terrible a <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom</hi>

to Preach to the Gentiles, that they might be saved; to fill up their

Betters,</hi> even <hi>Christs Apostles,</hi> and the <hi>universal Church, for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years,</hi> thought not <hi>kneeling most decent;</hi> nor did the Church, in
the <hi>first Age,</hi> think <hi>sitting unmeet</hi> in that Service, to the King of the
Church: And we hope you reprehend them not. 2. You require not
the <hi>Adult,</hi> that are <hi>baptized,</hi> to receive <hi>that Seal</hi> or <hi>Sacrament</hi> knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
3. When <hi>kneeling at Prayers</hi> was in use, in the <hi>Apostles times,</hi>
yet <hi>kneeling</hi> in the <hi>reception of the Sacrament</hi> was not. 4. Why can you
so lightly put off, both the <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church in this,
more than in other such things? However you cannot here deny <hi>de
facto,</hi> but that <hi>kneeling on the Lords dayes in the receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
was for many hundred years, of the purer times of the Church,
<hi>disused</hi> and <hi>condemned:</hi> And why do you not tell us, what other
General Council repealed this, that we may see whether it be such,
as we are any way bound by? When you say <hi>[the Church may vary
in such indifferent things]</hi> 1. If <hi>kneeling</hi> or <hi>standing</hi> at <hi>Prayer,</hi> be an
<hi>indifferent thing,</hi> then so are they at <hi>this Sacrament.</hi> 2. Then <hi>you</hi>
follow the <hi>Changers,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> the <hi>old Pattern.</hi> 3. Then the <hi>Canons</hi> of
<hi>general Councils</hi> and <hi>Customs,</hi> pretended to be from <hi>Apostolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
may be <hi>changed.</hi> 4. What is it, that you call <hi>the Church</hi> that
changeth, or may change these? A <hi>Council,</hi> or <hi>a popular Custom?</hi>
Bring us not under a <hi>forraign Power.</hi> 5. The thing then being so <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102298:63"/>
and changeable, you may change it</hi> if you please, for <hi>ends</hi> that
are <hi>not indifferent.</hi> 6. And if <hi>now</hi> the <hi>Ministers</hi> may <hi>Pray standing,</hi>
why may not the <hi>People receive standing?</hi> 7. When you say,
that <hi>[to sit, was never the use of the best times]</hi> you deny the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
and <hi>primitive times</hi> to be <hi>the best;</hi> as to the <hi>extent</hi> of the Church,
they were not the <hi>best,</hi> but as to the <hi>purity</hi> of administrations they
were.</p>

The shreds cited by you prove a <hi>Lyturgy indeed,</hi> such as <hi>we have

the <hi>words of Baptism, of Consecration, Commemoration,</hi> and delivery

they were left at liberty. If the <hi>Benedicite,</hi> the <hi>Hymns,</hi> or other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages

enough to some, it is no wonder when they <hi>rest</hi> not in the <hi>greater
plainness</hi> of the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> where Prayer is so frequently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
as much of the imployment of believers, and so many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
encouragments and exhortations given about it, and yet no

or once made mention of, no man directed here to use such, no man
exhorted to get him a Prayer <hi>Book,</hi> or to read or learn it, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
that he add or diminish not: whereas the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> that
were then given to the Church, men are exhorted to read, and study,
and mediate in, and discourse of, and make it their continual delight:
and its a wonder that <hi>David</hi> that mentions it so oft, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. doth
never mention the <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> or <hi>Common Prayer Book,</hi> if they had any:
And that <hi>Solomon</hi> when he dedicated the house of Prayer without a
<hi>Prayer Book,</hi> would onely beg of God, to hear <hi>[what Prayers, or what
Supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all the People of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
when every one shall know his own sore, and his own grief, and shall
spread forth his hands in that house] 2 Chro.</hi> 6. 29. and that he giveth
<hi>no hint</hi> of any <hi>Lyturgy</hi> or <hi>Form,</hi> so much as in those <hi>common Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
and talks of no other Book then the knowledge of <hi>their own
sores,</hi> and their <hi>own griefs:</hi> And in the Case of <hi>Psalms,</hi> or <hi>singing
unto God</hi> where it is certain, that they had a <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> or <hi>Form,</hi> (as
<hi>we have,)</hi> they are <hi>carefully collected, preserved,</hi> and <hi>delivered</hi> to us,
as a choice part of the <hi>holy Scripture.</hi> And would it not have been so
with the <hi>Prayers,</hi> or would they have been <hi>altogether numentioned,</hi> if
they also had been there prescribed to, and used by the Church, as
the <hi>Psalms</hi> were? would Christ and his Apostles even where they
were <hi>purposely giving Rules</hi> for <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>correcting its abuse,</hi> (as
<hi>Mat. 6. 1 Cor. 14, &amp;c.)</hi> have <hi>never</hi>-mentioned any <hi>Forms</hi> but the
<hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> if they had appointed such, or desired such to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and observed? These things are incredible to us when we
most impartially consider them; for our own parts as we think it
uncharitable to forbid the use of <hi>Spectacles</hi> to them that have weak
eyes, or of <hi>Crutches</hi> to them that have weak Limbs, and as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102298:64"/>
to <hi>undo all</hi> that will not use them, whether they need
them or not; so we can think no better of them, that will suffer <hi>none</hi> to
<hi>use such Forms, that need them,</hi> or that will suffer <hi>none</hi> to <hi>pray but in
the words of other mens prescribing,</hi> though they are at least, as able as
the prescribers. And to conclude, we humbly crave that <hi>ancient
customs</hi> may not be used <hi>against themselves,</hi> and us, and that you will
not <hi>innovate,</hi> under the shelter of the name of <hi>Antiquity.</hi> Let those
things be <hi>freely used among us</hi> that were <hi>so used</hi> in the <hi>purest Primitive
times.</hi> Let <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> be laid on nothing, on which <hi>they</hi> laid
them not; let <hi>diversity</hi> of <hi>Lyturgy,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> be allowed where
<hi>they</hi> allowed it. May we but have <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> on the Terms as
the <hi>Ancient Church</hi> enjoyed them, we <hi>shall</hi> then hope we may
yet escape the hands of uncharitable destroying zeal: we therefore
humbly recommend to your observation the Concurrent testimony
of the best Histories of the Church, concerning the <hi>diversity</hi> of
<hi>Lyturgy, Ceremonies,</hi> and modal observances; in the several Churches
under one and the same civil Government: and how they then took
it to be their <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>forbear each other</hi> in these matters, and how they
made them not the test of their Communion, or Center of their
peace concerning the <hi>Observation</hi> of <hi>Easter</hi> it self, when other <hi>Holy</hi>-days,
and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were urged, were less stood upon, you have
the judgement of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Bishops in whose name he
wrote in <hi>Eusob. Hist. Eccl. l.</hi> 5. 6. 23. Where they reprehend <hi>Victor</hi> for
breaking peace with the <hi>Churches that differed about the day, and the
antecedent time of Fasting,</hi> and tell him that the <hi>variety began, before
their times,</hi> when yet they <hi>nevertheless retained Peace, and yet retain
it, and the discord in their Fasting declared, or commended the concord
of their Faith,</hi> that <hi>no man was rejected from Communion by</hi> Victors
<hi>Predecessors on that account, but they gave them the Sacrament, and
maintained Peace with them,</hi> and particularly <hi>Policarp,</hi> and <hi>Anicetus</hi>
held <hi>Communion</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> notwithstanding this <hi>difference.

of their <hi>own Lyturgy,</hi> that it was not known in the time of their

and he professeth to <hi>pardon all such things, so be it the principal
things be kept safe. Socr. Hist. Ec. l. 51. c.</hi> 21. about the <hi>Easter</hi> difference,
saith <hi>[that neither the Apostles, nor the Gospel, do impose a yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
on those that betake themselves to the Doctrine of Christ, but left the
Feast of Easter, and other Festivals, to the observation of the free and equal
Judgement of them that had received the benefits. And therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
men use to keep some Festivals, for the relaxing themselves from
labours, several Persons in several places, do celebrate of custom, the
memorial of Christs Passion Arbitrarily, or at their own choice. For
neither our Saviour, nor the Apostles commanded the keeping of them
by any Law, nor threaten any mulct, or penalty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It was the purpose
of the Apostles not to make Laws for the keeping of Festivals, but to be
Authors to us of the reason of right living, and of Piety.</hi> And having
shewed that it came up by private custom, and not by Law, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cited <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> as before he addeth, <hi>[that those that agree in the
same Faith, do differ in point of Rites, and Ceremonies]</hi> and instancing
in divers, he concludeth <hi>[that because no man can shew in the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of writings, any command concerning this, it is plain that the
Apostles herein permitted free Power to every ones mind and will; that
every man might do that which was good without being induced by fear or
by necessity.</hi> And having spoken of the <hi>diversity</hi> of customs, about
the <hi>Assemblies, Marriage, Baptism,</hi> &amp;c. He tells us <hi>[that even
among the Novatians themselves there is a diversity in their manner of
their praying, and that among all the Forms of Religions and parties, you
can no where find two, that consent among themselves in the manner of
their praying.]</hi> And repeating the decree of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Act. 15.
[To impose no other burden but things necessary]</hi> he reprehendeth them
<hi>[that neglecting this, will take fornication as a thing indifferent, but strive
about Festivals, as it were a matter of life, overturning Gods Laws, and
making Laws to themselves.]</hi> And <hi>Sozomen Hist. Eccl. l. c.</hi> 18. and 19.
speaketh to the same purpose, and tells us that the <hi>Novatians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
determined in a Synod at Sangar in Bythinia, that the differenoe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Easter being not a sufficient cause for breach of Communion, all should
abide in the same concord, and in the same Assembly, and every one should
celebrate this Feast as pleased himself: and this Canon they called</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
and <hi>c.</hi> 19. He saith of <hi>Victor,</hi> and <hi>Policarp,</hi> that <hi>[they deservedly judged
it frivolous, or absurd, that those should be separated on the account of a
custom, that consented in the principal heads of Religion: For you cannot find
the same Traditions in all things alike, in all Churches though they agree
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102298:65"/>
among themselves]</hi> and instancing in some Countreys, where there is
but <hi>one Bishop</hi> in <hi>many Cities,</hi> and in <hi>others,</hi> Bishops are ordained in the
<hi>Villages.</hi> After many other instances, he adds <hi>[That they use not the
same Prayers, Singings or Readings, nor observe the same time of using
them.]</hi> And what Lyturgy was imposed upon <hi>Constantine</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour?
or what Bishops or Synods, were then the makers of <hi>Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi>
when he <hi>himself</hi> made <hi>publick Prayers for himself</hi> and <hi>Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and for his <hi>Soldiers? Euseb. de vit. Constantini, l. 4. c.</hi> 18, 20.
&amp;c. But the diversity, liberty, and change of <hi>Lyturgies</hi> in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
under the same Prince, are things so well known, as that we
may suppose any further proof of it to be needless: In the conclusion
therefore we humbly beseech you, that as <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and the <hi>Customs
of the Churches in the first Ages,</hi> is that which is most commonly and
confidently pleaded against us, that your <hi>mistake of Antiquity</hi> may not

<hi>in a stiff maintaining of their old Customs, had not utterly refused it:
But yet in other matters, they embraced each other with so singular a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
and Love, that they would willingly have dyed for each other,</hi>
(as <hi>Socrates</hi> tells us, <hi>Hist. lib. 2. cap. 30.)</hi> And may we not all here

the <hi>liberty of their Meetings within the City,</hi> he <hi>refused</hi> it, because
<hi>they had suffered for the Faith in the</hi> Arrians <hi>persecution,</hi> and <hi>changed
nothing in the Faith,</hi> though they <hi>separated from the Church;</hi> and was
so far from <hi>violence</hi> against <hi>dissenters,</hi> as that he <hi>gave large relief</hi> to
them that <hi>differed from him in Religion, Socrat. Hist. lib. 7. cap.</hi> 25.
It was the much praised saying of <hi>Theodosius</hi> to him, that asked him,
<hi>why he put none to death that wronged him; [I would I could rather make
them that are dead, alive] Socrat. l. 7. c.</hi> 22. Much more should <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

there is <hi>perfect Charity</hi> and <hi>Sanctity;</hi> and that <hi>destroying one another,</hi>

that <hi>Unity</hi> is to be held in <hi>things necessary,</hi> and <hi>liberty in things unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi>
and <hi>Charity in both.</hi> Remember that it was in a far greater

thought it no impertinent digression, here to take this occasion, again to

<hi>(Socrat. lib. 4. cap. 18.)</hi> when he saw a Woman pompously adorned, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>
He <hi>was not so careful to please God, as</hi> She <hi>was to allure men:</hi> So we shall

many faithful Servants of his, whom he hath called into his Work, and
whose Cause we plead; and that however they <hi>are used,</hi> they shall not be

for the Life of his Son [If thou wilt receive the true Faith, and restore the

And, if it be the will of the Lord that suffering at home, where we have
served Him, must be our Lot, we doubt not but that he will furnish us with
strength and patience, and we shall remember such Ensamples as <hi>Ruffin</hi>

to judge which of his Parishioners he pleaseth, Atheists, Infidels, Hereticks,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then in that name to reject their Children from being baptized. Our
Church concludes more Charitably, that Christ will favourably accept every
Infant to Baptism, that is presented by the Church, according to our present or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and this she concludes out of holy Scripture (as you may see in the Office of
Baptism) according to the Practice and Doctrin of the Catholick Church, <hi>Cyp.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> We perceive you will stick with us in more then Ceremonies.
To your Reasons we reply, 1. By <hi>that Reason,</hi> all the Children of all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
or Infidels in the world, should be admitted to Baptism, because
<hi>they, should not be punished for the Parents sakes.</hi> 2. But we deny that it is
(among Christians that believe Original Sin) any absurdity, to say that
Children are punished for their Parents sakes. 3. But yet we deny <hi>this</hi>
to be <hi>any such punishment</hi> at all, unless you will call their <hi>non-deliverance</hi> a
<hi>punishment.</hi> They are the <hi>Children of Wrath by nature,</hi> and have Original
sin. The Covenant of Grace, that giveth the saving Benefits of Christ,
is made to none but the faithful and their Seed. Will you call this a <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
them for their Fathers sakes,</hi> that God hath extended his Covenant
to no more? Their Parents infidelity doth but <hi>leave</hi> them in their <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
sin</hi> and <hi>misery,</hi> and is not further <hi>it self</hi> imputed to them; If you know
of any <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>Promise</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> made to <hi>all</hi> without <hi>Condition,</hi> or
to <hi>Infants</hi> on <hi>any other Condition</hi> or qualification, but that they be the <hi>Seed
of the faithful dedicated to God,</hi> you should do well to shew it us, and not
so slightly pass over things of so great moment, in which you might much
help the world out of darkness, if you can make good what you intimate:
If indeed you mean as you seem to speak, that its <hi>uncharitableness</hi> to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<hi>any Infants</hi> for the <hi>Parents faults,</hi> and that a <hi>non-liberation</hi> is such a <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t,</hi>
then you must suppose, that <hi>all the Infants</hi> of Heathens, Jews, and
Turks are saved (that dye in Infancy) or else <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>uncharitable:</hi> And
if they are all saved <hi>without Baptism,</hi> then <hi>baptizing</hi> is of no use or necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as you seem to think. What then is the priviledge of the Seed of
the Faithful, that they are <hi>Holy,</hi> and that the Covenant is made with
them, and God will be their God? We fear you will again revive
the opinion of the Anabaptists, among the People, when they observe
that you have no more to say for the baptizing of the <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
than of <hi>Infidels,</hi> Heathens and Athiests. To your second Objection,
we Answer: You will drive many a faithful Labourer from the work of
Christ, if he may not be in the Ministry, unless he will baptize the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Infidels, Heathens, and Excommunicate ones, before their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
do repent. And the <hi>first</hi> question is not, <hi>who shall be judge?</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102298:74"/>
                     <hi>we must be all thus forced?</hi> Is not the question as great, <hi>who shall be
judge</hi> of the <hi>unfitness</hi> of persons for the <hi>Lord's Supper?</hi> and yet <hi>there</hi> you
think it not a taking too much upon us, to keep away the scandalous, if
they have their <hi>Appeals</hi> to <hi>you?</hi> And is it indeed <hi>(a power too great and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary)</hi>
to have a <hi>judicium discretionis</hi> about our <hi>own Acts?</hi> and not to be
forced to baptize the Children of Heathens against our Consciences? who
judged for the <hi>Baptizers</hi> in the primitive Church, what persons they should
baptize? We act but as <hi>Engines</hi> under you, and not as men, if we must
not use our reason; and we are more miserable than brutes or men, if we
must be forced to go against our Consciences, unless you will save us harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
before God: O that in a fair debate you would prove to us, that such
Children as are described are to be baptized, and that the Ministers that
baptize them, must not have power to discern who to baptize. But who
mean you by the Churches that must present every Infant that Christ may
accept them? Is every Infant first in the Promise of pardon? (If so, shew
us that Promise) and then sure God will make good that Promise, though
Heathen Parents present not their Children to him, as (your grounds
suppose) if not, then will the sign save those that are not in the Promise:
But is it the God-fathers that are the Church, whoever called them so?
And if by the Church you mean the Minister, and by presenting, you meant
baptizing them, then any Heathens Child that a Minister can catch up and
baptize, shall be saved; which if it could be proved, would perswade us
to go hunt for Children in <hi>Turkie, Tartary,</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> and secretly bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
them in a habit that should not make us known; but there is more of
fancy than charity in this; and Christ never invited any to him, but the
Children of the Promise, to be thus presented and baptized.</p>

Guardians should Covenant and contract for their Minors to their benefit; by the
same right the Church hath appointed Sureties to undertake for Children, when
they enter into Covenant with God by Baptism, <hi>(St. Aug. Ep. 23.)</hi> And this

                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. Who made those Sureties Guardians of the Infants that are
neither Parents, nor Pro-parents, not Owners of them? we are not now
speaking against Sponsors: But you know that the very Original of those
Sponsors is a great Controversie: And whether they were not at first most
properly Sponsors for the Parents, that they should perform that part they
undertook (because many Parents were Deserrors, and many proved neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent)
Sponsors then excluded not Parents from their proper undertaking,
but joyned with them; Godfathers are not the Infants Guardians with
us, and therefore have not power thus to Covenant and Vow in their
names: We intreat you to take heed of leaving any Children indeed out
of the mutual Covenant that are baptised: How are those in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
that cannot consent themselves, and do it not by any that truly
represent them, nor have any Authority to act as in their names?
The Authority of Parents being most unquestionable (who by
nature, and the Word of God, have the power of disposing of their
Children; and consequently of choosing and covenanting for them)
Why should it not be preferred? at least, you may give leave to those
Parents that desire it, to be the Dedicators of, and Covenanters for
their own Children, and not force others on them whether they will or no.

It must then be the Minister, or the man himself. And must we

[I repent] and force him to absolve him, that they may deride him
and the Gospel. Some of us have known too many of those that have
for twenty or thirty years been common drunkards, seldome sober &amp;

so they said in sickness, dying within a few dayes or weeks after they

hatred of an holy like, reviling at those that are careful to please God;
yet saying, they hate them not as holy, but because they are all Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
or the like; and yet will say, they repent of their sins. Some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
not their accustomed swearing and cursing, while they profess re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
Some make no restitution for the wrong which they say they
repent of: And must we take all those for truly penitent? If not, the
Minister must judge. What you mean by your saying, [Our Church's

then we pretend to but must phrase it according to the nature
of the thing, and the sence of other Scriptures also that fullier open
it: There are three wayes of pardoning; 1. By grant or gift (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by a general act of pardon, or a particular.) 2 By sentence. 3. By
execution, that is, preventing, or taking off the penalty. The first of
these is done already by God in the Gospel. The second God doth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,
and his Ministers instrumentally, as his Messengers. The third,
(the taking off the penalty) they can do no otherwise in the case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, then by praying that God will take it off, and using his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
means. So that it is most evidens, that this Absolution that Ministers
are to perform, can be no other then to pronounce the penitent Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be absolved by God according to his Covenants: And if there
be no other should we not speak as intelligibly as we can? Indeed there
is more in absolving the Excommunicate, for then the Church both
judiciously<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and executively remitteth the penalty of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(to which also the Text, <hi>John</hi> 20. may have much respect) but the
penalty of damnation can be no otherwise remitted by us, than as is
expressed; and indeed, the thing is of such exceeding weight, that it
behoveth us to deal as intelligibly and openly in it, as we can. And
therefore we admire that you should say, <hi>The condition needs not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,

some in the ignorance and deceit of their hearts, and some as consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

they are to be confirmed. 3. Being confirmed, they are to be
admitted to the Lords Supper. 4. All that marry, and others, thrice a
year must receive the Lords Supper, (though unfit.) 5. The Minister
must absolve all the sick, that say they repent; (if we understand you,
for we suppose you allow not the Minister to be judge.) 6. This Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
must be absolutely expresly, <hi>I absolve thee from all thy sins,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Communion in his sickness, must in charity be presumed to be penitent

such baptizing, absolving, or delivering the Communion as foresaid.

then a Rubrick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> We marvel that you say nothing at all to our desire, <hi>that it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in a Rubrick, that Prayers and Exhortations there used are not for the
benefit of the dead, but onely for the comfort and instruction of the living:</hi> You
intend to have a very indiscreet Ministry, if such a needless circumstance
may not be left to their discretion. The contrivance of a Cap instead
of a Rubrick, shews that you are all unacquainted with the subject of
which you speak; and if you speak for want of experience in the case of
souls, as you now do about the case of mens bodies, we could wish you
some of our experience of one sort (by more converse with all the
members of the Flock) though not of the other. But we would here
put these three or four questions to you.</p>
               <p>1. Whether such of our selves as cannot stand still in the cold Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at the Grave half so long as the Office of Burial requireth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the certain hazard of our lives, (though while we are in motion we
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102298:81"/>
can stay out longer) are bound to believe your Lordships, that a Cap
will cure this better then a Rubrick, though we have proved the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to our cost, and know it as well as we know that cold is cold? Do
you think no place but that which a cap or clothes do cover, is capable
of letting in the excessively refrigerating air.</p>
               <p>2. Whether a man that hath the most rational probability, if not a
moral certainty, that it would be his death, or dangerous sickness
(though he wore twenty Caps) is bound to obey you in this case.</p>
               <p>3. Whether usually the most studious laborious Ministers, be not the
most invaletudinary and infirm? And 4thly, Whether the health of
such should be made a jest of by the more healthful, and be made so
light of as to be cast away, rather then a Ceremony sometime be left
to their discretion? And whether it be a sign of the right and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
spirit of Religion, to sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ect to such a ceremony? Both the life of
godliness, and the lives of Ministers, and the peoples<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>souls; much of
this concerneth the people as well as the Ministers.</p>
               <p>We see not why these words may not be said of any person,<note place="margin">Sect. 3. pag. 35.</note> whom we dare
not say is damned; and it were a breach of charity to say so even of those whose
repentance we do not see: For whether they do not inwardly and heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
even at the last act, who knows? And that God will not even then pardon
them upon such repentance, who dares say? It is better to be charitable and
hope the best, then rashly to condemn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> We spoke of persons living and dying in notorious sins, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
they were Whoredom, Perjury, Oppression, yea Infidelity or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism,
&amp;c. But suppose we cannot be infallibly certain that the man
is damned, because it is possible that he may repent, though he never
did express it: Will you therefore take him for a brother, whose soul
is taken to God in mercy? You are not sure that an excommunicate
person, or an Heathen doth not truly repent after he is speechless: But
will you therefore say, that all such dye thus happily? This is a most
delusory principle! The Church judgeth not of things undiscovered:
<hi>Non esse &amp; non apparere,</hi> are all one as to our judgement: We conclude
not peremptorily, because we pretend not here to infallibility. As we
are not sure that any man is truly penitent that we give the Sacrament
to, so we are not sure that any man dyeth impenitently. But yet we
must use those as penitent, that seem so to reason, judging by ordinary
means, and so must we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udge those as impenitent that have declared
their sin, and never declared their repentance. It seems by you, that
you will form your Liturgy, so as to say, that every man is saved that
you are not sure is damned, though he shew you no repentance, and
so the Church shall say that all things are, that are but possible, if they
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102298:82"/>
conceit that charity requireth it. But if the living by this be kept from
connversion, and flattered into Hell, will they there call it charity that
brought them thither? O lamentable charity, that smoothers men's
way to Hell, and keepeth them ignorant of their danger till they are
past remedy! Millions are now suffering for such a sort of charity. Lay
this to the forementioned Propositions, and the World wil see that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we differ in greater things then ceremonies, and forms of prayer.</p>
