            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, And to the Honourable The KNIGHTS, CITIZENS, and BURGESSES In this preſent PARLIAMENT Aſſembled; 
The Humble PETITION of <hi>TIT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S OATES,</hi> D. D.</head>
            <opener>Moſt Humbly ſheweth,</opener>
            <p>THAT your Petitioner in the Year 1678, diſcovered a horrid Popiſh Conſpiracy for the Deſtruction of the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, his preſent Majeſty, and the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> within theſe Kingdoms; and prov'd it ſo fully, that ſeveral Parliaments, and Courts of Juſtice, before whom he gave his Teſtimony, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their Belief of it by publick Votes, and the Condemnation of ſeveral of the Conſpirators. For which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and becauſe your Petitioner would not be terrified by their Threats, nor ſeduced by their Promiſes of great Rewards (with both which Temptations they often aſſaulted him) to deſiſt in his Diſcovery; the Jeſuits and Papiſts purſued him with an implacable Malice, and endeavoured to take away his Fame and Life, by ſuborning Witneſſes to accuſe him of Capital Crimes; but being defeated in that Villanous Attempt, they firſt procured King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second to withdraw that Protection and Subſiſtence his Majeſty had, at the Requeſt of ſeveral Parliaments, allowed to your Petitioner; and then inſtigated his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to proſecute your Petitioner in an Action of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> for ſpeaking this notorious Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> That he <hi>the ſaid Duke of York was reconciled to the Church of Rome;</hi> and that <hi>It is High Treaſon to be ſo reconciled</hi> wherein a Verdict and Judgment for one Hundred Thouſand Pounds Damages were obtained againſt your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners and your Petitioner was committed to the King's-Bench-Priſon.</p>
            <p>After this, the ſame Popiſh Party obtained leave from King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, to prefer two ſeveral Indictments againſt your Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for two pretended Perjuries in his Evidence concerning the ſaid Conſpiracy, which they brought on to Tryal in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the ſecond; and your Petitioner was upon the Evidence of thoſe very Witneſſes, who had confronted him in three former Tryals, and were disbelieved; and through the Partial Behaviour of the Chief Juſtice <hi>Jeffreys,</hi> in brow-beating his Witneſſes; and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leading the Juries, convicted of the ſaid Pretended Perjuries, and received this inhumane and unparallel'd Sentence following, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>To pay two thouſand Marks to the king; To be deveſted of his Canonical habit: To be brought into</hi> Weſtminſter-Hall <hi>with a Paper upon his Head, with this Inſcription,</hi> Titus Oates <hi>convicted upon full Evidence of two horrid Perjuries: To ſtand in and upon the Pillow two ſeveral days, for the ſpace of an Hour: To be whip'd by the common Hang-man, from</hi> Aldgate <hi>to</hi> Newgate <hi>on Wednesday, and to be whip'd again on the Friday following from</hi> Newgate <hi>to</hi> Tiburn: <hi>To ſtand in and upon the Pillow five times in every Year of his Life; and to remain a Priſoner during his Life.</hi>
               </q> Which Sentence being intended, as your Petitioner hath juſt reaſon to believe, to murther him, was accordingly executed with all the Circumſtances of Barbarity; he having ſuffered ſome thouſands of Stripes whereby he was put to unſpeakable Tortures, and lay ten Weeks under the Surgeons Hands. Neither did their Cruelty ceaſe here, but becauſe your Petitioner, by God's Mercy miraculouſly ſupporting him, (and the extraordinary Skill of a Judicious Chirurgion) outlived that Bloody Uſage, ſome of them afterwards got into your Petitioner's Chamber whilſt he was weak in his Bed, and attempted to pull off the Plaiſters apply'd to cure his Back, and threatned to deſtroy him: And that nothing within their Power or Malice might be wanting to compleat your Petitioner's Miſery, they procured him to be loaded with Irons of exceſſive Weight for a whole Year, without any Intermiſſion, even when his Legs were ſwoln with the Gout; and to be ſhut up in the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, or Hole of the Priſon, whereby he became impair'd in his Limbs, and contracted Convulſion Fits, and other Diſtempers, to the great Hazard of his Life. All which illegal Proceedings, and barbarous Inhumanities, your Petitioner humbly conceives were not only intended as a Revenge upon him, but likewiſe to caſt a Reproach upon the Wiſdom and Honour of four ſucceſſive Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments who had given him Credit, and upon the Publick Juſtice of the Nation. And your Petitioner humbly hopes that ſince the Papiſts themſelves have verified and confirmed his Evidence by their late open and avowed Violations of our Religion, Laws, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, this Honourable Houſe will vindicate the Proceedings of former Parliaments, and diſcharge your Petitioner from thoſe Arbitrary and Scandalous Judgments, and the unjuſt Impriſonment he lies under.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Petitioner doth therefore moſt humbly beſeech your Lordſhips and your Honours, to take his deplorable Caſe into your generous and tender Conſideration, and to give him ſuch Redreſs therein as to your Lordſhips and your Honours great Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Goodneſs, ſhall ſeem meet:</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>And your Petitioner ſhall ever pray, &amp;c.</closer>
