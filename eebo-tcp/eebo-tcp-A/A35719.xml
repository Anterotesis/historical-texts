            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some Quaeries about the actions
of a Party, or Brigade to be ſent forth.</head>
            <p>FIrſt, whether if experience tells, that ſouldiers are ſeldome
got out of their quarters foure houres after the time ſet, it
be not diſcretion, the march intended being long, to prefixe a
ſooner time.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whether it be diſcretion to march within Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
ſhot of the enemy, and not to come there untill five houres
within night, not knowing the ſtrength of the enemy, nor how
he was quartered.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whether it he fit the Commander in chiefe ſhould
have long diſcourſe in private with a perſon of great report<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and quality, and after let him go, not ſo much as making him
priſoner.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Whether it be wiſe, when the enemy is fighting
with a part of the forces of an Army, and newes is brought to
the Commander in chiefe, that they are killing his men, and
have taken Colours from them, that he ſhould ſweare <hi>God
confound him,</hi> if any ſtirred to relieve them, he would piſtol
them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Whether it be diſcreet that the Commander in
chiefe march out of a place with part of his forces, never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
direction how the reſt of the forces ſhould diſpoſe of
themſelves, the enemy being but a mile off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:54647:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sixthly, Whether drawing of ſwords, and comming into
the quarters of other ſouldiers, hacking and he wing men of
the ſame Brigade, be not fit to be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Whether the murthering men of the ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be not puniſhable, as well as the killing of a priſoner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to mercy.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Whether it be fit thoſe men ſhould have quarters,
that refuſe to deliver up their Colours, pretending they were
burnt, when the Colours taking is the greateſt honour to the
Victor, and embleme of Victory.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Whether when the ſouldiers ſtand ready to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
a place, and all prepared for it, the enemy ſhooting, it be
not a fault to withhold the word of Command.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Whether it be fit a priſoner of quality ſhould in
his going to priſon, be as well mounted as any in the company,
and be accommodated with Piſtols, and other weapons.</p>
            <p>Eleven thly, Whether in caſe an Officer in a party, gone
out upon ſervice, refuſe to doe according to rules of War, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be commendable for the Commander in chiefe to draw
out a Regiment of Horſe to reduce him to obedience, and ſo as
much as in him lies, bring deſtruction to the whole party, and
whether it had not been better to call it to account.</p>
