            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was the leaſt of my Thoughts, when I had preached the greateſt part of the enſuing Sermons, once to ſuppoſe they ſhould ever be publiſhed to the World: But through ſome of your important Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and Deſires, I was prevailed with, many of you ſo readily and unexpectedly <hi>ſubſcribing</hi> to take off ſo great a Number of them; which had you not done, they had never ſeen the Sun, I not judging them deſerving ſuch a Publication. I am ſenſible of my great Inſufficiency; and might, from the Defects of my Ability for the great Work called to, have ſeen cauſe enough to have denied a Compliance with you herein: But hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo often formerly paſſed through the Cenſure of the World, made me perhaps the more unconcerned; and knowing that the moſt of them will come into your Hands, (who I hope will caſt a Mantle on my Humane Frailties) it was a farther Inducement to conſent. However, if the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God be pleaſed to ſucceed the great Pains I have taken, with his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, I ſhall ſee no cauſe to be troubled at what I have done. It's like ſome may object, I do not well to meddle with Controverſies at this time. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that I have, it is true, touched upon ſeveral controvertable Points; but not as they are Matters of Controverſy, but to clear up the Truths of Chriſt for the Eſtabliſhment and Comfort of the People committed to my Care. Beſides, I being miſrepreſented as touching my Judgment in ſome great Points, (as I have been informed) I thought it was my Duty to rectify ſuch Miſtakes. The grand Controverſy here inſiſted upon, is that about <hi>Election,</hi> and the <hi>Saints Final Perſeverance,</hi> which I hope the Reader will find to his ſatisfaction confirmed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> I have ſince theſe Sermons were printed off, met with a Book wrote by a <hi>Perſon,</hi> whom I both eſteem and honour, (excepting his Opinion) entituled, <hi>A Treatiſe touching Falling Away;</hi> wherein he endeavours to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſome of our Arguments: Had I met with it ſooner, I had given a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reply; but in the general he may find he hath here an Anſwer to what he hath ſaid. He endeavours to prove the Elect may be deceived; which we deny not, though not finally deceived; for that our Saviour inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates to be impoſſible: And to ſay, none are the Elect but they whoſe War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare is finiſhed, ſeems ſtrange to me; and to ſuppoſe the New Covenant
<pb facs="tcp:59949:3"/>
ſpoken of <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. refers to the Jews only when called at the latter Days, is not true, but is contradicted by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. Our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, That Sin cannot ſeparate from God's Love, is here alſo fully cleared: As alſo what he ſays, That Chriſt's Sheep may ceaſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and ſo fall out of his Hand, I have anſwered likewiſe: It is the Property of ſuch, they do and ſhall follow him; God has put his Fear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Hearts, and we ſhall not depart from him. Moreover, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities that he pretends, do attend the Doctrine of Final Perſeverance, I find I have taken off, though I ſaw not his Book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſtill the Cry is, <hi>Your Doctrine renders God ſo ſevere to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it can't be a Truth.</hi> In anſwer; Conſider, all acknowledg that God foreknew all his Creatures from Eternity, and who would not be ſaved, (which were far the greateſt number); and yet nevertheleſs he created them whom he knew would refuſe his Grace, and periſh Eternally; is he unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and too ſevere therefore? But enough is ſaid to remove ſuch Cavils in the enſuing Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> There is one thing I thought good to hint unto thee, <hi>viz.</hi> I have quoted ſeveral Authors and worthy Writers in tranſcribing theſe Sermons for the Preſs, that were not mentioned when I preach'd the Sermons; which may be I had then done, had I thought they ſhould have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the World. Alſo I have left out many of the Enlargements, for otherwiſe the Book had ſwelled almoſt as big again; ſo that you have but the Subſtance of what was delivered on theſe Texts, except it be that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Fan in Chriſt's Hand,</hi> which you have larger, God having been pleaſed to bleſs thoſe Sermons to the great Profit of many Perſons. But I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Reader will like this Treatiſe not the worſe for my brevity on each particular Head; for great Enlargements I find are not profitable nor approved of by Chriſtians of this preſent Age. I ſhall not therefore retain thee longer at the Door, but ſhall deſire thy Prayers, (as I have made them mine, and ſhall, God aſſiſting me) that this Work may be attended with Divine Bleſſings to thee from the Preſs, as it has been to many from the Pulpit. And let me, Reader, have a ſhare in thy ſervent Breathings (as I hope I ſhall not forget thee) when at the Throne of Grace; that I with you, and you with me, may be kept from falling, and preſerved in Chriſt's Hand to Eternal Life, who am willing to ſerve thee according to that ſmall Ability received, whilſt,</p>

neither of Heart, nor Life, for young nor old. It is not only to direct young Men to reform their Lives and Ways according to the Precepts of God's Word, nor to think by any degree of moral Righteouſneſs or inherent Holineſs they could be cleanſed; no, no, but to take heed according to the <hi>myſterious</hi> and <hi>ſublime Doctrine of God's free grace</hi> in Chriſt: Which was the only way of Salvation, as well under the Law as under the diſpenſation of the Goſpel.

For the <hi>Jews</hi> were his <hi>floor,</hi> in which was abundance of <hi>Chaff;</hi> and now Jeſus Chriſt was come with his <hi>fan</hi> in his hand, to purge this floor; and evident it is, <hi>his holy Doctrine</hi> ſevered, or ſeparated the <hi>Wheat</hi> from the <hi>Chaff;</hi> and by this means was the <hi>Wheat gathered into Chriſts Goſpel-Garner,</hi> and the <hi>Chaff</hi> blown away: for as <hi>Chaff</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure the wind of the <hi>fan,</hi> ſo could not thoſe unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jews,</hi> and hypocritical <hi>Phariſees,</hi> endure Chriſts holy and heavenly Doctrine. See Joh. 6. 52. to v. 60. <hi>How can this Man give us his fleſh to eat?</hi> They thought he ſpake of a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eating of his fleſh, as we eat the fleſh of Beaſts or Fiſh: His Doctrine was not underſtood by them. <hi>Then Jeſus ſaid unto them, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, except you eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you,</hi> ver. 53.</p>
                     <p>Now the eating of Chriſts fleſh, and drinking of his blood, is no other thing than the receiving Jeſus Chriſt by Faith for Righteouſneſs and eternal Life: <hi>Believing in Chriſt, coming to Chriſt, looking to Chriſt, leaning, truſting, or ſtaying on Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>eating of Chriſt,</hi> imply one and the ſame thing: It is our going out of our ſelves to him, or feeding by faith on him, or reſting, or relying on his Merits, on his Obedience in his Life, and in his Death, for Juſtification and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, without any Works done by us, or any Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wrought in us, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. <hi>But to him that</hi>

                     <p>But this myſterious and ſublime Doctrine the <hi>Jews</hi> could not bear, but it was ſuch a <hi>Fan</hi> as <hi>fanned</hi> them all away that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not: <hi>For they being ignorant of God's Righteouſneſs, going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Righteouſneſs of God.</hi> They thought their own perſonal <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3.</note>

and inherent Righteouſneſs was that by which they muſt be juſtified, accepted, and eternally ſaved: they had meat of their own to eat; and therefore ſaw no need to go to their Neighbours door for it; <hi>they were full,</hi> and <hi>increaſed in Goods,</hi> and thought they <hi>had need of nothing:</hi> And hence the Doctrine of Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone was rejected by them, it was not underſtood by them; that <hi>Chriſt's fleſh ſhould be Meat indeed, and his blood Drink indeed,</hi> was a ſtrange Doctrine in their apprehenſions; they could not conceive how ſuch things could be, (as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſpake of Regeneration.) Nor can any Man whatſoever who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 9.</note> no point of Faith, but what his natural reaſon can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; and thus this Doctrine of our Lord Jeſus was a <hi>Fan</hi> in his hand, and it fanned away all the <hi>Chaff</hi> of that mighty <hi>Jewiſh floor,</hi> even all that received not that Doctrine, or who believed not in Chriſt, received not Chriſt by Faith for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and eternal life: Nay it was ſuch a <hi>Fan</hi> that it <hi>fann'd</hi> away ſome of Chriſts Diſciples, (not ſuch who were his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples indeed,) but many that followed him, and who are ſaid to believe on him; they believed he was the true <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> had ſome kind of faith, tho' not the Faith of Gods Elect: <hi>Many of his Diſciples when they heard this, ſaid, This is a hard ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>

                        <hi>who can bear it?</hi> It ſeemed hard to them, becauſe they could not comprehend it by their own carnal reaſon: <hi>From thàt time many of his Diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.</hi> Such a <hi>Fan</hi> was this Doctrine then, and ſuch a <hi>Fan</hi> it is now, <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 66.</note> that it may be ſaid to make a diſcrimination between the pure <hi>Wheat</hi> and the <hi>Chaff:</hi> for no doubt all that receive not this holy Doctrine (whatever fair ſhew they make in the fleſh) are but <hi>Chaff</hi> in the ſight of God, and will be found ſuch at the laſt day. Nor ought they to be ſuffered to abide in Chriſt's <hi>Garner</hi> on Earth, (as they ſhall not be gathered into his <hi>Garner</hi> in Heaven) but be eſteemed as <hi>Chaff,</hi> or droſſy, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, whatſoever their converſations may be: (I mean ſuch who <hi>eat not Chriſts fleſh, and drink not his blood,</hi> i. e. wholly feed not upon Chriſt, rely not alone upon the Merits of a crucified Chriſt, or ſeek not Juſtification by his Righteouſneſs only, but go about to bring in their own Works and inherent Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with Chriſt's Merits in point of Juſtification in God's ſight.)

(I doubt not) likewiſe intended here: <hi>viz.

Becauſe the Covenant of Peculiarity God made with him and his natural ſeed as ſuch, as to the Date of the Duration thereof, was now <hi>run out</hi> and expired, <hi>the Ax being now laid to the root of the Tree, ver.</hi> 10<hi>th.</hi> So that unleſs they receive Chriſt, believe in Chriſt, and are found gracious perſons, fit <hi>Wheat</hi> for Chriſts ſpiritual Garner, or Goſpel-Church (which is built up of lively ſtones) as <hi>Chaff</hi> the Goſpel-diſpenſation like a <hi>Fan purges</hi> them out; as indeed it did, and blew them all away: And we are not alone in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this great Truth, for many of our worthy Brethren (who in ſome things differ from us) aſſert the ſame: particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Reverend Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> who ſpeaking of this Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 10. ſaith, "The <hi>firſt</hi> is the root of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Covenant, which this people much truſted upon, and of that it is which <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Now is the Ax laid to the root of the Tree, think not to ſay within your ſelves, we have Abraham to our Father;</hi> ſo that all their confidence that they had in <hi>Abraham's Covenant, Temple and Tabernacle,</hi> and ſuch things, are burnt up, and ſo they have no Root left them to ſtand upon, and this is one thing intended by the <hi>Root.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"<hi>Secondly,</hi> There is (ſaith he) ſomething more in it; the Lord by the power of his Spirit doth cut us off from any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our natural Gifts and Parts, and ſpiritual Gifts alſo, or from any Confidence of our own ſufficiency; the Lord hath cut us off from hope in the Righteouſneſs of our Parents, and from boaſting of Ordinances. And again he ſaith, This we read of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 1. It is ſpoken of the Miniſtry of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> which did <hi>burn as an Oven,</hi> againſt all the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi> and left them neither the Root of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Covenant, nor the Branch of their own good Works: He cutteth them off from the Covenant of <hi>Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> And by cutting them off from the Root, he leaveth them no ground to truſt on." Thus Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> on <hi>The Covenant,</hi> p. 177, and <hi>p.</hi> 21, 22. Now evident it is, that nothing but the diſpenſation of God's
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59949:12"/>
Providence, or the Expiration of that period of Time deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Almighty for the ſtanding of the Church of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> could cut the <hi>Jews</hi> off as a Nation, from being a Church and peculiar People unto God; I mean in reſpect of that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Covenant. I deny not but that the Covenant of Grace God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and with his true ſpiritual Seed, ſtands firm for ever and ever, and none in that Covenant can be cut off, nor fanned away: for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſthood, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and Church-memberſhip, and all their Church-priviledges, were to remain until Chriſt came, or until the time of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; that is, till the Goſpel-days and Goſpel-diſpenſation took place, and no longer: But now that time being come, and they not ſeeing an end put to the old Covenant-Church, as it was made with the natural Offspring of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and that their right to legal Ordinances, and Church-memberſhip, could not give them any right to Goſpel Ordinances, nor Goſpel-Church-memberſhip, and they not believing in Chriſt, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of the Terms of the Goſpel, were all of neceſſity purged out or <hi>fanned away,</hi> by the <hi>Fan</hi> of the New Teſtament-diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and ſo were no longer a people in any ſenſe in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Chriſt hath alſo another <hi>Fan</hi> in his hand, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Fan</hi> of Church-Diſcipline. And many perſons falling into ſin are purged like <hi>Chaff</hi> out of his <hi>floor.</hi> Hereby,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Sometimes ſome evil and corrupt Perſons, who get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong God's people (or into his Church) and paſs a while for <hi>Wheat, i. e.</hi> for gracious Perſons, yet in time God ſuffers them to fall into one Temptation or another, by which means they are <hi>fann'd away,</hi> the Holy Jeſus by his wiſe. Providence make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a diſcovery of them, and their evil Tempers and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. May be ſome glorious Truths, or Truth of Jeſus Chriſt, is revealed, or cleared up to his Church in General, to which ſeveral Perſons of the ſame Congregation may not only want Light in, but may be filled with Prejudice againſt, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Truth, but againſt the Church or Miniſter for ſeeking to bring it in; and this may riſe to ſuch a height, through their Pride and Stubborneſs, that they will not abide any longer Members thereof, but violently rend themſelves by Schiſm, and ſo are purged out. Tho' (as 'tis obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Husband-man) ſome <hi>light Corn,</hi> may be good <hi>Wheat,</hi> may be <hi>fanned out</hi> with the <hi>Chaff,</hi> which he knows how
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59949:13"/>
to recover by fanning the Chaff alſo afterwards. And thus it was with ſome of thoſe who were called Chriſt's Diſciples, they could not, would not endure that bleſſed Truth Chriſt <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 60. 66.</note> preached to them, of <hi>Eating of his Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. but cried out, <hi>This is a hard ſaying, who can bear it?</hi> and ſo <hi>went away and walked no more with him.</hi> O ſee what the Effects of preaching ſome Truths may be! how many are there who cannot bear in this day ſound Doctrine, but deſert his People, and ſome Truths of Chriſt, and ſeem to ſhut their eyes againſt them, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Error and falſe Doctrine, and what not? And this way God takes (in his wiſe Providence) to purge out ſome rotten Members, which poſſibly were a repoach to his People: And altho' may be ſome <hi>Wheat,</hi> may by this means through Satans Temptations, and Corruptions of their own hearts, and their great Ignorance, be <hi>fanned</hi> out with the <hi>Chaff,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried away by the Craftineſs and Subtilty of ſuch whom Chriſt hath a mind to ſever from the Body; yet he knows how to gather up the <hi>Wheat again,</hi> as the Husbandman doth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Others, whom Chriſt would have purged out of his Church, may be ſuffered to ſuck in ſome evil, corrupt and dangerous Principles, or Errors in Fundamentals, like that of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe Errours being diſcovered, were purged out. <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 20.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Alſo others fall into notorious and ſcandalous Sins, and ſo are purged out.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Some who are <hi>Chaff,</hi> or unſound Chriſtians, may be ſuffered to take up undue offences againſt the Church, or Churches to whom they belong, and by giving way to Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they may become unreconcileable, magnifying their own Wiſdom and Self-conceitedneſs, and ſo by a ſecret hand of God be diſcovered and purged out: But it muſt be conſidered that the uſe and exerciſe of the Keys, or Rules of Church-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, is appointed by Chriſt, as the proper <hi>Fan</hi> by which thoſe ſorts of Perſons laſt mentioned, and ſome others, are to be purged out of the Church or Congregations of the Saints. Now the <hi>Fan of Diſcipline</hi> is two-fold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Act of Excommunication: <hi>In the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when ye are gathered together, with my Spirit, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver ſuch a one unto Satan, for the Deſtruction of the Fleſh, that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 41.</note> 
                        <hi>the Spirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Chriſt by this <hi>Fan</hi> of Diſcipline purges out, are of three ſorts.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59949:13"/>
1. All groſs and ſcandalous Perſons, who are Guilty of any Act or Acts of Immorality, as <hi>Theft, Swearing, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Vncleanneſs, Covetouſneſs, Lying,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe being publick and reproachful Crimes, the Offender ought ſorthwith (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on clear proof) to be purged out, that the Name of the Lord may not be expoſed to contempt, and his People villified by the ungodly World; and time given to him for the proof and Trial of the ſincerity or Truth of his Repentance; which in part will be manifeſted by his Carriage and Behaviour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Puniſhment; I mean the Righteous Cenſure of the Church.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Second ſort</hi> that this <hi>Fan</hi> of Diſcipline takes hold of, are ſuch that ſuck in <hi>Hereſies</hi> or <hi>Capital Errors;</hi> theſe <hi>after</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Tit. 3. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>the firſt and ſecond Admonition,</hi> ought to be <hi>rejected and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to Satan, that they may not learn to Blaſpheme.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Third ſort</hi> are ſuch who refuſe to hear the Church after their caſe (in which they have offended) is regularly brought in againſt them according to the Rule contained in <hi>Matthew;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 18. 17.</note> the offence at firſt may be againſt one brother, and the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed party is firſt to tell him his fault between himſelf and his Brother or Siſter that hath offended him alone: Whom if he can bring to ſee and acknowledge his evil, it is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further; but if he cannot, then he is oblidg'd by the holy Law of Chriſt to take one or two more, and go to him, and ſtrive to convince him, and bring him to a ſight and ſenſe of his iniquity; but if he cannot do it, then it ought to be brought unto the Church, <hi>and if he will not hear the Church,</hi> then the Fan of Excommunication is to be uſed <hi>in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and they purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out.</p>
                     <p>As to ſuch who rend themſelves from a Church, or violate their ſacred Covenant by irregularly withdrawing themſelves, they ought to be <hi>marked, and ſolemnly in the publick Congregation</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 17, 18. 2 Theſſ. 3. 6, 14, 15. Matth. 18.</note>

                     <p>The <hi>Second part</hi> of the <hi>Fan</hi> of Diſcipline is that rule laid down by the Apoſtle, of <hi>withdrawing from every Brother and Siſter that walketh diſorderly;</hi> as ſuch that are <hi>Buſibodies, Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3. 6. Matth. 18. 17.</note>

cauſe Diviſion in the Church, and refuſe to live in Obedience to Chriſt, under the due and juſt Government thereof, or to obey them that are ſet over them in the Lord, or who ſtrive to have the prehemience, like <hi>Diotrophes,</hi> being Vain-glorious, prating againſt, or deſpiſing of Dignities, or the juſt Authority of Chriſts <hi>Miniſters,</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi> of his Churches, as the beloved Apoſtle ſpeaks, 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>Wherefore if I come, I will Remember his deeds which he doth, prating againſt us with malicious Words, and not content therwith, neither doth he himſelf receive the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and forbideth them that would, and caſteth them out of the Church.</hi> Theſe are to be marked and withdrawn from, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Not to be counted as Enemies, but exhorted as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:</hi> Unleſs they provoke the Church to further and a more ſevere Cenſure. Some of this ſort oft-times ſtrive to draw away diſciples after them, and ſeek to diſquiet the Peace of the Church, and in a fawning and flattering manner to deceive the hearts of the Simple; therefore theſe, if they will not hear the Church, are to be quite <hi>fanned out</hi> alſo by Excommunication, and to be looked upon as an <hi>Heathen-man or Publican,</hi> as in the Caſe of Notorious and Scandalous Sinners, or ſuch who are guilty of <hi>Hereſie. Mat.</hi> 18.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt hath alſo another <hi>Fan</hi> in his hand to purge his floor, or cleanſe his Wheat from the Chaff, filth and defilement of Sin, namely, the Holy Spirit; and by this means he cleanſes and Purifies in a gracious manner the Souls of his own People: <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are Sanctified, but ye are Juſtified in the Name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> What filthy Creatures were thoſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> before the Lord Jeſus by his Spirit had purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Sanctified them.</p>
                     <p>Faith, of the the Operation of God, is a moſt excellent Grace; it is by Faith in the Blood of Chriſt that we come to be purged from the Guilt of Sin; Faith applying his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Righteouſneſs unto the Soul in Juſtification; and ſuch is the Nature thereof, that it makes holy the Hearts and Lives of all ſuch Perſons in whom it is by the Spirit wrought or infuſed in Sanctification: <hi>And hath put no difference between them and us, Purifying their hearts by Faith.</hi> Yea, it cleanſeth them <note place="margin">Acts 15. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>from all filthyneſs of Fleſh and Spirit, that they may perfect Holyneſs in the fear of God.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 1.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But let me tell you that the Spirit and Grace of Chriſt in this reſpect is as a <hi>Fan,</hi> rather to Cleanſe the Saints, by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59949:14"/>
purging out the Chaff of Corruption, which naturally is in their Hearts and Lives, than to purge Hypocrites and groſs Profeſſors out of the Church, and to that I Principally referr here.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Moreover Chriſt hath the <hi>Fan of Perſecution,</hi> or the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Croſs, and all other afflictions which he brings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his People, which he uſes to purge and purify their Souls, and his Churches too.</p>
                     <p>And from hence Afflictions are compaired to a Refiners fire: <hi>He ſhall ſet as a Refiners fire, and Purifier of Silver:</hi> He, that is the <hi>Meſſiah, i. e.</hi> our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; this is his <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 3.</note> Work, <hi>viz.</hi> to purge his People, who in this Place are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to <hi>Silver and Gold</hi> that is refined: As in my Text they are likened unto <hi>Wheat,</hi> in this he is compared to a <hi>Refiner,</hi> and hath his <hi>Furnace;</hi> in the other to an Husbandman, and ſo hath his <hi>Fan.</hi> Both theſe Texts allude to the ſame thing, and doing the ſame work, namely, to ſever and ſeparate the <hi>clean</hi> from the <hi>unclean,</hi> the <hi>Gold</hi> from the <hi>Droſs,</hi> the <hi>Chaff</hi> from the <hi>Wheat.</hi> And evident it is, that <hi>Perſecution, Trials</hi> and <hi>Afflictions,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make a great diſcovery who are <hi>Wheat</hi> or pure Gold, <hi>viz.</hi> Sincere Believers; and who droſſy and chaffy Profeſſors. If <hi>Wheat,</hi> Perſecution purges and purified them: But if they are <hi>Chaff,</hi> it uſually fans them away. <hi>But he that received the ſeed in ſtony places, the ſame is he which heareth the Word, and anon with joy reciveth it: Yet hath he not root in himſelf, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for a while; for when Tribulation or Perſecution ariſeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>

                        <hi>of the Word, by and by he is offended.</hi> Thus the <hi>fan</hi> of Perſecution purges theſe <hi>Chaffy Profeſſors</hi> out of Chriſts Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual floor, or rather his <hi>garner:</hi> Namely, his Church, into which in a day of Liberty they got, and had a place; but they cannot bear the Wind and blaſt of Affliction and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation: And as it purges out much <hi>Chaff,</hi> ſo alſo the <hi>Wheat</hi> is thereby refined and made more clean and fit for the Lords uſe. Of ſo great benefit is Perſecution to Gods Church, that they cannot ſome times be without it; it is <hi>if need be that we are in heavineſs;</hi> if we need it not, or if Chriſt ſees there is no need of it, we ſhall never feel the Rod: <hi>He doth it</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>not for his pleaſure, but for our profit, that we might partake of his Holineſs.</hi> And this <hi>Jehovah</hi> by the Prophet further makes known to us: <hi>This is the fruit of all, the taking away your</hi>

                        <hi>Spirit of Judgment and by the Spirit of burning.</hi> The Rod of Affliction, or Furnace of Perſecution, cannot purge out the <note place="margin">Iſa. 4. 4.</note> filth of Sin that is in the Lords People, without the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Holy Spirit: The Spirit is called a Spirit of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe like fire it burns up and conſumes the Filth, Chaff and Droſs that is in us: Before Trials and Perſecution comes, Chriſt ſeems to have a very great <hi>floor,</hi> a great heap, or much Corn; but when he comes to try them with this <hi>fan</hi> in his hand, one great part thereof is found meer Chaff, and the wind drives it away. So much ſhall ſuffice as to the Fan in Chriſts hand by which he purgeth his Floor.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Thirdly what is meant by the Chaff?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer the Chaff may be underſtood to be two fold.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Men and Women who get into Gods Church, or among his People, but are not Wheat, but vile Hypocrites, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be that which in truth they are not; thus <hi>all that are of Iſrael are not Iſrael.</hi> Tho' they bore his Name, were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jews,</hi> called Saints, yet were unſound at heart, and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 6.</note> Souls, or meer Chaff in Gods ſight.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By Chaff may alſo be intended Sin, or that Filth and Corruption which cleaveth oft-times to the beſt of Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which Chriſt muſt and will purge out.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Why are Hypocrites or ungodly Perſons in the Church compared to Chaff? and how may they be known?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, <hi>Hypocrites and ungodly men in the Church are compared to Chaff;</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe Chaff before it is ſeparated from the wheat, cleaveth cloſe to it, and it is hard to ſever it from the wheat, and it alſo ſeems like unto it:</hi> Even ſo ſome carnal and hypocritical Profeſſors cleave to the Church, and ſeem to love and embrace the Godly in their Arms, and to lay them in their hearts; they walk in Company, nay in outward Fellowſhip and Church-communion with them; they Pray, and Break-bread with them, as if they were real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gracious, and are not known to their Brethren to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: And as it is hard to diſcern them from the Godly, ſo 'tis as hard to ſeparate ſuch from them. <hi>Chaff</hi> is ſo much like to the <hi>Wheat,</hi> that ſome have taken it at firſt view to be <hi>Wheat;</hi> ſo are theſe taken to be Saints, and there may be no ſevering them from the Congregation of the Lord, till Chriſt comes with his <hi>Fan</hi> to purge his <hi>floor.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. They may be compared to <hi>Chaff,</hi> in regard of the great pains that is, and muſt be uſed to ſeparate it from the <hi>Wheat:</hi>

                     <p>As he weighs Men, ſo he weighs their Works, their Graces, their Gifts, their Duties, to ſee whether they hold weight, whether true and righteous or not; whether the Grace be true Grace, ſpecial Grace, not common Grace, and their Gifts not Counterfeit Gifts, or meer Natural Gifts, or only humane and acquired Gifts: Some <hi>boaſt of falſe Gifts,</hi> which as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, is <hi>like Clouds and Wind without rain:</hi> What a ſtir doth a vain Perſon make of a ſtrong Memory, crying it up as if it was a Spiritual Gift, and as if none were true Miniſters but ſuch who have a great Memory, and can deliver all they have got by their Study, by the ſtrength of their Memory; alas, all men of any ſenſe know, that is but a Natural Gift, which ſome wicked men have as well as ſome good men; but let him know, God knows what mens Hearts are, what their Ends <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 3.</note> and Deſigns are, what their Gifts are, and what their Duties are, as well as what the matter of their Worſhip is, which they perform to God; that is, whether it hath his Image <hi>ſtampt upon it;</hi> or is of his <hi>Authority,</hi> his own Appointment, <hi>his own Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or but <hi>Humane Inventions;</hi> he alſo weighs the manner how they perform all Divine Worſhip towards him, from what <hi>Principle, Life, Power, End</hi> and <hi>Deſign;</hi> whether 'tis from a <hi>changed Heart, from unfeigned Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to Chriſt, in <hi>ſincerity,</hi> with <hi>Zeal,</hi> and to <hi>glorify God;</hi> if not, he will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, weigh them, and they will be found wanting, and be found no better than <hi>Chaff</hi> at laſt: Though they may ſeek ways to hide and cover their Wickedneſs, and falſe Spirits, and baſe deſigns, yet let them know, he <hi>that weighs the hill in ſcales, and the mountains in balances,</hi> doth and will weigh them, and find out all their Curſed Deeds, their Pride, their Malice, and put a rebuke upon their back-ſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and <hi>detracting Tongues: Talk</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hannah) no more ſo exeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proudly, let not arrogancy come out of thy mouth for God is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed:</hi> "Thou <hi>Peninnah</hi> (as our Annotators note) ſpeak no more ſo inſolently and reproachfully of me as thou haſt done; he knoweth thy Heart, and all that Pride, Envy and Contempt of me, which

Oh that I were gone from hence, that ſome body would let out this weary Soul! My ſin, ſaid</hi> Spira, <hi>is greater than the Mercy of God;</hi> nay, anſwered his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors, the Mercy of God is above all ſin, <hi>God would have all men to be ſaved; it is true,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>God would have all the Elect to be ſaved; he would not have damn'd Reprobates to be ſaved: I am one of that Number; I know it, for I willingly denyed Chriſt, and I feel that he hardens me, and will not ſuffer me to hope.</hi> Being asked whether he did believe that Doctrine to be true for which he was accuſed before the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> he aſwered, <hi>I did believe it when I denyed it, but now I neither can believe that nor the Doctrine of the Roman Church; I believe nothing, I have no Faith, no Truſt, no Hope, I am a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, like</hi> Cain <hi>or</hi> Judas, <hi>who caſting away all hope of mercy, fell under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; and my Friends do me wrong, that they ſuffer me not to go to the place of Vnbelievers, as I juſtly deſerve.</hi>

                                 <p>And then roaring out in bitterneſs of Spirit, he ſaid, <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi>

                                 <p>Some ſaid with a whiſpering Voice that he was poſſeſſed; he over-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, ſaid, <hi>Do ye doubt it?

I know that Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be expected by Chriſt, and I have denyed and abjured it, to the end I might keep my frail Life from Adverſity, and my Children from Poverty, and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how bitter my Life is to me, and God only knows what will become of this my Family; but ſure no good is likely to betide it, but worſe and worſe, and ſuch at length as one ſtone ſhall not be left upon another.</hi>

                                 </head>
                                 <p>MR. <hi>John Child</hi> was a Preacher, and when he was young a very zealous Aſſerter of the Doctrine of Gods Free-Grace; Namely, of Perſonal Electrion, and of the Saints final Perſeverance; and was a man of conſiderable Natural Parts and Ability, being much followed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he preached, both in the City and Countrey, yet ſeemed to be of a haughty Spirit, loving Applauſe and Popularity, which it may, be feared was the Cauſe of his Fall, and may be a Warning to all how they have mens Perſons in Admiration. But he had not many years aſſerted the Doctrine before mentioned, before he changed his Judgment, and turned to be a grand <hi>Arminian;</hi> which Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he maintained with great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and was ſo conceited of his Abilities, that he feared not to Diſpute with any Man, charging the Doctrine of Perſonal Election at a ſtrong man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if the Aſſerters of it rendered God cruel, and worſe than the worſt of Mortals: In his Judgment he was a Baptiſt, <hi>being againſt Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> and for the <hi>Baptiſm of Believers;</hi> for many years he lived in <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-ſhire,</hi> near me, I being intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted wth him for near 30 years; but a little before the laſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of Diſſenters he removed his Dwelling, and came to <hi>London,</hi> and lived near to my Habitation, in <hi>Pauls Shadwel;</hi> now the firſt time I came to fear him, was through ſome Words he uttered to me, which was to his effect; <hi>I have,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſeriouſly conſidered whether there be any thing in Religion worth ſuffering for:</hi>
                                    <pb n="49" facs="tcp:59949:30"/>
Which Words I wondred at, from ſuch a one as he; but ſoon after he Conformed, (Troubles riſing high,) and then wrote a Curſed Book, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Diſſenters, eſpecially the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> very odious; caſting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon their faithful Miniſters, becauſe ſome of them were not learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, I mean with the Knowledge of the Tongues; and quickly after this he fell under fearful Deſpaira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I was one of the firſt Men that he ſent for, and I found him in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal State and Condition, being filled with Horror, ſaying, <hi>he was damned,</hi> and crying out againſt himſelf for Writing that Book; ſaying, he had touched the Apple of Gods Eye; I ſaid all I was well capable to ſpeak, to Comfort him, but all in vain; at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time he ſaid, <hi>Mine iniquities are great and many, old ſins as well as of a late date come to mind; Wrath is come upon me to the utmoſt, God hath forſaken me, good Men are my Enemies; I hate my ſelf, I am afraid and aſhamed to go abroad, and am confuſed and diſtracted at home; the Scriptures look dreadfully upon me, I have raiſed Reproach, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Reproach, and by it wronged mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes,—I am afraid to live, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to dye; Judgment I fear will be terrible in this World, and more in the World to come; I cannot give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my Actions to Men, how much leſs to God! my Heart condemns me, and he is greater, and knows more: I think I have not only outdone</hi> Cain, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam, <hi>and</hi> Judas, <hi>but ſome of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils themſelves.</hi>

                                    <hi>O I cannot Repent, I cannot Repent! I ſhall go to Hell! I am broken in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; When I think to Pray, either I have a fluſhing in my Face as if I were in a flame, or I am dumb, I cannot ſpeak; all the ſigns of one whom God hath left, forſaken and hardened—If I was in Heaven, it could not relieve me, for I ſhould behold the Face of God and holy Saints, as now I behold the Face of good Men upon Earth, with ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Face—and then again ſaid, Wrath is come upon me to the utermoſt—I am one of the greateſt Hypocrites that ever lived upon the Earth, and ſhall be ſo accounted: God hath and will do his will upon me—Oh he thunders upon me! ſhould God let out the ſence of my ſins on me, (as he will) I ſhould howl like a Dog, roar like a Lyon, bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low like an Ox; mine inward parts would melt within me, as braſs melts in a flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire; I ſhall lye lower than</hi> Judas, <hi>I have ſinned worſe then</hi> Judas<hi>—he quoting thoſe words in</hi> Heb. 10. 2, 6. <hi>If we ſin willfully, after we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the knowledge of the truths, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no more ſacrifice for ſin,</hi> &amp;c. he ſaid, <hi>when I am faint and low, I take ſome refreſhments, but in Hell, there is no refreſhment, not a drop of Water to cool my Tongue.</hi>

                                 <p>To ſome that came to viſit him, and to Comfort him, he ſaid, <hi>All is gone, I am undone—I have been ſo great a ſinner againſt God, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, that God will have no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on me, but will glorifie himſelf by me, and make me an Example for the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening and eſtabliſhing of his People, but it ſhall end in my deſtruction—God hath ſworn in his Wrath that I ſhall never enter into his reſt—I have been a looſe and carnal Profeſſor,</hi>

                                    <hi>and if I were in the place of God, I ſhould meet the ſame meaſure that God doth to me: My Calamity is even at the door, and all men in a little time will juſtifie Gods dealing with me: The Wrath of God is kindled, and burns in me; it is impoſſible for you to imagin my torment, and this is but an Earneſt pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my Eternal Damnation.</hi> Said a godly man, this is a humbling diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation that you are exerciſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<hi>—A humbling diſpenſation, ſaid he, do you call it?

I take not upon me to paſs Judgment upon this miſerable Man, not knowing how God might deal with him, whoſe Mercy is Infinite, for I do not believe Self-murther is an unpardonable ſin; for if ſo, there is more Sins unto Death than one; certainly it is a <hi>Sin againſt the Father and the Son,</hi> and not againſt the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>and therefore may be forgiven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>

But I am of the Opinion, (with a worthy Miniſter that viſited him) that if any <hi>Atheiſt</hi> in the World who had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known this man, and had converſed with him in his bitter Agonies, he would have ſeen ſufficient Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations to have convinced him that there is a dreadful God, or a Power beſides and above Nature, who can touch, ſhake, and diſorder, and turn into Confuſion the ſtrongeſt conſtitution of body, by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring and faſtning terrible things upon the Soul; and as he ſaith, let this <hi>Pillar of Salt</hi> tend to warn and ſeaſon the People of this preſent and future Ages, of the danger of ſinning againſt the light of their underſtanding.</p>
                                 <p>Moreover, it doth I am ſure ſerve with a witneſs to prove, and fully to demonſtrate the truth of that Propoſition I am upon, <hi>viz.

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The fire of Gods eternal wrath opened.</note>To proceed, by <hi>buring up the Chaff with unquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fire,</hi> or by the Wrath of God in this place, our Bleſſed Saviour doth intend, <hi>caſting the wicked into Hell it ſelf:</hi> Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable it is, that no leſs than four or five times the Lord Chriſt poſitively affirms in <hi>Mark</hi> 9. that the fire of Hell into which Body and Soul of wicked men ſhall be caſt, cannot be quenched; <hi>where the worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched,</hi> &amp;c. Why repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo often? is it not to aſſure all ungodly perſons of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Mark 9. 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48.</note> of it? Men are not willing to believe this great truth, they are too ready to think that it is inconſiſtent with infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to inflict ſuch Puniſhment on his Creatures, but alas, they forget that there is an infinite perfection in every one of the Divine Attributes, and that as Gods mercy is infinite, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable, and unconceivable, ſo is his wrath and fury; none are able to conceive, much leſs to declare, what pain and anguiſh the damned undergo. What torments like fire? and what fire is ſo hot and ſo tormenting as Hell-fire? ſad it is to burn half an hour in an <hi>Elementary fire,</hi> yet the Martyrs have endured that for Chriſts ſake; God made it eaſie to ſome of them: But alas, who can bear the burnings of Hell-fire, when wrath ſhall be let out upon the Soul to the utterermoſt?</p>
                     <p>O Sirs, what a fearful thing will it be to be found <hi>chaff,</hi> and falſe hypocritical Perſons! ſuch cannot eſcape the damnation of Hell;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59949:32"/>
No, nor can any ſinner whatſoever, <hi>except they believe, repent,</hi> or are <hi>born again;</hi> there is no avoiding being caſt into unquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly, I ſhall now endeavour to prove the point,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Wrath of God in Hell is intollerable, and far greater than any Wrath let out here, either on the Bodies or Souls of men;</hi> which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſider theſe particulars following:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The extremity of their Torment will appear, upon the Conſideration that it is inconceivable, beyond all mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding <note place="margin">Pſa. 90. 11.</note>; <hi>who knoweth the power of thy Anger?</hi> who can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <note place="margin">Tormens of Hell inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable.</note> it, or is rightly and duely affected therewith? we can conceive of all bodily pain, or external Torment, but cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Nature of infinite Wrath, no more than we can conceive or apprehend the Nature of infinite Love and Goodneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is and will be intollerable, becauſe it is according to that fear, nay beyond the fear that an awakened Conſcience hath <note place="margin">Hells Torments according to the fear of them.</note> of it; <hi>even according to thy fear ſo is thy Wrath.</hi> O what fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thoughts and aſtoniſhing fears had <hi>Spira</hi> and <hi>Child</hi> of Gods Wrath: Now Sirs, it cannot be ſaid of the Wrath of God as ſome other things, or of Death it ſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the fear is worſe than the thing; No, no, <hi>acording to the fear, ſo is the the Wrath and Vengeance of an angry God.</hi> The fears of a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deity are not vain Bugbares, and the effects of ignorance, or of a craſie head, of Folly, Melancholly, or Superſtition, as ſome <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> Wretches are ready to ſay; No, no, but it is grounded and built upon ſolid Foundations, as it is in part made manifeſt ſometimes by the terrible effects upon mankind, (as I have hinted.) Wrath bears proportion unto the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fear of it, nay, doth far exceed the fear thereof, and what prepared Plagues, infinite pains, intollerable anguiſh, have ſome ſelf-accuſed, and ſelf-condemned mortals ſeared and looked for? what is the nature of that <hi>certain fearful looking for of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>and fiery indignation?</hi> why now according to the fear of it, ſo will the thing it ſelf be. Some have felt much Sorrow, but have feared much more: Mans thoughts and fears exceed all that can be expreſſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Wrath of God will be intollerable in Hell, <note place="margin">No pains like the pains of Hell.</note> and the extremity of the damned amazing, if we compare that miſery and anguiſh with all, or any, nay the worſt of Plagues and Puniſhments that can be undergone in this World; I mean of all temporal Miſeries, as <hi>Peſtilence, Famine, War,</hi> or any tormenting Diſeaſe, as the <hi>Stone, Gout,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

1. Theſe may be but the Fatherly Rebukes and Chaſtenings of the Almighty; not from a Sin-revenging hand, but a Sin-correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand of God; not in Wrath, but in Love; but if his Anger be ſo terrible when he chaſtizes as a compaſſionate Father, what is his fury when he puniſhes as a ſevere Judge? if he deals thus ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with thoſe he loves, what will their portion be whom he hates? if his Wiſdom leadeth him forth thus to corect in mercy, what will be the ſtrokes of his Juſtice and incenſed Wrath and Fury?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Miſeries of this preſent Life are abated, or mitigated with the mixture of ſome Sweet: None are ſo univerſally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, ſo deplorable, but ſome thing remains to eaſe their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and tormenting pains: Judgments are tempered with Mercys. No man (as one obſerves) is tortured with all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, nor forſaken of all Friends; beſides, if the Malady be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable and remedileſs, yet their grief is a little allayed by the Sympathy of Friends and Neighbours: But in Hell the damned are tortured and ſurrounded with pain and horror, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd with flames, without any mixture, nothing to refreſh their diſtreſſed Souls and Bodies, no, not one drop of water to cool their Tongue. The <hi>rich Man</hi> deſired but ſo much water that <hi>Lazarus</hi> could bring upon the tip of his finger, and it was denyed him. <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 24.</note>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The State of the Damned is void of the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Comfort, Eaſe and Refreſhment: <hi>The ſame ſhall drink of</hi>

                        <hi>the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cup of his indignation, and he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone in the preſence of his holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb:</hi> They ſhall have Judgment without Mercy, Sorrow without Joy, Pain without Eaſe, Darkneſs without Light, all felicity is totally withdrawn. Pitty is the cheap and ſmalleſt relief any here can meet withal in miſery, not denyed to the moſt guilty notorious Criminal, but yet this is not afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the damned; all their bitter Crys cannot move the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of God nor the Bleſſed Angels or Saints in Heaven to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, for they are not Objects of Compaſſion, their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries being the juſt puniſhments of an offended God, whom they wilfully and of their own choice contemned, thro' love to Sin and this preſent World; beſides, in Hell all humane affections are extinguiſhed for ever. Ah, this is the quintiſence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Miſery, the exceſs of Anguiſh and Sorrow, to be deprived of all good things pleaſing to our deſires, and to ſuffer all evils from which we have the deepeſt averſation and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59949:33"/>
abhorrence; for as in Heaven all Good, all Felicity, all Joy, is inconceivable, ſo in Hell all evil is felt and endured to the higheſt degree, and nothing but what is evil.</p>
                     <p>Some of the greateſt miſeries that Mortals have met with here in this World, have been inflicted upon them by the hand of Man, (whoſe power is but little, and oft-times reſtrained and mittigated by the Lord) as in the caſe of the poor <hi>Martyrs:</hi> But in Hell the pain and puniſhment the of damned will be from the immediate hand of Almighty God, whoſe power is Infinite; nay, and it ſhall be according to <hi>his glorious Power,</hi> or the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Power; <hi>Who knows the power of thine anger?</hi> When <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 1. 9. Pſa. 80. 11.</note> infinite power is exerted in puniſhing the offending Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who can conceive of that? what are the Laſhes of a ſmall Whip, to that with <hi>Scorpions?</hi> or the ſtroaks of a Child, to the blows of a Giant? but alas, this will not reach it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Stroaks of Gods Wrath are incomprehenſible; in Hell he lets out the perfection of his Wrath, as in Heaven the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Sorrows and Miſeries we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure here from the hand of God, may by Repentance, by Cryes and Tears, through Chriſts Blood be taken off; God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to eaſe ſuch who fly unto him (and look up to his Son) of their burthen, as he did thoſe that were ſtung <hi>with fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents in the Wilderneſs,</hi> who looked up to the <hi>brazen Serpent;</hi> but no Tears, no Cries, no Repentance, will do in Hell, there's no Goſpel preached, no means of Grace afforded, no Chriſt held forth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Torments of the damned will be diſmal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable <note place="margin">The damned caſt into a la7c of fire.</note> and amazing, becauſe they ſhall be <hi>caſt into a lake of fire,</hi> or be tormented with fire. O how amazing is it, to be thrown into a fierce fire! look into a <hi>Glaſs-houſe,</hi> (behold their burning Furnaces) or into a hot <hi>Oven;</hi> can you bear the thoughts of being thrown into one of them? whether the fire of Hell be material or metaphorical Fire, however the reality and extenſiveneſs of the Torment is ſignified by it, held forth by it, and as in other tropes in the Scripture, the things ſignified or held forth by thoſe Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors far exceed what they are borrowed from, ſo no doubt it is here, our ordinary fire is not an adequate Repreſentation of the fire of Gods Wrath, tho' it may ſeem to ſet it forth to our Capacities in ſome meaſure; what is the fire that man kindles, to the fire that God kindles? nay, to that Divine Wrath doth kindle? <hi>The breath of the Lord, like a ſtream of brimſtone doth kindle</hi>

a <hi>little</hi> of it, but a <hi>River;</hi> this ſerves ſo Illuſtriouſly to ſet it forth, that as one hints, as ſome of the Ancient Fathers expreſſed it, <hi>if one of the damned might paſs out of Hell flames into the fierceſt fires here, it were to exchange a torment for a refreſhment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It will be intolerable, becauſe the puniſhment of Hell <note place="margin">Hell Torments can never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Divine Juſtice.</note> is to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice, to pay the juſt Debt owing to God for the breach of his holy Law; true, becauſe ſin is an infinite wrong, and the Creature is but finite, they can never pay the Debt, nor make a ſatisfaction for the injury done to God, therefore they muſt ſuffer eternally; they are always a paying, but can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fully pay what they owe, Juſtice requiring the utmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 26.</note>: Nothing can ſurely ſet forth the diſmalneſs of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more than this. Oh take a view of Divine Wrath in the ſufferings of our Bleſſed Saviour, when he ſtood in our ſtead, and was to ſatisfie for the Sins of all the Elect, how did it bring him down proſtrate to the ground, and made him <hi>ſweat great drops of blood,</hi> and to Cry out, <hi>My Soul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto Death!</hi> Tho' he was God as well as Man, and had the Strength of the infinite Deity to ſupport him! Ah Sirs, this wrath laid upon finite Creatures, will ſink them down to the loweſt Hell, and grind them to Powder.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It will be Wrath-amazing, and very terrible Wrath, <note place="margin">The Torments of Hell ſeize on the Souls of the damned.</note> becauſe it will ſeize <hi>on the Soul</hi> of the Sinner, it will <hi>put the Soul into the fire:</hi> The <hi>Soul</hi> hath <hi>been the chief</hi> ſinner here, and therefore ſhall be <hi>the chief ſufferer</hi> in thoſe Regions of Sorrow; and how unſupportable is that Wrath which is let out on the Soul or Spirit of man, you have had a taſte in <hi>Spira</hi> and <hi>Child.</hi> If, Sirs, a ſpark of Divine Diſpleaſure, when it falls upon the guilty Conſcience, tears it pieces, what will be thoſe floods of Divine Wrath poured forth in Hell on the Souls of Men and Women? who can ſtand here whilſt in this World before an Angry God, or encounter with Offended Omnipotency? ſuch is the ſharpneſs of his Sword, the heavineſs of his <hi>Rod,</hi> when laid on by the <hi>hand of his Wrath,</hi> that every <hi>ſtroak is deadly,</hi> and no doubt Satan greatens the wounds on the Conſcience, he charges the guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Spirits with all the Soul-killing aggravations, and ſtrives to hide Divine Mercy, and Rob the Soul of the precious Blood of Chriſt, the only lenitive and choice balm to heal a wounded Spirit. O what viſions of horror, what ſence of fear, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, were preſented to the diſtreſſed minds of theſe two mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Creatures before mentioned! the guilty Conſcience turns all Joy into Sorrow, all Light into Darkneſs, the ſweet Promiſes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59949:34"/>
of the Goſpel, that aſſure of favour and pardon to believing Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, afford no relief, but are turned into arguments of Deſpair, by reflecting on their former Iniquities and abuſe of Mercies, ſo that Chriſt himſelf they ſee is become their Accuſer.</p>
                     <p>'Whatever the wounded Sinner ſees and hears (ſaith a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Miniſter) afflicts him, whatever he thinks of, torments him; all the diverſions in the World, Buſineſs, Pleaſures, Merry Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, Comedies, are as ineffectual to give him freedom from thoſe ſtings and furies in his breaſts, as the ſprinkling of holy Water is to expel the Devil from a poſſeſſed Perſon; thoſe who in their Pride and Jollity have deſpiſed ſerious Religion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a fond Tranſport and Extaſie, or a dull Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly and Dejection about the Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet when God has ſet their ſins, with all their killing circumſtances, before their Eyes, how changed, how confounded are they at that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition! how reſtleſs in the dreadful expectation of the doom that attends them!' But alas, alas, what is internal Wrath let out on the Soul in Hell, as he notes? for the Aprehenſions of the Soul will be enlarged, and their ſpirits work with the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt activity: Here tho' they have no hope at preſent, yet they know not what God may do in a moment to turn their Sorrow into Joy, and their Night into Noon-day; here are many things to divert their thoughts, and they meet with ſome intermiſſion of their horror and perplexity, as Mr. <hi>Child</hi> intimated, but in Hell there's none of this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> It will be intolerable miſery, becauſe it ſhall be Torments on the Body and Soul too, not on the Soul only, <note place="margin">Body and Soul both ſhall be tormented in Hell.</note> but on both. O it will be a diſmal Meeting, when they two old Companions meet together at the laſt day, I mean the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Soul and Body of a wicked man, at the Reſurrection, and hear the doleſom Sentence, <hi>Go ye curſed. Spira</hi> and <hi>Child</hi> had direful Sorrow and Anguiſh in their Souls, but their Bodies were not much tormented, they both being in a ſtate of Health as to the outward man; but the fire of Gods Wrath will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to and ſeize upon the Body as well as on the Soul in that day; every Faculty of the Soul and Member of the Body which have been Inſtruments of Sin, ſhall then be in Pain, and under fearful Torture and Miſery: Now the <hi>Spirit of a man may</hi> ſupport <hi>or ſuſtain</hi> his bodily <hi>Infirmities</hi> and Afflictions, but in Hell the Spirit cannot afford any Relief to the Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot ſuſtain its own miſery, both muſt and ſhall ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Eighthly,</hi> All the Perplexing <hi>Paſſions</hi> and <hi>Faculties</hi> will then be let out upon the wicked, beyond whatever they have been here whilſt in this World.</p>

The meer fear of Hell is not ſufficient to Convert the Souls of men, tho' it may ſtop them in their way, and prevent great Abominations in the groſs acts thereof, yet does not, cannot renew their Nature, regenerate and make holy their hearts and lives; that Religion that is the meer effect of fear will be according to the nature of its principle, even legal, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and inconſtant; yet the fear of Hell may awaken the ſinner, and in ſome ſence prepare for Grace: When the Soul is ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the terror of Wrath, and the fear of Hell has made a breach, Divine Grace enters, but it is the Love of God and hopes of Heaven that works ſpiritual affections, (as the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that flows therefrom is Evangelical, free and voluntary, from the entire conſent of the Soul) and are abiding.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>They are his Sheep by Choice, or by virtue of Election.</hi> Thoſe that are Chriſt's, are not only his Sheep, but his Spouſe alſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">Believers Chriſt's Sheep by Choice.</note> to another Scripture-Metaphor; and therefore 'tis reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable they ſhould be his own free Choice, and ſuch as he can and doth dearly love; not only ſuch as the Father loved, but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo loved: all that were Elected from Everlaſting, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by the Father, and the Son, from Everlaſting, with a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Grace and Favour, or Love of Benevolence. The Sign and Fruit of Chriſt's Love to his Sheep, is the Choice he hath made of them; <hi>Ye have not choſen me, but I have choſen you, and ordained that you ſhould go and bring forth Fruit, and that your Fruit ſhould remain,</hi> John 15. 16. This Chriſt mentions here, as an Argument of his greateſt Love; and therefore he doth not refer to that Choice of them as Apoſtles, for ſo was <hi>Judas</hi> choſen, who was not comprehended in God's Eternal Election; <hi>I ſpeak not of you all, I know whom I have choſen,</hi> John 15. 18. <hi>Judas</hi> was choſen to the Apoſtleſhip, but was not choſen to Eternal Life; <hi>he was a Devil,</hi> and therefore not to be one of Chriſt's Sheep: <hi>Have I not choſen you Twelve, and one of you is a Devil?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſt hath no Sheep, but ſuch that he was pleaſed to chuſe, or make choice of for his own; and he knows them, before they know him, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>The Lord knows them that are his;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19.</note> that is, all ſuch that he hath choſen according to the Decree of Eternal Election.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſt's Sheep are his, by virtue of the Father's free Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">By Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> They are all given unto him; <hi>I pray not for the World, but for them thou haſt given me. I have manifeſted thy Name to the Men which thou gaveſt me out of the World: thine they were, and thou</hi>

                        <hi>gaveſt them me.</hi> They were given to Chriſt to be his Sheep, to be his Spouſe, and Members of his Myſtical Body. <hi>Behold, I and the Children thou haſt given me, are for Signs and Wonders in Iſrael.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>They are Chriſt's Sheep by Purchaſe:</hi> He bought them all, and that too at a dear Price. He paid heartily for them, every <note place="margin">By Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe.</note>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:59949:44"/>

                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 19, 20.</note> 
                        <hi>your own, but you are bought with a Price.</hi> We had ſold our ſelves to other Maſters, and they had poſſeſſion of us. <hi>I am carnal,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, ſold under Sin.</hi> He was formerly ſold, and was hardly yet <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14. Iſa. 50. 1.</note> got out of the Tyrant's Hand. <hi>Behold, for your Iniquities have you ſold your ſelves; but ye ſhall be redeemed without Money.</hi> We were all ſold to Sin, ſold to Satan, and there was no ways to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from the Wrath of God, without a great Ranſom; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice will have a ſatisfactory Price: And ſince corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, will not do it, no nor a thouſand Rams, nor ten thouſand Rivers of Oil, nor the Fruit of the Body, which could not make Atonement for the Sin of the Soul, Chriſt muſt come to the Price propoſed to him, and demanded of him, if he will purchaſe theſe Sheep, and that was his own precious Blood. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves, and to the Flock over which the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18, 19.</note> 
                        <hi>Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, that ye feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood. I lay down my Life for</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 20. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>my Sheep.</hi> This was the Price, ſo dearly did Chriſt buy his Sheep. And this Day, Beloved, the Tokens of this Price, or Sacred Signs or Symbols of this Purchaſe is to be ſet before your Eyes: pray re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that Believers are Chriſt's Sheep by Purchaſe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Believers are Chriſt's Sheep by Renovation, or Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> In this lies a great Myſtery, they had not once a Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <note place="margin">By Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> Nature, but by Grace their <hi>ſwiniſh</hi> and evil Qualities are changed: he hath infuſed new and holy Diſpoſitions into them. So that in this reſpect Jeſus Chriſt excels all other Shepherds, for they cannot turn <hi>Swine, Bears,</hi> or <hi>Tigers,</hi> into Sheep; but the Lord Jeſus, by the Holy Ghoſt, makes ſuch to become his Sheep, or to have Sheep-like Natures and Diſpoſitions, that were before as vile, filthy, and abominable as the worſt of Sinners: the Holy Ghoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them before Grace and Regeneration, to <hi>Dogs, Swine,</hi> &amp;c. they having like evil Qualities with thoſe unclean and filthy Creatures: <hi>Such were ſome of you.</hi> What a kind of ſuch were they? Why, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 10, 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Thieves, Covetous, Drunkards, Reviiers, Extortioners, Effeminate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> (that is, by the Power of the Lord Jeſus <hi>and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Chriſt hath not one Sheep, but what he hath made ſo to be: He, as God, made them at firſt,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59949:44"/>
and they having loſt their firſt Excellent and Holy Nature, he new makes them, forms them again, or transforms them into his own holy, humble, meek, and gentle Nature. <hi>This People have I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for my ſelf, they ſhall ſhew forth my Praiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We are <hi>created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works;</hi> and thus they <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 10.</note> may be ſaid to be his Sheep.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Believers are Chriſt's Sheep, by a Holy Covenant or Contract made with the Father;</hi> and by virtue of this Covenant they were <note place="margin">By Holy Covenant and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</note> given to him. By virtue of this Covenant he died for them; by virtue of this Covenant they became his, and he calls them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news them, and changes them; <hi>He ſhall ſee his Seed.</hi> It was by the Blood of this Covenant the Great Shepherd of the Sheep was raiſed from the Dead; that they might be raiſed, quickned, and <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 21.</note> juſtified. By virtue of this Covenant <hi>he gathers them, and carries them in his Arms, and lays the young and tender Ones in his Boſom; and gently leads ſuch that are with Young,</hi> Iſa. 40. 11. By virtue of this Covenant he puts his <hi>Fear into their Hearts, that they may not depart from him.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 33.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſt as Mediator in this Covenant, is God's Servant, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes the Office of Shepherd, to take care of, <hi>feed, heal,</hi> and <hi>preſerve</hi> all thoſe who were given to him by the Father.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>Believers are Chriſt's Sheep by Conqueſt.</hi> They were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the Enemy's Hand; in the Hands and under the Power of <note place="margin">By Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</note> moſt cruel Tyrants, who deſigned to tear them in pieces and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them: They were in Satan's Hand, and under the Power of Sin; and were meer Bond-ſlaves, and in fearful ſlavery to theſe Enemies, having their Eyes put out, their Fleece torn off, or ſtrip'd of their Robes, being dangerouſly wounded. And although Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, to redeem them from Wrath and Miſery, laid down a great Price (as you heard before) to ſatisfy God's Juſtice; yet, alas, Satan takes no notice of that, they were in his Hand; who like a ſtrong Man armed, keeps the Soul, and had Power over them: therefore Jeſus Chriſt puts forth his Almighty Hand to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh and ſubdue this cruel Foe, and thereby redeems and reſcues all his Sheep out of Slavery and Bondage; by which means they come to be his by a bleſſed Conqueſt of their Enemies, and by overcoming them; for he ſubdues their Hearts bends and ſubjects their rebellious Wills by the Power of Divine Grace, before he can have one of them: All the Sheep of Chriſt yield themſelves up to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59949:45"/>
him, as being conquered by him; overcome by his Love, and the Power of his Spirit. This brings me to the next thing.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, and laſtly, <hi>Believers are Chriſt's Sheep by virtue of a</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">By a holy Reſignation.</note> 
                        <hi>holy Reſignation of themſelves to him.</hi> They have choſen him to be their Shepherd: other Sheep can't make choice of their Shepherd, but Chriſt's Sheep can do this, their Eyes being enlightned to ſee the Excellency of Chriſt, the Greatneſs of his Love, and what he hath ſuffered and undergone for them; they commit their Souls to his care and keeping, that he may watch over them, feed and lead them: <hi>They gave themſelves firſt unto the Lord, and unto us by the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Will of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, They gave themſelves unto the Lord, (by the Power of his Spirit) to be his, and no more their own, but to be his People, his Spouſe, his Sheep; and then gave themſelves to his Church, to be of his Flock. Chriſt hath no Member, no Sheep of his viſible Church or Fold on Farth, but ſuch who know him; <hi>I am known of mine.</hi> They are not ignorant Perſons, or ſuch who are unable to give themſelves up to him. Others are not required to give them: No, no; they muſt be able to give or reſign themſelves to him, (as being overcome by his Love) and thus they become his Sheep alſo.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I ſhall ſhew you what is meant by Chriſt's Voice.</p>
                     <p>There is a Four-fold Voice of Jeſus Chriſt which his Sheep hear.<list>
                           <item>1. The Voice of his Word.</item>
                           <item>2. The Voice of his Spirit.</item>
                           <item>3. The Voice of his Holy Doctrine.</item>
                           <item>4. The Voice of his Rod.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt.</hi> Chriſt's Sheep hear the Voice of his Word. The Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is Chriſt's Word, and therefore the Voice of Chriſt, and this Voice his Sheep hear: They give full credit to the Truth of the Sacred Scriptures, they believe they are of Divine Authority: <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs.</hi> They are none of Chriſt's Sheep that do not, will not hear this Voice of Chriſt; that is, do not believe the Truth of the Sacred Scriptures, do not hear nor regard what they ſpeak, but magnify unwritten Traditions above the Word of God, or the Light of Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The Sheep of Chriſt hear Chriſt's Voice <hi>in the Miniſtry of his Word,</hi> they attend upon the preaching of the Goſpel, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59949:45"/>
look upon the Word delivered in Chriſt's Name, by his faithful Miniſters, to be the Voice of Chriſt unto them: But how, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner Chriſt's Sheep do hear his Voice, <hi>viz.</hi> the Voice of his Word, I ſhall open under the third Head.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is the Voice of Chriſt's Spirit; and this Voice of his his Sheep hear alſo, and indeed none but they. Sirs, this is that Voice of Chriſt which doth the Work, and that which diſcovers who are his Sheep. The Voice of Chriſt's Word, without the Spirit, is not ſufficient; the Word will not make Sinners hear, though it be ſpoken a thouſand times over, except the Spirit's Voice do accompany it: I ſhall therefore open to you the Nature of this Voice of Chriſt, I mean, the Voice of his Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis an awakening Voice:</hi> Sinners are aſleep, yea, in a dead Sleep, and ſleep they will till they hear this Voice. The power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Voice of Chriſt awakened dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> after he had lain in the Grave four days: And it muſt be the like Voice that doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken the ſleepy and dead Sinner; <hi>Wherefore he ſaith, Awake thou</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the Dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee Life.</hi> 'Tis ſad to ſee what a multitude of poor People ſit, day by day, under the hearing of the Word, and yet remain in their Sins: they are aſleep, the Word doth not awaken them; but when the Spirit's Voice is heard, when that works with the Word, they are quickly rouſed up out of that dead Sleep in which they lay.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Voice of Chriſt's Spirit, is a convincing Voice. <hi>Come,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 4. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>ſee a Man that told me all things that ever I did:</hi> The Spirit of Chriſt reached her Heart, convinced her what a vile Sinner ſhe was: We do not read of many things Chriſt told her ſhe had done, but <hi>that he ſhe had then was not her Husband,</hi> ver. 18. ſo that ſhe lived in Adultery with him. But now as ſoon as the Spirit convinced her of this one Sin, ſhe is convinced of all her other abominable Evils; and therefore cries out, <hi>Come, ſee a Man that told me all things that ever I did; Is not this the Chriſt?</hi> Intimating, none but Chriſt can make the Evil of Mens Hearts and Lives appear unto them: So 'tis none but the Holy Spirit can pierce the Soul, or convince the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner throughly of his Sin and Miſery, and diſcover the Vileneſs of their Hearts and States unto them; <hi>They were pricked in their Hearts,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 2. 37.</note> 
                        <hi>and ſaid, Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> Is there any hope that ſuch Sinners as we may be forgiven, and be ſaved? <hi>Verily, we were guilty concerning our Brother,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren;) God's Spirit now convinced their Conſciences, and brought their Sin to remembrance. So there are none that hear the Voice of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59949:46"/>
Spirit, but their Sin appears preſently before their Eyes; their Sin is aggravated on their Conſciences, and is moſt hateful and odious to them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Chriſt's Voice is a Soul quickening Voice. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 5. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>unto you, The Hour is coming, and now is, when the Dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> The Voice of Chriſt doth not only cauſe the Ear to hear, but the Heart to hear alſo. All Mankind naturally are dead in a ſpiritual Senſe, they have no divine nor ſpiritual Life in them. Man is not by Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin, or by Nature, only wounded or maimed, but dead: The Holy Ghoſt doth not make uſe of an improper Metaphor. We by Nature were as truly and really in a ſpiritual Senſe dead; that is, had no more Life, ſpiritual Life, Motion, Heat, Feeling, or Strength in us, than a dead Man hath natural Life, Motion, Heat, Feeling, or Strength in him: but when the Soul hears the ſpiritual and powerful Voice of Chriſt, 'tis immediately quickened, a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of divine Life is infuſed; <hi>You hath he quickened, that were dead</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>in Sins and Treſpaſſes.</hi> Thus the Greatneſs of Chriſt's Power to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Sinners appears, that were dead, or deſtitute of a Principle of ſpiritual Life. Thoſe that aſſert the Power of the Creature, or that every Man is put into a Capacity to be ſaved if he will, certainly do not conſider this; lay this to heart, ponder on this, <hi>viz.</hi> That all Mankind, before Grace is infuſed into the Soul, are dead: What ſhort of Almighty Power can raiſe the Dead to Life? Power is not in the Dead to quicken himſelf; nor can dead <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> reſiſt that Principle of Life infuſed into him: 'tis not what the Sinner, but what Chriſt the Saviour will; and he quickens not all, but whom he will; <hi>For as the Father raiſeth up the Dead, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 5. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>them; even ſo the Son quickneth whom he will:</hi> 'Tis not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that ſheweth Mercy.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt's Voice by his Spirit, is a Soul-humbling and a Self-abaſing Voice:</hi> They that hear his Voice, are ſtraitway brought to his Feet, loathing and abhorring themſelves. The Voice of Chriſt hath the ſame Effect on the Soul, as the ſight of God in Chriſt: <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the Ear; but now mine Eye</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Job 42. 5, 6.</note> 
                        <hi>ſeeth thee: Wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in Duſt and Aſhes.</hi> After <hi>Paul</hi> had heard the Voice of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Saul, Saul, Why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> how humble was he; though called to be an Apoſtle, yet eſteemed himſelf leſs than the leaſt of all Saints: Now to be leſs than the leaſt, is to be nothing. Man before Grace,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59949:46"/>
or before he comes to hear the Voice of Chriſt, is a proud Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but Grace humbles him to ſuch a degree, that he is little, nay nothing in his own Eyes.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Chriſt's Voice is a Soul-regenerating Voice.</hi> His Voice is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſhakes the old Foundation down, all former Hopes and fleſhly Confidence is gone: It was the Voice of the Spirit that firſt made us, and made this World; <hi>By the Word of God were all things made and created:</hi> And 'tis his Voice that creates us again, or that renews us, or forms his Sacred Image in us. He <hi>that commanded</hi> by his Voice <hi>Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs,</hi> doth but ſpeak the word, and ſo <hi>ſhines into our Hearts;</hi> and thereby transforms us, <hi>and gives us the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jeſus</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>'Tis a Sin-killing Voice:</hi> It lays the old Man a bleeding, (as it were) the Spirit deſtroys the Body and Power of Sin, it breaks down all the ſtrong Holds of Sin. Chriſt ſlays this Enemy <hi>by the Sword that goes out of his Mouth,</hi> that is, by his Word, through the Operations of the Spirit: <hi>If ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall die;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the Deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live.</hi> 'Tis not enough to forbear the acting of Sin, but we muſt kill and crucify it; and this we cannot do without the powerful aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and help of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>'Tis a Soul-ſtrengthning Voice.</hi> As Sin dies, Grace lives, and the Soul receives ſtrength: Faith is the Life and Strength of the Soul; and this Life and Strength we receive by the Holy Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>'Tis a comforting Voice.</hi> 'Tis by the Spirit God ſpeaks Peace to the Soul: <hi>He will ſpeak Peace unto his People, and unto his Saints.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 85. 8. Hoſ. 2. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>I will ſpeak comfortably to her,</hi> I will ſpeak to her Heart: None can ſpeak to the Heart but God, by his Spirit; it is the Holy Ghoſt that is the Comforter: And after the Sinner hath been deeply wounded in the true ſenſe of Sin, and is dejected, grieved, and ſorely troubled, then the Spirit comes with its ſweet, ſtill, and comforting Voice, and revives the drooping Soul. To comfort the Conſcience, <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, <hi>is as great a Work as to make the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Now the Spirit ſpeaks Comfort to the diſtreſſed Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence through the Blood of Chriſt; that is, by ſhewing the Soul that Chriſt died in its ſtead, and bore the Wrath that was due to us, having fully ſatisfied God's Juſtice, and anſwered all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Requirements of the Law, being <hi>made a Curſe for us, that the Bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come upon the Gentiles through Chriſt</hi>

                        <hi>Thirdly, There is alſo the Voice of Chriſt's Doctrine:</hi> I mean, the true Evangelical Doctrine of the Goſpel. The true Faith of the Goſpel, or the ſacred Doctrine thereof, is the Voice of Chriſt, which his Sheep will hear: And they will not hear the Voice of Strangers, they will not hear the Voice of falſe Teachers, or their pernicious Doctrine; <hi>they know not the Voice of Strangers,</hi> they can diſtinguiſh between Chriſt's Voice, Chriſt's Doctrine, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of falſe Prophets, and falſe Teachers: they know not the Voice of Strangers, that is, they approve not of their Doctrine; but they know, they approve of Chriſt's Doctrine; though never ſo hard, never ſo difficult, and never ſo unpleaſant to others, yet 'tis approved of by them; 'tis eaſy and pleaſant to them that are Chriſt's Sheep.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. They hear Chriſt's Voice; not the Voice of the <hi>Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> only, or the teaching of <hi>Natural Conſcience:</hi> though, 'tis true, they hear and follow that Light, yet they know the Light that is in all Men, which is in <hi>Pagans, Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> is not the Voice of Chriſt as he is <hi>Mediator,</hi> and the great Shepherd of the Sheep.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They hear Chriſt's Voice, follow his Voice, not the Voice of <hi>General Councils</hi> and <hi>National Synods;</hi> they will no further hear any, than they hear and adhere to the Voice and Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>Particularly,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They believe the Holy Scripture is of Divine Authority, and that it is the only Rule of Faith and Practice.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They ſtedfaſtly believe the Doctrine of the Bleſſed Trinity, that <hi>there are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Son,</hi>

                     <p>And the Doctrine of Socinians, who affirmed, He is a meer Man, and had no Pre-exiſtence before he was Conceived and Born of the Virgin.</p>
                     <p>They abominate that Voice or Doctrine of <hi>Eutychians,</hi> who maintain, that the Matter of Chriſt's Fleſh was from Heaven, or that it was a Converſion of the Deity of the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity into Fleſh, and that he partook not of the Nature of the Virgin.</p>
                     <p>They abominate their Doctrine, who declare, that Chriſt doth conſiſt of one Nature only; and thoſe who affirm that the Light that is in all Men (which is but an <hi>inward Quality</hi> created of God,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59949:48"/>
with which the Soul of Mankind is naturally indued) is the only Chriſt of God; they know theſe are Strangers, and the Voice of Strangers they will not hear.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They hear and ſtedfaſtly believe, and receive the Doctrine of Chriſt's Headſhip over the Church.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Doctrine of Satisfaction by Chriſt, in his Expiation of Sin, and of Juſtification by his Righteouſneſs imputed, as it is received by Faith alone, without inherent Righteouſneſs wrought in us, or good Works done by us.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Doctrine of Regeneration, the Reſurrection of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and of the Eternal Judgment, and World to come.</p>
                     <p>In all theſe Reſpects they hear Chriſt's Voice, <hi>i. e.</hi> his Doctrine, and in all other reſpects ſo far as they receive Light and Knowledg touching any one, or all the bleſſed Truths and Ordinances of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is the Voice of Chriſt's Rod alſo, which his Sheep hear; <hi>The Lord's Voice crieth to the City, and the Man of Wiſdom</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mich. 6. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhall ſee thy Name: hear ye the Rod, and who hath appointed it.</hi> When Chriſt's Sheep will not hear as they ought the ſoft and ſweet Voice of God's Word, he ſpeaks to them by the Voice of his Rod, by Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and ſharp Rebukes, which by his Providence he brings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: And though others cannot hear ſo as to underſtand this Voice of Chriſt, yet his Sheep do, they <hi>ſee his Name,</hi> and <hi>hear the Rod,</hi> and know whoſe Voice it is, and to what End 'tis appointed; but this I ſhall not inſiſt further upon here.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould now come to ſhew you how Chriſt's Sheep hear his Voice, but that muſt be for the next time.</p>

                     <p>I am to ſhew you how Chriſt's Sheep hear his Voice, his Word, <note place="margin">How Chriſt's Sheep do hear his Voice.</note> his Holy Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>They hear Chriſt's Voice, his Word and Doctrine, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; <hi>He that heareth the Word, and underſtandeth it,</hi> &amp;c. Some, tho they hear it, yet they are ignorant, and know not the Nature, <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 23.</note> Power, and divine Excellency of it. The ſacred Scripture is as a ſealed Book to ſome that are learned with Humane Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; they ſee but the outſide of the Book (as it were); and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers they are ignorant Perſons, neither have Humane nor Divine Teachings: <hi>then he opened their Vnderſtandings, that they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luke 24. 45.</note> 
                        <hi>the Scriptures.</hi> See how Chriſt does honour the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: He did not open their Underſtanding without the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he ſends them to that becauſe they teſtify of him; but he knew the Scripture would not ſufficiently give them the knowledg of himſelf, without the Influence and Illumination of his Spirit. Sirs, they hear Chriſt's Voice aright, who are taught of God, and by his Spirit, to underſtand his Word. Some Men are ſo far cheated by the Devil, that they cry up the Light of natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and magnify that above the Holy Scripture. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them to caſt away the Scriptures <hi>as a dead Letter,</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Spirit's Teachings; whereas the Spirit teacheth by, not without, nor contrary to the Sacred Scripture. The Word of Chriſt is full of Myſtery; its holy and ſublime Doctrine is not eaſily underſtood, nor can it be without the Spirit helps the Underſtanding. In a right and ſaving manner it is given to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59949:49"/>
Chriſt's Sheep to <hi>underſtand the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, and to others it is not given.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt's Sheep hear his Voice with Affection:</hi> They like, love, and approve of his Word and Doctrine, it is ſweet to them; <hi>Thy Word is very pure, therefore thy Servant loveth it.</hi> They know that <note place="margin">Pſal 119. 140.</note> there is no Falſhood in it, it is pure from all Mixture, there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Purity and Holineſs in it; which makes unſanctified Perſons to like it not, but either disbelieve it, or elſe deſpiſe and hate it: But a godly Man loves it upon the account of its Purity, in that it promotes nothing but Holineſs both in Heart and Life. <hi>The Word of the Lord is right; and all his Works are done in Truth. Therefore</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 33. 4. Pſal. 119. 128.</note> 
                        <hi>I eſteem all thy Precepts concerning all things to be right; and hate every falſe Way.</hi> I do not reject ſuch things that my carnal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot comprehend, or ſuch as are oppoſite to the Luſts and Corruptions of my Heart, or worldly Intereſt; but I approve of all things that come out of thy Mouth. Some Men do not receive the Truth in the love of it, and therefore are given up to believe a Lie, or to ſtrong Deluſions. <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 10.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>They hear Chriſt's Voice with Attention; they hear it diligently.</hi> He ſays, <hi>Hearken diligently unto me;</hi> and they with the greateſt care do ſo. Thus <hi>Mary</hi> heard Chriſt's Voice; ſhe gave ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to his Word and Doctrine, that ſhe left all her ſecular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns to attend upon him, though her Siſter was offended with her. And thus <hi>Lydia</hi> heard the Word of Chriſt, <hi>Whoſe Heart the Lord</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. <hi>They hear Chriſt's Voice believingly.</hi> Others hear it, but do not believe it: <hi>Who hath believed our Report? and to whom hath the Arm</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The great Doctrine of the Goſpel, is a Doctrine of Faith; 'tis to believe: <hi>He that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth</hi>

                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Chriſt's Sheep hear his Voice tremblingly, with great Fear, holy Awe, and Reverence.</hi> Thus good King <hi>Joſias</hi> heard the Word of <note place="margin">2 Chron. 34. 27. Iſa. 66. 2.</note> God; his Heart was tender, and he trembled: and ſaith the Lord, <hi>To this Man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite Spirit, and that trembleth at my Word.</hi> They know it is God's Word, Chriſt's Word, who hath all Power in Heaven and Earth, <hi>Who is the only Potentate, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.

                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Chriſt's Sheep hear Chriſt's Word univerſally, even all that he ſaith unto them; <hi>Him ſhall ye hear in whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto</hi>

                        <hi>you.</hi> And thoſe who do not thus hear this great Prophet, ſhall be deſtroyed from among the People. Some will hear Chriſt's Word which they like of; but if any part of his Doctrine ſutes not their carnal Hearts or Intereſt, that they will not hear, nor comply with: but Believers are for hearing the hardeſt things that are contained in Chriſt's Word; they approve of every thing, as you heard before.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. They hear Chriſt's Voice with Retention; they hear and keep his Word; they lay it up in their Hearts, as it is ſaid of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin:</hi> They will not loſe it, and therefore, with <hi>David,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 11.</note> hide Chriſt's Word in their Hearts.</p>

They are called Strangers, becauſe they publiſh ſtrange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: <hi>Be not carried about with divers and ſtrange Doctrines.</hi> The Doctrine of Chriſt is one and the ſame, being immutable, can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 3.</note> no Change or Alteration; but theſe bring in a new Doctrine, not known in the Primitive Days, not taught by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, nor received in the pureſt Times of the Goſpel before Corruptions crept into the Church.</p>
                     <p>They will not hear the Voice of Strangers, or the Doctrine of falſe Teachers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Not but that they may occaſionally hear ſuch preach; yet if they know they are Deceivers, they will not ſo much as hear them; neither ought they, but to ſhun them as ſuch who have Plague-Sores upon them; yet they may hear and read their Books, to know the better their curſed Principles and Errors.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Therefore they do not ſo hear them, as to like and approve of their Doctrine, as I ſaid before.</p>

                        <hi>Firſt.</hi> O labour to maintain and abide firm in the Doctrine of the Bleſſed Trinity: God hath revealed or made known himſelf <hi>as three in one,</hi> and therefore as ſuch to be worſhipped. Look what way God hath manifeſted his Being and Properties unto us in his Holy Word: Our Worſhip conſiſteth in a due application of our Soul unto him, according to that Revelation of himſelf. And that there are <hi>three diſtinct Perſons,</hi> ſubſiſting in the ſame infinitely holy One undivided Eſſence, as manifeſted in his Word, is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and thoſe Perſons are ſo diſtinct in their peculiar Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, that diſtinct Actings and Operations are aſcribed unto them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Father knoweth the Son,</hi> and loveth him; and the Son ſeeth, knoweth, and loveth the Father. In theſe mutual Actings, ſaith Reverend Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> one Perſon is the Object of the Knowledg and Love of the other. <hi>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his Hand. No Man knoweth the Son, but the Father;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 5. 35. Mat. 11. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>neither knoweth any Man the Father, ſave the Son.</hi> No Man knoweth the Divine Eſſence, or Eternal Generation of the Son, but the Father: Nor no Man knoweth the Eſſence or Counſels of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Diſpenſations of the Goſpel, ſave the Son: Or, as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, The Son is ſaid to know the Father, as he is the lively and expreſs Image of his Perſon.</p>
                     <p>This mutual Knowledg and Love of the Father and Son, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed at large in <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22.</p>
                     <p>And they are Abſolute, Infinite, Natural and Neceſſary unto the Being and Bleſſedneſs of God.

                        </note> in theſe mutual and internal and external Actings of themſelves, conſiſts much of the infinite Bleſſedneſs of the

Holy God. Again, 2. there are diſtinct Actings of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſons in the Godhead, which are voluntary, or Effects of Will and Choice, and not natural or neceſſary; and theſe are of two ſorts, ſuch as reſpect one another: for there are exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Acts of one Perſon towards another; but then the Perſon that is the Object of theſe Actings, is not conſidered abſolutely as a <hi>Divine Perſon,</hi> but with reſpect unto ſome peculiar Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and Condeſcenſion. So the Father <hi>gives, ſends,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Son, as he had condeſcended to take our Nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and to be the Mediator between God and Man. So the Father and the Son do ſend the Spirit, as he condeſcended in a ſpecial manner to the Office of being the <hi>Sanctifier and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter</hi> of the Church. Now theſe are free and voluntary Acts, depending upon the ſovereign Will, Counſel, and Pleaſure of God, and might not have been without the leaſt diminution of his Eternal Bleſſedneſs."</p>
                     <p>Although this is ſuch a Myſtery, that it's beyond our Capacities fully to comprehend it, yet there are, as appears by what hath been ſaid, clear Scripture-Demonſtrations, that in the Deity there is a plurality of diſtinct Perſons, which might further be evinced, as the Learned have ſhewed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A Being that ſtands under divers mutual Relations, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <note place="margin">John 1. 14, 18. 1 John 1. 22. Heb. 1. 5, 6. Gal. 4. 6.</note> and unalterably fixed, that one cannot be the other, muſt admit of ſuch a Conſideration of Exiſtence. But thus it is here, God the Father eternally begets, and never can be begotten; the Son is eternally and unchangeably begotten, and can never beget the Father; alſo the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the Father and the Son, and neither Father nor Son can proceed from the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Where one doth as it were command, and another obey; one ſends, and another is ſent, there muſt needs be a perſonal diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <note place="margin">Joh. 8. 20. &amp; 10. 17, 18. John 20. 21. Luke 10. 22. Acts 20. 28. John 5. 17. 1 Pet. 1. 18.</note> between each other: But, as it was before ſhewed, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth as it were command and ſend the Son, not himſelf; the Son is held forth as obeying, not commanding or ſending the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Where there is ſomething done by one, that is not done by another; that argues the Perſons are diſtinct one from the other. But thus it is in reſpect of the Deity, there is ſomething done by the Son, that is not done by the Father: The Son aſſumed Man's Nature, the Father did not this; the Son in that Nature died,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59949:51"/>
and ſatisfied for our Sins by the Sacrifice of himſelf; the Father did not this: The Holy Ghoſt is ſent by the Father and the Son, <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 8. Heb. 10. 9. Heb. 1. 8, 9. Iſa. 61. 1.</note> he doth not ſend the Father nor the Son.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Where there is a diſtinct mutual Converſe, in which one ſpeaks of himſelf to another, and of a third, there is the formality of three Perſons; but in the Deity there is ſuch a Converſe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Where there is an Image one of another, there is ſuch a Diſtinction one from another, that one is not the other in that reſpect; but in the Deity there is an Image one of another. The Myſtery is moſt manifeſt from expreſs Scripture. It is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Rule that cannot be contracted, That things alike are not <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 4. Col. 1. 15. Heb. 1. 3.</note> the ſame, in that reſpect wherein they are alike. Dr. <hi>Chauncy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Alſo labour to abide firm in the Faith concerning the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, who is both God and Man, the Eternal God; not God by Office, but God by Nature, the moſt High God who made Heaven and Earth, and yet truly Man, taking our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into a myſtical Union with his Holy Deity, being <hi>made like unto us in all things, Sin only excepted;</hi> and thus both God and Man in one Perſon.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> It is requiſite that he ſhould be God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe none can ſatisfy for Sin but he that is God; no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though never ſo Holy, could do it, becauſe Sin hath an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite demerit in it; being againſt an infinite God, it therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth everlaſting Puniſhment. From hence it appears, that the Satisfaction for our Sins muſt be infinitely meritorious, otherwiſe it could not ſatisfy the infinite Juſtice and Wrath of God. Now from the Dignity of Chriſt's Perſon, he being God as well as <note place="margin">Acts 20. 28. Heb. 9. 14.</note> Man, his Obedience and Suffering hath an infinite Worth in it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. No meer Creature was able to abide and overcome infinite Wrath, or the Puniſhment due to us for our Sins; therefore he muſt be God, that ſo he might bear the Burden of Divine Anger in his Fleſh, the Godhead upholding and ſuſtaining his Humane Nature, under his bloody Agony and fearful Anguiſh and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Tree, when God the Father was withdrawn from him, and the Pangs of Hell took hold of him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That he might overcome and vanquiſh all the Enemies of our Souls, as <hi>Sin, Satan, Death,</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> Had he not been God, he could not have raiſed himſelf from the Dead; from whence riſes the Spring of our Regeneration to a State of Grace here, and our Reſurrection to a State of Glory at the laſt Day hereafter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:59949:52"/>
2<hi>dly.</hi> He muſt be Man; becauſe he muſt die, which the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head could not do; yea, he muſt be Man in our Nature, that he might ſatisfy the Juſtice of God for us, becauſe the Righteouſneſs of God requires, that the ſame Nature which had ſinned, ſhould make a full Compenſation to the Law of God and infinite Juſtice. O take heed no Man ſhakes your Faith in this great Article of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Take heed alſo that you abide ſtedfaſt in the Doctrine of Chriſt's Satisfaction, which dependeth on the former. Such who deny Chriſt's Deity, muſt diſown that plenary Satisfaction he gave to the Law and Juſtice of God. Beware of <hi>Socinianiſm, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm,</hi> &amp;c. and all ſuch like Errors.</p>
                     <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> Take heed, there are ſome who tell you, Chriſt has fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for the Breach of the Law of the firſt Covenant, for the Sins of the whole World; ſo that all Men are cured of that Sickneſs, and delivered from that Curſe, and put into a Capacity to be ſaved, if they will but exerciſe the Power of their own Will and Abilities; and that Men have power to believe and be regenerated, that ſit under the preaching of the Goſpel; and if they anſwer and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their part in Salvation, Chriſt's Death will become effectual to them, it being but on this Condition that Chriſt Jeſus died to ſave Men, provided they anſwer thoſe Terms the Goſpel offers: Whereas it's evident, that Chriſt is not the End of the Law, as touching Righteouſneſs to any Man, but only to ſuch as believe, (I ſpeak of the Adult); and the Goſpel is not our Sickneſs, but our Cure; that condemns not, but as the healing Remedy is rejected, and the Curſe of the Law abides upon all Unbelievers. And it is alſo as evident, that Man by Nature <hi>is dead in Sin,</hi> and muſt by an almighty and irreſiſtible Power be quickned; which is done by the infuſion of a Principle of Divine Life. Faith is God's Gift, and not the Condition of the Covenant of Grace; it is a Branch, or part of that Grace promiſed therein, upon the Condition of Chriſt's Satisfaction, not the Condition to be performed by the Creature, which procures the Bleſſings purchaſed; therefore no Condition then in order and connection in the Promiſes, that God will enable all his Elect to perform, by beſtowing that Bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them freely by his own Grace. The whole of our Salvation is by Chriſt; <hi>It is by Faith, that it might be by Grace, to the end the Promiſe might be ſure to all the Seed;</hi> and <hi>all boaſting might be exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 16.</note> And 'tis not an uncertain Salvation, that depends upon the doubtful and depraved Will of Man; but <hi>it is well ordered in all</hi>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:59949:52"/>
                        <hi>things, and ſure,</hi> by the infinite Grace, Wiſdom, and Power of God. Nor did Chriſt die only for our Good who are ſaved, but in our ſtead alſo; ſo that Eternal Life comes to us in a way of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Righteouſneſs, as well as in a way of Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. God was not rendred only reconcileable by the Death of his Son, which the Creature is to make effectual on his part, but he is abſolutely reconciled: <hi>For if when we were Enemies, we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God by the death of his Son; much more being now reconciled,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>we ſhall be ſaved by his Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> There are others alſo that affirm, that Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator, gave to God a valuable Conſideration, or Recompence, <note place="margin">The new Doctrine, or rather new Goſpel.</note> that he might juſtly wave, and not execute the Law of perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and by his Merits purchaſed a new and milder Law of Grace: ſo that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs hath only purchaſed the removing the Law of Works from being a Covenant of Life; and that our Right to Salvation, the Favour of God, and Peace of Conſcience, does depend upon our Obedience to the Goſpel, which Chriſt hath purchaſed, ſhould be accepted for our Righteouſneſs, by which we muſt be juſtified and judged: and that Faith in its whole latitude, is our believing and obeying the Goſpel, or new Law, that by this we are made partakers of the Benefits of Chriſt, he having merited this Grant, or Law, That they who obey him ſincerely ſhould be ſaved; and that he is juſtified ſo far, and ſo long as he anſwers the Condition of this new Law of Grace.</p>
                     <p>Now we, and all ſound Proteſtants, in oppoſition to this, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That Jeſus Chriſt as the Head, Surety, and Repreſentative of all the Elect, did fulfil or ſatisfy for the Law of Works, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Curſe of the Law for us, and in our ſtead; and by his Holy Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> purchaſed for us that Life which the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to him, that continued to do all things that were written therein, and by the Supereminency of his Obedience, Additions of Bleſſedneſs unto Life; and that his Obedience and Righteouſneſs, whereby he fulfilled the Law, is imputed to Believers for their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, by which God grants them pardon of Sin, and a Grant of Eternal Life, and that by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, thus impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Believers ſtand perfectly juſtified and delivered from the Curſe of the Law, and are certainly intituled to Eternal Life; and that Faith is a relying on Chriſt, and truſting in him and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Merits only for Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="6">6<hi>thly.</hi> Therefore be ſure alſo you hear Chriſt's Voice, and adhere to his Doctrine about Juſtification, through his perfect and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59949:53"/>
compleat Righteouſneſs alone, imputed unto all them that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, without Works done by us, or Holineſs wrought in us; I mean, our Faith and ſincere Obedience, is not the Matter of our Juſtification before God, nor any part of it, but the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt only, in his perfect conformity to the Law of God in his Life, and by dying on the Croſs as our Surety and bleſſed Repreſentative: Yet know, we conſtantly affirm, That that Faith which unites us to Chriſt, in whom we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, doth purify both the Heart and Life; and though inherent Grace, Holineſs, and good Works, do not juſtify our Perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, yet they do juſtify our Faith, and declare us to be in a juſtified State before Men, and to our own Conſciences alſo, as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſhews; and that that Faith that is not attended with good Fruits, is dead, <hi>as the Body without the Spirit is dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Pray remember that you have been often taught, that Faith it ſelf doth not juſtify us in God's ſight, as an Habit, or Act, or in reſpect of the Product of it, but only objectively, <hi>i. e.</hi> in reſpect of the Object it doth apprehend, apply and take hold of.</p>
                     <p>O Sirs, take heed ye are not deceived; may be ye look upon the Lives and Converſations of Men, and you think they are good Men, holy Men; yet for all this examine the Doctrine they preach: for an evil and corrupt Doctrine may be as pernicious and damnable as an evil Converſation. <hi>But there were falſe Prophets alſo among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, even as there ſhall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

He ſees and knows they are his Sheep, as they have his Mark, his Image formed in them: for like as other Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds know their Sheep by the Mark they have upon them, ſo (to ſpeak after the manner of Men) Jeſus Chriſt may in this reſpect be ſaid to know his Sheep, his Saints and People; <hi>Surely they are my People, Children that will not lie: ſo he was their Saviour.</hi> I know <note place="margin">Iſa. 63. 8.</note> theſe are my People, I cannot but own them, they will keep my Covenant: I have renewed them, and they abide faithful to me, and will not deal falſly with me.

                        <note place="margin">Jer. 17. 10.</note> Moreover 'tis ſaid of Jeſus Chriſt, That he <hi>needed not that any ſhould teſtify of Man, for he knew what was in Man.</hi> He needeth not any to bring him Information concerning the Principles, Ends, <note place="margin">Joh. 2. 25.</note> Aims, Purpoſes, and Tempers of Men; and therefore he knows his Sheep, his Saints, that they are ſincere or upright-hearted Ones; he knows them from Hypocrites, from the <hi>Goats,</hi> from the fooliſh Virgins.</p>

O poor drooping Saint, lift up thy dejected Spirit; All thy Wants are in Chriſt's ſight, he ſees the Place where every Sheep and Lamb of his dwells, and what their Wants are: And his Love, Bowels, Care and Compaſſion is infinite; he that laid down his Life for his Sheep, for this and that poor afflicted, tempted, and dejected Soul, will not he, think you, ſeeing he knows your Condition, ſupply, ſupport, ſtrengthen, heal, feed, and comfort you, whoſoever you are, if one of his Sheep? <hi>He that ſpared not</hi>

True, there is no Work of ours that deſerveth any thing from the Hands of Chriſt, in point of Merit; yet what though, Rewards of Grace (as I have often told you) will exceed all Rewards of Merit: A Cup of <hi>cold Water</hi> ſhall have a Reward of Grace; the Gift of a Penny given in love to Chriſt, when thou cauſt give no more, ſhall have a glorious Reward at the great Day. As I once told you of a King, who meeting with a Baker's Boy, as he was carrying Bread into the Town, (he

being very hungry, and loſt his Nobles, having been a hunting) deſired the Boy to give him a Penny Loaf; which he readily did: And for this the King knighted the Boy, and gave a yearly Eſtate to him and his Heirs for ever.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt it is from their clean and mild Nature.</hi> Wicked Men, <note place="margin">Why Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are compared to Sheep.</note> from the conſideration of their filthy and ravenous Nature, are contrariwiſe compared to <hi>Lions, Wolves, Foxes, Dogs, Swine,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p>But now God's People have (through the Operation of Divine Grace) their unclean and filthy Nature changed; that brutiſh, perverſe and <hi>ſwiniſh</hi> Diſpoſition which they brought into the World with them, is gone: <hi>Such were ſome of you, but you are</hi>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:59949:59"/>
                        <hi>waſhed, but you are ſanctified, but you are juſtified in the Name of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Sheep are of a clean Nature, they like not to wallow in the Mire as <hi>Swine</hi> do: So the Saints have a clean and holy Nature wrought in their Souls, or ſpiritual Habits infuſed through the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, having obtained a true Righteouſneſs, in which they ſtand juſtified, and appear without Spot before God, even in the perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, which is counted to them for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their Juſtification, and are ſanctified through the Spirit of Holineſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Sheep are a harmleſs and innocent ſort of Creatures;</hi> not <hi>crafty</hi> like the <hi>Fox,</hi> nor <hi>devouring</hi> like the <hi>Lion.</hi> So the Saints are harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and innocent, they ſeek the Hurt of no Man, but deſire to live peaceably in the Land, and not like <hi>Romiſh</hi> Wolves, who delight in nothing more than in Blood and Rapine: They are like unto their Maſter, (or ought ſo to be) <hi>i. e. holy, harmleſs,</hi> &amp;c. They are ſimple concerning Evil, <hi>Children in Malice,</hi> though <hi>Men in Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding:</hi> They are not like the ungodly ones of the World, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 20.</note> who are full of Wrath, Hatred and Revenge; they are ſo far from this, that if they arrive at their true Character, <hi>they will ſpeak Evil of no Man,</hi> but pray for their Enemies, and for ſuch that hate them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Sheep are patient under Suffering:</hi> In this they ſtrive to imitate their Bleſſed Saviour alſo, <hi>who was led as a Lamb to the Slaughter; and as a Sheep is dumb before the Shearer, ſo he opened not his Mouth.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 7.</note> How patiently did the poor Martyrs go to the Stake; they ſtrove not with their Perſecutors, nor made reſiſtance: And when they ſuffer from the immediate Hand of God, they are patient as <hi>David</hi> was, and open not their Mouths, becauſe the Lord hath <note place="margin">Pſal. 39. 9. Levit. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> done it: Like <hi>Aaron</hi> who held his peace, and patiently bore the heavy Hand of God, when his two Sons were devoured with Fire before his Eyes.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Believers may be compared to Sheep from their Profitableneſs to others.</hi> We all know that Sheep are very profitable Creatures ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways, enriching and making Land fat; as alſo for Clothing, and for Meat: How excellent is the Fleſh of Sheep for Food? So God's People are uſeful and profitable. <hi>The Lips of the Righteous feed many,</hi> by their wiſe and pious Diſcourſe, Counſels, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Comfort, which they often communicate to many diſtreſſed and diſconſolate Souls: <hi>They are the Salt of the Earth, the Light of the World;</hi> and what a profitable thing is <hi>Salt</hi> to us, is <hi>Light</hi> to us?
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59949:59"/>
Even ſo in many reſpects the Godly, in a ſpiritual Senſe, are alike uſeful, and have been in their reſpective Generations in this World.</p>
                     <p>What a bleſſing was <hi>Lot</hi> to <hi>Sodom</hi> whilſt he was among them! the Fire could not ſeize upon that wicked City until he left it: <hi>Haſte thee, eſcape thither,</hi> (ſaid the Angel) <hi>for I cannot do any thing</hi>

                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Sheep are tractable and obedient,</hi> being ready to follow their Shepherd whitherſoever he goeth. It is the Cuſtom in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries for the Shepherd in leading the Sheep, to go out before them; to which practice our Saviour doth here allude: So Believers are obedient to Jeſus Chriſt, they are tractable, and learn to follow him; <hi>My Sheep hear my Voice, and they follow me.

                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Sheep are incident to divers Diſeaſes;</hi> many of them are weak and feeble, ſick and diſtempered, and therefore muſt by their Shepherd be ſtrengthned and healed, with much care, skill, and faithfulneſs: So are Chriſt's Sheep, his Saints, ſubject alſo to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold ſpiritual Diſeaſes, Weakneſſes, Temptations and Afflictions, which of old moved the Almighty to great Compaſſion, and ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to rebuke the Shepherds of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for their Cruelty and great Remiſneſs towards his Flock: <hi>The diſeaſed have ye not ſtrengthned;</hi>

                        <hi>neither have ye healed that which was ſick,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Among a Flock of Sheep are oftentimes ſome Goats,</hi> who feed with them, and lie down together. So in Chriſt's Flock are ſome evil and corrupt Members, ſuch who are none of his Sheep, but Hypocrites, though they ſeem to feed and have Communion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and theſe alſo are called <hi>Goats</hi> by the great Shepherd. <note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>Sheep are very fruitful,</hi> and do multiply in a little time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, though many of them may be killed by Butchers. The Saints may be compared to Sheep alſo in this reſpect, for they from a few have often increaſed to a very great Multitude. How few were the Number of Chriſt's Sheep at the time of his Aſcenſion, yet in a little ſpace we read, that their Number was five Thouſand; And though the Heathen Butchers killed many Thouſands, yet how wonderfully did they increaſe! which was marvellous in the Eyes of their Enemies. The like may be noted in theſe Days among us in <hi>England;</hi> what a few were they of the <hi>Baptized Churches,</hi> and other <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> not many Years ago, and to what a Multitude are they riſen now? Alſo the Saints grow in Grace, they are fruitful, bearing Twins, and none barren among them.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>Sheep are ſometimes ſeparated from the Goats,</hi> for ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Occaſion known to the Shepherd. Even ſo at the laſt Day ſhall all the Sincere and truly Godly be ſeparated from unſound and unſanctified Ones, by our Lord Jeſus the great Shepherd: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him ſhall be gathered all Nations, and he will ſeparate them one</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 32, 33.</note> 
                        <hi>from another, as a Shepherd divideth the Sheep from the Goats: And he will ſet the Sheep at his right Hand, and the Goats on his left Hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> To proceed: Tho I have already clearly opened the Properties or Characters of the Sheep of Chriſt, in ſpeaking to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts of my Text, yet I ſhall in a ſummary way, here add ſome few Particulars further upon this Account, which may ſerve by way of Trial to all of us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The firſt diſtinguiſhing Character of them is, They <hi>hear Chriſt's Voice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:59949:61"/>
What is meant by his Voice, and how they do hear it, we have ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chriſt's Sheep have paſſed through a great Change, a glorious, internal and viſible Change. They are converted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, renewed or regenerated by Divine Grace: They were once like other Men and Women, and had no Sheep-like Nature, (as you have heard) but rather the ſame filthy, unclean, and brutiſh Nature of <hi>Swine,</hi> &amp;c. which is in all ungodly Ones.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is a real Change from Nature to Grace; 'tis not a ſeeming, a nominal, or notional, but a true and real Change; they have a new Heart, a new Spirit, a new Nature created in them; they are become new Creatures: all real Operations of the Spirit ſuppoſe ſome real Form; a real Habit is infuſed, from whence they act, which works in them a ready Inclination, Diſpoſition, and ſweet Propenſity to do that which is truly and ſpiritually Good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And this is common to all the Sheep of Jeſus Chriſt; in this reſpect they are all alike, having all obtained the ſame precious Faith, as to the Quality of it: As all <hi>Wolves</hi> have the Nature of <hi>Wolves,</hi> and all <hi>Swine</hi> the Nature of <hi>Swine,</hi> and all Sheep have the Nature of Sheep; ſo all the Saints and Children of God have the Nature of Saints; all Believers and Sheep of Jeſus Chriſt have one holy Nature.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is a Nature and Diſpoſition quite contrary to that which was in them formerly: 'Tis a mighty Change, as when a <hi>Wolf</hi> is made a <hi>Lamb,</hi>  the "<hi>Wolfiſh</hi> Nature (as one obſerves) is loſt, and the <hi>Lamb-like</hi> Nature is introduced. By Corruption Man was Carnal and Brutiſh, but by the new Creation he is Spiritual and Divine; by Corruption he hath the Image of the Devil, by this he is reſtored to the Image of God; by that he had the Seeds of all Villanies, by this the Seed of all Graces." He was an Enemy to God, nay, had Enmity in his Heart againſt God; but now he loves God, loves Chriſt, loves Holineſs, loves the Ways of God, and People of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is an univerſal Change, a Change of the whole Heart; as when a Child is formed in the Womb, it hath all the Parts, Nature doth not faſhion one Part and leave another imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: So the Holy Spirit forms every Part of the new Creature in the Soul of the Regenerate. This Habit is but one, 'tis an intire Rectitude in all the Faculties, and an univerſal Principle of inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Charnock.</note> and diſpoſing to that which is good and well-pleaſing to God: there is a Divine Light in the <hi>Vnderſtanding,</hi> by which the Soul
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59949:62"/>
ſees God to be its chief Good, and owns and looks upon him as ſuch. There is a Change in the Will, that conſents and chuſes God as ſuch; there is a Change in the Affections. There is no true Draught of the Image of God in us, unleſs there be a Rectitude of Affection and Diſpoſition: There is therefore a conformity of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to God, they love God, and love as God loves, and hate as God hateth; they hate Evil, becauſe of that inward Filthineſs that is in it, and love Grace and Vertue, becauſe of its pure and native Beauty and Excellency: therefore it is from hence the Soul comes to take delight in God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It changes not the Heart only, but the whole Life alſo; <hi>The Life which I now live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>God.</hi> Such live no longer to themſelves, but to God; their Tongues ſpeak for God, their Ears hear for God, their Hands work for God; their Actions are Holy, Juſt and Good. There is a Change of Company alſo, a Change of Labour, of Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and their whole End, Aim and Deſign, is to glorify God: Heavenly Things are preferred by them before earthly Things; they chiefly ſeek the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs. They do not purſue the World as they did, nor faſhion themſelves according to the former Luſts and the Courſe of this World; nor pray as they did, nor hear as they did, nor give Alms as they did: No, no, they do all things from another Principle, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother End, and with other Zeal, Endeavours, and Diligence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Chriſt's Sheep will feed in Chriſt's Paſture, in their own Paſture, where they are put by him; not but that they may, for good Reaſons, be removed into another Paſture, but they will not (unleſs under ſtrong Temptation) break down the Hedg or Fold where they were put, and run away; No, no, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with that Food, that Paſture God affords them, though there may be ſome more Fat and Rich than theirs. Some Sheep when they grow wanton, are unruly, and will break into other Mens Ground; ſo there are ſome Profeſſors, ſome Church-members that rend themſelves away from their own Flock and Fold, in a diſorderly manner; "Which (as a Reverend Miniſter ſhews) is an abominable Evil, and a ſhame to them: this deſtroys the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Paſtor and People, for what may be done by one Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, may be done by all; and (ſaith he) what Liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Sheep, belongs alſo to that particular Shepherd who has the Charge of them much more; it is a breaking Covenant
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59949:62"/>
with Chriſt and the Congregation, and therefore a great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality: 'tis a Schiſm, if there be any ſuch thing in the World; it is a deſpiſing the Government of the Church; and there is as much reaſon a Perſon ſhould come in when he pleaſes, without asking Conſent, as to depart when he pleaſes: It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo very evil and unkind in another Church to receive ſuch a One, as not doing as they would be dealt with. Such a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice can iſſue in nothing but in the Breach and Confuſion of all particular Churches: It tends (ſaith he) to <hi>Anarchy,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an Arbitrary Power in every Member, and breaks all Bonds of Love, and raiſeth the greateſt Animoſities between Brethren and Churches." The truth is, how can another Shepherd juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy ſuch an Act to the great Shepherd of the Sheep; I mean, to take into his Fold his Neighbour's Sheep, without Chriſt's Order and Authority?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Chriſt's Sheep will, and do follow him; and this our <note place="margin">Chriſt's Sheep do follow him.</note> Bleſſed Saviour lays down as an undoubted Character of all that are his.</p>
                     <p>They follow his Example, his Steps. The good Shepherd <hi>when he putteth forth his own Sheep, he goeth before them, and the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Sheep follow him.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt hath gone before his Sheep in his Obedience to the Father, <hi>leaving us an Example that we ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>his Steps.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. They follow his Steps in Humility: He bids us to learn of him upon this Account; <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>Heart.</hi> How did Chriſt deny himſelf? in taking our Nature upon him: In this ought his Sheep to follow him; <hi>Let the ſame Mind be in you which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> O let the ſame humble Spirit, <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 5.</note> and ſelf-denying Temper be in you, which was in him; <hi>Who being in the Form of God, thought it no Robbery to be equal with God, and made himſelf of no reputation, but took upon him the Form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> &amp;c. Saints are, or ought to be, of a humble Frame, having mutual Love, and a condeſcending Spirit, even to them that are in the loweſt and meaneſt Condition, bearing with the Weak, and not exalting themſelves, nor offending one another in any thing that is indifferent in its own Nature: <hi>I become all things to all, that I might gain ſome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chriſt's Sheep do follow him in Love, and bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion: <hi>Be ye followers of God, as dear Children; and walk in love,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 1, 2.</note> 
                        <hi>as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given himſelf for us.</hi> By this
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59949:63"/>
all Men may know we are his Diſciples, even when we have this Mark of his Sheep, namely, that we love one another. Husbands are exhorted to love their Wives, as Chriſt alſo loved his Church, <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 25.</note> and gave himſelf for it; even with a ſincere, pure, ardent and conſtant Affection. And thus ought all Chriſtians to love each other alſo, being united as Brethren together, and Members of the ſame Body of which Chriſt is the Head. <hi>He that loveth not his Brother, is in Darkneſs,</hi> he is none of Chriſt's Sheep. <hi>He that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Joh. 2. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>ſaith he abideth in the Light, ought alſo to walk even as he walked,</hi> and love as he loved.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They follow him in Holineſs. <hi>But as he that hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of Converſation: Becauſe it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi> God the Father is holy, and Chriſt is holy: He was <hi>holy, harmleſs, and undefiled, ſeparated from Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Therefore in this we ſhould follow him in the whole Courſe <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 15, 16. Heb. 7. 26.</note> of our Lives, and in the ſeveral parts of our Converſations. All thoſe who are his Sheep, they are ſuch who are ſanctified Perſons, who laying <hi>aſide all filthineſs of the Fleſh and Spirit,</hi> (they go on) <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. They follow the Example of Chriſt, their holy Shepherd, in Obedience. <hi>Though he was a Son, yet learned he Obedience by the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 8, 9.</note> 
                        <hi>things he ſuffered: And being made perfect, he became the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi> Chriſt's Meat and Drink was to do the Will of him that ſent him; and thus we ought to follow him; it ought to be our Joy, our Delight, to do his Will, and attend on his Work: And this Mark have all Chriſt's Sheep, <hi>i. e.</hi> they keep Chriſt's Word; If a Man love me, he will keep my Word. And again, <hi>He that hath my Commandments, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, he it is that loveth me:</hi> Not he that hath the knowledg of <note place="margin">John 14. 11.</note> them; it is poſſible Men may have Chriſt's Commandments in their Heads, and in their Mouths, may know which they are, but they may not do them: It is he that doth his Word, that doth his Sayings; that keepeth his Commandments, that loves him; <hi>Ye</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 15. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>are my Friends, if you do whatſoever I command you.</hi> This is a Mark of Chriſt's Sheep, of one of Chriſt's Friends, or of a ſincere Chriſtian and follower of him: He will be obedient to Chriſt, not in ſome things only, but in every thing that he requires or enjoins him to do in his Word.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. They follow Chriſt in the hardeſt things, in ſuch things that ſeem grievous to the Fleſh. Like as <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 2, 3.</note> to offer up <hi>his Son, his only Son,</hi> his only Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> whom
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59949:63"/>
he loved, went preſently about it, he made no pauſe, did not conſult with Fleſh and Blood: <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>roſe up early in the Morning,</hi> &amp;c. with an intention to do this hard Work. And now ſaith the Lord, <hi>I know that thou feareſt God, ſeeing thou haſt not</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Verſe 12.</note> 
                        <hi>withheld thy Son, thine only Son from me.</hi> God knew it before, tho he ſpeaks here after the manner of Men: but he would have <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to know it, and all Men to know that this is a Mark of one that feareth him, that loveth him, <hi>viz.</hi> he will do any thing God requires of him, even ſacrifice up all that is near and dear to him, when called for. O ſee how obedient Chriſt was to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>The Lord God hath opened mine Ear, and I was not rebellious,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 50. 5, 6.</note> 
                        <hi>neither turned away my back. I gave my Back to the Smiters, and my Cheeks to them that plucked off the Hair; I hid not my Face from Shame and Spitting.</hi> This was hard Work, yet Chriſt readily paſſed through it; <hi>He became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs,</hi> the worſt of Deaths, exceeding ten thouſand Deaths, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what he felt and did undergo for us.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. They follow Chriſt whitherſoever he goeth. Some will not do this; they may go a great way after the Lord Jeſus, but then make a halt, and give over following of him. Some are like <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pah,</hi> who kiſſed her Mother-in-Law, and departed from her, but <note place="margin">Ruth 1. 14, 15, 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Ruth clave unto her.</hi> Even ſo ſuch who are ſincere Chriſtians, they keep following of Chriſt, when others leave him and cleave to the World, to their Luſts, to their curſed Idolatry; but theſe ſay to Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Naomi, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following of thee; for whither thou goeſt, I will go; and where thou lodgeſt, I will lodg: Thy People ſhall be my People, and thy God my God.</hi> Thoſe that are wiſe Virgins, or the Sheep of Chriſt, the Holy Ghoſt gives us their Character; <hi>Theſe are they which were</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>not defiled with Women, for they are Virgins; theſe are they which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth,</hi> &amp;c. They will not follow God and <hi>Baal,</hi> Chriſt and Antichriſt; receive Chriſt's Inſtitutions, and <hi>Rome</hi>'s vile Idolatry and Superſtitions; or follow ſome Precepts of Chriſt, and reject others: No, no, they follow him in all his holy Laws, keeping cloſe in all things to the Rules of his Worſhip, both in Doctrine, Diſcipline, and Converſation; in all Duties of Religion, both Natural and Supernatural, whether towards God, or towards Men. They are like unto <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt fully; <hi>But my Servant</hi> Caleb, <hi>becauſe he had another Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Num. 14. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the good Land, and his Seed ſhall poſſeſs it.</hi> He followed God when others
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59949:64"/>
forſook him, being not acted by that evil Spirit of Cowardice, ſlaviſh Fear and Unbelief which ruled in others, but was a Man of another Temper, <hi>i. e.</hi> Couragious, Faithful, Obedient; as it is ſaid of the Righteous, he was <hi>bold as a Lion;</hi> and univerſally, thrô all Difficulties, Deaths and Dangers, followed God: And thus do all the true Sheep of Chriſt follow him.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. They follow Chriſt in ſincerity, not for Loaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. They follow Chriſt conſtantly to the End, and faint not. We read of ſome that followed our Bleſſed Saviour for ſome time, but then they were offended at his Doctrine; <hi>From that time many</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 66.</note> 
                        <hi>of his Diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.</hi> This ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they were not his Sheep or Diſciples indeed, for theſe returned no more; they, it is evident, drew back to Perdition. A godly Man may, under a Temptation, ſeem to faint and draw back, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, but he returns by Repentance and follows Chriſt again. <hi>We are not</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) of them who draw back unto Perdition, but</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 39.</note> 
                        <hi>of them that believe to the ſaving of the Soul.</hi> The Sheep of Chriſt hold on their way, they having clean Hands, grow ſtronger and ſtronger, they can never periſh; therefore ſhall follow Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, or perſevere in well-doing to the End of their Days. The good Ground brought forth Fruit unto Eternal Life: ſuch who fall away were not ſincere and honeſt-hearted Ones, but are either like <note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> the ſtony or thorny ground Hearers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly</hi> Chriſt's Sheep have his <hi>Character</hi> by which they are known. <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Chriſt's Sheep have his Mark on them.</hi> Ezek. 9. 4.</note> Men <hi>mark</hi> their Sheep ſo; we read in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God were <hi>ſealed;</hi> they were marked in their right Hands, and in their Foreheads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God gave a Charge of old, to ſet a Mark upon the Men that ſigh'd and mourn'd for all the Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations that were committed in the Land. <hi>Merchants,</hi> and others, commonly ſet a Mark upon their Goods, by which they lay claim to them, and know them: So Chriſt ſets his Mark, his Seal, upon all his Saints. By their Father's Mark on their right Hand, ſome underſtand <hi>the Heart:</hi> A Mark in the Hand is a ſecret Mark.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. No doubt the Mark of Chriſt's Sheep, is the Mark of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or that holy Image of God which is ſtamp'd upon them all, as I hinted at firſt: And if Chriſt ſees not this Mark on the Soul, he will not own that Man or Woman actually to be his.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Holy Spirit is expreſly called the Seal with which every true Believer is ſealed: <hi>Alſo after that ye believed ye were ſealed with that holy Spirit of Promiſe. Which is the Earneſt of our Inheritance,</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. It may be for Lamentation. <hi>Cyprian</hi> brings in the Devil triumphing over Jeſus Chriſt, after this ſort: "As for my Followers, I never died for them as Chriſt did for his; I never promiſed them ſo great Rewards as Chriſt hath done to his, and yet I have more Followers than he, and they do more for me than his do for him."</p>
                     <p>O how blind and deceived are poor Sinners, that they chuſe to follow Satan rather Jeſus Chriſt! What a great Multitude hath the Devil! his Flock is a mighty Flock, Chriſt's Flock is a little Flock: <hi>Fear not, little Flock, it is your Father's good</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. By what you have heard, you may try your ſelves: O ſee, have you theſe Characters, theſe Marks of Chriſt's Sheep? certainly if ſo, you have no cauſe to doubt but your State is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; if not, labour for them.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. By his coming ſo far (as 'tis from Heaven to the Earth) to ſeek them; <hi>For the Son of Man is come to ſave that which was loſt.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Bowels and Compaſſion of Chriſt to his Sheep, chiefly appears by his dying for them. He laid down his Life for the Sheep; none could ſhew greater Love than this: <hi>As the Father knoweth me, even ſo I know the Father; and I lay down my Life for</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 10. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>the Sheep.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. His great Love and Affection to his Sheep, is manifeſted by his care to gather them; <hi>He ſhall gather the Lambs with his Arms,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 40. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>and carry them in his Boſom.</hi> Gathering implies, bringing them Home unto himſelf by the Arm of his Power, or by the effectual Operation of his Word and Spirit. <hi>To whom hath the Arm of the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Lord been revealed?</hi> Or, who hath felt and experienced the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Influences of his Spirit, and ſaving Grace thereof, on their Souls? This muſt be before any poor Sinners are gathered or brought home to God. Jeſus Chriſt muſt reſcue them out of the Mouth of the Lion, and Paw of the Bear, as <hi>David</hi> did his Sheep, who was a Type of him. We were all once in Satan's Hand, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 17. 34, 35.</note> that hungry Lion had us in his Teeth, and was going to tear us
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59949:67"/>
to pieces, but then comes our Bleſſed Shepherd and delivers us. None but he whoſe Power is Infinite could gather us, or bring us home to God, ſuch a miſerable State were we in.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Chriſt's Love is further expreſſed, by that affecting Metaphor, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 6. He goes after the loſt Sheep, leaveth the reſt in the Wilderneſs, and never gives over until he hath found it; <hi>And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his Shoulders, rejoicing.</hi> O my Friends, how great is the Love of Chriſt to one poor, loſt, and undone Sinner? He will not loſe one that his Father hath given him: No, no, though it be but one individual Soul that is miſſing, yet he will go after that, ſeek that, leave all the reſt to look after that one poor Sheep; and when he has found it, he ſees it cannot go, it has no ſtrength, therefore he lays it upon his Shoulders. Sinners, Chriſt muſt lay hold of you, and take you up, and lay you on his Shoulders, and carry you home if ever you are ſaved. It is upon Chriſt's Shoulders, Chriſt's Power, that every Elect Soul is brought home; 'tis not on the Power of their Will, their Strength, their Faith; no, but on Chriſt's Shoulders. Moreover, it is ſaid, <hi>He rejoiced,</hi> and calls upon all his Friends (the bleſſed Angels and Saints) to rejoice with him, <hi>for I have found my loſt</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Verſe 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Sheep.</hi> This ſhews his wonderful Love to poor, undone, and loſt Sinners that are his Sheep, whatever it coſts him, whatever Pains, Labour, or Charge, home he will bring them, ſaved they muſt and ſhall be. <hi>I have other Sheep</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that are not of this Fold,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 10. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my Voice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. His Love to his Sheep, to his Saints, alſo appears in <hi>his laying them in his Boſom,</hi> in his Heart. O how near and dear is every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul to Jeſus Chriſt! It's a Metaphor taken from a Father or tender Mother, that hugs an only Child in his or her Arms, and lays it in their Boſom, knowing not how to expreſs the Greatneſs of their Affections. Chriſt himſelf is ſaid <hi>to lie in the Boſom of the Father;</hi> which denotes how he is beloved by him, how near and dear he is to him: Even ſo this diſcovers his great Affections to his People.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. He alſo makes his Love manifeſt to them, by his gentle leading of them: <hi>He ſhall gently lead them that are with young.</hi> He will not <note place="margin">Iſa. 40. 11.</note> lead them faſter than they are able to go, or lay more upon them than they can bear; nay, he gives Strength to them, and ſupports their Souls under all their Troubles and Sorrows. <hi>Jacob</hi> was a compaſſionate Shepherd; <hi>If I over-drive them,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 33. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>Flock will die.</hi> Chriſt had many things to tell his Diſciples, but
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59949:67"/>
they were not able to bear them: He lets out or diſcovers his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Truth to his People, according as he knows they are able to receive it and take it in: You ſhall not have harder Things, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, Temptations nor Afflictions, than your ſtrength is. <hi>There</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>hath no Temptation taken you, but what is common to Man: and God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above what you are able; but will with the Temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. His infinite Love and Bowels are made known alſo to his Sheep by his feeding them, as well as it is by his leading them. He feeds them with choice Food, he gives them his own Fleſh to eat, and his own precious Blood to drink, knowing that except he doth this, they muſt periſh for ever: This was that ſtrange Doctrine in the Eyes of the Jews, which they could not receive nor underſtand.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Alſo by his healing of his Sheep with his own Stripes. <hi>But he was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our Iniquities; the Chaſtiſement of our Peace was upon him, and by his Stripes we are healed.</hi> What Shepherd ever thus loved his Sheep, even to be wounded and bruiſed for them, to heal them of their Wounds with his own Stripes? But this Jeſus Chriſt doth.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. By this waſhing them alſo in the ſame precious Blood: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could purge away the Filth and Guilt of our polluted Souls, but Chriſt's Blood; and if he waſh us not, we have no part with him: <hi>He hath loved us, and waſhed us from our Sins in his own Blood.</hi> This Love is wonderful Love, amazing Love, exceeding all Love. <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 3.</note> O in what a Stream, in what a Fountain are the Sheep of Chriſt waſhed! Think upon it, our Pollution was great, but Chriſt hath waſhed us. God ſent his Son to take away our Sin, and it muſt be done this way; <hi>It is the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son that cleanſes</hi>

                        <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is the good Shepherd. <hi>I am the good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; the good Shepherd giveth his Life for the Sheep.</hi> Our Lord <note place="margin">Chriſt the good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</note> Jeſus ſhews in this that he excels all Shepherds: Some Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds have ventured their Lives, hazarded their Lives for their <note place="margin">John 10. 11.</note> Sheep; yet it was more than was required of them, for the Life of a Man is much more valuable than the Life of a Beaſt: But no doubt our Saviour refers to his great Work and Office as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and as the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that was to come, who was to <hi>be cut off, not for himſelf,</hi> for his own Sins, but for the Sins of the Elect, or <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 26.</note> die for his Sheep: It was required of him, the Father gave him
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59949:68"/>
commandment to lay down his Life; and he did it actually, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, willingly; nay, he came on purpoſe into this World to do it, and therefore he is the good Shepherd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is a Wiſe Shepherd, a knowing Shepherd; <hi>I know my Sheep:</hi> this I have already ſpoken to. <note place="margin">Jeſus Chriſt a wiſe Shepherd.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. He knows and ſees all his Sheep at once, with one look of his Eye, in all the Nations of the Earth, let them dwell where they will, though never ſo far aſunder or remote.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He is ſo wiſe, that he knows in what Condition they are, and what Condition is beſt for them; whether Poverty or Riches, Sickneſs or Health, Liberty or Bonds, Peace or Trouble, Honour or Diſgrace, Strength or Weakneſs, either a fat or a lean Paſture, Loſs or Gain, Cold or Heat, whether a North or a South Wind.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He is wiſe to protect us, wiſe to conduct us, to feed us, wiſe to fold us, wiſe to heal us, and wiſe to ſave us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly.</hi> Chriſt is the chief and great Shepherd of the Sheep. <hi>And when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, ye ſhall receive a Crown of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Chriſt is a great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</note> 
                        <hi>Glory.</hi> And again, the Holy Ghoſt calls him in another place, the great Shepherd: <hi>Now the God of Peace, that brought from the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 4. Heb. 13. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>Dead our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that great Shepherd of the Sheep,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Jeſus Chriſt may be called the chief and great Shepherd.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe he entered into Covenant with the Father, as the great Surety of all the Sheep; by which he came under a legal Obligation to pay the juſt Debts, and to anſwer for the Defaults of all his Elect: And then and thereby he undertook to bring in and gather all the Sheep to God by the Blood of the Everlaſting Covenant; by which Tranſaction he made our Peace, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 20.</note> us unto the Father.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe he actually bought all the Sheep, in purſuit of the ſaid glorious Covenant-Tranſactions, by the Price of his own Blood, that ſo he might unite them all unto himſelf in one Body. <note place="margin">Acts 20. 27, 28.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. He may be called the chief and great Shepherd, becauſe all the Sheep, or Elect of God, are given into his Hand, to keep, take care of, feed, heel, protect and preſerve to Eternal Life. And this great Work and Office he hath undertaken, and doth and will perform with all Faithfulneſs, being every ways fitted, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared and qualified, as Mediator and univerſal Shepherd and Head, to diſcharge it.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:59949:68"/>
4. Becauſe 'tis he that calls them, that juſtifies them, that ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies them, and preſents them all faultleſs and without Spot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Father.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Becauſe he is exalted in Glory and Dignity, not only as the Head, Lord, and Sovereign of all the Sheep, but alſo as the Prince of all Paſtors and ſubordinate Shepherds that ever were, are, or ſhall be; from whom they all receive their Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as his Deputies, to take care of and watch over each part and parcel of his Flock committed to their reſpective Charge. Jeſus Chriſt is not only above all Shepherds, all Miniſters, but they do all in his Name, and muſt at the laſt Day be accountable to him for their Adminiſtrations.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. He is the great Shepherd of the Sheep, a mighty Shepherd, if we conſider the greatneſs of the Flock, which he hath not only received the Care and Charge of, but they are all his own Sheep. If a Shepherd had under his Care 100000 Sheep, and all his own, would not every body call him a great Shepherd? Now though Chriſt's Flock is called a little Flock comparatively, yet the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of all his Sheep, all his Elect, is very great: we read of <hi>ten thouſands of his Saints,</hi> and a Number that no Man can number, they are all his; and therefore a great Shepherd.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. He is great in Riches, having a multitude of rich and choice Paſtors, enough to feed Millions of Sheep here on Earth: And though his Flock will encreaſe e're long, when the <hi>Fulneſs of the Gentiles ſhall come in,</hi> and his antient Flock, I mean, the <hi>Seed of Abraham</hi> now ſcattered, be gathered, and all brought into one Fold, yet he hath Paſtures for them all. Moreover, he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a glorious and rich Fold for them Above, which is Heaven it ſelf, that is the Fold into which all his Flock ſhall be put for ever and ever.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Laſtly, He is great in Power: No Shepherd hath ſuch Power to defend, protect, preſerve and ſave his Flock like to him. None are able to pluck one Sheep out of his Hand, as I ſhall prove and demonſtrate when I come to ſpeak to the next part of my Text. Another Shepherd, for want of Power, may loſe his Sheep, the <hi>Wolf</hi> or <hi>Lion</hi> may come and tear them in pieces, and rob him of them: But no Enemy, neither Sin nor Satan, nor the World, can rend his Sheep from him; he hath Power over all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, and can ſubdue them with much caſe at his Pleaſure; therefore he is the great Shepherd.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Seventhly.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is a watchful Shepherd. This is one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty <note place="margin">

                     <p>Chriſt knows his Sheep are ſubject to ſleep, and ſo lie open to many Dangers, therefore he watches over them.

2<hi>dly.</hi> Chriſt knows that his Flock is not only ſubject to ſleep, but alſo to go aſtray, and therefore he watcheth over them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe he ſees our Enemies watch againſt us to enſnare, to catch, and to ruin us; <hi>Deliver thy ſelf as a Roe from the Hand of</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Satan is a ſubtil Fowler, a crafty Enemy; and is alſo clothed with great Power. He is compared to a Serpent, to ſhew his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty; and to a Lion, which denotes his Strength and devouring Nature.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt watches his Sheep, that he may give them thoſe Mercies they need in the proper ſeaſon of them: He knows when and how to give us that Good he himſelf hath promiſed. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he watches over his People, to <hi>chaſten,</hi> to afflict and puniſh them with the Rod, when he ſees there is need of it: He lets out his Dog, (as I may ſo ſay, like as a Shepherd doth upon unruly Sheep) when his Calls will not do, will not reclaim them and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to an orderly and diligent walk. But then at another time, he watches over them, to beſtow his Favours and Bleſſing upon them: <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that like as I have watched</hi>

God here ſpeaks after the manner of Men; and as he is diligent to afflict for Diſobedience, ſo he is likewiſe as diligent upon a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, to diſtribute his Bleſſings, when he ſees it will make for his Glory and his Peoples Good.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Beloved, there is a two-fold taſting of the Word.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) Some taſte it, but digeſt it not; they have an Apprehenſion, and bear Reception of it, and no more: The news of a Saviour, and deliverance from Wrath, ſeems deſirable to them; they like the Promiſes of the Word, and flatter themſelves with a falſe Hope of Pardon, by giving a bare Credit to the Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in the declaration of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) But there is a farther and better taſting than this; a taſting by a ſpecial Application, and a ſaving reliſhing of the Word of God; and not the promiſſory Part only, but the preceptory Part thereof alſo: Theſe like and love the Word, becauſe of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it. Others have a common, but not a ſpecial Faith; the Jews ſeemed to rejoice in <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but did not receive it <note place="margin">John 5. 35.</note> into their Underſtanding, and ſincerely ſubject to the Life and Power of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) The Word of God feeds the Souls of Believers with ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Knowledg, the Doctrine of Free Grace, of Juſtification, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, Pardon of Sin, and free acceſs to the Father, which ſhews
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59949:70"/>
it to be a ſat and bleſſed Paſture; and thus it feeds their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) It feeds and raiſes their Affections alſo in Love to Chriſt, and deſire after him, to hear what God is to them, and Chriſt is to them; what a Covenant is made with Chriſt for them, what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are made to them, what Love the Lord Jeſus hath to them, and what Grace is purchaſed, laid, and treaſured up in Chriſt for them; what Care he hath of them, and what Glory he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) They receive the Word they aſſent to the Truth of it and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p n="4">(4.) It feeds their Faith alſo, and every Grace of the Spirit in their Souls; it increaſes their Faith in Chriſt, and their Love to Chriſt, whilſt they meditate thereon, and believe with an unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Faith the Veracity of God's Word, and apply the Promiſes and Bleſſings thereof, which are purchaſed by Jeſus Chriſt now, is to eat and digeſt the Word.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly.</hi> The Ordinances of Chriſt may be ſaid to be another <note place="margin">

The Spouſe no doubt enquired after this Paſture; <hi>Tell me, O thou whom my Soul loveth, where thou feedeſt,</hi> &amp;c. where thy Holy Ordinances are truly adminiſtred.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The Ordinance of Preaching, or Adminiſtration of the Goſpel, is a rich Paſture,</hi> eſpecially when it is preached powerfully by the Influence and Demonſtration of the Spirit; the opening and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the Word of the Goſpel, is like the opening the Paſture-Gate, and ſo letting the Sheep into it. <hi>Did not our Hearts burn within</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luke 24. 32.</note> 
                        <hi>us, while he talked with us, and opened the Scriptures?</hi> 'Tis like the opening of the Box of precious Ointment, cauſing a ſweet Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume in the Soul, like as <hi>Mary</hi>'s did in the Houſe. The Work of the Miniſtry is to open the Scripture; <hi>Vnderſtandeſt thou what thou readeſt?</hi> ſaith <hi>Philip.</hi> The Eunuch anſwered, <hi>How can I, unleſs</hi>

                        <hi>ſome Man ſhould guide me?</hi> He might have added, ſome skilful Man. Alas, ſome are unlearned, unexperienced and ignorant Preachers, they know not the Lord themſelves, they never lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Father, but want the Teachings of the Holy Spirit: They underſtand not the Scripture, the Holy Bible is a ſealed Book to them, notwithſtanding all their Humane Literature and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Tongues, with their Arts and Sciences.</p>

                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:59949:71"/>
The preaching the Goſpel, is the feeding of the Soul. But O what care ſhould be taken, that nothing is delivered by the Preacher but ſound Doctrine; not to feed the People with airy and empty Notions, corrupt and poiſonous Doctrine; for that is to deſtroy the Sheep, eſpecially ſuch that are weak in Knowledg, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quickly diſcern Truth from Error.</p>
                     <p>They are not to feed the Flock with Humane Traditions, nor with their own Dreams. Simon, <hi>Son of</hi> Jonas, <hi>loveſt thou me?</hi>

And (ſaith the ſame worthy Author) ſo dipping into the Water, in a moſt lively "Similitude, ſets forth the Mortification of the old Man; and riſing out of the Water, the Vivification of the new Man; it being meet that we, being baptized into his Death, and buried with him, ſhould riſe alſo with him, and go on in a new Life."

                        <hi>Know ye not, that ſo many of us as were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized into his Death? Therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſm into Death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the Dead by the Glory of the Father; even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of Life.</hi> We have Fellowſhip with Chriſt in his Death in Baptiſm, or the Efficacy of his Death evidenced to us, as the outward Symbol of it is held forth in the external Adminiſtration of it: For as Chriſt died for Sin, ſo we are hereby obliged to die to Sin; and as he roſe again from the Dead, ſo we ought (as we covenant in this Ordinance) to walk in newneſs of Life. Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> ſaith, "In Immerging there are in a manner three-fold Acts, <hi>The putting the Perſon into the Water, his abiding under the Water,</hi> and <hi>his riſing up again;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>repreſenting Chriſt's Death, Burial, and Reſurrection;</hi> and our Conformity thereunto in our dying to Sin, and the deſtruction of its Power, and our reſurrection to a new courſe of Life." O learn what your Baptiſm holds forth, and what you are taught thereby, and promiſed therein, and live accordingly.

A Crucified Chriſt is the Bread of Life; and by Faith in this Ordinance we feed on this Bread; it feeds and ſtrengthens our Faith, and alſo our Love to the Lord Jeſus: Who can forbear to love that Chriſt, who poured forth his precious Blood for us? He was made a Curſe for us, by hanging on the Tree, and bearing our Sins.</p>
                     <p>When you take this Bread, and this Cup, you declare you take and accept of Chriſt as the only Food of your Souls; and that way of Salvation God hath been graciouſly pleaſed to find out: and when you eat the Bread, and drink of the Cup, you ſhew that you feed alone upon him, and that he is your Saviour. Indeed, Chriſt doth in effect ſay to you, Soul, <hi>take all this,</hi> in token that I
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59949:72"/>
have ſatisfied the Juſtice of God for thy Sins, I have made thy Peace; take this Bread, and this Cup as a Pledg of it, and of my Eternal Love to thee, and as a Token that all thy Sins are forgiven, and that thou art mine alſo. (1.) By this Ordinance we learn, and clearly ſee, the horible Evil of Sin, the curſed Nature of Sin, in that nothing could atone for it, nor ſatisfy the Law and Juſtice of God, but the precious Blood of the Son of God himſelf. (2.) Here likewiſe we ſee that infinite Love of the Father, in giving of Chriſt to die for us; <hi>He ſpared not his own</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note>

Moreover, here we ſee how we come to be ſaved, or the Way of Life; and that it is only by a Sacrifice, and that by the Sacrifice of Chriſt himſelf alone. (5.) Here we ſee our near Union with Chriſt, and bleſſed Union one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Bread and Wine is turned into Nouriſhment; the firſt is held forth: and as many Corns of Wheat do make one Loaſ, ſo we being many Members, are but one Body; and therein the latter Union is held forth alſo, I mean, our Union one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                        <hi>Thirdly. The Ordinance of Prayer,</hi> is alſo as a Paſture for Chriſt's Sheep to feed in. If we pray in Faith, we receive what we deſire <note place="margin">Prayer a rich Soul-Paſture.</note> and ſtand in need of: That Soul that goes to God in Chriſt's Name believingly, never comes away empty handed. <hi>We have not,</hi>

It argues we have not hungry Souls, if we have not praying Souls. You may as well live without eating, as ſpiritually live without praying; and as it is a ſign you are not well when you cannot eat, ſo it is a ſign your Souls are not well when you cannot pray: And as it is a ſign the Body is faint, when the Breath is ſhort, or breaths not freely ſo it is a ſign of a faint and languiſhing Chriſtian, when his Prayers are ſhort, or prays not freely. He that believes ſavingly, will pray ſervently. He that thrives not in this Paſture, will thrive in none. As be cannot live naturally that breaths not, no more can that Soul live ſpiritually that prays not. He that caſts off Prayer, caſts off God. No wonder God withholds Mercies from us, when we reſtrain Prayer

from him. Pure Prayer is only pleaſing to a pure God: our Prayers muſt be directed to the right Object; <hi>O thou that heareſt Prayer, to</hi>

                        <hi>thee ſhall all Men come.</hi> We muſt always direct our Prayers to God, but muſt not forget to come unto him by Jeſus Chriſt; and we muſt ſee to the Matter of it, as well as the Object: If we ask not that which is lawful, our Prayers muſt needs be unlawful; as it is a Sin to do any thing God commands not, ſo it is a Sin to ask any thing God allows not.</p>
                     <p>We muſt alſo be right in the Manner, as well as in the Matter of our Prayer: When our Spirit prays not, our Hand receives not.</p>
                     <p>And we muſt, if we would thrive in this Paſture, alſo ſee that our End be right: Our great End ſhould be, that our Prayer may be accepted, and God may be glorified.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing we ſhould ask in Prayer is, that the Name of God may <hi>be hallowed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O Soul, haſte into this Paſture: <hi>Whatſoever ye ask,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <note place="margin">John 14. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>in my Name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To pray in Chriſt's Name,<list>
                           <item>1. Is to know we come to have this Privilege to draw near to God, only by Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> through the Vail, that is to ſay, his Fleſh; he hath purchaſed us this Liberty.</item>
                           <item>2. 'Tis to pray in his Strength, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the Spirit, which he hath procured for us, and given to us.</item>
                           <item>3. 'Tis to pray in the Virtue of Chriſt's Mediation: Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ask on Earth, Chriſt obtains for us in Heaven.</item>
                           <item>4. To ask in Chriſt's Name, is to ask for his Sake, for his Worthineſs: 'Tis not what our Deſervings are, but what Chriſt's Merits are.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly. The Promiſes of God are another Paſture, where the Sheep</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are a rich Paſture for Chriſt's Sheep.</note> 
                        <hi>of Chriſt do daily feed.</hi> The Promiſes of God are of a Soul-faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Soul-ſtrengthning Nature: But there is no feeding here, without believing. A Sheep may as well feed on Graſs, without Teeth, as a Chriſtian can feed on the Promiſes without Faith. The Reaſon why the Soul cannot get into this rich Common, or rather fat Medow, is, becauſe he cannot get over the Slough of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. <hi>Man lives not by Bread alone, but by every Word that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 42. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>God, my Soul is caſt down within me; therefore I will remember thee from the Land of</hi> Jordan, <hi>and of the</hi> Hermonites, <hi>from the Hill</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar.

                        <hi>from the Paw of the Bear, and Paw of the Lion, will deliver me from this uncircumciſed Philiſtine.</hi> All Power is given into Chriſt's Hand, he is the great diſpoſer of all things; therefore be ſure he will order every thing for the Good of his Church. If not a Hair of our Heads ſhall fall without the Providence of God, we may conclude he will be concerned for us in greater Matters: And if he provide for <hi>Sparrows,</hi> he will provide and take care of his own Children.</p>
                     <p>The Covenant of Grace, the Love of Chriſt, and that Relation we ſtand in to him, muſt needs give us ground to believe he will, in his moſt wiſe Providence, order all things for our Good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the expreſs Promiſes he hath made upon that Account. Doth

                        <hi>Query.</hi> Methinks I hear ſome doubting Soul ſay, <hi>O that I could but experience this Spiritual Life to be in me! How may I know I am made alive, and have Eternal Life given to me?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. In anſwer to ſuch it is neceſſary to conſider, that all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity by Nature are ſpiritually dead in Sin, or under a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Life of God, until ſpiritually quickned and made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now as natural Death is made uſe of by the Spirit of God, to ſhew what ſpiritual Death is; ſo alſo natural Life is tropically made uſe of, to demonſtrate and diſcover ſpiritual Life.</p>
                     <p>A Man naturally dead,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Is cold; all Heat is gone, if long dead. So all unregenerate Perſons are ſpiritually Cold, or without any Divine Heat or Warmth in their Spirits; that Principle of internal Life Man had before he fell, being loſt and gone, he is cold as a Stone God ward, or in a ſpiritual Senſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Man naturally dead cannot move, all power of Motion and Activity, or all vital Actings are gone alſo. So in Men ſpiritually dead, there is a Diſability or Impotency unto all ſpiritual things to be performed in a ſpiritual manner; they can perform or act ſpiritually no Act of Life, or do any thing that is abſolutely accepted of him: <hi>The carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God; it is not</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7, 8.</note> 
                        <hi>ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.—So then they that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. A Man naturally dead cannot breath nor ſpeak, no more can carnal Men: Men ſpiritually dead breath forth their Deſires in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God, they have no Tongue to ſpeak for God, or to pray to God acceptably; all they do is dead Service, all their Prayers and Works, are dead Prayers, dead Works, becauſe performed from Perſons ſpiritually dead, and not from a Principle of Divine Life.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A dead Man can't <hi>feel, ſee,</hi> nor <hi>hear:</hi> No more can ſuch who are dead in Sin, they cannot feel ſpiritually, they have a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Burden, a mighty Weight of Sin, Guilt and Wrath lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, but feel it not: They are grievouſly wounded, but feel no pain, do not cry out; think they are well, and all nothing: They cannot ſee ſpiritual Objects, nor ſpiritual Things. Theſe Dead ſee not Jeſus Chriſt, ſee not his Beauty, his Glory; neither the Want of him, nor the Worth of him; the Eye of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is darkned, they have no Faith, which is the Eye of the new Creature: Nor can they hear in a ſpiritual Senſe, until,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59949:78"/>
like dead <hi>Lazarus,</hi> they hear Chriſt's voice by his Spirit, and are made alive.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Beauty of the Dead is gone, <hi>Death is gaſtly;</hi> ſo is the ſpiritual Beauty of the Soul gone, of thoſe who lie dead in Sin and Treſpaſſes.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Bodies of thoſe who are naturally dead, are fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, they ſoon ſtink, and therefore muſt be buried and put under the Ground, being loathſom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So ungodly Perſons who are ſpiritually dead, are loathſom in God's ſight, as <hi>filthy Carion,</hi> or a <hi>ſtinking Sepulchre</hi> is in ours, and are fit for nothing but to caſt into Hell, as abominable and hateful to the Holy <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. By theſe things therefore you may know, whether you are <note place="margin">How to know we are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally alive.</note> ſpiritually alive, or not; for if ſo, you are quickned and made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live by the Operations of the Spirit, and there is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Divine Life infuſed into your Souls: So that from a holy and new Nature, you can and do breath forth your Deſires freely and frequently to God, and ſee the excellency of ſpiritual Objects and Things; Chriſt is muſt precious and lovely in your ſight: Your Eyes ſee, and your Ears hear, and you have ſpiritual feeling, and you can and do act and move; that is, believe, repent, and obey God, with great Activity, and a ſtrong Propenſity, or gracious Inclinations of Heart: There is alſo much of the Beauty of Holineſs ſhining forth in your Lives.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This alſo by the way may ſerve to detect that Doctrine ſome, nay too many maintain, of the Power of the Creature: <note place="margin">Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected.</note> Alas, alas, what can the Dead do! For evident it is, that thoſe who are thus dead, have no Principle or firſt Power of living unto God, or to perform any Duty to be accepted of him: It is with them, as to all Acts and Ends of ſpiritual Life, as with the Body, as to the Acts and Ends of natural Life, when the Soul is departed from it; or elſe God would never ſay they are dead, call them <hi>dead.</hi> Does God make uſe of an improper Metaphor? Dare they affirm that? It muſt be ſo, if Man naturally be not dead, but wounded, in a ſpiritual Senſe only. True, a wicked Man is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally alive, and his Soul is in his Body, and he is endowed with <hi>Vnderſtanding, Will</hi> and <hi>Affection,</hi> and may perform many Duties God requires of him: But what of this? for in ſpiritual Life the Holy Ghoſt is unto the Soul, what the Soul is unto the Body, in reſpect of natural Life, namely, the quickning Principle. And (as a Learned Author well obſerves) to deny ſuch a quickning <note place="margin">

                        <pb n="147" facs="tcp:59949:78"/>
Principle of ſpiritual Life, ſuperadded unto us by the Grace of Chriſt, diſtinct and ſeparate from the natural Faculties of the Soul, is upon the Matter to renounce the whole Goſpel: It is all one as to deny that <hi>Adam</hi> was created in the <hi>Image of God,</hi> which he loſt, and that we are renewed unto the <hi>Image of God</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> They may alſo as well aſſert, Man hath a creating Power; for Regeneration is called the <hi>New Creature,</hi> which <hi>is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17. Eph. 1. 18, 19, 20.</note> 
                        <hi>in us after the Image of God,</hi> according to his own glorious Power.</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Therefore whatſoever Sinners act in ſpiritual Things, by their Underſtanding, Will or Affections, that are not renewed, they do it naturally, and not ſpiritually, and are therefore called <hi>dead Works.</hi> We may alſo from hence infer, what a mighty Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Favour it is to be made ſpiritually alive. How ſhould ſuch admire God, and his Free Grace in Jeſus Chriſt; for as they have an internal holy Life, ſo they ſhall never die, but have eternal Life; nay, that this Eternal Life is begun in them here: <hi>I give them Eternal Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to proceed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly.</hi> I am to ſhew how Salvation, or Everlaſting Life is a free <note place="margin">Salvation a free Gift.</note> Gift, or by Grace only.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Life and Salvation is of Grace in oppoſition to Nature, we have it not as the Product of Nature: <hi>Which were born, not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God.</hi> To <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 13.</note> be born, ſignifies to receive a Principle of Life; and thoſe that are the Children of God, have not that ſpiritual Life that is in them, from the Motions or Powers of Nature; not from the Power of Man's Will, nor from their fleſhly or natural Parts and Abilities, however improved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Life and Salvation is wholly of Grace, or a free Gift, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Merit; we cannot purchaſe or procure it by our Acts of Obedience: <hi>By Grace are ye ſaved through Faith, and that not</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 8, 9. Tit. 3. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>of your ſelves; it is the Gift of God: not of Works,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Not by Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his Mercy he ſaved us.</hi> Not the deſert of our Works, let them be what they will, either before or after Grace, but from God's own ſovereign Mercy and Goodneſs, whoſe Bowels yerned towards his Elect in Miſery: <hi>For the VVages of Sin is Death; but the Gift of God is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>Life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Death Natural, Death Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and Death Eternal, are the Wages and Deſert of Sin:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59949:79"/>
And who will deny a Servant his Wages? Wicked Men are the Servants of Sin, and they ſhall have their Wages. But though Death is the Wages or Merit of Sin, yet Eternal Life is not the Wages of our good Works; no, but the Gift of God, through the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt: It is not by our Works, or for our Worthineſs. The Apoſtle, as our <hi>Annotators</hi> note, varies the Phraſe, on purpoſe to ſhew that Salvation is wholly of God's Grace, and not of our own Merits: 'Tis of Grace, or the Gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt, that is, through his Merits, <hi>De gratia &amp; libero arbitrio,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Life and Salvation is by Grace only, or the free Gift of God, in oppoſition to the Law: The Law could not give Life, that could not ſave us: <hi>For had there been a Law given that could have given</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>Life, verily Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law.</hi> The Law requires perfect Obedience, and lays every one under the Curſe, <hi>that continues not in all things that is written therein to do them.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 10.</note> Therefore no Life by the Law; that <hi>being weak through the Fleſh,</hi> Man could not perfectly fulfil it, and ſo could have no Life by it. <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Life and Salvation is the free Gift of God, in oppoſition to any acceptable Service done for it, by us; as ſome times great Gifts are beſtowed on Perſons for the ſake of ſome ſmall Service performed for them: But it is not ſo here, though Salvation be a Reward of Grace, yet it is not given for the ſake of any accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Service done by us; we know that a ſmall Matter ſometimes purchaſes that which is of great Value; but nothing we do, or can do, can purchaſe Life and Salvation for our Souls. True, Eternal Life is a Purchaſe, it is a Reward of Merit; but O miſtake me not, it is not of our purchaſing, it is no Reward for any Work done by us, but it is the Purchaſe of Jeſus Chriſt, the Reward of his Work, by his fulfilling of the Righteouſneſs of the Law for us in our Nature, in his holy and ſpotleſs Life, and by his ſatisfying the Juſtice of God for our breaking and violating of his Holy Law, which he did by the painful and curſed Death of his Croſs: <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Fleſh,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, and for Sin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Sin in the Fleſh; that the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> That the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us, that is, in our Head, Surety, and Repreſentative; for though we in our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were utterly unable to do it, yet Chriſt having done it in our
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59949:79"/>
Behalf, and Nature, it is accepted, as if we had done it our ſelves, Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and Obedience being imputed to us who do believe: ſo that what he did and ſuffered, is accounted unto us as if we had done and ſuffered it; yet it was Chriſt that purchaſed Life, not we; he purchaſed, and we poſſeſs; he is the Redeemer, <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 24, 25.</note> we are the Redeemed; he merited all, and we have all freely of Grace through his Merits, or through that Redemption that is in his Blood.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Life and Salvation is a free Gift, or of Grace only, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear yet further, becauſe the Foundation thereof laid from before all Worlds, in God's eternal Election, was the Spring of it; and this was alone of God's own free Grace: <hi>There is a Remnant accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>to the Election of Grace. And if it be of Grace, then it is no more of Works, otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace. But if it be of Works, then it is no more of Grace, otherwiſe Works are no more Works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Oppoſition or Contrariety is not only between Grace and legal Works, but between Grace and all manner of Works whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; becauſe it lies betwixt the Nature of Grace and Works, they are repugnant or contrary the one to the other, they can no more be the Cauſes or Motive of any one Action, than one individual thing can be White and Black in the ſame part, as a worthy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter notes. Men are not elected partly of Grace and partly of Works foreſeen, but wholly of Grace; nothing but an Act of God's Sovereign Grace was the Cauſe and Motive of it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Life and Salvation is a free Gift, or by Grace only, becauſe the Glorious Covenant between the Father and the Son, made and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into before the World began, was alone of God's Grace, of his infinite Grace and Favour: God was at liberty (who foreſeeing Man's Fall and horrible Tranſgreſſion, he having forfeited all thoſe Bleſſings beſtowed originally upon him) whether he would or would not afford him any Help or Relief, but might have juſtly and utterly rejected the whole Race of Mankind, as he rejected all the Angels that ſinned, or kept not their firſt Eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Did Man, fallen Man, deſerve this Love, this Favour, who was become an Enemy to God? Was there any thing in Man that could be a Motive to move the Almighty to enter into this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to ſave ſo vile a Creature, ſuch a poor and deſpicable a Creature as Man became by his Sins, the Viſage of his very Soul being now loathſom, deformed, and abominable in the ſight of God, God's holy Image being utterly defaced, and all his Beauty gone, being beſmeared and covered all over with noiſom Filthineſs
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59949:80"/>
and Pollution, filled with Enmity and Hatred againſt God; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throning his bleſſed Creator, and ſetting up the Devil in his Place; ſubjecting himſelf to that implacable Enemy of his, and caſting off his moſt holy and gracious Sovereign from whence he received his Breath and Being.</p>
                     <p>Nay, and in reſpect of God himſelf, it muſt needs appear to be wholly of Grace; could Redemption of Man add any thing to the eſſential Glory of God? Did he ſtand in need of Man to make him more happy or glorious in himſelf, who being an independent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had been eternally happy in the Injoyment of himſelf, had Man never been made, or had he left him under Wrath and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery? Or was he obliged to ſave us, and that he might do it, to ſend his own Son to die, and be made a Curſe for us? Or could he not have created other Creatures to have ſhewed forth his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Perfections? Or why might he not have ſent his Son to have taken hold of the Nature of Angels to have redeemed them, (who were his Creatures as well as fallen Man, and more glorious too than Man before they fell) and let Man have periſhed for ever, and not have entred into ſuch a Covenant of Grace with his own Son on his Behalf?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Life and Salvation therefore is a free Gift; it is wholly of Grace, becauſe we could not have obtained it unleſs God ſent his Son out of his own Boſom to effect it. The giving of Chriſt, and the Father's ſending of him into the World, is nothing but an Act of his own free Grace: <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only</hi>

                     <p>So that it appears Eternal Life, from the firſt to the laſt, is wholly of Grace, both the Author of it, the Means of it, and the End thereof, all is of Grace: Heaven it ſelf is the Gift of Grace; <hi>Fear not, little Flock; it is your Father's good Pleaſure to give you the</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To proceed to the Grounds of the Point, I ſhall give <note place="margin">Why Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of Grace.</note> you the Reaſons why Eternal Life is the Gift of Chriſt, or of the free Grace of God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is becauſe Sin and Death cannot be removed out of the Way to Life, but only by Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo by Grace only. The Law of God is broke, and <hi>Juſtice</hi> calls for Wrath and Vengeance to be executed upon the Tranſgreſſor. <hi>Juſtice</hi> muſt be ſatisfied, but Man cannot make a Compenſation for the Violation of God's Holy Law, nor will God acquit the Sinner unleſs that be done; the Law is but an Impreſſion of God's Holy Nature, it reſulted not from a bare Act of his Sovereignty, but from his Holineſs and perfect Rectitude of his bleſſed Nature. If Man could have attained to Life by any Works of Obedience done by him, Chriſt died in vain; and if it had conſiſted with the Wiſdom and Holineſs of God to have accepted of imperfect Obedience, provided it had been ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, he could at firſt have given Man ſuch a Law, and ſo have ſaved the Life of his Son. For any therefore to affirm that God accepteth ſinful Man for the ſake of his imperfect (though ſincere) Obedience, it is to aſſert, in effect, that he accepted of ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and polluted Acts as a Recompence and Satisfaction for other ſinful Acts and Deeds of Darkneſs; for all our beſt Services are unclean in themſelves. <hi>Paul</hi> accounted all his own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but Dung, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides, the Obedience under the Goſpel which God requires, is to be performed in the higheſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection imaginable; <hi>Be ye Perfect, as your Father in Heaven is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 48.</note> The Law of the Goſpel is the ſame in Nature with the Moral
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59949:81"/>
Law, therefore (if it may be called a Law) it is a perfect Law; we are ſtill commanded to love <hi>the Lord our God with all our Hearts, with all our Souls, and with all our Strength;</hi> yea, and to live and ſin not. <hi>Little Children, theſe things write I unto you, that ye ſin not.</hi> Our Faith, <note place="margin">1 John 2. 1.</note> Love, and Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to be perfect; the Law or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Goſpel know no Bounds nor Limits; <hi>Vntil we all</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>come in the Vnity of the Faith, and of the Knowledg of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the Fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> It would therefore be a Work becoming the <hi>New-Lawyers</hi> to ſhew where the Commands lie in the Goſpel, that God's Law only requires ſincere Obedience unto; the Law certainly loſes no part of its Sanction by the Goſpel, that is as <hi>Holy, Juſt</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> as ever, and a perpetual Rule of Life and Obedience: "Therefore (as a reverend Perſon Notes)<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>J. C.</hi>
                        </note> either the Goſpel-Law, or Law of Faith, muſt require Perfection of Obedience in theſe Duties, or ſome other Divine Law, or elſe God would become an indulger of Sin, by Law: if it be by another Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the Moral, that requires perfect Obedience, and this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere only, then theſe Laws differ but in Degree, not in <hi>Specie</hi> or Kind; becauſe both require the ſame Duties or Works; and ſo this Goſpel-Law would be no diſtinct Law, but only the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſincere Obedience would receive a new uſe; which we own it has, to wit, to be an <hi>Index</hi> and Mark of our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tho we cannot own that uſe of its giving Right," <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to proceed, (ſaith he) "a diſtinct Law they muſt hold, or quit their Cauſe, or this Foundation of it; for the Text ſets the Law of Faith down as an oppoſite Law to that of Works, and that they hold. Then if it be a perfect Law, requiring perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, there is no poſſibility of Juſtification in this Life. <hi>Poppius</hi> the <hi>Arminian</hi> grants the Concluſion, that our Obedience muſt be conſummate before our Aſſurance; and others diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a compleat and partial Juſtification, the former is not, they ſay, until the Day of Judgment. But this is not all the Difficulty, for it's the adding a Load to a Burden: Is this Goſpel, to a Man that is unable to perform the leaſt part of the Moral Law, to tell him, that God, or the Mediator, requires perfect Obedience to it for the future, and another too? Or is this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to ſay, you ſhall periſh eternally, and have the Fire of Hell ſeven times heated, if you obey not this Goſpel? It's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a conditional Hell, but it is more dreadful than the Fire of Hell; and the Condition is more impoſſible, becauſe we have
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59949:82"/>
leſs power to ſhun this Difficulty of two perfect Laws. Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> owns no other perfect Law but this Goſpel, ſince Man fell: but by ſhunning one Difficulty, he falls into two as great; (1.) Then the Moral Law is abrogated, beſides the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Doctrine it ſelf; for it is impoſſible that ſhould ceaſe to be our Duty, to love God with all our Heart and Soul. What Advantage brings Chriſt's Death, to abrogate one perfect Law, and eſtabliſh another? here is little Goſpel. A ſecond Difficulty is, we muſt either ſay Chriſt has purchaſed to us Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for Sins againſt the Goſpel-Law, or none at all, but that one Sin of <hi>Adam</hi>'s, if the Moral Law be abrogated; after the Fall we never ſinned againſt any Law but the Goſpel, for we were under no other Law according to him," <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Sum of that I drive at is this, <hi>viz.</hi> There is a neceſſity we muſt be juſtified and ſaved by Grace only, becauſe we cannot be ſaved by a Law of Obedience, but by Chriſt and Grace alone: If we ſly not to Chriſt by truſting, believing, and depending on him, and the Grace of God in him, who hath ſatisfied the Juſtice and Law of God for us, and brought in Everlaſting Righteouſneſs, the Law of God will cut us down and throw us into Hell for ever.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is by Grace alone that we are ſaved, becauſe all boaſting is excluded, and cauſe of boaſting. And this is the Deſign of God in the Goſpel. <hi>viz.</hi> That Man might not have whereof to glory, but in the Lord alone: Nor could this be done any other way, but by his contriving our Salvation to be wholly by his own free Grace. <hi>Where is boaſting then? it is excluded; by what Law? of Works; nay, but by the Law of Faith, not of Works, leſt any Man ſhould boaſt.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 3, 24.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is only by Grace that we are ſaved, or Eternal Life is the free Gift of God, and Gift of Chriſt; becauſe he will have all the <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 8, 9.</note> Glory of it: God will not give the Glory of our Salvation unto others. <hi>Having predeſtinated us to the Adoption of Children by Jeſus</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 5, 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Chriſt according to the good Pleaſure of his Will, to the Praiſe of the Glory of his Grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is by Grace only becauſe God would magnify his Son, by whoſe Righteouſneſs and Obedience imputed to us, we are juſtified and ſaved: and it is to this end I ſay, that God might exalt Jeſus Chriſt; his Deſign was, to magnify Chriſt in our Salvation, and to abaſe Man: <hi>Thou haſt given him Power over all Fleſh, that he</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhould give Eternal Life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:59949:82"/>
5. And laſtly, It is by Grace, becauſe God would have Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſure to all Believers: <hi>Therefore it is of Faith that it might be</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>by Grace, to the end the Promiſe might be ſure to all the Seed,</hi> &amp;c. If Salvation were by our Works and Obedience, it might be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; or if the whole of our Happineſs and Eternal Life be not in Chriſt's Hand, but that it dependeth on the Will of Man, or on the condition of our Faith and Holineſs, or in the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Abilities; and it is poſſible that we may, or may not anſwer the Condition thereof; it might ſo fall out, that not one Soul might be ſaved: Beſides, ſhould it be ſo, thoſe that are ſaved, would then have ſomething to glory in, or boaſt of in the Great Day: They in effect may thank themſelves, and admire their own Wiſdom, Care and Induſtry, that brought them to Heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Why doth and will Chriſt give Eternal Life to all his Sheep, to all his Saints?</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe Eternal Life was purchaſed for them by his Death: <hi>But by his own Blood he entred once into the Holy Place, having</hi>

They aſſert, that all Men have Power to believe, and that that Grace which God affords to Men to ſave them, 'tis in the preaching of the Word, or conſiſteth in no more than <hi>Moral Swaſions, Arguments,</hi> or <hi>Excitements,</hi> in a <hi>rational way.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Light, Power, or Moral Grace, (as they call it) be Natural or Supernatural, Mediate or Immediate, they do not ſeem well to accord about it. Some of them (as one obſerves) ſay, the Power of Natural Reaſon, or the Exerciſe of Human Credence, is ſufficient to a Man, being convinced of the Truth of the Goſpel, or of the Declaration of God's Love and Grace in Chriſt, ſo that he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59949:83"/>
may believe as eaſily as to believe any other Matter upon infallible Teſtimony. Others call it a Gift, or the Light of the Spirit, which all Men have; yet if thorowly examined, it is no more than a Natural Gift, Light or Ability: That it is the ſpecial Grace of God, or Illumination of the Holy Spirit, is not granted, but denied by theſe Men, it being no other Grace or Power, than is afforded equally to thoſe who periſh, as to ſuch who are ſaved. It is not ſuch Grace or Operations of the Spirit that infuſes holy Habits, which determines the <hi>Will,</hi> or inclines it to Good, but ſuch Excitements that only awaken and rouſe its Native Power; it is ſuch Grace that the <hi>Will</hi> may receive, or refuſe the whole Efficacy of it; (ſo far as I can gather) it lies not in its own Nature, nor from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Operations of God's Spirit, but from the <hi>Will</hi> of Man.</p>
                     <p>Now how contrary this is to the Truth of the Goſpel, and all the Experiences of renewed and gracious Perſons, I leave to their conſiderations: yet to detect and condemn theſe Notions, I ſhall add a word or two before I conclude.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Can a dead Man quicken himſelf, or be raiſed to Life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a vital Principle be infuſed into him? Will Moral Swaſions bring a dead Man to Life?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hath Man a Power, naturally in him, exceeding the Power of Satan? Or is he ſtronger than that <hi>ſtrong Man armed?</hi> Or are not all Men naturally under the Power of the Prince of Darkneſs, he <hi>taking them Captive at his Will?</hi> Let this be conſidered, for ſeeing <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2, 26.</note> God's Word doth poſitively declare this to be the State of all Men by Nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they are under Satan's Power; what ſignifies that which they affirm? Will Satan be perſwaded to releaſe and <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 29. Mark 3. 27. Luk. 11. 21. Eph. 1. 18, 19, 20.</note> let go his Captives, which he holds down in ſtrong Bonds and Chains? Or doth not our Saviour expreſly intimate, he will keep all his Goods in ſecurity until a ſtronger than he comes, and binds him, and deveſts him of his Power?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Is not Faith ſaid to be the Gift of God; and not only ſo, but that we believe according to the working of God's Almighty Power, and after the ſame manner that he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the Dead?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Is not the <hi>Carnal Mind enmity againſt God,</hi> having in it an utter Averſeneſs and Moral Impotency to do that which is ſpiritually Good? for <hi>it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can</hi>

It muſt be left indifferent as to either: Grace turns not the Scales, but leaves the <hi>Will</hi> an equal poiſe that the <hi>Will of Man,</hi> not the Grace of God may have the caſting weight; if Grace ſhould weigh it down, the Liberty of the <hi>Will,</hi> they ſay, would be violated and in nature deſtroyed."</p>
                     <p>Is this the Doctrine of general Love which they will have to be in God to Mankind? <hi>viz.</hi> Hath the Lord left it indifferent in his Eternal Purpoſe, whether any ſhould be ſaved, or no? For if the <hi>Will</hi> complies not, God will not bend it, or bring it, by irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Grace, in a Phyſical Way, to a Compliance: and though Chriſt, in redemption, according to them, died for all, yet he hath left it indifferent whether any ſhould be actually redeemed, or no; for the depraved <hi>Will</hi> of Man determines the whole Event of all that which Chriſt hath done, and the Goſpel, or the Spirit doth do: and if ſome Men were not better natured, and more conſiderate than others, Chriſt might have died in vain. And it follows alſo that ſuch who are ſaved, have more cauſe to admire their <hi>Wills compliance</hi> in believing, than to exalt and admire the free Grace of God, if what they ſay be true. Alas, this general Love of God they talk of, (that is but an indifferent reſpect to all or any, for all are beloved alike, or elſe God is a reſpecter of Perſons,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59949:84"/>
they ſay) ends in Love or Hatred, as the Sinner's <hi>Will</hi> determines it: If the <hi>Will</hi> accepts, chuſes and yields to Chriſt, then the Perſon is beloved and choſen by Him; but if the <hi>Will</hi> refuſes, (as the <hi>Will</hi> of every Mortal might, as well as one, according to their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) then he is hated: Whatever particular Love they aſcribe to God, it is no other than what riſes or is occaſioned from the Sinner's Love to him. God foreſaw that ſuch and ſuch Perſons would believe and love him, therefore purpoſed to ſave them: he foreſaw that they would embrace, chuſe, and love Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he loved them and choſe them to Eternal Life; provided they continue their Good-liking and Affections to God unto the End. How they will be able to deliver themſelves from theſe and ſuch like Conſequents from attending their Notions, I ſee not. The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us;</hi> and that <note place="margin">1 John 4. 19.</note> we have not choſen him, but he hath choſen us: But certainly if theſe Men conſider their Principles, when they ſpeak of particular Perſons, they muſt ſay, he did not love us firſt, but we loved him; and that he did not choſe us firſt, but we choſe him. And thus the Doctrine of <hi>God's Free Grace</hi> is trampled upon; but <hi>let God be true, and every Man a Liar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But doth not this Doctrine of ſpecial Grace, render God unmerciful, becauſe he doth not give that Grace unto all Men that is effectual to their Salvation?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, We do not deny that God gives that Grace to all, which they ſay is ſufficient or effectual to ſave all; our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine robs no Man of that Power they have but we do deny that common Light, Grace, and Abilities are ſufficient to ſave any one Soul: And if this be true, it follows that they render God more unmerciful than they are aware of, in that they will not have God to afford ſuch Grace that is ſufficient, <hi>viz.</hi> Special Grace to any at all. Certainly if God was not more merciful to them that aſſert this Doctrine, than their Notions import, or did not their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences contradict their Principles, it would be impoſſible one of them ſhould be ſaved: For will <hi>meer moral Swaſive Grace,</hi> (which leaves Salvation to the choice of Man's depraved and unrenewed Will, whether it will turn to God or no, believe in Chriſt or no) ſave one Soul? which they ſay is all the Grace God vouchſafes to any. So that by their Doctrine, none can be ſaved, but all muſt unavoidably periſh.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, how unjuſt do they render God to be, ſeeing he, as they ſay, gave Chriſt to die for all Men, with an intention to ſave them,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59949:85"/>
and this without any deſert of Man, which is the greater Gift; and yet he denies the Goſpel to the greateſt part of the World, nay and effectual Grace to many (nay to all, according to them) that attend upon the Adminiſtration thereof, ſeeing he could as eaſily bend or incline the Wills (if he pleaſe) of ſuch who do not believe, as he doth theirs that do believe. Strange! did Chriſt ſpill his Blood for the greateſt part of Mankind in vain? nay, die in their ſtead for them, that he foreknew would reject him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not? Did he give Millions for them to redeem them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one Pound to make that Redemption effectual to them, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to give them a Right to it, and Intereſt in it? What! give them the greater, and deny them the leſſer Gift? But how contrary is this to what <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>If when we were Enemies, we were reconciled to</hi>

                        <hi>Secondly.</hi> If Life Spiritual and Eternal be by Grace, or if it is given freely by Jeſus Chriſt; Then all that have not this Gift given to them, Life given, Grace given, are ſpiritually dead: and if they die naturally before it is given to them, they muſt periſh for ever, or die eternally.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew you, by way of Premiſe, that the Saints, or Sheep of Chriſt may fall, yea, fall from Grace; and alſo how far they may fall: and then proceed to demonſtrate the Truth of the Propoſition, and prove, <hi>That they cannot fall finally, ſo as eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to periſh.</hi>

ſtrong Party for him, and ſiding with him in our own Bowels, or within us. This inbred Enemy always lies in wait to betray us; and if we take not the more care, will prevail againſt us, and at one time or another trip up our Heels, eſpecially that Sin which doth chiefly beſet us; moſt Chriſtians having their Conſtitution-Sin, though no godly Man hath a beloved Sin: yea, the Seed of all Sin ſtill remains in our baſe Hearts, and hence it is our Danger is great which appears may be not ſo clearly, till the Providence of God brings us unto ſuch a State, Occaſion or Company, whereby Satan hath an Opportunity to excite and ſtir up, or draw forth that Sin or evil Seed into act that lies hid within us.</p>

Let Chriſtians take heed they are not out of ſuch Employment that God calls them to, and not put an Opportunity into Satan's Hand, by exceſs of Eating, Drinking, or Idleneſs, or by gadding or gazing Abroad, like <hi>Dinah, Jacob</hi>'s Daughter; and beware how they neglect any ſpiritual Duty, in the way of which God hath promiſed to keep our Souls.</p>

when in the true Exerciſe thereof, to preſerve his whole Soul from Evil; but let this Shield go, and Satan quickly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails: If Satan can perſwade a Man there is no ſuch Evil in Sin as God's Word declares, or that it is no great matter, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he is overcome.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Evil of the Sins of God's People are ſo great, God is grievouſly diſhonoured by the Falls and groſs Enormities of his Saints.

                     <p n="2">2. The Sins and Falls of God's People, hinder the ſpreading and bleſſed Promulgation of the Goſpel. It makes the Souls of thoſe who ſtand faſt to mourn, and the Hearts of the Wicked to rejoice, and to inſult over them who always watch for their halting.</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Another Reaſon of theſe Cautions may be, becauſe there are many falſe Profeſſors in Churches who may fall finally: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from theſe and other Reaſons it appears.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. We may alſo infer from hence, that the Reaſon why ſome fall quite away, is, becauſe their Hearts were never upright with God.</p>

Let us bewail our ſelves upon the account of Indwelling Sin, for oft-times it wounds our Souls, it breaks our Bones, deſtroys our Peace, ſpoils our Communion with the Father and the Son, and brings Fears and Doubts upon us about our State, when we are overcome thereby, covering us with Clouds and Darkneſs.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall premiſe one or two things before I proceed to confirm this Argument.</p>
                     <p n="1">

1. That God ſet up Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator from Everlaſting, as the Head and Spring of our Election; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>We were choſen in him before the Foundation of the World.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> It was the only Act of Love, and Free Grace of the Father, therefore not to be aſcribed to the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt: For though Chriſt hath merited our Salvation, yet he did not procure or merit our Election; for Chriſt himſelf was the Fruit of this Eternal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Privilege, it being then the ſole Act of God's Sovereign Grace and Love. It follows,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That all the Ways which were ordered in the Wiſdom of God, for the accompliſhing the Ends of Election, are of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's appointment alſo; for whatſoever Chriſt hath done in working out of our Redemption, it was according to the Purpoſe and Determinate Counſel of his own Will and Sovereign Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Jeſus Chriſt was firſt choſen, or elected, by the Father, as Head and Mediator, and only Foundation to bear up the whole Building, which the Almighty deſigned to raiſe: The Father's Love, did precede Chriſt's glorious Miſſion; therefore he was only of the Father's Deſignation; <hi>Who verily was fore-ordained before the Foundation of the World, but was made manifeſt in theſe laſt Days.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 19.</note> Chriſt was firſt choſen as the Well-head of Grace and Glory, and then others were choſen in him, by and through whom they ſhould be redeemed and raiſed to a State of Grace and Holineſs here, and to Eternal Happineſs in Heaven hereafter: <hi>For whom he did foreknow, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son, that he might be the Firſt-born among many Brethren.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note> To the Image of his Son, that is, to Chriſt's likeneſs as Mediator, and taking our Nature; not to Chriſt barely conſidered as God, for as Chriſt is God, he is no where ſaith to be <hi>the Firſt-born among many Brethren.</hi> Now this Conformity being abſolutely deſigned in Election, Chriſt, in the Contrivance and Intention of the Father, was the firſt Exemplar and Copy of it, or the main Center, to which all muſt be brought that were given unto him; the Father ſetting him up, and electing him as Head of all that ſhould be ſaved, or as the glorious Bridegroom, and therefore it was requiſite he ſhould be conſulted about thoſe who were to be the Members of his Body, and his own bleſſed Spouſe for ever: And ſince Chriſt was alſo to ſuffer and undergo ſuch Pain and Sorrow in the purchaſing and redeeming of them, it was neceſſary he ſhould not only freely aſſent and conſent in the Choice of them, but alſo be certain of the obtaining and ſecuring them all to and for himſelf for ever, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59949:90"/>
not run the Hazard of injoying or not injoying of them; which muſt follow he did, if the Doctrine of ſome Men of dark Minds were true.</p>
                     <p>To proceed, it may not be amiſs to conſider what is contained <note place="margin">The firſt Argument explained.</note> in the Bowels of my firſt Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is a peculiar People, or ſome certain Perſons (as perſonally conſidered) of the loſt Children of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> who are Elected or Choſen of God, in Chriſt, from all Eternity, of his own Sovereign Grace and good Pleaſure, ordained unto Everlaſting Life; and that this Decree of Election doth prevent their final falling, or make it impoſſible that any of them ſhould ever ſo <hi>apoſtatize</hi> as eternally to periſh.</p>
                     <p>The Argument being thus fairly ſtated, it calls upon me to do two things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> To prove that there is ſuch <hi>a particular</hi> and <hi>perſonal Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>a peculiar People</hi> of the <hi>loſt Sons of</hi> Adam.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> To ſhew how this prevents their <hi>final falling,</hi> and makes it <hi>impoſſible</hi> that any of them ſhould ever ſo <hi>apoſtatize</hi> as eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to periſh.</p>
                     <p>A little to open the firſt of theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I ſay of <hi>peculiar Perſons,</hi> which denotes it belonging to them only and to none elſe; others are paſſed by, or not afforded by any ſuch Divine Act of Grace the like Privilege: they are God's <hi>Jewels,</hi> or his <hi>peculiar Treaſure,</hi> though until called and cleanſed, or <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 17.</note> their inward Filth and Pollution purged away, they cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in by him, or be beloved with a <hi>Love of Complacency;</hi> though from Eternity God did love all his, with a Love of <hi>good Will, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> of Grace and of <hi>Benevolence.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>They were choſen in Chriſt;</hi> in the Mediator, in their Bleſſed Head, that their ſtanding might be ſecured through their Union with him, and his Righteouſneſs being imputed to them, according to God's Eternal Purpoſe.</p>

And further, to make good the firſt Part of what I have <note place="margin">Particular Election proved.</note> laid down, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is ſuch a particular Election; what lies more clear in the Word of God, and the Election of <hi>Jacob,</hi> I ſhall here firſt mention, as a full Proof of what I ſay; <hi>For the</hi>

                        <hi>Children being not yet Born, neither having done Good or Evil, that the Purpoſe of God, according to Election might ſtand, not of Works, but of him that calleth.</hi> Here the Apoſtle deſignedly or on purpoſe confirms, not only the Doctrine of <hi>Perſonal Election,</hi> but alſo that of Preterition, of a paſſing by, or rejection of the other; and all reſulting from the Eternal Purpoſe and Good Pleaſure of God's Will; <hi>As it is written,</hi> Jacob <hi>have I loved, but</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 13.</note> The main ſcope of <hi>Paul</hi> in this place is to ſhew, that God hath not caſt off all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, thoſe who are the true <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or ſuch who are the Children of the Promiſe, or that do belong to Chriſt according to the Election of Grace; ſee 5, 6, 7, 8 Verſes: therefore they that run the Love of God and Election here ſpoken of, to the Poſterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and Reprobation to the Poſterity of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and will not have it to be underſtood of their particular Perſons, do palpably abuſe the ſacred Text and Drift of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.

                     </p>
                     <p>Unto theſe Teſtimonies I ſhall add one or two more; as that of <hi>Paul,</hi> touching the Saints at <hi>Theſſalonica; Knowing, Brethren belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, your Election: For our Goſpel came not to you in VVord only, but</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 1. 4, 5.</note> 
                        <hi>alſo in Power, and in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. By the evident Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God's Spirit, the Apoſtle knew they were elected: We cannot know our Election, but by ſpecial Vocation, or as it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the Fruits and Effects of it. There is a Knowledg of Things, (as our Annotators note on this place) <hi>à priori,</hi> when we argue from the Cauſe to the Effect: So <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> when we argue from the Effect to the Cauſe. Now what is Election, but a chuſing ſome out of others? Thus the Angels that ſtand were <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>elected,</hi> and the reſt were left to the Power they had, or paſſed by, or reprobated. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo confirms the Doctrine of perſonal Election,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59949:92"/>
calling the Perſons to whom he wrote his Epiſtle, <hi>Elect according to</hi>

The Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are concerned in our Salvation; the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther elects,</hi> this is principally aſcribed to the <hi>firſt Perſon</hi> in the Godhead; the <hi>Son purchaſeth,</hi> he redeems; and the <hi>Holy Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news,</hi> calls, and ſanctifies. Now the Purchaſe of the Son extends no further than the Election of the Father; nor the Sanctification of the Spirit, further than the Purchaſe or Redemption of the Son: Sanctification here, takes in the whole Work of the Holy Spirit in Regeneration and actual Holineſs, to the final ſitting and making the Soul meet for the Eternal Inheritance.</p>

Thus God may as juſtly another Day reply upon thoſe who think to excuſe their lewd and wicked Lives, their unbelief and contempt of his Word, from their not being Elected, and not having Power of themſelves to believe and repent, not receiving his efficacious Grace; <hi>O ye wicked and ſlothful Wretches.</hi> May he not ſay, did ye ſuſpect or fear you were not elected? Why did you not then give all diligence to attend upon the Means, and to make your Calling ſure, as all they do that are elected? Do you plead the Power of your own Wills, to repent one while, and that you wanted Power at another time, and that I gave you not my ſpecial Grace?

                     <p>But it is not ſo here, God foreſaw all future Events, his Mind alters not; he is of one Mind, and who can turn him? And none <note place="margin">Job 23. 13.</note> can hinder him in the accompliſhing of his own Eternal Purpoſe; <hi>For the Lord of Hoſts hath purpoſed, and who ſhall diſannul it?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Declaring from the Beginning, and from Ancient Times.—My Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi>

                     <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> It is, becauſe they are choſen or elected in Chriſt, in an <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> immutable, an unchangeable, and an Eternal Head. What was the Reaſon <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood not, notwithſtanding his Power and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities were ſuch? Why he ſtood not in Chriſt, was not fixed on Chriſt; but all true Believers are in Chriſt, choſen in him, he is the Head of the Eternal Election, as Mediator. In Election he is
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59949:94"/>
to be conſidered as the Head; and all the Father hath given him, as the Members of his Body, <hi>choſen in him,</hi> and <hi>united to him:</hi> Therefore their ſtanding in Chriſt, by virtue of Election, is like that of the Election of their Head. Now can Chriſt ceaſe being an Elect Head? Every one will ſay, No, that is impoſſible: No more can they ceaſe from being Elect Members. This of Election in Chriſt, preſuppoſeth an Union; and there was a decretive Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Eternity, and that influenced their actual Union in Time: and as certainly as Chriſt died, roſe again, and aſcended, (in the fulneſs of Time) who was decretively <hi>a Lamb ſtain before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World,</hi> ſo will God's Decree of Election in Chriſt as certainly bring in all the Elect into actual Union with Chriſt, and carry them all to Heaven, (whither their Head, as <hi>the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner</hi>

                     <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> That the Saints of God, or Sheep of Jeſus Chriſt, by virtue of their Election, cannot fall away ſo as to periſh for ever, doth appear evident from one or two expreſs Scriptures; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>We know all things work together for Good to them that love God, who are the Called according to his Purpoſe. For whom he did foreknow, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son, that he might be the Firſt-born among many Brethren. Moreover whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called; and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi> See here, and I beſeech you conſider it, and weigh it well, for this Text is enough to convince (one would think) all the Oppoſers of this glorious Truth in the World, or ſilence them for ever: The Apoſtle begins the Happineſs and eternal Salvation of all that ſhall be ſaved, and the certainty of it in Election, <hi>Whom he did foreknow;</hi> that is, whom he in his good Pleaſure did <hi>pitch upon,</hi> or think good to give to his Son, to be his Spouſe, or Members of his Myſtical Body; <hi>he alſo did predeſtinate</hi> them, and all them, them, and none but them; he elected, choſe, or appointed them, to <hi>be conformed to the Image of his Son,</hi> that is, in Holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but more of that by and by: and whom he ſo <hi>predeſtinated,</hi> or elected, <hi>he called,</hi> and them he juſtified, and them and every one of them he glorified, or will ſo call, juſtify and glorify. This is that place of Scripture which is called by ſome, the <hi>Golden Chain,</hi> by others the <hi>Chain of Salvation;</hi> and it may very well be ſo called: nothing can be more clear than this, <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe who are elected, ſhall
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59949:95"/>
be called, juſtified, and be all as certainly glorified. 'Tis not in the Power of all the Enemies of the Soul to break this Chain, one part is ſo linked to the other; it begins in Election, and ends in Glorification: So that our Election is a forcible Argument to prove there is no final falling for any one of the Sheep of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> I argue from the Nature of the <hi>Election</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:</hi> All the Angels that ſtand were elected, and it was this that ſecures them and preſerves them from falling: Thoſe that fell were not elected; and as evident it is, not one of the Elect Angels are fallen, nor can fall. I marvel any thinking Chriſtians ſhould doubt of Election, as it reſults from the abſolute Soveraignty of God's Grace, or good Pleaſure of his Will, ſince God by Election took hold of ſome of the Angels, as well as ſome of the loſt Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam.</hi> Was God unjuſt, becauſe he did not ſecure, by his unchangeable Decree, the ſtanding of all the Angels, but left ſome of them, and only fix'd upon ſo many as he in his own Wiſdom thought good? They may as well charge this upon the Divine Majeſty of God, as ſo to charge the Doctrine of particular Election of loſt Sinners. <hi>Brethren,</hi> Though Chriſt is not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of Angels, the Elect Angels needing none, yet he is the Head of Angels, and a Confirmer of them; He is the Head of Principalities and Powers: by him, and <hi>for him were all things cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated that are in Heaven, that are in Earth, viſible and inviſible; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Col. 1. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>they be Thrones or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers; all things were created by him, and for him.</hi> Chriſt is God, and he is the preſerver of the Elect Angels; they are committed to him, and under his Power, and he upholds them, though he never died for them; and ſhall we think he will not preſerve his Elect Saints, or that their Election ſhould not as abſolutely ſecure them, for whom he as their bleſſed Lord and Head died, and to whom he is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, as the Elect Angels to whom he is only a Confirmer? <hi>And ye are compleat in him, who is the Head of Principalities and Powers:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Col. 2. 10.</note> Ye are compleat, fully compleat; ye ſtand in him, in his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, compleat, who is your Head, and ſhall be preſerved in him, in whom you are elected to everlaſting Life.</p>
                     <p n="6">6<hi>thly.</hi> Becauſe they are choſen to Salvation, that is, to enjoy and poſſeſs Salvation; if they have it not, the Decree of God is fruſtrated: but his Eternal Decrees are as firm as Mountains of

Braſs. If the Decree of God, in appointing his Elect to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be fruſtrated or made void, either it is done by himſelf, or by others. Now it cannot be made void by himſelf, becauſe it is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Decree, his Mind alters not, and none elſe are able to do it: And as to the Slips and Miſcarriages of the Elect themſelves, God foreſaw all their Evils from Everlaſting, and as that hindered not their Election, ſo beſure it ſhall neeer turn them out of it. <hi>But we are bound to give Thanks always to God for you, Brethren, becauſe</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>God hath from the beginning choſen you to Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. From the beginning, that is, from before the World began, or from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for the abſolute Decrees of God, according to his Eternal Counſel, are from Everlaſting. After the Apoſtle had ſhewed theſe Saints that there would come a falling away from the Faith, and that many would be deceived and damned for ever, to comfort and encourage them againſt the fear of <hi>final Apoſtacy,</hi> he brings this in the 13<hi>th</hi> Verſe, <hi>But we are bound to give Thanks for you, Brethren, beloved of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. You need not fear, as if he ſhould ſay, of being deceived, or of periſhing by dangerous Errors, or otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe you are beloved of the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And alſo are elected to Salvation; and becauſe beloved, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore elected: Whomſoever God doth abſolutely appoint to this or that End, he will aſſiſt or enable to do whatſoever Means is neceſſary in order to that End. Now the Elect are choſen to Salvation, to inherit Eternal Life; if therefore any of them miſs of it, his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and Purpoſe is fruſtrated, which cannot be. We have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Iſa. 46. 10.</note> Text of the like Nature with this; <hi>For God hath not appointed us to Wrath, but to obtain Salvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> From <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5. 9.</note> hence the Apoſtle argues, that they needed not to doubt of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and by what preceeds, it appears, that Election is a great Motive to Holineſs; as when a Man that is ſure of the Victory will fight couragiouſly, <hi>Let us who are of the Day,</hi> or Children of Light, not of Night, nor of Darkneſs, <hi>be ſober, putting on the Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of Faith and Love; for God hath not appointed us to Wrath,</hi> &amp;c. Children of the Night ſhall periſh, but none of the Children of the Light ever ſhall. The Apoſtle aſcends to the original Cauſe of it, which is God's abſolute Decree of Election; Salvation would wholly elſe depend upon the uncertainty of Man's Will, and not upon the immutable and unchangeable Will and Purpoſe of God. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59949:96"/>
Faith, becauſe Faith is the Gift of God, and proceeds from his Counſel, that's appointed too: elſe a Man may ſay, that I might be ſaved, I muſt thank God; but that I am ſaved, I muſt thank my ſelf, becauſe it was left to the liberty of my own Will whether I would believe, and be ſaved, or no. Two things are neceſſary in our Salvation; (1.) The Merits of Chriſt's Blood: (2.) Faith to apply it; by which God's Image is reſtored to us, and preſerved in us: and both theſe we have by his own free Grace, through Chriſt Jeſus, as the Fruit of his electing Love.</p>
                     <p n="7">7<hi>thly.</hi> It doth further plainly appear, that Election does eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſecure all Chriſt's Sheep, all true Believers, from final Falling, or everlaſting Ruin, from the words of our Bleſſed Lord himſelf; <hi>For there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew</hi>

And if this be granted, then Election ſecures them, they cannot finally fall. If they might periſh eternally, they might be deceived with damnable Hereſies, and bring upon themſelves ſwift and utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; but they cannot be ſo deceived, becauſe they are the Elect, therefore they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nnot fall away ſo as to periſh.</p>

                        <hi>Arg.</hi> If the Election of Grace be abſolute, as the Decree of <note place="margin">The general Argument.</note> Day and Night, or as that of Chriſt dying for our Sins: If we are elected in Chriſt as the Head, we being all Members, given to him to make up his Myſtical Body; if thoſe that are elected, ſhall be called, juſtified, and glorified; if the Means, as well as the End, be under God's abſolute Decree and Purpoſe; if our Election doth as abſolutely ſecure us from final Apoſtacy, as the Election of the Holy Angels does ſecure them; if we are elected to Salvation; if it be impoſſible for any of the Elect to be finally deceived; then none of them, none of the Elect, or no Sheep or Lambs of Jeſus Chriſt, can ſo fall away as to periſh eternally: but all this is true, therefore none of them can ſo periſh.</p>
                     <p>So much ſhall ſuffice as to the firſt Argument, to prove the Saints final Perſeverance.</p>

                        <hi>God's Infinite Love to all his Saints:</hi> The Love of the Father, and Love of the Son doth ſecure them from periſhing; it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it paſſeth all Underſtanding: It is becauſe God's Love is ſet upon them; and it is ſuch a Love, What a Love?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I anſwer, it is an Everlaſting Love: <hi>The Lord appeared of old unto me, ſaying, Yea, I have loved thee with an Everlaſting Love,</hi> &amp;c. It is a Love from Everlaſting, therefore it muſt be a firſt Love, an early Love; and becauſe he loved them from Eternity, he elected them from Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is a firm Love a ſtrong Love, an endeared Love, nay, an inconceivable Love: <hi>I in them, and thou in me; and that the World may know that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt loved them, as thou haſt loved</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 17. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>me:</hi> A Love of the ſame Nature, of the ſame Quality. O! what is the Nature of that Love the Father hath to Jeſus Chriſt? Who can conceive of it, much leſs expreſs it? It is impoſſible for us to comprehend how firm, ſtrong and endearing it is; but thus he loves all his Elect Ones: Chriſt as Mediator is the Object of the Father's Love, ſo are all his Members: The ſame Love that is let out to the Head, as to the Nature of it, is let out to his Myſtical Body, and to every particular Member thereof.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Father's Love is a Love of Delight: He is ſaid to love others with a Love of Pity, but he loves his Saints with a Love of Complacency: <hi>He will rejoice over thee with joy; he will reſt in his</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. The Love of the Father is an inſeparable Love, nothing can ſeparate his Love from his Elect; like as nothing could ſeparate his Love from his own Son, ſo nothing can ſeparate his Love from his Saints: <hi>For I am perſwaded, that neither Death, nor Life, nor</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. Yet nevertheleſs, ſee what God ſaith of the People before mentioned; <hi>But thou haſt not called upon me, O</hi> Jacob; <hi>but thou haſt</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 43.</note> 
                        <hi>been weary of me, O</hi> Iſrael, ver. 22. <hi>Thou haſt not brought me the ſmall Cattel of thy Burnt-offerings; neither haſt thou honoured me with thy Sacrifices. I have not cauſed thee to ſerve with an Offering, nor wearied thee with Incenſe,</hi> ver. 23. <hi>Thou haſt bought me no ſweet Cane with Money, neither haſt thou filled me with the Fat of thy Sacrifices; but thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy Sins, and wearied me with thine Iniquities,</hi> ver. 24. See now what a People theſe were, they had not ſo much as done the leaſt things commanded, had not brought the ſmall Cattel for a Sacrifice, nor did they pray, nor ſeek the Face of God: Yet that God may magnify his Grace, ſee what he ſpeaks in the next Words, <hi>I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy Tranſgreſſion for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy Sins.</hi> Nothing you ſee, can take off God's Love from his Covenant-Children; nothing is done by our own Merits, or for the ſake or worth of our Duty, but all wholly of his own Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> To make it further manifeſt that the Sins of Believers cannot ſeparate them from the Love of God, is evident; becauſe Jeſus Chriſt hath fully ſatisfied his Juſtice for all their Sins, he hath paid all their Debts; Wrath and Divine Vengeance cannot hurt the Elect of God, in whoſe ſtead Chriſt died: Should their Sins work their Ruin, and deſtroy their Souls, it would follow that Chriſt made no perfect Compenſation for them; if he hath, it would be injuſtice in God, ſhould he let out his vindictive Wrath againſt them for their Sins: <hi>Surely he hath born our Griefs, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried our Sorrows,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All we like Sheep have gone aſtray: we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities</hi>

                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:59949:99"/>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe they have an Advocate with the Father. Chriſt pleads <hi>the Merits</hi> of his own Blood, the Satisfaction he hath made for their Sins. <hi>My little Children, theſe things write I unto you that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>you ſin not.</hi> O take heed you ſin not; do not grieve your Father, offend your God; you know how hateful Sin is to him, as if he <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ver.</hi> 2.</note> ſhould ſo ſay: <hi>But if any Man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous.</hi> Saints ſhould neither preſume to ſin, nor deſpair if overtaken thereby.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe Chriſt prayed in the Days of his Fleſh, that the Father <hi>would keep them</hi> that he had given him in the <hi>World from the Evil</hi> thereof, though not from every Evil. I dare not ſay <note place="margin">John 17. 15.</note> that; becauſe whatever Chriſt prayed for, it was granted; and yet we ſee the beſt of Saints do ſin: But he prayed that they might not fall ſo, ſin ſo, as to periſh in their ſin, or ſin unto Death; therefore their Sins ſhall never damn them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Their Sins cannot ſeparate them ſo from the Love of God; as that he ſhould caſt them off for ever; becauſe a broken Heart, and pardon of Sin, is contained in the Covenant of Grace: <hi>I will be merciful unto their Vnrighteouſneſs; and their Sins and Iniquities I will remember no more.</hi> Though they will be ſick; <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 16, 17. &amp; 8. 12.</note> none can live and ſin not; yet they have a Phyſician that can and will heal them. The Covenant hath a healing Antidote in it for every ſpiritual Malady of the Soul of a poor dejected Believer: And becauſe God hath promiſed to give Repentance to his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Sin not being actually forgiven without Repentance, or before Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, therefore God will give Repentance to all his Children; he will look upon them as Chriſt look'd upon <hi>Peter,</hi> and then they ſhall, and do weep as he did, bitterly. Nay, Brethren, Jeſus Chriſt is exalted on high to this very End: <hi>Him hath God exalted with his</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Act. 5. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>right Hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance unto</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and forgiveneſs of Sins:</hi> That is, to cover, to conquer and ſubdue all their Corruptions, and to ſupply their Wants, and to protect and defend them from all Enemies, and eternally to ſave their Souls: For which End he had his Name given him; <hi>And thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his People from their</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 1. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>Sins;</hi> from the Guilt of them, the Power of them, and the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of them. Alſo therefore Sin cannot ſeparate them from God's Love, and ruin their precious Souls.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:59949:100"/>
                        <hi>Sixthly.</hi> No Sin can deſtroy the Soul, nor ſeparate it from God, but ſuch Sins only that have dominion, that rule and reign in Men and Women, ſuch that the Sinner loves and allows in himſelf: Nay, all unrenewed Perſons are Servants of Sin; but no Sin reigns in a true Believer, he loves no Sin, allows of no Sin, therefore cannot commit Sin: <hi>Sin ſhall not, cannot reign in them; for Sin ſhall</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>not have Dominion over you; for you are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> Grace will prevent it, the Covenant of Grace, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Grace, and the Promiſes of Grace. The Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but gives no Power to obey; but Power to ſubdue Sin goes along with the Goſpel: the Law is the Strength of Sin, but the Goſpel is the Death of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But for all this, good Men may be overcome, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlide from God, and God may leave them and love them no more.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer, They may be overcome for a Time, or worſted in the Conflict, but they ſhall not finally be overcome; though <hi>they fall, they ſhall riſe again:</hi> And as it is ſaid, <hi>A Troop</hi>

                        <hi>ſhall overcome</hi> Gad, <hi>but</hi> Gad <hi>ſhall overcome at laſt;</hi> ſo it may be ſaid of every Believer. Hence the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>We are more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, through him that loveth us. Rejoice not over me, O mine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; when I fall, I ſhall riſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though they backſlide from God for a time, yet he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them again: <hi>I will heal their Back-ſlidings, and will love them freely.</hi> See here, that God's People by their Backſlidings, do not <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 4.</note> loſe his choice Love and Affections: No, no, he will love them ſtill, and that freely too; and will not reſt till he heals them of that Sickneſs, which is the worſt they can relapſe into.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Elect are another ſort, they are not of them that back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlide ſo, that God's Soul takes no pleaſure in them: <hi>But we are not of them who draw back unto Perdition, but of them that believe to the</hi>

                        <hi>Salvation of the Soul.</hi> There are ſome that ſo draw back, after they have made a high Profeſſion of the Goſpel; but Chriſt's Sheep are not <hi>Sons of Perdition,</hi> but <hi>Sons of Faith,</hi> or true and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Believers, they cannot ſo ſin, ſo apoſtatize: becauſe <hi>the Seed remains in them, they cannot commit Sin;</hi> they cannot ſin as others <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 9.</note> do, not ſo as to loſe God's Love, or not ſin unto Death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot periſh: <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 John 2. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us,</hi> &amp;c. They were not ſuch that had real Union with Chriſt, the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59949:100"/>
true Anointing was not in them, they were not of Chriſt's Sheep, not ſincere Believers, not Elect Ones. From hence let me draw this Argument;</p>
                     <p>Arg. 2. <hi>All thoſe that ſin, cannot ſeparate from the Love of God in Chriſt, nor eternally deſtroy, nothing can, but they ſhall be certainly ſaved: but Sin cannot ſeparate true Believers, or the Sheep of Chriſt, from the Love of God in Chriſt, nor eternally deſtroy them: therefore nothing can, but they ſhall certainly be ſaved.</hi>

                        <hi>as Heaven, what canſt thou do? deeper than Hell, what canſt thou know? longer than the Earth, broader than the Sea.</hi> Many Wits, as <note place="margin">Job 11. 8, 9.</note> one notes, run Riot in <hi>Geometrical Notions</hi> about <hi>Moral Dimenſions;</hi> and whereas Naturaliſts give us but three Dimenſions of a Body, <hi>Longitude, Latitude,</hi> and <hi>Profundity,</hi> the Love of Chriſt (Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) hath <hi>Altitude</hi> added, which is a Fourth.

2. Chriſt's Love is an infinite or an immenſe Love, as appears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is without beginning, it is from Eternity, before ever the Earth was.

                        <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>everlaſting Love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Chriſt's Love to his Sheep, to his Saints, is an infinite or immenſe Love; doth appear, becauſe his Love to them is as that Love the Father hath to him: <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you.</hi> Though [as] may not be a Note of Compariſon in <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 9.</note> every Senſe, yet it doth ſignify the Truth, Firmneſs, and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe of Chriſt's Love: The Father loveth Chriſt with an eternal, immenſe, immutable, conſtant, free, full, and perfect Love; ſo doth Jeſus Chriſt love every one of his Elect Ones. Again, ſaith Chriſt to his Father, <hi>that the World may know that thou haſt loved them, as thou haſt loved me:</hi> He would have all know how he loves <note place="margin">John 17. 23.</note> his People, or ſuch that were given to him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It appears to be an infinite Love, becauſe it cannot be found out, defined or comprehended, it paſſing all Underſtanding; as alſo by the glorious and amazing Effects thereof, which are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to all.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Becauſe it is without ending:</hi> all thoſe that Jeſus Chriſt doth love, or hath ſet his ſpecial Affections upon, he loveth to the End; <note place="margin">Joh. 13. 1.</note> his Love is not only from Everlaſting, but alſo to Everlaſting; he abides in his Love, notwithſtanding all the Weakneſs, Frailties or Decays of Love in his People towards him: He heals, and with a <hi>Nevertheleſs</hi> will heal their Back ſlidings, and love them freely.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Love of Jeſus Chriſt to his Saints is a Conjugal Love;</hi> it is an Eſpouſal Love Though I purpoſe to ſpeak to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Chriſt's Love is a Conjugal Love.</note> of that bleſſed and myſtical Union which is betwixt Chriſt and every Believer under a diſtinct Argument, yet let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered here, that the conſideration that Chriſt's Love is ſuch, as that he doth eſpouſe every Godly Soul, and marry it to himſelf; this muſt needs be one of the higheſt Arguments that can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to prove their final Perſeverance; becauſe Eſpouſal Love is the Sweeteſt, the Firmeſt, and moſt abiding Love, eſpecially the Love of Chriſt's Eſpouſal: <hi>I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 19, 20.</note>, <hi>I will betroth thee unto me in Righteouſneſs, and in Judgment, and in loving Kindneſs, and in Mercy. I will even betroth thee unto me in Faithfulneſs, and thou ſhalt know the Lord.</hi>

What words can more fully expreſs the Firmneſs of this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Contract, or Eſpouſal Love of Chriſt to his true <hi>Iſrael?</hi> This Conjugal Love of Chriſt is that never-exhauſted Fountain of all our ſpiritual and eternal Comforts; all Mercies, like Streams which never fail, flow to all Believers, from hence. Can a Man ſhew greater Love to a Woman, than to eſpouſe her to be his Wife? This is beyond the Love of Parents to Children: Chriſt beſtows himſelf on us, and all he hath; nay, and that he might do this, he bought or purchaſes us: Chriſt bought his Spouſe; none ever gave ſuch a vaſt Sum for a Wife as Jeſus Chriſt hath done; and ſhall any think he will loſe her after all this, if he is able to help it? How can that enter into any Man's Thoughts? Will a faithful Husband, a tender Husband, ſuffer his moſt dear and beloved Wife, that he hath ſuch Affection to, to be torn from him, and be abuſed and pulled into pieces, and he look on? If he hath Power in his Hand, will he not reſcue her, nay, die upon the Spot before he will ſee this done? But alas, ala, what is the Love of any mortal Man, to his Spouſe, to his Wife, when compared with the Love of Chriſt to his Saints, <hi>who loved his Church, and gave himſelf for her;</hi> and whoſe Love is as you have heard, ſo wonderful, infinite, and inconceivable? Moreover I hope none doubt of his Power. Others may ſee their Wives raviſhed and torn in pieces before their Eyes, and cannot help it, they are not able to help and ſave them: but Chriſt wants no Power, as he wants no Wiſdom, Care, or Affections. Now what are the Enemies, the moſt dangerous Enemies of the Spouſe of Chriſt? Is not Sin the chief, Sin, the World, the Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Will he then, think you, let Sin prevail, Satan prevail, ſo far as to deflour, murder and deſtroy that precious Soul he thus loves, and hath eſpouſed to himſelf? Thoſe who aſſert final falling from a State of true Grace, muſt ſay he doth thus, <hi>viz.</hi> He ſuffers Sin to deſtroy his Spouſe, even to put out the Eyes, deflour, ſtrip, wound, and murder the Soul he has eſpouſed, whilſt he ſtands by and looks on, and can, but will not help nor deliver her, becauſe the Soul is bliaded by ſome Luſts, or drawn away by an Enemy; therefore they ſay he will not. He that can believe ſuch a Doctrine, let him. But,</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Chriſt Love hath an attracting and a retaining Quality in it:</hi> It draws the Soul to Chriſt, and it keeps it cloſe with Chriſt, <note place="margin">Chriſt's Love an attracting Love.</note> when it hath received and imbraced him; it draws, nay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains the Soul to love Chriſt; <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved</hi>

                        <hi>us.</hi> And no Man or Woman that loves Chriſt ſincerely, but they hate Sin: it conſtrains the Soul to return Love for Love. Chriſt's Love is like <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Garment that he caſt upon <hi>Eliſha,</hi> who immediately run after <hi>Elijah,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Let me, I pray thee, kiſs my Father and Mother, and then I will follow thee. And be ſaid, Go</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 King. 19. 19, 20.</note> 
                        <hi>back, what have I done unto thee?</hi> Thus doth Chriſt's Love to the Soul in all that feel its Influences, they follow him, cleave to him, and alſo keep with him: for like as the Fear of God, ſo the Love of God is put into our Hearts, (if we are ſincere Chriſtians) and we ſhall not, cannot finally depart from him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Chriſt's Love is a free Love; as nothing did purchaſe <note place="margin">A free Love.</note> it, ſo nothing can nor ſhall loſe or forfeit it: <hi>I will love them freely.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the whole I infer,<hi>—If the Love of Jeſus Chriſt is an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Love, a Love of Complacency; if it be a wonderful and amazing</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The General Argument.</note> 
                        <hi>Love; if it be an immenſe, infinite, and incomprehenſible Love; if it is a conjugal Love, an attracting and retaining Love, a free and abiding Love, which he hath to every Believer; then he will not ever let go that hold he hath of every one of them, ſo as to ſuffer them to fall from him, as eternally to periſh: But ſuch is the Nature of the Love of Jeſus Chriſt; therefore he will never ſo let go that hold he hath of every Believer, as to ſuffer them to fall ſo as eternally to periſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Brethren, ſuch is the Love of Chriſt to his Saints, as that he <note place="margin">Chriſt's ſpecial Love-Tokens.</note> gives them ſpecial Tokens and Aſſurance of his Eternal Favour.</p>

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1ſt. Exhort.</note>To cloſe with this; O ſee, you that are Believers, that you ſtrive after the Knowledg of Chriſt's Love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Motives.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is the higheſt Ingratitude not to deſire after the Knowledg of ſuch Love: Shall a Beggar be beloved by a Prince, and ſhe not be affected with it, nor inquire after it?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe you are the Objects of this Love, of this Affection; doth it not ſeem an amazing Conſideration to you? May be you can't ſoon believe it; becauſe you ſee no worth in your ſelves. Ah, ſaith the Soul, Chriſt loves me thus! What, ſuch a poor ſorry and filthy Wretch! Wonder O Heavens, be aſtoniſhed O Earth! The more you know it, the more you will love your Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. He loved me not a righteous Perſon, but me a Sinner, a loathſom Sinner, when in my Blood and Filth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This will make you little in your own Eyes; the more we know of God, and of Chriſt, and of his Love, the more we ſhall loath and abhor our ſelves. O that ever I ſhould grieve him <note place="margin">Joh 42. 5.</note> as I have done! How did the ſenſe of God's Love and Goodneſs to <hi>David</hi> humble him: <hi>Who am I, O Lord, and what is mine</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Chron. 17. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto? And yet is this a ſmall thing in thine Eyes, O God, for thou haſt ſpoken of thy Servant's Houſe for a great while to come, and haſt regarded me according to the Eſtate of a Man of high Degree, O Lord.</hi> Thus may every Believer ſay. The Love of Chriſt will have the like Effect on our Souls, as the Knowledg of <hi>David</hi>'s Love to <hi>Abigail,</hi> when he ſent Meſſengers to her to make her his Wife, and raiſe her to his Throne: <hi>Let me</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>be a Servant, to waſh the Feet of the Servants of</hi>

4. The Knowledg of Chriſt's Love, will beget greater and ſtronger Love in our Souls to him: <hi>Love begetteth Love,</hi> but not till it is known. O taſte, Sinners, of this Love: had you but a Taſte, how would your Hearts be enflamed in Love to Jeſus Chriſt. And as to you Saints,</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The more you know of Chriſt's Love, the more your Hearts will die (and your Love cool) to all earthly things.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The more you know of Chriſt's Love, the more firmly you will be fixed and ſetled in his Truth, and be delivered from Fears and Doubts about your ſtanding. Alas, it is not Sin, nor Satan, nor Hell, nor Death, that can deprive your Souls of Chriſt's Love, if you are his. If Satan ſays, Thou art a vile Sinner, and lays before thee the Baſeneſs of thy Heart; tell him, Chriſt's Love paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Knowledg. Does he ſay, that thou wilt fall one time or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Tell him, Chriſt loved thee not for thy Righteouſneſs; and his Love that is ſo infinite, will never ſuffer thee to fall and riſe no more.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Knowledg of Chriſt's Love will make us to ſpeak well of God, and Chriſt, and his Ways, at all times; ſtill we ſhall ſay, the Love of God, and Jeſus Chriſt, is the ſame, <hi>all is in Love; whom I love, I rebuke and chaſten:</hi> Chriſt's Love known and experienced, <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 19.</note> will be a Cordial to bear thee up to the end of thy Days.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. This will ſet your Souls at liberty, and bring you out of the Spirit of Bondage, and make you <hi>to run after him:</hi> But it is <note place="margin">Cant. 1. 4.</note> not the knowing of Chriſt's Love in any degree, but to that degree that <hi>paſſeth Knowledg;</hi> a Love that can't fail which will do this.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Knowledg of Chriſt's Love will make you cling and cleave to him: Chriſt is the Loadſtone, and our Soul the Needle; and now our Soul having touched him, it makes to the Center; and though you may, like the <hi>Needle, tremble</hi> for a Time, yet you are haſtening to him, and never will reſt till you come to him whom your Souls love.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The more you know of him, and of his Love, the more will be your inward Joy and Peace: For this is the Way to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with all the Fulneſs of God, <hi>and to know the Love of Chriſt</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>which paſſeth Knowledg, that you may be filled with all the Fulneſs of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> This may reprehend and ſharply reprove, ſuch Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that doubt of the Love of Chriſt; eſpecially thoſe who affirm, that juſtified and ſanctified Perſons may for ever loſe his Love and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59949:107"/>
periſh; for this renders his Love mutable and changeable, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Love of Mortals change one towards another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> and laſtly, What Comfort and Conſolation doth this afford to all true Chriſtians?</p>
                     <p>But I muſt proceed to the next Argument, to prove, That Saints ſhall not, cannot finally fall ſo as to periſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Chriſt's Sheep, his Saints, ſhall never ſo fall, as finally <note place="margin">The fourth A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> taken from the Nature of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace.</note> and eternally to periſh, I ſhall in the next place prove, and that from the Nature of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt.</hi> Becauſe it is a Covenant of Grace: We do not ſtand in this Covenant, as <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in the firſt Covenant.</p>
                     <p>And now that it is a Covenant of Grace, will appear, if we conſider with whom this Covenant was primarily made; and that was with Jeſus Chriſt, it was made between God in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 10, 11. Zech. 6. 12, 13.</note> of the Father, and Man in the Perſon of Chriſt. Our Lord Jeſus was conſtituted in this Covenant, the great Head, Repreſentative, and bleſſed Surety, for and in behalf of all the Father gave unto him. <hi>Adam</hi> had no Surety that undertook for him in the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as a Covenanting Hand, but was entruſted with all his Riches, all being put into his own Hand, which he ſoon by his Sin loſt, and undid himſelf and all his Poſterity, whom he was ſet up as the common Head and Repreſentative of. God foreſecing this, he would not enter into a Covenant any more with Man, his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit being for ever loſt: And ſince he loſt all when he had Power to ſtand, there was no likelihood or poſſibility of his ſtanding, after he had deprived himſelf of his Power of doing good, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved in all the Faculties of his Soul. Therefore Chriſt was ſet up, ſet up from Everlaſting, by the Holy God, (who foreſaw all things before they came to paſs) as the Head and Surety of the New Covenant, (called the New Covenant, in reſpect had to the time of the Revelation of it to Mankind, it being not known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Man had broke the firſt Covenant): now Chriſt undertook in the Covenant of Grace for all the Elect, he perſonating them, when the Father and he entred into that glorious Compact or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Tranſactions, we having not then an actual Being, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented all that were given to him out of the loſt Lump of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Man; and undertook, as Mediator, to make up that Breach that was between God and Man; and by his perfect Obedience to merit for them Everlaſting Life, and to bring them all to Glory.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59949:107"/>
This being ſo, nothing can more fully demonſtrate the Certainty of their Salvation, and the Impoſſibility of any of their periſhing; for they for whom Jeſus Chriſt did undertake this great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Work, even all the Elect Seed, were put into his Hand by the Tenour of this Covenant, to work out Life and Salvation for them, and to die in the room and ſtead of them; thereby to bear that Wrath and Curſe that they otherwiſe muſt have ſuffered, born and endured for ever. Now in this Covenant, Eternal Life comes to us primarily by God's Free Grace, in his finding out, parting with, and accepting of his own Son to be our Saviour and Surety. And ſecondly, by virtue of what Chriſt hath done, and did undertake to do and ſuffer for all that ſhould be ſaved, they cannot periſh: <hi>I have found</hi> David <hi>my Servant; with my Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit have I anointed him.—My Mercy will I keep with him for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 89. 20. Verſe 28, 29.</note> 
                        <hi>and my Covenant ſhall ſtand faſt in him. His Seed alſo will I make to endure for ever.</hi> His Seed, that is, all that are the Product of his Spirit, or are quickned and renewed by him. This is the Nature of the Covenant of Grace, Chriſt is their Root and Head, their Spirit of Life is in him, and it is derived from him in Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, in a ſpiritual way, as our natural Life was in, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to us from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by Generation, in a natural way. My Brethren, pray do not miſtake about the Nature and Tenour of this great and glorious Covenant: The Father, we ſay, enters into a Covenant with his Son, and promiſes Eternal Life unto him, and to all his Elect Seed, upon the conſideration of what he, I mean our Bleſſed Saviour, was to perform in reſpect of thoſe fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral Conditions propoſed to him, which he did then undertake on Man's behalf, or ſuch of Mankind that God did intend to ſave. And the Father that accepted of him, and ſent him into the World, and gave him his Sheep, doth look to him as to the final and compleat Accompliſhment of all things, that were either to be done for them, or wrought and done in them, in order to the Everlaſting Salvation of their Souls. And this Chriſt engaged to do, and took them into his Hands in this Covenant to effect; which is clearly ſignified in my Text, together with a full Aſſurance unto us, that he will do it in ſpite of Sin, Devil, World, and all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; <hi>Neither ſhall any pluck them out of my Hand.</hi> Our Bleſſed Saviour further ſaith, <hi>All that the Father hath given me, ſhall come unto me; and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out. For</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 6. 37, 38, 39.</note> 
                        <hi>I came down from Heaven, not to do mine own Will, but the Will of him that ſent me. And this is the Father's Will that ſent me, that of</hi>
                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:59949:108"/>
                        <hi>all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt Day.</hi> This was the Covenant between them both, this is his <hi>Father's Will,</hi> that none, no not one, no nothing of them that were given to him, neither their Souls nor Bodies, ſhould be loſt, but all muſt be ſaved, he having engaged and promiſed to fulfil and accompliſh the Father's Will herein. O happy Believers! you are not left to your own Covenanting with God, to the Power of your own Wills; nor do you ſtand upon your own Legs, but you are in God's Covenant, in Chriſt's Covenant; you are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Chriſt's Hand to keep, you ſtand upon your Surety's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, his Undertakings; God looks to him, and expects that he gives a good Account of all his Sheep at the laſt Day; and Chriſt is able and faithful: He ſays, <hi>Them I muſt bring;</hi> I have ſtruck Hands with my Father, I have covenanted and promiſed to <hi>die for them,</hi> and <hi>to call, renew,</hi> and <hi>eternally to ſave them; and they ſhall never periſh.</hi> This being all true, what is become of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine (or rather of the groſs Error) of a final falling from a State of true Grace?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> To proceed a little further: Jeſus Chriſt, by virtue of this Covenant, and in purſuance of that great Work he undertook, did not only die to ſatisfy for the Sins of his People, but alſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed or procured thereby a gracious conveyance of the Holy Spirit, and the ſaving Graces and Influences thereof, to change their Hearts, bend and ſubject their Wills, and graciouſly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and convert their Souls unto God, which God foreſaw other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe could never be done, and alſo to carry on that good Work in them until they come to Glory: And this indeed he was obliged to perform, according to the Tenour of this Covenant. And hence it is that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Being confident of this very thing, that he which</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>hath begun a good Work in you, will perform it until the Day of Chriſt;</hi> or until the Day of your Death he will perform it; which denotes his Covenant-undertaking, he having obliged or bound himſelf as our Surety to do it. It is not ſaid he will <hi>perfect,</hi> or <hi>finiſh it,</hi> but he will <hi>perform it.</hi> Had not the Apoſtle referred to that Obligation in the Covenant of Grace which he laid himſelf under, the other Expreſſion had been as proper, <hi>i. e.</hi> to ſay, he will <hi>perform it.</hi> He is faithful, and cannot fail in doing and performing what he hath made a Bargain, or covenanted to do: As we ſay, when a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and reſponſible Perſon hath covenanted to do this or that, though the Work be great and difficult, and much Oppoſition lies in his way, yet he will do it, he will perform what he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.

them can periſh. See what our Bleſſed Saviour ſaith, <hi>That which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh, and that which is born of the Spirit is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 3. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Spirit.</hi> That which is born of corrupt Nature, or is the Product of the Fleſh, is Fleſh, or of the ſame Nature of that which did beget it: As it is ſaid of <hi>Adam, he begat a Son in his own likeneſs;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 5. 3.</note> that is, a depraved, ſinful and mortal Child: The Fleſh bringeth forth Effects proportionable to the Cauſe. 'Tis thus in the firſt Birth: But if by Fleſh you will have our Saviour intend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Man's natural Abilities, or the Effects of the higheſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of his natural Light, Underſtanding, Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why then it follows ſtill, that a Man purely natural can produce nothing but natural Operations; for nothing in operation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the Virtue or Excellency of that Cauſe which influenceth it: So that no Man can by his Abilities, however improved, produce any divine or ſpiritual Operation; and this ſhews that Man muſt be born of the Spirit, that becomes or is made truly ſpiritual and ſit for the Kingdom of Heaven. And ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, what <hi>is born of the Spirit, is Spirit,</hi> or is of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the Holy Spirit; that is, Spiritual, Holy, Immortal; ſince every Creature begetteth its own Nature, Qualities, and Image: Such as is the Cauſe, ſuch is the Effect. Thus it is in Generation, and thus it is in Regeneration; it muſt be from a Divine, from a ſpiritual Cauſe, and not a Natural, that the Image of God is formed in the Soul. The Fleſh cannot bring forth an Heavenly Babe: Can Corruption produce or be the Cauſe of Regeneration? Can a Worm, or an Ant bring forth a Man, ſooner than Fleſh? Or can any Man under Heaven beget, or form, and bring forth the New Creature in the Soul; which is called the <hi>forming of Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Image of God in us?</hi> But now pray conſider, that ſuch as is the Nature or Quality of the Begetter, ſuch is the Nature of that which is begotten of him; therefore ſince the New Creature is begotten by the Holy Spirit, it muſt partake of the Nature of the Spirit. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>it is Spirit,</hi> it is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> immortal or incorruptible. Hence the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, Believers partake of the Divine Nature; <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>and precious Promiſes, that by theſe we might be partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi> Every Child of God is begotten by the Spirit through the Promiſe, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was: <hi>I will come, and</hi> Sarah <hi>ſhall have a Son.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 23.</note> Compare this with that in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Being born again, not of corruptible Seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God that liveth and abideth for ever.</hi> Pray obſerve it, which liveth and abideth for

ever. Mortal Seed in Generation begetteth and bringeth forth a <hi>mortal Babe,</hi> a <hi>corruptible Child;</hi> but the Word and Spirit of God, begetteth and bringeth forth an immortal or an <hi>incorruptible Babe:</hi> Such is the Babe of Grace, or Child of God; I ſpeak of the <hi>New Creature,</hi> or the <hi>regenerated Part</hi> in Man.</p>
                     <p>From hence let me draw this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">Arg. 1. <hi>That which is begotten and born of, and is brought forth by the Spirit of God, or of immortal and incorruptible Seed, is an immortal or incorruptible Babe: But the New Creature in the Soul of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, is begotten and born of, or brought forth by the Spirit of God; therefore the New Creature in the Soul of the Regenerate is an immortal or an incorruptible Babe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if it be immortal or incorruptible, it can never die, but liveth and abideth for ever; and this the Apoſtle ſhews and affirms: Therefore it is impoſſible ſuch ſhould fall away, or ſuffer a Spiritual Death here, or an Eternal Death in Hell hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> My ſecond Argument from hence is this, Becauſe the Child of a natural Parent cannot ceaſe to be his Child whilſt he liveth, or Life abideth in him; this every Man muſt grant: True, he may prove a Rebellious and a Diſobedient Child, but ſtill he is his Child, and the Man that begat him is his Father, that Relation cannot be loſt; nay, and that Nature which the Child derived from his Father, continues, and muſt continue, he is of his Fleſh and Blood ſtill. Even ſo it is here, and impoſſible it is that it ſhould be otherwiſe, that Man or Woman, whoſe Soul is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and born of God, cannot ceaſe to be a Child of God, though he may prove diſobedient to his Heavenly Father, and grieve and diſhonour him, but yet nevertheleſs he is a Child of God ſtill: and God who by his Spirit in a ſpiritual manner begot him, is his Father; and that bleſſed Relation continues; and that holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Seed of Grace which he derived from God, continues and muſt abide alſo in him, as long as that Life he hath in him, as a Child of God, doth remain; and that Life is, as I have proved by the former Argument, Eternal or Immortal.</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> Beſides I have made it moſt evident by my former Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that God in the Covenant of Grace, and through the Suretiſhip of Jeſus Chriſt, hath provided that his Children ſhall never ſo rebel againſt him, as finally to depart: <hi>I will put my Fear</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 32. 40. Ch. 3. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>into their Hearts, and they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> Though they may be backſliding Children, yet God ſaith, he is married to them,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59949:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which denotes that intimate Union there is between the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and them, according to another Metaphor.</p>
                     <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> None of thoſe who were truly Regenerate, or indeed the Children of God, as being begotten and born of him, though ſome of them grievouſly ſinned againſt him, were ever caſt out ſo as to ceaſe to be God's Children. Where is he that can contradict this, by ſhewing ſome that were indeed Children begotten of God, who have by their Diſobedience ceaſed from being his Children, or never were reſtored after they ſinned and fell? Who fell worſe than <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter?</hi> I have before clearly proved, though they may ſin, and fall, yet they ſhall riſe again.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If all thoſe that were the Children of God, who ſinned, were reſtored, and not one Inſtance can be given of any one of this ſort, <hi>i. e.</hi> that were truly regenerated, that ſinned, fell, and roſe no more; then none of the true Children of God can ſo ſin, ſo fall, as eternally to periſh.

                     <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> Thoſe that are the Children of God, begotten by him, cannot ſin, ſo as eternally to periſh and loſe. Eternal Life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that are his Children, are Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Chriſt. This I grant is not always true of the Children of earthly Parents, or earthly Princes, for they are oft-times diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited; but it is otherwiſe here, they are all born Heirs, their being regenerated and united to Chriſt, gives them a ſure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Right and Title to Eternal Life. The Holy Ghoſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively aſſerts this very thing; <hi>And if Children, then Heirs, Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Chriſt.</hi>

                     <p n="6">6<hi>thly.</hi> It is becauſe the Children of God are the Seed of Chriſt, which the Father ſaid Chriſt ſhould ſee; <hi>He ſhall ſee his Seed:</hi> Nay, the Father aſſured him, that his <hi>Seed ſhould indure for ever.</hi>

                     <p n="7">7<hi>thly.</hi> I argue yet further upon this Argument, from that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">How Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may be ſaid not to commit Sin.</note> Text in the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>John; Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin, for the Seed remaineth in him; and he cannot ſin,</hi>

                        <hi>Argument here in expreſs Terms:</hi> Evident it is, the Apoſtle means not, that they do not ſin at all; that's evident becauſe he elſewhere ſays, <hi>If we ſay we have no Sin, we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>is not in us. James</hi> alſo ſays, in many things we offend all; neither is there, as <hi>Solomon</hi> declares, <hi>a juſt Man upon the Earth that doth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>Good, and ſinneth not.</hi> Therefore that is not the ſenſe of the Text, I will give you my underſtanding of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. So far as he is born of God, he doth not commit Sin, or ſo he ſins not; that is, the New Creature doth not ſin, that never yields to Sin, but evermore wars againſt it, and reſiſteth it: This is that which <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Law of his Mind, it is the renewed or <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 25.</note> regenerated Part, or 'tis that which is born of God, that luſteth againſt the Fleſh, or wars againſt it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He doth not, nay, he cannot ſin as others do: this appears by that I mentioned laſt, becauſe of that new Nature or bleſſed Seed he hath received.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He cannot live in a <hi>Courſe of Sin,</hi> or make a <hi>Trade of Sins</hi> He cannot live in a cuſtom of Sinning, becauſe all evil Habits are broken by Divine Grace in him. That Man that lives in any way of Sin, the old Habit of Lying, Pride, Luſts, Drunkenneſs, Covetouſneſs, or any other Sin being not broken, is not born of God; for it is impoſſible a Child of God ſhould ſo ſin, <hi>i. e.</hi> live in a courſe and practice of committing of known Sins, or in a conſtant and continual omiſſion of known Duties: Though he may fall into groſs Sins, as <hi>David</hi> and other Children of God did, yet they continue not in a Courſe of ſuch Sins that once poſſibly they were overcome by; nay, be ſure they ſet a greater Watch againſt ſuch Sins, and hate them rather more than all other Sins, becauſe thereby they greatly diſhonoured God, and wounded their own Souls.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Therefore Sin is not his Way, or Walk; he doth not commit Sin, as to walk after it; <hi>he walks not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> He may ſtep into the Way of Sin, but he <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> ſoon ſteps out of it again, whereas others walk in that Way every Day; it is the high Way, the common Road of the Ungodly.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He doth not commit Sin with Liking, Allowance, and Love. Though the fleſhly Part may like, love, and allow of it, yet he finds another Part in him that hates it: <hi>What I hate, that do I.</hi> And hence it is the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is not I that doth it, but Sin</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 15.</note>

                        <hi>that dwells in me.</hi> I am againſt it, Grace hath the upper Hand in my Soul: I am for the Law of God, I give my Voice for Chriſt; <hi>I,</hi> that is my <hi>renewed part,</hi> that's the <hi>I</hi> he ſpeaks of.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>He cannot ſin unto Death;</hi> ſin ſo as to fall, finally fall, and periſh for ever. 'Tis evident that this is intended here, though there may be a Truth in the other reſpects. <hi>If any Man ſee his</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Brother ſin a Sin which is not unto Death, he ſhall ask, and he ſhall give him Life for them that ſin not unto Death. There is a Sin unto Death; I do not ſay he ſhall pray for it.</hi> The Elect ſin, but not unto Death; there is Pardon for all their Sins; if they ask, their Sins ſhall be forgiven them: but there is <hi>a Sin unto Death,</hi> a falling into <hi>Hereſy</hi> or <hi>Debauchery,</hi> or ſuch an <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgiven; but thus they cannot commit Sin that are born of God, ſo as to periſh. Which indeed the Apoſtle in the ſame Chapter ſhews to be his meaning, <hi>All Vnrighteouſneſs is Sin; and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">V. 16, 17.</note>

Or ſhould he ſuffer it, would not all ſay that he was a cruel and unmerciful Father, one that had no Love, no natural Affections to his poor Child?

                     <p>Now it cannot be that God wants Love to all, or any one of his Children; we have ſhewed you, that he loves them with an everlaſting, infinite, and inconceivable Love, ſuch a Love as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſeparate his Children from it: and to ſay he either wants Power to ſave them, or Care and Faithfulneſs, <hi>is Blaſphemy.</hi> O what is the Love, the Care and Faithfulneſs of God? Beſides, he has committed them into Chriſt's Hand, to keep and preſerve them, as my Text holds forth: And can any think that Chriſt has not received a Charge to keep them from the Danger of Sin, that they be not finally loſt thereby, as well as from any other Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? Or do you think Chriſt will fail in his Care and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who is their great Shepherd, Sponſor, Surety, or Truſtee?

                        <hi>Infer.</hi> 1. From hence we infer, that thoſe Men who affirm that ſuch who are the Children of God, begotten and born of the Spirit, may periſh, are ſtrangely beclouded; for they muſt ſuppoſe that a Child may utterly loſe the Nature and Relation of a Child, and degenerate ſo far, as to become a <hi>Dog,</hi> a <hi>Swine,</hi> &amp;c. which is impoſſible in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and much more in Grace: for as none but the Almighty Power of the Infinite God could change the Soul; ſo it is impoſſible for any Diabolical Power to turn or change that Holy Nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and that not only becauſe the Divine Nature and Image of God is ſuch in ſelf, but alſo by reaſon of the Deſign and Purpoſe of God, in and by Jeſus Chriſt in our Reſtauration, that being ſuch, that it cannot be loſt any more without the higheſt diſhonour to God, and a fruſtration of his Eternal Purpoſe and Counſel, which was to deſtroy the Works of the Devil. If any ſhould object, that <hi>Adam</hi> had the Image of God in him before he fell, and loſt it. I anſwer, He was the Son of God by Creation only, not by Grace; he was not begotten by the Holy Spirit, nor did he ſtand as we do, in Chriſt.</p>

                        <hi>Infer.</hi> 2. This may alſo therefore inform all Believers, that they are in a moſt happy and ſafe Condition, becauſe they are born of God, and brought by Grace and Regeneration into an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble State.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Exhort.</hi> O ſee that you are the Children of God, begotten of God; for if ſo, though you are but <hi>Babes,</hi> yet you are out of Eternal Danger.</p>
                     <p>Let me give you, Brethren, here a few Marks or Characters of Babes in Chriſt, or of a Child of God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Babes have all the Parts and Lineaments of a Man,</hi> if it be a perfect Birth: So a Babe in Chriſt hath all the Eſſentials of a true Chriſtian; he hath all the Parts and Lineaments of the New Creature. There is a Formation of God's Image, or a gracious Work of the Spirit in every Faculty of the Soul, and a partaking of every Grace; though at the firſt forming it is not come to full Growth and Perfection: there is not only Light in the <hi>Vnderſtanding,</hi> Convictions in the <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> but the <hi>Will</hi> is ſubjected to the Will of God, and Power
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59949:116"/>
of Divine Grace; and the <hi>Affections</hi> are renewed and changed alſo to love, as God loves; and to hate, as God hates.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Babe partakes of the Nature of the Father that begot him: So does a Child of God partake of his Divine Nature; he is <hi>after God created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs. That which is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 24. John 3. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>born of the Fleſh, is Fleſh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is obſerved, <hi>that Babes come into the World crying:</hi> So <hi>a Babe</hi> in Chriſt, or one born again, comes into a State of Grace praying; <hi>Behold he prays.</hi> And though it be not univerſally true in Nature, <note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> yet it is ſo in Grace, always ſo; he that prays not, is not renewed, nor born again.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>A Babe or Child new-born, deſires the Milk of its Mother's Breaſt:</hi> So ſuch who are born of God, <hi>deſire after the ſincere Milk of the Word,</hi> or the <hi>heavenly and pure Doctrine of the Goſpel, that they</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 1, 2.</note> 
                        <hi>may grow thereby.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>A dear Child loves and honours his Father who begot him:</hi> So every true Child of God does love and honour God: <hi>If I be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where is mine Honour?</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 6.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>A Child is grieved when the Father is offended,</hi> and will take care that he doth not diſpleaſe him, if a dear Child: So doth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Child of God mourn when God is offended; and alſo takes ſpecial care and heed he diſpleaſes him not.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>A dear Child loves all his Brethren and Siſters:</hi> So every one that <hi>is born of God, doth not only love him that begat,</hi> but <hi>alſo all thoſe</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>who are begotten of him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>A dear Child will ſtrive to follow and imitate his Father in all his Vertues:</hi> So a Child of God follows God, imitates God in all his imitable Perfections; <hi>Be ye followers of God as dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Reproof.</hi> How doth this tend to reprehend the Enemies of God's People, who abuſe, reproach, backbite, nay, perſecute them? How will they ſtand in the Judgment-Day, when Chriſt will ſay, what ye did to this and that Child of mine, you did it unto me? <hi>He that toucheth you,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jehovah) toucheth the Apple</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. This greatly raiſeth the Honour of Believers: What greater Dignity can be conferred on us, than to be begotten and born of God? This is more than to be Adopted Sons, we are born of God, partake of his Divine Nature: <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

                     <p>By the way;</p>
                     <p>Let it be conſidered, that this Union by the in-dwelling of the Holy Spirit, is not a Perſonal Union, that is impoſſible; he doth not aſſume our Nature, and ſo prevent our Perſonality, which (as one obſerves) would make us one Perſon with himſelf: But he dwells in our Perſons, keeping his own, and leaving us our <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dr.</hi> Owen.</note> Perſonality indefinitely diſtinct: But it is a Spiritual Union, a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious and Myſtical Union, more to be admired, than undertaken fully to be defined by any Man under Heaven. Many Debates there have been about this Union amongſt Learned Men, ſome car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it too high, and ſome too low; for though it be not a Perſonal Union, yet it is more than a Union in Love and Affection, or in Principle, in Deſign and Intereſt, which may be between one Friend and another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:59949:117"/>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is ſuch a ſtrong Union intenſively, that Chriſt and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Man become one Spirit: <hi>He that is joined unto the Lord, is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>one Spirit:</hi> One Spirit (ſaith Reverend <hi>Charnock)</hi> as if they had but one Soul in two Bodies. What the Spirit doth in Chriſt, it doth alſo in a Believer, according to the Capacity of the Soul: The ſame Spirit which was the immediate Conveyer of Grace to the Humane Nature of Chriſt, is ſo to us; Chriſt hath an Eſſential Holineſs in reſpect of his Godhead, but a Derivative Holineſs as Man: and this Derivative Holineſs proceeded from the Spirit's dwelling in him <hi>without meaſure,</hi> which we have in our Meaſures: And by virtue of this Union, by the ſame Spirit whereby we become one Spirit with Chriſt; not only that Grace which is in us, and in the greateſt Apoſtle, is the ſame; but that Grace which is in us, and in our Bleſſed Mediator the Man Chriſt Jeſus, are of the ſame Nature and Original: As the Light of the Sun, and the Light of the Stars, are the ſame, but they differ in Degrees, not eſſentially. And as we ſay of Souls, <hi>Animae ſunt pares dignitate,</hi> ſaith <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock;</hi> though the Actions are not the ſame, becauſe of the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Organs, and the predominancy of ſome particular Humour. 'Tis the ſame Spirit in Chriſt and a Believer, as it is the ſame Soul in dignity, which is in an Infant and a Man of moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Parts. It is more here, for 'tis the ſame Spirit in reſpect of his Perſon, which makes Chriſt very near of Kin to us; this Spirit muſt either deſert Chriſt or us, before this Union can be diſſolved: Not Chriſt, for he had it in the World not in Meaſures, and he is yet anointed with the Oil of Gladneſs above his Fellows: Not us, becauſe the Promiſe of Chriſt cannot be broken. This being the Top-ſtone of the Comfort of Believers, in ſending this Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he may abide with us for ever. Evident it is, that it is ſuch a Union that Believers are ſaid to <hi>partake of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> that the Holy Spirit is promiſed to them, and in a ſpiritual manner is united to them, and dwelleth and abideth in them, and that for ever, cannot be denied. Chriſt ſhews us, that this Union ariſes from our ſpiritual eating of his Fleſh, and drinking of his Blood: <hi>He that eateth my Fleſh, and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> But when ſome were offended, and could not <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 56.</note> ſee how this could be, he ſaid unto them, <hi>ver.</hi> 63. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth, the Fleſh profiteth nothing;</hi> (it is not ſuch eating as the Idolatrous Papiſts dream of) it is by the Holy Spirit, by the indwelling of the quickning Spirit, whereby we have a real parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59949:117"/>
of Chriſt: He is in us by his Spirit, (as a Vital Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, changing our Hearts, and working in us his own Holy Image, infuſing Gracious Diſpoſitions and Sacred Habits in the Soul) and we are in him by Faith, in a gracious, hidden, and myſtical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and this Union cannot be diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Union muſt needs be moſt intimate, near and ſtrong, if we conſider by what Metaphors it is ſet forth in God's Word.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is a Marriage-Union; like as a Man and his Wife are ſaid to be <hi>one Fleſh,</hi> ſo <hi>he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit. No Man ever hated his own Fleſh,</hi> but nouriſhed and cheriſhed it as the Lord the Church. He that loveth his Wife, loveth himſelf; a Man and his Wife is but <hi>one Myſtical Self:</hi> and what is in Nature as to the Perfection of it, is much more eminently in Chriſt. Now ſince God hath fitted to our Nature a Care of our Body, this Care be ſure is much more in Chriſt, when the Apoſtle ſhews what the Love of the Husband ſhould be unto the Wife; and that a Man <hi>leaves both Father and Mother, and cleaveth to his Wife; and they two ſhall be one Fleſh:</hi> Saith he, <hi>This is a great Mystery; but I ſpeak</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 31, 32.</note> 
                        <hi>concerning Chriſt and his Church;</hi> or of Chriſt and every believing Soul. The Union between Husband and Wife is near; ay but Death diſſolves this Union, becauſe they can be united, or be one no longer than both live: But Chriſt lives for ever, and the Soul of a Believer lives for ever: Nay, Believers have Eternal Life in them, and they ſhall never die; therefore it follows this Union abides for ever: He hath betrothed his Saints, his Spouſe unto himſelf for ever. And can any then diſſolve this Marriage-Contract and Conjugal Union? Is Chriſt able to preſerve his Souſe, or the Soul that is united unto him? Is it in the Power of his Hands? Pray, Brethren, conſider it well. Will any of you that have a Spouſe, a Wife that you dearly love, ſuffer her to be torn into pieces, and baſely murdered before your Eyes, if you could prevent it? And do any think that Chriſt, who hath all Power in Heaven and Earth, Power over <hi>Sin,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> yea, over <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi> will he, I ſay, ever ſuffer his Spouſe to be deſtroyed and murdered by Sin, World, or Devil? Strange! did he die for her, and has he married her, and made her one Spirit with himſelf; and will he leave her to conflict, to fight and war with an Enemy that he knows is too ſtrong and mighty for her, and not come in, ruſh in to her aſſiſtance, to ſave and reſcue her from ſuch bloody, cruel, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59949:118"/>
Enemies? No doubt but he will riſe up with Indignation and Jealouſy, to ſave every Soul that is ſo related and united to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Spiritual Union between Chriſt and every believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul, is ſet forth by that near and intimate Union which there is between the Natural Body and every Member thereof: The Head and Members make but one Body; even ſo Chriſt is the Head of his Saints, and they being many, are all Members of that one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Chriſt and all Believers make but one Myſtical Chriſt: <hi>Even as the Body is one, and hath many Members, and all the Members of that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>one Body, being many, are one Body; ſo is Chriſt,</hi> that is, Chriſt <hi>Mystical.</hi> Now this Relation of Head and Members, I ſay, holds forth this Spiritual Union between Chriſt and every Believer: <hi>We are Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bone.</hi> And it is <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 30.</note> from their Head, Jeſus Chriſt, that every Member receives Divine and Saving Influences of Life, Strength, Government and Guidance, as the Apoſtle ſhews; <hi>From whom the whole Body fitly joined together and compacted, by that which every Joint ſupplieth, according to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 15, 16.</note> 
                        <hi>working in the meaſure of every part, maketh encreaſe of the Body, unto the edifying of it ſelf in Love.</hi> Our Union with Chriſt brings us into a fixed Settlement, and ſecures us from all Fears or danger of miſcarrying, let all Enemies do what they can. Can the Members be loſt that have ſuch a Head? Our Union with Chriſt cannot conſiſt in the communication of any thing unto us as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from him the Head: But it muſt be in that which conſtitutes him and us in this Relation, (ſaith a Reverend Miniſter) he is our Head antecedently in order of <hi>Nature,</hi> to any communication of <hi>Grace</hi> from him as a Head, yet not antecedent to our Union it ſelf. Herein then conſiſts the Union of Head and Members; that tho they are many, and have many Offices, Places, and Dependencies, yet there is but one living, quickning Soul in Head and Members: The ſame Life that is in the Head, is in the Body and in every Member thereof in particular; and he that offers Violence to one Member, offers Violence to the Body and the Head alſo: And as one living Soul makes the natural Head and Members to be but one Man, one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; ſo one quickning Spirit dwelling in Chriſt, and in his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, gives them their Myſtical Union, and makes them but one Body: <hi>As the firſt Man</hi> Adam <hi>was made a living Soul, ſo the laſt</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 45.</note> 
                        <hi>Man</hi> Adam <hi>was made a quickning Spirit.</hi> It is he that quickens by his Spirit, or conveys a vital Principle to all his, by which they
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59949:118"/>
live ſpiritually, as from <hi>Adam</hi> all his live naturally: <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> So long as there is Life in Chriſt the Head, there ſhall be Life in the Members; becauſe that Life that is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Head without meaſure as Mediator, was to this very End, that it might be communicated to every believing Soul that is united to him.</p>
                     <p>Now then if it be thus, if this be the Nature of the Soul's Union with Jeſus Chriſt, that it is ſet out and opened to us by the Union that there is between the Body natural and its Members; then I infer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That by the Life that is in the Head, the Members live; and becauſe of that Life that is in him, they cannot die: it was by that Spirit that is in him that we were firſt quickned; and Life is in us, and ſhall be continued to us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I alſo infer, That if Chriſt be able, or can do it, he will prevent his loſing of any one of his Members: And for any one to ſay it is not in his Power, is Blaſphemy; and to ſay he can, and will not, is a like Evil to aſſert, becauſe it renders Chriſt leſs ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and careful of his Spiritual Members, than we are of the Members of our Natural Body. Which of us would ſuffer his <hi>Hand</hi> or <hi>Foot</hi> to be torn from us, nay, a <hi>Toe</hi> or <hi>Finger,</hi> if we could prevent it?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Furthermore I infer, That all the Members of Chriſt's My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body, as they were all given to him, ſo they are all known by him; they are ſo many Members numerically, and no more, as it is in the Body natural. In God's Book are all his Members writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of the Members of his Body; which ſome <note place="margin">Pſ. 139. 16.</note> conclude refers to Chriſt chiefly, and to the Members of his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I infer, That if Jeſus Chriſt loſes one Member of his Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body, then his Body will be an imperfect Body, a maimed Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for ſo we know it is in the natural Body, though the loſs be but of one of the leaſt Members thereof.</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> The Union between Chriſt and Believers, is ſet forth by the Union of a Tree and its Branches: <hi>Thou being a wild Olive-Tree,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>wert grafted in amongst them, and with them partakeſt of the Root and Fatneſs of the Olive-Tree.</hi> Now the Branches have a cloſe and near Union with the Tree; and being grafted into it, partake of the Juice and Fatneſs of the Root, the Tree and Branches being nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed thereby: There is the ſame fructifying and fatning Virtue
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59949:119"/>
in the one that is in the other, only with this difference, in the Root and Tree it is originally, in the Boughs or Branches by way of Communication. This is brought by the Holy Ghoſt to open the Union of Chriſt and his Saints, both he and they are partakers of the ſame Fruit-bearing Spirit; he that dwells in them, dwells in him alſo, only it is in him (as to them) originally, in them by communication from him. Take a <hi>Cyon,</hi> a Plant, a Graft, fix it <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dr.</hi> Owen.</note> to the Tree with all the Art you can, and bind it on as cloſe as poſſible, yet 'tis not united to the Tree, until the Sap that is in the Tree be communicated to it; which Communication ſtates the Union: Even ſo and in like manner let a Man be bound to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt by all Bonds of viſible Profeſſion imaginable; yet unleſs the Holy Spirit be in him to unite him to Chriſt, unleſs he hath that Divine Sap and Life communicated to him, he hath no real Union with him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But doth not our Saviour ſay, <hi>Every Branch in me that beareth not Fruit, he taketh away.</hi> And again, <hi>If a Man abideth not</hi>

2. Let it be conſidered, that there is a twofold being in Chriſt ſpoken of in God's Word; as Chriſt alſo is compared to a Vine under a twofold Conſideration.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) There is a Spiritual, Real and Inviſible being in Chriſt, by Faith and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit; and theſe are grafted into Chriſt the Vine, ſpiritually conſidered, and ſo have that true Union with him of which we ſpeak.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) There is alſo an External or Viſible being in Chriſt, by an outward profeſſion: Hence thoſe that are baptized in his Name, are ſaid to be <hi>baptized into Chriſt. Paul</hi> ſaith of ſome, that <hi>they were in Chriſt before me.</hi> How did he know who were ſavingly, inviſibly in Chriſt? No doubt he ſpeaks of their viſible being in him, by that Profeſſion they made of the Goſpel, and by their being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; and in this reſpect <hi>Vine</hi> is to be taken for the Church, which ſometimes bears Chriſt's Name. Now evident it is, many that thus are in Chriſt, that is, by a Profeſſion and Sacramental Implantation, may bring forth ſome ſort of Fruit for a while; but for want of a real Union with Chriſt, they having not a Supply of Grace, and Divine Sap from the Root, they abide not in Chriſt, that is, in a viſible Profeſſion, but are caſt forth as withered Branches, and at laſt will be caſt into the Fire. But now whoſoever bringeth forth true Spiritual Fruit, who is viſibly in Chriſt the <hi>Vine,</hi> him will God purge that he may bring forth more Fruit. And that this is the true meaning of this Text, is plain, if we conſider what Chriſt ſaith of all his Elect Ones, (as hinted to you before) <hi>viz. That he had not only choſen them, but ordained them, that they</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 15. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhould go and bring forth Fruit, and that their Fruit ſhall remain:</hi> And this he ſpeaks to his Diſciples ſoon after in this very Chapter, to comfort them, leſt they might fear miſcarrying, and become like ſuch who are <hi>withered Branches.</hi> And this is ſufficient to remove this Objection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Union of the Soul with Chriſt, as to the excellent, firm, and abiding Nature thereof, is further demonſtrated and ſtrengthened, by the conſideration of the Union of Chriſt to the Father, and them, as it is expreſſed by our bleſſed Lord; <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfect in One,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>into one:</hi> Firſt, the Father in Chriſt, the <hi>Fulneſs of the Godhead being in him bodily;</hi> then, Chriſt in Believers: ſo that from that fulneſs of Grace, Strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the Father communicated to the Son as Mediator, by virtue of his Union with him, (and which is
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59949:120"/>
communicable to us) all his Members do receive from Chriſt by virtue of their Union with him. Our Lord prayed, in Verſe 20, <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us,</hi> &amp;c. Now though it be hard to underſtand the Nature of this Union in ſome Reſpects, yet this is eaſy to comprehend, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Union between the Father and Chriſt is an inſeparable Union, it is an abiding Union, or it is a Union that cannot be diſſolved. Why then let us conſider, ſince Chriſt prayed the Father, and was heard herein, that all <hi>that the Father had given him, might be one, as He and the Father was one:</hi> What can be a greater Argument to prove, that that Union which is between Chriſt and Believers is an inſeparable, an abiding, and an undiſſolvable Union? The Union here doth not reſpect that Eſſential Union that is between the Father and the Son, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Chriſt, as he is our Head and Mediator; in which reſpect the Father poured into him of his abundant Fulneſs, that ſo we having a firm, perfect, and ſetled Union with him, might in a glorious manner receive from him, and be ſupplied with all things we need. And Chriſt being the Medium of our Union with God, both the Father's Union with Chriſt, and Chriſt's Union with us, are for the final Perfection, and compleating that Glorious Work he hath begun in the Souls of his People, until we all come to be with him where he is, and behold his Glory. If therefore we conſider the Nature of this Union, and the Prayer of Chriſt, that it might be perfected and abide undiſſolvable, it muſt follow that it is impoſſible for any Soul that is thus united to the Lord Jeſus, ever ſo to fall away as eternally to periſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By this Spiritual Union with Chriſt, we partake of his Bleſſed Image or Divine Nature: So that the Head and Members are of one kind, and not like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s <hi>Image, a Head of Gold,</hi> and a <hi>Belly and Thighs of Braſs,</hi> and <hi>Legs of Iron,</hi> and <hi>Feet</hi> and <hi>Toes,</hi> part of <hi>Iron</hi> and part of <hi>Clay:</hi> This would be to make the Myſtical Body of Chriſt a Monſter, an Immortal Head, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible Head, and a Mortal Body and Members, that may corrupt, putrify and become loathſom. No, this cannot be; ſuch as is the Head (as to Nature and Quality) ſuch is the Body, and every Member in particular, a living Head and living Members; a Head of pure Gold, and Members of pure Gold; alſo a Head that cannot die, and therefore the Members cannot die. For,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="229" facs="tcp:59949:120"/>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is a <hi>Vital Vnion,</hi> as you have heard, that is to ſay, the ſame Life that is in Chriſt, is in all Believers: And as it is in the natural Body, the Members have not only Life in the Head, but Life in themſelves alſo; and ſo long as there is Life in the Head, there ſhall be Life in the Members, ſo it is here: And this muſt therefore be for ever; for by the ſame parity of Reaſon that one Member may die or corrupt, the whole Body may die and corrupt alſo. But Chriſt is our Life, and the Spirit, which is the Bond of this Union, communicates Life to every Soul in whom he reſides and dwells; and the Holy Spirit hath taken up his abode in Believers for ever: He that hath the Spirit, hath the Son; and <hi>he that hath the Son, hath Life.—I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20, 21.</note> 
                        <hi>me.</hi> From hence I argue;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If he that believeth in Chriſt, or that hath Union with Chriſt, is a Part or Limb of Chriſt Myſtical; then not one Soul that believes in Chriſt, and has real Union with him, can eternally periſh. Shall a Member of Chriſt periſh or be torn from his Body! Brethren, was it Chriſt's Natural Body only that was concerned in that Prophecy, <hi>A Bone of him ſhall not be broken?</hi> Or did Chriſt <note place="margin">John 19. 36.</note> take more care of the Members of his Natural Body, than of the Members of his Myſtical Body?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If Chriſt's Love to, and Care of the Members of his Myſtical Body, be greater than any Man's Love to, or Care of the Members of his Natural Body can be; then not one of Chriſt's Sheep or Saints can eternally periſh: But his Love to, and Care of the Members of his Myſtical Body is far greater than theirs can be; therefore it follows, no Believer can ever periſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. If the Union between Chriſt and Believers be a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Union, and that thoſe that Chriſt does eſpouſe, and bring into that Relation to himſelf, he doth eſpouſe for ever; if it is a Union like that Union that is between God the Father, and Chriſt as Mediator; if it be an indiſſolvable Union, a Union which God nor Chriſt will ever break, nor Sin, Satan, nor no Enemy can ever break; then not one Soul that is truly and really united to Chriſt, can ever ſo fall away as eternally to periſh. But all this we have proved to be true, therefore not one Soul that hath true and real Union with Chriſt, can fall away ſo as eternally to periſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="230" facs="tcp:59949:121"/>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If the Love of God, and the Love of Chriſt abides firm for ever to every Soul that hath Union with Chriſt, which is the Spring, efficient and moving Cauſe of this Union; then not one of them who have Union with Chriſt can periſh. But we have proved that the Love of the Father and Son abides firm for ever to every Soul that has Union with Chriſt; therefore not one of them can periſh for ever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. If Chriſt died, roſe again, and aſcended into Heaven, as the Head and Repreſentative of all thoſe that were given unto him, and have Union with him, then, as ſure as he is now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they ſhall every Soul of them come thither: But this hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I ſhall fully prove, and clearly (God aſſiſting) make appear when I come to ſpeak to the next General Argument.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. If the Union between Chriſt and Believers is ſo ſtrong and firm a Union intenſively, that Chriſt and they become one Spirit ſo, that as if there was but one Spirit in Chriſt and in them; or what the Spirit is to Chriſt, and doth to Chriſt as Mediator without meaſure, he is to every Believer, and does for every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in meaſure, according to each Believer's Neceſſity and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity; then this Union ſecures every Believer from falling ſo, as to periſh for ever. But this we have proved is ſo; the Spirit muſt either deſert Chriſt (as you heard) or them, if ever the Union be broken; not Chriſt, that all will ſay is impoſſible; not Believers, becauſe of the bleſſed Union they have with him; and alſo, becauſe Chriſt hath promiſed that the Spirit ſhall abide in them for ever. Nay, this is alſo the abſolute Promiſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Son in the Covenant of Grace: <hi>And as for me, this</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 29. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>is my Covenant with them, ſaith</hi> Jehovah, <hi>My Spirit that is upon thee, and my Words which I have put in thy Mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy Mouth, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed's Seed, from henceforth and for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. By virtue of this Sacred Union, becauſe Chriſt lives, the Saints (or thoſe that have Union with him) ſhall live alſo, (which Bleſſing beſides he has by a poſitive Promiſe aſſur'd them of;) then no Soul that hath real Union with him can periſh: But this our Bleſſed Saviour doth aſſert; <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 14. 19.</note> that is, the Life of Grace here, and the Life of Glory hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                        <pb n="231" facs="tcp:59949:121"/>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. If there is no Condemnation to ſuch who are in Jeſus Chriſt, or have Union with him: if they have Everlaſting Life, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> becauſe they have Union with the Son, and are paſſed from Death <note place="margin">John 3. 36.</note> to Life, and ſhall not come into Condemnation; then this Sacred Union ſecures and ſaves all that are united to Chriſt from falling <note place="margin">John 5. 24.</note> away ſo as eternally to periſh. But that all this is true, we have proved, and it is in plain words aſſerted by the Holy Ghoſt: therefore this Sacred Union ſecures and ſaves them all from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal periſhing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 9. If <hi>Chriſt in us</hi> is a certain and ſure Ground of the Hope of Glory, and that Hope is the Anchor of the Soul both ſure <note place="margin">Col. 1. 27. Heb. 6. 18. 19, 20.</note> and ſtedfaſt, that cannot be loſt; then Union with Chriſt gives all ſuch an aſſurance of Salvation; and that none of them that have Union with Chriſt, <hi>or have Chriſt in them,</hi> can eternally periſh. But that this is ſo, the Holy Ghoſt doth poſitively aſſert; therefore none of them can ſo periſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 10. Laſtly, If Faith in the Habit of it, through which by the Spirit we come to have this Actual Union with Chriſt, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be loſt, or ſhall not fail, then none that have Union with Chriſt ſhall ever periſh. But that Faith in the Habit of it cannot be loſt, or ſhall not fail, our Saviour affirms it, being one part of his Prayer when on Earth, and no doubt it is part of his Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion now in Heaven; <hi>I have prayed for thee that thy Faith fail not:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 32.</note> And he never asked any thing of the Father but it was granted him; <hi>And I know thou heareſt me always:</hi> Therefore they can never <note place="margin">John 11. 42.</note> periſh.</p>
                     <p>I might add here that Communion which flows neceſſarily from this Union, which affords a ſtrong Argument for the Saints final Perſeverance: Union cannot be without Communion, for whilſt the Members are united to a living Head, there will be (as one <note place="margin">Charnock.</note> obſerves) an Influx of Animal Spirits whereby they ſhall partake of Life and Motion: and though a Believer, I grant, may loſe the ſenſible Experience of Communion with Chriſt, yet the Spirit from their Myſtical Head, will be working in them, providing for them, and ſtanding by them.</p>
                     <p>To conclude with this Argument, I argue,</p>
                     <p>(1.) If our Union be by the Indwelling of the Holy Spirit. (2.) If our Union with Chriſt be a Conjugal Union, a Marriage-Union. (3.) If it be as near a Union as is between the Body, the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59949:122"/>
Members of the Natural Body. (4.) If it be ſuch a Union as is between the Tree and the Branches. (5.) If it be ſuch a Union as is between the Father and Son, as Chriſt is Mediator. (6.) If it be a Union of Spirits, as if but one Soul was in two Bodies. (7.) If it be ſuch a Union, that Believers partake of the Divine Nature. (8.) If it be a Vital Union. (9.) If it be ſuch a Union that cannot be diſſolved by all the Powers of Darkneſs, the Seed of Grace remaining: Then it is impoſſible for any Believer that hath Union with Chriſt to periſh Eternally. But all theſe things are true; therefore no true Believer can Eternally periſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>APPLICATION.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Theſe things being ſo, we may infer, that our Union with Chriſt is a moſt glorious Spring of the greateſt Comfort to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers imaginable.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From hence, Brethren, comes in your Actual Juſtification: No Man is perſonally juſtified, before he receives Chriſt by Faith, before he has actual Union with him: But every Soul that is in Chriſt, is actually juſtified and diſcharged from all the Guilt of his Sins, and ſtands in Chriſt compleat in his perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without Spot, before the Throne of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such are made near and dear to Chriſt: O how near is the Wife to the Husband, or the Members to the Body! even ſo near and dear is every Soul that hath actual Union with Chriſt unto him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From hence flows our Communion with Chriſt; for by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of our Union we come to have our Natures changed: It is hereby that we come to <hi>behold, as in a Glaſs, the Glory of the Lord,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>and are changed into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> It is impoſſible that a brutiſh and ſwiniſh Creature, as all unrenewed Men and Women are, ſhould have Communion with the Holy God, or with the Holy and Bleſſed Jeſus. <hi>What Fellowſhip hath Righteouſneſs with Vnrighteouſneſs? Or</hi>

                        <hi>what Communion hath Light with Darkneſs? Or what Concord hath Chriſt with Belial?</hi> If we would have Communion with Chriſt, we muſt be Holy, and touch not the unclean thing: And impoſſible it is that we ſhould be Holy, until we come to have Union with Jeſus Chriſt, by which means we come to partake of his pure Nature, and have the evil Habits of our vile and filthy Hearts and Souls changed. The Tree muſt be firſt made good, and then
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59949:122"/>
the Fruit will be good. Man naturally is united to the Devil, and to his own Sin and Iniquity, and hath Enmity in his Heart againſt God: The Prince of Darkneſs is the Head of this dark and wicked World. The <hi>Vnderſtandings, Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> of all Men are under diabolical Influence, ever ſince <hi>Adam</hi> betrayed us into the Enemies Hands; and abide ſo, until that Union be diſſolved by the Power of Divine Grace, and the Soul united by the Spirit unto Jeſus Chriſt. We are united to the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by a Likeneſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and how can we be united to the <hi>Second</hi> without a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Life, by which another, a new Nature is formed in us? We were united to the <hi>Firſt</hi> by a living Soul; and we muſt be united to the <hi>other</hi> by a quickning Spirit. By Nature Man is dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes; and how can he have Communion with a living Chriſt without a Principle of Life? Would any go about to join a ſtinking Carcaſs to the Holy Jeſus? Would not any think it a great Plague to him, if he had a dead and rotten Carcaſs united to him? O remember it is from your Union with Chriſt, your Communion with him follows, yea, and your Communion with the Saints too; you can take no delight in Heavenly Company, nor Heavenly Things, without an Heavenly Heart.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By this Union you that are Believers come to have intereſt in, and a right unto all things Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed by his Death; nor ſhall any ever have any ſhare or part in all thoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Eternal Bleſſings, except they obtain this Union: As the <hi>Cyon</hi> cannot partake of the <hi>Sap</hi> and Fatneſs of the <hi>Olive-Tree</hi> without it is grafted into the <hi>Stock,</hi> no more can we partake of the <hi>Fatneſs</hi> and <hi>glorious Fulneſs</hi> of the <hi>true Olive</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, unleſs we are grafted into him by Faith, and have the Indwellings of the Spirit; and then all things that Chriſt merited for us, and are laid up in him for us, are ours.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is by virtue of this Union that we have, and may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Supply of all Grace according to our Wants and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities: Like as the Wife needs not to fear Want if it be in her Husband's Hand, (provided he be a loving and faithful Husband) and that by reaſon of that Union ſhe hath with him, and that Relation ſhe ſtands in unto him.

While you ſee not your Folly in keeping your Agreement and Affinity with Hell, there is but little Hope: O throw down your Arms, fight againſt God no more; when once you come to hate your old Lovers, and are reſolved to leave them, forgo them, and ſeek after this Union with Chriſt, there is ground to hope you are not far from the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

                     <p>The laſt Time I was upon the <hi>Sixth general Argument,</hi> which was taken from the Nature of that <hi>ſacred, high,</hi> and <hi>ſublime Vnion</hi> which is between Chriſt and every true Believer.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall proceed to the next Argument.</p>

See <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the Charge of God's Elect? It is God that juſtifieth.</hi> Who can implead ſuch, or put in an Accuſation againſt them, that ſhall be heard, admitted, or allowed at God's Bar? He brings in four or five Reaſons why none can. (1.) From their Election; they are God's Elect. (2.) Their Juſtification; they are actually juſtified, they are acquitted, declared Righteous in Chriſt, and that by God himſelf: <hi>It is God that juſtifieth.</hi> If the Supreme Judg, he whom they have offended, doth acquit and diſcharge them, who ſhall bring in any Accuſation againſt them? To which he adds, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died.</hi> Such a One (as our Annotators note) may throw down the <hi>Gaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> and <hi>challenge</hi> all the Enemies in the World; let <hi>Conſcience, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reaſon,</hi> the <hi>Law, Sin, Hell,</hi> the Fleſh and Devils, bring forth all they can ſay, and ſhew what they can do, yet after all they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59949:124"/>
bring under Condemnation that Soul; all that they can do will fail to condemn thoſe that Chriſt died for. The (3.) Reaſon is, becauſe <hi>'tis Chriſt that died;</hi> becauſe he died <hi>for them,</hi> that is, in their ſtead or room. Should one be condemned for High-Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King's Perſon, and he ſhould accept of another, who is his Surety, to die for him; whoſe Death, according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Kingdom, and Laws thereof, would every way ſerve and anſwer for the Offence of the guilty Criminal; and yet the King ſhould afterwards take the Offender, and hang him for that very Offence for which his Surety was put to Death; would not all cry out and ſay, it was a piece of great Injuſtice? Even ſo here, ſhould God condemn and caſt into Hell one Soul for whom, or in the room and ſtead of whom Chriſt died, would it not be great Injuſtice in God? <hi>O ſhall not the Judg and King of Heaven and Earth do right?</hi>

                        <hi>Brethren,</hi> It was God himſelf who ſubſtituted his own Son to die inſtead of the Elect, and to that End, that they ſhould not die or periſh for ever. But it may be ſome will object,</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>It is granted that Chriſt died for us, and ſatisfied for all Sins we committed before Grace, before we were called; or for all Sins againſt the Law: But if we believe not, or ſin after Grace and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we may be condemned for ever.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer; Do not theſe Men think that Chriſt did not die for Sins committed againſt the Goſpel, and for the Sin of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, even for all ſuch Sins that a Believer does commit after Grace and Regeneration, as well as Sins againſt the Law, or Sins committed before they were renewed? Alas, how long do ſome of God's Elect Ones continue in a State of Unbelief, and refuſe the Offers of the Goſpel, before they do believe and cloſe with Chriſt? Why now, if Chriſt did not die for thoſe Sins, (which were committed againſt the Goſpel) as alſo for the Sins they do commit after they are in a State of Grace, there is not one Soul can be ſaved, becauſe <hi>without ſhedding of Blood there is no remiſſion;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22.</note> that is, without the ſhedding of Chriſt's Blood: <hi>It is the Blood of</hi>

Object. <hi>I like not, ſay ſome, your Notion,</hi> viz. <hi>That Chriſt died in our ſtead or room: For though he died for our good, yet not in our ſtead, I doubt of that: And if you can make it appear that he ſo died for us as you affirm, namely, in the room or ſtead of all his Elect, then your Argument is not to be anſwered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer; That Jeſus Chriſt did not ſuffer Death for our Good only, but in our room or ſtead, alſo I ſhall prove and make clearly to appear.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This Notion (if you will ſo call it) of Chriſt dying for us, muſt denote his dying in our ſtead; becauſe it is ſo always gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken, when one Perſon is ſaid to <hi>die for another,</hi> one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and another dies for him, that is, <hi>in his Room,</hi> to ſave the guilty Perſon from Death. And ſhould not this be granted, we ſhould be all confounded, and not know either what Men or the Scripture means, when they ſay, ſuch a Man, ſuch a Perſon, died for another, or for others, when the Perſon for whom that great Love and Favour was ſhewed to, was as a Criminal, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die; which moved his Friend or Surety to ſtep in and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Penalty for him, or in his ſtead. Now it was ſo here, we were all Criminals, guilty of the higheſt Treaſon againſt the God of Heaven; and were by the holy Law of our offended Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, condemned to die, and to bear Eternal Wrath; and our Bleſſed Saviour was choſen in our room, and given up as an Act of the Father's Infinite Love and Favour (and as an Act of no leſs Love, Favour and Compaſſion in Chriſt) to die for us, and to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy Divine Juſtice for us, or to bear the Puniſhment we were to have born, and muſt (had not he born it for us) for ever.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Is it not plainly foretold, that <hi>the Meſſiah ſhould be cut off,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>but not for himſelf?</hi> Now ſince he had no Sin of his own, and yet was <hi>cut off for Sin,</hi> it follows, he was put in our Place, and ſtood charged with our Guilt or Debt, and ſo was <hi>penally cut off;</hi> he was cut off for us, to ſave us from Divine Wrath and Vengeance: It was not for himſelf, it was not for the fallen Angels; it was therefore for us, that we might not die, but live eternally.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Pray, Brethren, ſee what our Saviour ſaith upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; <hi>Greater Love hath no Man than this, that a Man lay down his</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 15. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>Life for his Friends.</hi> Can this Expreſſion intend any thing more or leſs, than in the room or ſtead of his Friend, or die for them? Thus Chriſt died. <hi>Even the Juſt for the Vnjuſt;</hi> the Juſt in the place or <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 18.</note> ſtead of the Unjuſt, or us the guilty Perſons. <hi>Hereby perceive we the Love of God; Becauſe he laid down his Life for us, we ought to lay</hi>
                        <pb n="238" facs="tcp:59949:125"/>
                        <hi>down our Life for the Brethren.</hi> Theſe Texts fully prove the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; He that lays down his Life for his Brother, or dies for the Brethren, dies in their ſtead to ſave them from Death, as ſome have done: <hi>For ſcarcely for a righteous Man will one die; yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>for a good Man ſome would even dare to die. But God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his Love towards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>, in that while we were yet Sinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> Now then ſeeing Chriſt underwent Death, and bore that Puniſhment that was due for Sins, and there being no Cauſe in himſelf why he ſhould ſuffer that Pain and Penalty, it unavoidably follows, that it was becauſe he ſtood in our Place charged with our Offences.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Again, it muſt be thus taken and underſtood, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord laid on him the Iniquity of us all:</hi> Our Sins were made <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 6, 7.</note> to meet in him<hi>—He was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our Iniquities.</hi> It was not by Chriſt's praying and interceding to the Father for us to forgive us our Iniquities; No, no, that was not enough, it was his dying for them: <hi>He bore our Sins in his own Body on the Tree.</hi> He prayed again and again, but that Cup could not paſs by; if we are delivered and ſaved from our Sins, he muſt die, nay his Soul muſt be made an Offering for Sin.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That Chriſt died in our ſtead, will further appear, becauſe <hi>he was made Sin for us, that knew no Sin. He bore the Sins of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21. Iſa. 53. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>many,</hi> that is, the Puniſhment of them. Our Sins were charged upon him, though he had no Sin of his own in <hi>a moral Senſe,</hi> but was pure from all Iniquity; yet in a <hi>judicial Senſe</hi> he was made Sin, as he was conſtituted and put in the Sinner's Place, dying and making Satisfaction in our ſtead, as our bleſſed Head and Surety. And how frivolous is the Cavil of the Socinians, who would have it be underſtood, where it is ſaid, Chriſt was <hi>made Sin,</hi> that <hi>he was accounted a Sinner by wicked Men.</hi> This cannot be the meaning of the Place, becauſe as he was made Sin for us that knew no Sin, ſo it was <hi>that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> Do wicked Men account Believers to be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him? Or does not God look upon us, or count us in him ſo to be?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But why is it ſaid by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>But when the fulneſs of Time was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4, 5.</note> 
                        <hi>the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law?</hi> &amp;c. Had he not ſtood in our Law-place, why is it thus expreſſed? Certainly God ſaw it neceſſary to ſubſtitute him, and to accept of him in our ſtead; and therefore he was made under the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> he was
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59949:125"/>
obliged to keep the Law perfectly for us, God requiring that of us in order to Juſtification, which we being fallen, were not able to do, therefore he did it for us, and in our Nature; being <hi>made of a Woman,</hi> he took our Nature upon him, and ſuffered Death, making a full and compleat Satisfaction for our Breach thereof; whoſe Sufferings and Obedience, upon the account of his being God as well as Man, had an infinite Worth and Merit in them. And if this which the Apoſtle ſaith in this place, doth not prove that he ſuffered in our room, I muſt confeſs I know nothing of this great Goſpel-Myſtery.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That he ſuffered, not only for our Good or Profit, but alſo in our <hi>room</hi> and <hi>ſtead,</hi> doth further appear, becauſe it is ſaid, He <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 24.</note>
                        <hi>died for our Sins; Who was delivered for our Offences, and roſe again for our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> "This <hi>Particle,</hi> ſaith a Learned Man,<note place="margin">

So that from the whole we may confidently conclude, that Chriſt did not only ſuffer for our Good, but in our room.</p>

8. <hi>Chriſt was once offered to bear the Sins of many.</hi> Now to bear <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 28.</note> Sin, uſually in Scripture-Phraſe, is to bear the Puniſhment of Sin, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. 1. &amp; 7. 8. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 33. <hi>He hath born our Griefs, and carried our Sorrows.

                     <p n="9">9. If all the other pretended Grounds and Cauſes are frivolous and vain, that Men bring of <hi>Chriſt's dying for us, ſuffering for us,</hi> beſides this of dying in our ſtead or room; then that is the proper and only meaning thereof: but all other pretended Grounds are vain and frivolous. How idle is it for any to ſay, He died only to remove or take away the <hi>rigid Law of Works,</hi> and to merit a milder Law of Grace? Which ſeems to imply, as if God repented he ever gave the Law of perfect Obedience: Or as if God could allow of Sin; or elſe, as if the Law of perfect Obedience did not reſult from his Holy Nature, but that he might have given a Law at firſt, like their new Law of Grace: Or according to others, that he died to fulfil and take away the Ceremonial Law, and to be a Pattern of Abaſement, Humility, and Self-denial. Now had that been, could not God have ſubſtituted <hi>Peter</hi> to have been ſuch a Pattern as well as his own Son, and ſet him up as an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; or elſe ſome other moſt choice and renowned Saint or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; or have cauſed and Angel to be <hi>incarnate</hi> to have done it, that we might have followed his Steps? And how vain is that which ſome of the <hi>Arminians</hi> aſſert, <hi>viz.</hi> That he died to ſatisfy for Original Sin, or for the Breach of the firſt Covenant, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Salvation upon the Condition of Repentance, Faith and Obedience, or to merit God's Acceptance of the Creature's Faith, Love, Holineſs, and ſincere Obedience, inſtead of perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law of Works, ſo that God is become reconcilable through Chriſt's Death? But that he may be actually reconciled, lies wholly upon the Creature as his part; and thus he died for the Good of all Men, but not in the place or ſtead of any one. Now by this Notion, Salvation is principally wrought out by the Creature, God having put Man into a Condition or Capacity to work it out for himſelf: And according to this Notion Man may or may not be ſaved, God having left the whole of Salvation, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the making Chriſt's Death to become effectual, to the <hi>Will</hi> of Man. So that <hi>Man's Will,</hi> as I before intimated, determines the Caſe, whether Chriſt's Death ſhall effect any Eternal Bleſſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sinners in general, or to any one Sinner in particular, or not.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59949:126"/>
God (as one of them once preached) puts Man into a Capacity <hi>to work and to do,</hi> but works not in any <hi>the Will or the Deed of his own good Pleaſure.</hi> Now how falſe and frivolous all theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Grounds or Deſigns of Chriſt's Death are, I have already ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>Arg. 1. And from the firſt Argument taken from the Death of Chriſt, I argue thus; <hi>All thoſe that Jeſus Chriſt died in the room or ſtead of ſhall never die or eternally periſh. But Chriſt died in the room or ſtead of all his Elect, or all ſuch who believe and are his Sheep; therefore not one of them ſhall die, or eternally periſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Arg. 2. <hi>If Chriſt died for all the Sins of his Elect, both before Grace, or before they are called; and for thoſe committed after Grace, or after they are called, ſo that they might not be condemned for any of them; then none of them can eternally periſh. But this I have proved; therefore none of them ſhall ever eternally periſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Death of Chriſt doth deliver every true Believer <note place="margin">Chriſt hath delivered all Believers from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</note> from Eternal Wrath and Condemnation, I prove thus; Becauſe the Sufferings of Chriſt, or the Sacrifice of Chriſt, is imputed to them, or is accounted to them that do believe: This follows from what I ſaid laſt, He took our Sins upon himſelf, and ſatisfied for them, as if he had actually ſinned, and freely of his own Grace gives us the Benefit of his Suffering, as if we had actually ſuffered; our Sin was imputed to him, that his Righteouſneſs and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence might be imputed to us, even both that which is called his <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Paſſive Obedience.</hi> Sin was imputed to Chriſt, yea, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sin we have, or ever ſhall commit; ſo that in Chriſt we have born already all that Vindictive Wrath and Vengeance of God that was due to them, according to his Holy Law and Threatning denounced againſt us. Chriſt and his Elect are as one Perſon, or as one entire Corporation; and what he did, was as if every one that he repreſents had done it.

                     <p>The Juſtice of God hath nothing to lay to the Charge of God's Elect, becauſe it is Chriſt that died; he whoſe Death hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Worth and Satisfaction in it: this is the Apoſtle's very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; If God's Juſtice is ſatisfied, and his Wrath appeaſed in Chriſt's Death; if our bleſſed <hi>Jonah</hi>'s being thrown into the Sea of Divine Wrath, hath made ſo <hi>ſweet a Calm,</hi> that God declares in him, <hi>i. e.</hi> in his Son, he is <hi>well-pleaſed,</hi> and that <hi>Fury is not in him</hi> now no more for ever towards Believers; who can or ſhall <note place="margin">Iſa. 27. 4.</note> then condemn them?

                        <hi>He was made Sin,</hi> without knowing Sin: He knew the Guilt by Imputation, but he knew not Sin any otherwiſe, neither Original nor Actual; He was born without Sin, and lived without Sin, <hi>in his Mouth was found no Guile:</hi> yet he had our Sins upon him, and carried them away; he being the Antitype of the <hi>ſlain Goat,</hi> ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for all our Sins; and as he is the Antitype of the live Goat, he hath born them away for ever.</p>

1. Becauſe Chriſt hath by his Death delivered them from the Curſe of the Law, as well as from the Guilt of Sin; the Law is the Strength of Sin, it is by that Sin condemneth the Sinner: The Law lays every Man under the Wrath and Curſe of God; and unleſs it be anſwered, God might be ſaid to change his Will ſhould he juſtify any Man; nay, it would ſeem to reflect upon his Holineſs: the Precepts muſt perfectly be kept by Man, or his Surety; the Breach we had made of it by Sin muſt be ſatisfied, for, both theſe Jeſus Chriſt hath done, not for himſelf; he needed not to have come to keep the Law to juſtify himſelf, for as God he is infinite Holy; but as Mediator he did this for us, he obtained a perfect Robe or Righteouſneſs to give away and put on us; <hi>He hath brought in everlaſting Righteouſneſs, and made an end of Sin.</hi> How made an <note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note> end of Sin? Not that there ſhall be no Sin any more in the World; No, but he has made an end of the condemning Power of it; the ſtrength it had to kill and damn the Soul is took away for ever from all that believe, from all that he hath put his Righteouſneſs upon. God's juſtice being ſatisfied, we are furniſhed with an <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>compleat Righteouſneſs,</hi> that ſhall laſt for ever; 'tis an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Righteouſneſs that every Believer hath in Chriſt. <hi>Who therefore ſhall condemn? Chriſt hath delivered us from the Curſe of the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 4. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Law, being made a Curſe for us.</hi> Sin is our Sickneſs, Sin is that by which we ſtand charged, and the Law condemns us, pronounces a Curſe againſt us; but Chriſt hath cured us of this Sickneſs, and delivered us from this Curſe: <hi>As it is written, Curſed is every one</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>that continueth not in all things that are written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</hi> Till we believed, we lay under that fearful Curſe; but from this we are diſcharged, and Chriſt hath undergone that great Curſe for us, and there is no other Curſe can come on Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; all ſeparation from God and Wrath is by the Curſe of Law: but this is ended and gone for ever to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth. Nothing therefore now can ſeparate them from God, the Curſe is taken away, and the Bleſſing is put on us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From hence it appears that the Veracity of God is ingaged to acquit all them that believe in Chriſt, as his Juſtice is obliged to leave Sinners under the Curſe of the Law that believe not, becauſe nothing but a perfect Righteouſneſs can deliver from the Curſe thereof.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Moreover, God is obliged, upon the account of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with his Son for us, to diſcharge us for ever, becauſe Chriſt hath fully performed all things as the federal Conditions of our
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59949:128"/>
Reſtoration and Deliverance from Sin, and the Curſe of the Law, which he covenanted to do.</p>
                     <p>Arg. 5. <hi>All that are delivered from the Curſe of the Law, and to whom there remains no more any legal and juſt Cauſe in God of Wrath and Separation from him unto their Eternal Condemnation, cannot eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally periſh. But all that believe in Chriſt are delivered from the Curſe of the Law, and to them there remains no more any legal and juſt Cauſe in God of Wrath and Separation from him unto their eternal Condemnation: therefore no Believer ſhall eternally periſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Chriſt dying for our Sins, was a full and compleat Pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Chriſt hath born all God's Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive Wrath due to Believers.</note> of all our Debts, which bound us over to Death and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; we owed ten thouſand Talents, and Chriſt our Surety was charged with it, even with all we owed to Juſtice; and by his Death he paid the uttermoſt Farthing: Now the Principal and the Surety are legally and judicially one Perſon; ſo that in Chriſt we paid all, though it was God and not we that found out the Surety, and paid himſelf with his own Money; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are acquitted in a way of Sovereign Grace; we have it in a way of Mercy, though in a way of Righteouſneſs alſo: <hi>That</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>From whence I argue;</p>
                     <p>Arg. 6. <hi>All thoſe for whom Chriſt hath paid all their Debts, or made a full Compenſation for, ſhall never periſh. But Chriſt hath paid all the Debts of Believers, or made a full Compenſation for them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall never periſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Would it not be look'd upon as an Act of Injuſtice in a Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to arreſt and throw a poor Debtor into Priſon for thoſe Debts his Surety paid for him, and laid down every Farthing of his Money? Now then ſay I, either ſome of the Sins of Believers, or ſome of their Debts Jeſus Chriſt did not die for, pay, or ſatisfy for, or elſe all muſt conclude it is impoſſible (becauſe God is Juſt) any one of them ſhould periſh.</p>
                     <p>Now who is it that dares to affirm, that Chriſt did not die and ſatisfy for all the Sins of Believers, or for his Elect Ones? <hi>If we</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 John 1. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>confeſs our Sins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanſe us from all Vnrighteouſneſs.</hi> He will not exact from us the Satisfaction which he hath accepted in the Atonement of his own Son our Surety, and in his own way applied; God will not require double Payment.</p>

                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:59949:129"/>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> From the Death of Chriſt I further argue; No Believer can eternally periſh, becauſe his Death was the higheſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Expreſſion and Demonſtration of Divine Love, both in the Father and Son. Now ſay I, (as I hinted once before) He that gave the great Gift, will not deny the leſſer: Sure if God gave his Son to die for our Sins, he will give us Grace to reſiſt Sin, to mortify Sin, and will alſo pardon all our Sins: And if Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us, ſpilt his Blood for us, he will pray for us, he will not refuſe to intercede for us, that our Faith may not fail, or we loſe the Benefit and Bleſſings purchaſed for us by his Death.</p>
                     <p>He that would not pray for his Friend, or for his Neighbour, will not die for him: But on the other Hand, if he yields him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to die for him, he will pray for him. Chriſt died for his Sheep, he will therefore both feed them, heal their Diſeaſes, and preſerve them, that they may not be devoured by any Enemy whatſoever; neither by Sin, nor the Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32.</p>

Do they need Faith, need Patience, need Power againſt Sin, need Pardon, need Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all theſe things, and whatſoever elſe they ſtand in need of, they ſhall have: <hi>My God ſhall ſupply all your need according to</hi>

Will God, think you, ſuffer this, ſince his main Deſign in the Gift of Chriſt, is the Glory of his own Rich and Sovereign Grace? Nay, and after he has with ſuch large Expence of rich Treaſure, and ſuch Pains reſtored his <hi>loſt Image</hi> to a poor Believer, will he ſuffer Sin and Satan utterly to deface it again whilſt he looks on? <hi>Our Oppoſites</hi> are Men for <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon.</hi> Now Sirs, what think you of this; is there any reaſon for you to believe God will ſuffer either of theſe things to be done?</p>

                     <p>Arg. 7. <hi>If therefore Chriſt's Blood was not ſhed for none in vain, but that he ſhall have his whole Purchaſe; then none of his Sheep or Elect Ones ſhall ever periſh. But Chriſt's Blood was ſhed for none in vain; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhall have his full Purchaſe, none of his Elect ſhall periſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No Man would lay down a Sum more in value than a whole Kingdom, but would firſt ſee himſelf ſure of it, upon laying down that Price: the Father's Covenant and Promiſe alſo made all the Elect certain of Eternal Life upon Chriſt's dying for them. Beſides,</p>

                        <hi>Beloved,</hi> the Sacrifice of Chriſt unites all the Holy Attributes together to ſecure a Believer's Intereſt; <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> are both agreed in Chriſt, they meet together, and kiſs each other, yea, and join Hands to help and ſave every Believer. The Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of Mercy are opened, and the Fire of Divine Wrath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd in its Flames, or rather quenched by the Streams of Chriſt's Blood, that Mercy might flow down to us abundantly: Chriſt's Blood hath eternal Virtue in it, it is called <hi>the Blood of the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant,</hi> therefore extendeth to the Expiation of Sins to come, as well as what are already paſt. <hi>Chriſt's Death</hi> hath glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Effects, as the Apoſtle ſhews: <hi>For if the Blood of Bulls and Goats, and Aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the Fleſh; how much more ſhall the Blood of Chriſt, who through the Eternal Spirit offered himſelf to God, purge your Conſciences from dead Works to ſerve the living God?</hi> To talk of Chriſt's Death, and ſee no Effects of it, alas, what's that?

                     <p n="4">4. And as to you Sinners, is not here Ground of Hope for you? Chriſt died for the chiefeſt of Sinners; <hi>And whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth</hi>

                     <p n="5">5. This may ſerve alſo to detect ſuch, and ſeverely to reprehend <note place="margin">Aſſertors of General Redemption reprehended.</note> them that ſay, Chriſt died to ſave all, or for all, and every Man and Woman in the World. Brethren, if he died for all, that is, in the Stead and Room of all, then all ſhall be ſaved; God will not condemn ſuch whom Chriſt laid down his Life for, or in the place or ſtead of, as I have proved from God's Word. But further, to detect this Error of General Redemption,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Conſider, that Redemption is a Word eaſy to underſtand; it is the ſaving of a Perſon, that is in Slavery or Captivity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly procured or obtained by a Price paid, or a Ranſom: but if the Perſon is indeed redeemed, he is ſet at Liberty. To ſay a Man is redeemed, and yet left in Chains and ſtrong Bonds, out of which he cannot come, unleſs the Redeemer break thoſe Chains and Bonds to pieces, is to ſpeak untruly, or in plain Engliſh, a Lie. Now are all Men redeemed? Redemption cannot be more univerſal than it is in Matter of Fact. If ten Men were in Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in <hi>Argiers,</hi> and a Sum of Money was paid to redeem them, and yet after all, care is not taken to make that Ranſom to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual for their Redemption, but ſix or ſeven of them are left in Captivity; can any Man ſay all the ten were redeemed out of that Slavery and Thraldom wherein they are held? Even ſo it is here; for Men to ſay, that the Redemption by Chriſt is for all the World, and yet the greateſt part of Mankind lie in Bonds, under the Power of Sin and Satan, and have not the Death of Chriſt made effectual to them, is a great Miſtake, and indeed not true as to Matter of Fact.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Are we redeemed only from the Curſe of the Law, and from the Wrath of God; and are we not alſo redeemed from Sin, and from being under the Power of Satan? That Redemption that is by Chriſt, is (you hear) from all Iniquity; and are all ſo redeemed? The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Foraſmuch as ye know that ye were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed</hi>

                        <hi>but with the precious Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. So many as are, and ſhall be redeemed from all Iniquity, from a vain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation or whom Chriſt hath redeemed from the Power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, he ſetting them at Liberty who naturally are bound, and bringing them out of the Priſon-Houſe, ſo many, and no more, did he die for; and no further doth Redemption by Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If there are many left in the Enemies Hand, and under their Power, and eternally periſh, then there is no general or univerſal Redemption; but there are Multitudes ſo left, and periſh.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That Grace, Love, and bleſſed Price that doth not procure Univerſal Salvation, is not, cannot be an Univerſal Redemption. But God never ſhewed ſuch Grace and Love by the Price of Chriſt's Blood that doth procure Univerſal Salvation; therefore there is no Univerſal Redemption: for that Price or Paiment which doth not actually paſs or terminate in Salvation, is no Redemption at all: an Attempt to redeem unleſs it be effected, is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Brethren, is Chriſt an Univerſal Saviour of the Souls of all Men? Why there can be no Univerſal Redemption, unleſs there be an Univerſal Redeemer, (as I ſaid before) but there is no ſuch Univerſal Redeemer.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>We do not plead for an abſolute Vniverſal Redemption, but for a Conditional; and that Condition is to be performed by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and many periſh becauſe they do not perform it; the Condition is Faith, Regeneration, Sincere Obedience, and Holineſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Condition they ſay is Repentance, Faith and Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Now were it thus, as theſe Men affirm, then how is Chriſt rendred, even more weak and inconſiderate than any Man of Underſtanding? For what Man would lay down ten thouſand Pounds to redeem a Captive out of <hi>Slavery,</hi> when he knew a cruel Tyrant had him in his Hands and in ſtrong Chains, and would not let him go, nor regard at all the Sum laid down for his Ranſom, there being no treating with him: he' I take no Price; but unleſs he is conquered, and the Perſon redeemed by Power, the Money is loſt. This is the Caſe, Chriſt's Blood is the Ranſom that was laid down to ſatisfy the Law and Juſtice of God; but all and every Man and Woman in the World is under the Power of Sin and Satan: and unleſs Chriſt delivers the Soul out of the Hands of theſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by the Power of his own Arm, his Blood would be of none
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59949:132"/>
Effect to redeem any one Soul. Therefore God by this Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Univerſal Redemption, rather ſeems to mock Men, according to theſe Mens Notion; for this is the purport of it, <hi>You are redeemed, Sinner, yea all of you by Chriſt's Death, if you can redeem your ſelves.</hi> Do but your part, and you are redeemed: What is that? Why anſwer the Conditions, <hi>viz.</hi> change your own evil Hearts, make you a new Heart, believe in Chriſt; get out of Satan's Chains; raiſe your ſelves from the Dead, and you ſhall be redeemed. Is this poſſible? Strange! doth the Righteous God make that the Condition of Salvation on the Creature's Part, which he knew the Creature was no more able to do than to give ſight to the Blind, or raiſe the Dead?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Beſides, it renders Chriſt to be but a Conditional Redeemer, could the Creature anſwer the Condition; yea, and it puts Chriſt but into a poſſibility alſo of being a Redeemer, (as one well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) he is not actually ſo whilſt he ſtands under that Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onality; <note place="margin">Examen confectionis pacificae.</note> for the Conditionality doth not only lie upon the Perſon to be redeemed, ſo that he cannot be a redeemed One, till the Condition is performed: But it puts alſo a Bar to the Purchaſer, he can't in any good ſenſe be called the Redeemer of ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, 'till the Perſon hath performed the Condition. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if I lay down an hundred Pounds for the Redemption of a Perſon in Slavery, upon this Condition that he yield to ſerve me ſeven Years after, I muſt have his Conſent to theſe Terms before I can redeem him; and therefore upon this Condition I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuſpended from being a Redeemer, and am no Redeemer to the ſaid Perſon, if he refuſe the Terms; all that I have done is but a Proffer of Terms. Hence (ſaith the ſaid Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) for Chriſt to be a Conditional Univerſal Redeemer, is a Contradiction; for it's to be but a Redeemer of ſome that perform the Condition, and no Redeemer to them who do not.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. To which let me add, this Notion of Conditional Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, renders Salvation not to be freely of God's Grace, no not the very Purchaſe it ſelf; becauſe in the Deſign of it, it was not to be had without the Creatures Money, I mean without his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the Condition of <hi>Repentance, Faith, Regeneration, and final Perſeverance,</hi> &amp;c. which to do, they deny Chriſt's purchaſed Grace and Power for all or any one; or hath he promiſed to perform it for them, or to work it in them? No, but it is that which abſolutely the Creature muſt find Power, Strength, and Skill to do, or periſh for ever, the Redemption being intended for
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59949:133"/>
him on no other Terms: all depends on the <hi>Will</hi> of Man, 'tis as Man's <hi>Will</hi> determines it.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Moreover, who can ſuppoſe Chriſt would ſhed his Blood, and lay down ſuch an infinite Sum, to redeem ſuch whom he knew would not anſwer thoſe Conditions propounded? Nay, and which is worſe, to lay down his Life to redeem Multitudes upon ſuch Conditions, which he knew they were no more able to perform, than to create a World? Can this ſtand conſiſtent with the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs of Jeſus Chriſt? This Aſſertion of theirs (ſaith the ſame Author) is as if they ſhould ſay, <hi>A. B.</hi> purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an Eſtate for me, and in my Name, upon Condition that I ſhould take up the <hi>Monument</hi> and carry it over the Bridg.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. All thoſe that have Redemption, or that Chriſt died to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, have or ſhall have remiſſion of Sin: But the greateſt part of Men have not, nor ever ſhall have remiſſion of Sin, therefore Chriſt did not die for the greateſt part of the World; Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Forgiveneſs of Sins is of equal extent.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Again, I might argue thus; Thoſe that Chriſt did not pray for, he did not die for; thoſe that he never would put up one Prayer, one Sigh to the Father for, certainly he never purchaſed Remiſſion of Sins and Eternal Life for: <hi>I pray for them, I pray not</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>for the World; but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine.</hi> Now it is eaſy to know what World it was Chriſt prayed not for; namely, thoſe that were not given to him by the Father; for all that were of the World, that did belong to the Election of Grace, though then under the Power of Sin and Unbelief, he did pray for: <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>believe on me through their Words:</hi> the Elect, whilſt Sinners, may be called the World as well as any others.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. If Chriſt died for all, he intended to ſave all: But Chriſt did not intend to ſave all; therefore he did not die for all. Strange! will any ſay our Lord Jeſus did that which was contrary to his Purpoſe and Intertion? And if it was his Intention to ſave all, who could fruſtrate him in it? Why then are not all ſaved? Sirs, the Death of Chriſt cannot extend to the Salvation of any one Soul, further than the Intention and Purpoſe of God, or the Election of the Father, and Application of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Thoſe that Chriſt died for, he purchaſed Grace for, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin for; and all things in order to make the Redemption of his Blood effectual unto, he purpoſed to beſtow the leſſer Grace and Gift upon them, as well as the greater. Would a Man give
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59949:133"/>
a <hi>Million</hi> to purchaſe ſuch an Eſtate for a Man, and will he refuſe to part with <hi>five Pounds</hi> in order to have it made ſure to him for whom he laid down ſo great a Sum?</p>
                     <p n="12">12. That Purchaſe of Remiſſion of Sin, and Salvation, that <note place="margin">Examen confectionis pacificae.</note> leaves Men under a Certainty of Damnation, is not eſteemed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption at all; but a Purchaſe of Remiſſion and Salvation, upon the Condition theſe Men talk of, leaves moſt under a Certainty of Damnation, becauſe it is an impoſſible Condition in reſpect of Man, he being <hi>dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes,</hi> therefore can't perform it; and alſo in reſpect of Chriſt, becauſe he never purchaſed Grace for them to enable them to perform that Condition.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. If the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt ſhall have its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Effect, to the Eternal Salvation of all them for whom he died; as a Corn of Wheat that falleth into the Ground, or is ſown in the Earth, in that reſpect hath its Effect; then all for whom he died ſhall be ſaved: But his Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall have like Effect; ſee his own Words, <hi>And Jeſus anſwered them, ſaying, The Hour is come that the Son of Man ſhould be glorified. Verily verily I ſay unto you,</hi>

                        <hi>Except a Corn of Wheat fall into the Ground, and die, it abideth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much Fruit.</hi> See here, all that are and ſhall be ſaved, our Lord aſcribeth unto his Death as the abſolute Effect thereof; all his Elect being virtually in him, as all the Increaſe virtually is in that one <hi>Corn of Wheat</hi> that is ſown into the Earth, that is produced by it.</p>

                     <p>"5.

                     <p>"6. He that died to redeem all, died inſtead of all. But Chriſt did not die in the room or ſtead of all.

                     <p>"7. It is not fit Chriſt ſhould die for all, ſeeing his Father elected not all, and gave not all to him; for Chriſt to redeem more, were to diſobey his Father's Will, and not to do it. If any ſay God elected all, it's moſt abſurd to talk of chuſing ſome from among many others. When a Man takes the whole Number, this is no Election: or if any ſay that Election is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, provided a Man will, this alſo is no Election; for if Election be upon the Condition of Man's free Will, one Man is not choſen and not another; but all have equal previous Deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the End, and ſo there is no Election at all."</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>take away the Sin of the World:</hi> What World <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 29.</note> is that which Chriſt takes away the Sin of? I affirm, there is not one Sin taken away from the World, nor one in the World, but only of ſuch that Believe, (of the Adult): all Unbelievers are under the Guilt and Puniſhment of Original Sin, and Death is to ſuch a Fruit of the Curſe ſtill, which God denounced againſt <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 In one ſenſe he may be ſaid to buy or ſave the whole World, <hi>i. e.</hi> externally; for it was by Chriſt's Mediation and Death this World was ſaved (and all in it) from periſhing immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sin and Fall of Man: <hi>all live, move, and have their being in him as God,</hi> and through him as <hi>Mediator;</hi> he is in this reſpect the <hi>Saviour of all Men;</hi> but eſpecially, or with an eſpecial and eternal <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 10.</note> Salvation, he ſaves none but <hi>them that do believe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So much ſhall ſerve as to this Objection, and at this Time.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Sermon XIII.</note>BELOVED, the laſt Day I was upon that Grand Argument, to prove, <hi>That none of Chriſt's Sheep can fall away, ſo as eternally to periſh,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi>) taken from the Death of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>I ſhewed you that <hi>Chriſt died in their ſtead;</hi> he bore all that <hi>Vindictive Wrath</hi> that was due to them for their Sins, ſo that they might never bear it, or ſuffer in Hell.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now proceed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eighthly,</hi> My next Argument ſhall be taken from the Effects of Chriſt's Death and Reſurrection. Though I have ſpoken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">The Eighth Argument taken from the Effects of Chriſt's Death and Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> already touching the Effects of the Death of Chriſt, yet I ſhall, before I paſs it, add ſomething further to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> We have ſhewed you, that the appeaſing of God's Wrath was the Effects of the Death of Chriſt; he put an end to all <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive Wrath</hi> and Vengeance that was due to all Believers or Elect Ones: The <hi>Pangs of Hell</hi> due to us, ſeized upon him, and he bore it in our ſtead upon the Croſs: He was <hi>delivered for our Offence,</hi> and roſe again for our Juſtification. Now when Chriſt was diſcharged, all his Elect were virtually diſcharged alſo, becauſe he ſuffered and roſe again <hi>as a publick Perſon,</hi> repreſenting all that were given to him by the Father: thoſe things which he did in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in this reſpect, we are ſaid to do together with him. Brethren, the benefit of his Performances doth redound unto us; we are ſaid to <hi>die with him,</hi> and to be quickned together with him, and entred <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 5, 6. Col. 2. 12, 13.</note> into the Holy Place with him; the whole Victory over Sin and Death being obtained, and the Quarrel removed; the condemning Power of Sin being deſtroyed: all things about making an end of Sin are done and paſſed through. Now what ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He that is dead, hath ceaſed from Sin.</hi> Well, what of this? Likewiſe, <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 1.</note> ſaith he, <hi>Reckon ye alſo your ſelves to be dead indeed unto Sin; but</hi>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:59949:136"/>
                        <hi>alive unto God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Knowing that Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 10, 11.</note> 
                        <hi>raiſed from the Dead, dieth no more; Death hath no more Power over him.</hi> Now this being done by us, and for us in our Head, can we henceforth die any more? Shall Eternal Death have Dominion over us? No, no, we are to reckon our ſelves to be as abſolutely freed and diſcharged from Sin and Eternal Death, as Chriſt is diſcharged and freed from Death, and dieth no more: And this comes to us as the Effects of his Death, by his ſuffering for us, and in our room. <hi>If one died for all, then were all dead,</hi> (that is, all <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 15.</note> thoſe for whom he died) they were dead, and died likewiſe with him their Sponſor, and are delivered from the Curſe due for Sin; ſo that we now might and ſhall <hi>live to him that died for us, and roſe again.</hi> This was the End of his Death, and is or will be the Effect thereof on all for whom he died.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, Reconciliation,</hi> from hence it doth appear is alſo another <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Chriſt's Death.</hi> Eph. 2. 16.</note> Effect of Chriſt's Death. The Deſign of God was to bring us to Happineſs; and this he doth as the Effects of the Death of his own Son the Lord Jeſus, <hi>who hath made our Peace by the Blood of his Croſs. He hath reconciled both Jews and Gentiles to God in one Body, having ſlain the Enmity thereby.</hi> Divine Juſtice, you heard the laſt Day, has nothing to charge upon God's Elect, <hi>becauſe it is Chriſt that died.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 34.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Obſerve; Chriſt's Death hath reconciled God to us: <hi>When we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. And then alſo, as an Effect and Fruit of his Death, he having obtained the Spirit for us, we are actually reconciled to God: And thus <hi>our Days-man lays his Hands upon both;</hi> he brings God to us, and us to God; he is not the Mediator of one, but God is one: <hi>There is one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Therefore as the Effects of Chriſt's Death and Reſurrection, Reconciliation is made with God for us, and that for ever: it is not a Peace made for ſuch a time, or for ſo long, but for ever, ſo that there ſhall never be any deſtructive Breach any more, no more War between God and Believers; let Sin and Satan do what they can, they cannot break this League of Peace and Amity. 'Tis not a Peace upon Condition that we are to keep, and may break it; No, no, the Peace was made by Chriſt, and he that made it, maintains it, as he ſits upon the Throne: He it was that made it as he is a Prieſt, and he maintains it <hi>as he is a King upon the Throne;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Zech. 6. 13.</note>
                        <pb n="259" facs="tcp:59949:136"/>
he will never ſuffer Sin to get ſuch Head in us, that we ſhall caſt off God any more, or violate our Covenant with him, nor will he ſuffer Satan to do it; therefore they who are reconciled, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver periſh, no not one of the Elect of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Gift of the Holy Spirit is another Effect of the Death of Chriſt: <hi>This Jeſus hath God raiſed up, whereof we are Witneſſes.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 2. 32, 33.</note> 
                        <hi>And having received of the Father the Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed forth this, which ye now ſee and hear.</hi> The Father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed unto his Son upon his dying for us, that the Holy Spirit ſhould be given to all his Seed: <hi>I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 44. 3.</note> Indeed, Chriſt receiving the Holy Spirit without meaſure for us, in his own Perſon as Mediator, antecedent to our believing, is the fulleſt Security to us imaginable: We are <hi>bleſſed with all ſpiritual Bleſſings in Chriſt,</hi> that is, in him as our Head. And although Chriſt received the Spirit before he ſuffered, yet it was upon the account of his Sufferings; the Father truſted his Son, took his Son's Word, and gave him part of his Wages from the beginuing: for all the Saints under the Old Teſtament, had the Spirit upon no other Account than as we have it, namely, as the Fruits and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Chriſt's Death and Purchaſe who was to die.</p>
                     <p>Now, Brethren, pray conſider what the Work of the Holy Spirit is, which is promiſed to abide with the Saints and Seed of Chriſt for ever.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. His Work is at firſt to quicken them: <hi>You hath he quickned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. To renew, to regenerate, to ſanctify them; this is the Work and Office of the Spirit: <hi>I will ſprinkle clean Water upon</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 25. Rom. 15. 16. 2 Theſſ. 2. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>you, and ye ſhall be clean from all your Filthineſs.</hi> And hence the Gentiles are ſaid to be ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt. But pray take notice of this, <hi>the Rock in the Wilderneſs was firſt ſmitten</hi> before Water guſh'd forth. So Chriſt was firſt ſmitten, firſt crucified, then the Spirit like Water was poured forth: It is, Sirs, wholly the Effects and Fruits of his Death.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is the Work of the Spirit to cauſe us to walk in God's Ways, and to keep his Statutes: <hi>I will put my Spirit within you,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my Judgments, and do them.</hi> We ſhould not do this were it not for the Spirit; we could not keep God's Precepts, nor walk in his Paths, but God puts his Spirit into us that we ſhall not depart from him; that is, we ſhall not finally apoſtatize from him, but ſhall keep his Precepts to the End.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="260" facs="tcp:59949:137"/>
4. It is the Work of the Spirit to help us to pray, and breathe forth our Deſires to God: <hi>We know not how to pray, but as the Spirit</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>helps our Infirmities, and maketh interceſſion for us with Groans that cannot be uttered.</hi> Chriſt having redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, it is, that this Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> might come upon the Gentiles: <hi>And becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 5, 6.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Office and Work of the Holy Spirit, is to enable us to mortify Sin: Rom. 8. 13. <hi>If ye through the Spirit mortify the Deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live.</hi> And hence it is alſo that Sin ſhall not have Dominion over them; and therefore Believers cannot periſh, they having ſuch a Helper: He deſtroys all that Dominion Sin and Satan had in them, and Power over them: The Spirit utterly ſpoils Satan's Kingdom in them, <hi>Becauſe greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the World,</hi> ſaith <hi>John,</hi> ſpeaking to the Saints. This is <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 4.</note> ſuch a Helper that can never be worſted.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It is hereby we perform all our Holy Duties: By the Spirit Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters preach to profit, and Hearers hear to their profit; hereby we read to profit, and ſing God's Praiſe to our profit and ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: for as we pray with the Spirit, ſo we ſing with the Spirit; and the ſame Meaſure, the ſame Fillings of the Spirit that enable us to do the one, enable us to do the other. By the Spirit we are alſo helped to meditate on God, and on his Word; and hereby our Meditations of him are ſweet to our Souls.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. 'Tis by the Spirit we reſiſt and repel Satan's Temptations: Or if he doth at any time worſt us, the Spirit will help us up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. It is the Holy Spirit that doth confirm and eſtabliſh us in the Truth.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. In a word, All Grace is from the Spirit; and it is by the Aid and Aſſiſtance of the Spirit, that we are enabled to exerciſe that Grace: for as he firſt formed the Habit in our Souls, ſo it is he helps us to do the Act alſo, or that doth influence us in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thereof.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Holy Spirit is alſo <hi>the Earneſt of the Saints Inheritance:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 13.</note> 'Tis given to them as an Earneſt of that Glory they ſhall one Day abſolutely be poſſeſſed of: 'Tis given to aſſure them, that as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as they have received the Holy Spirit here, and he is in them, ſo certain it is that they ſhall be ſaved, or have the Eternal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. True, I have mentioned this two or three times already, yet it is of ſo great Importance, I cannot paſs it by here: It is
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59949:137"/>
no ſmall Matter that God gives us, when he gives the Holy Spirit to us; for as he is that Principle of Life in us, ſo he gives us a full Aſſurance of Eternal Life hereafter: and it is upon this Earneſt-Money a Saint may be ſaid to live, whilſt in this World; nay, and it will defray all his Charge, and ſupply all his Need and manifold Wants, as long as he lives upon the Earth, even until he comes to the full poſſeſſion of his Inheritance above.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. And as the Spirit is the Earneſt of Glory, or of Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life, ſo he is alſo the Witneſs of God in our Souls; yea, ſuch a Witneſs, whoſe Teſtimony every Chriſtian may truſt to, and reſt upon: <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our Spirit, that we are</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>the Children of God.</hi> It witneſſeth to us our Adoption, that we are Children, and ſo Heirs, <hi>Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Chriſt.</hi> There is a twofold Witneſs of the Spirit.<list>
                           <item>(1.) The Spirit witneſſeth by a <hi>direct Act,</hi> we taking hold of Chriſt, and of the Promiſe: Saith the Spirit to the Soul, I teſtify that Chriſt and Eternal Life is yours; you believe, and therefore you have Chriſt, and ſhall be ſaved.</item>
                           <item>(2.) There is the witneſſing of the Spirit by a <hi>reflex Act:</hi> A Man finds ſuch and ſuch gracious Effects of Divine Grace upon his Soul, and by theſe the Holy Spirit teſtifies he is gracious. One that loves God, that hates Sin, is changed, renewed, lives a godly Life; therefore is in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſhall be ſaved.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. It is alſo by the Holy Spirit that Believers are <hi>ſealed unto the Day of Redemption. Alſo after that ye believed, ye were ſealed</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 14. &amp; 4. 30.</note>

Can ſuch periſh that have received the Earneſt of Heaven, and have the Witneſs of the Spirit, and have it ſealed to them? No, no, God hath put his Seal, or Mark, upon them; he by his Seal hath ſecured them to and for himſelf: and all this is the Effects of Chriſt's Death and Reſurrection.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The Spirit alſo thus purchaſed by Chriſt's Death, and given as the Fruits and Effects thereof to Believers, the Promiſe of the Father is, that <hi>it ſhall abide with them for ever;</hi> it is the great Promiſe made to Chriſt in the Covenant; <hi>My Spirit which is upon thee—ſhall not depart from thee, nor from thy Seed, henceforth and for ever:</hi> See the Words, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 21. there is the Promiſe of the Father; it is an abſolute Promiſe, and it runs thus, it ſhall be in Chriſt and in his Seed, <hi>henceforth and for ever.</hi> The Spirit is called <hi>the Promiſe of the Father.</hi> Alſo we have a Promiſe of the conſtant abiding of the Spirit in all Believers, made by Chriſt, the ſecond
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59949:138"/>
Perſon in the Trinity; he told his Diſciples, <hi>The Spirit of Truth, the Comforter ſhould abide with them, and be in them forever.</hi> Unto <note place="margin">John 14.</note> theſe, add the Teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt himſelf; for it is he that doth in the Word aſſure us of his own abiding with us; he hath choſen our Souls to be his own Temple and Habitation for ever; and alſo aſſures us, <hi>That all the Promiſes are in Chriſt, yea and amen, to the Glory of God.</hi> So that we have this great Truth ſealed and confirmed to us by the <hi>Three that bear witneſs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Pardon of Sin is another Effect and Fruit of the Death of Chriſt, <hi>In whom we have Redemption through his Blood,</hi> that is, as <note place="margin">Col. 1. 14.</note> the Effects of his Blood, <hi>even the Forgiveneſs of Sin.</hi> True, Jeſus Chriſt ſatisfied God's Juſtice for our Sins, he paid our Debts, it is not Remiſſion without a Satisfaction, but yet we are freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; we have it of God's Free Grace, but it is through the Blood of Chriſt; Remiſſion of our Sins follows Redemption, as the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Effects thereof. Chriſt hath procured this Favour and Bleſſing for us, and Goſpel-Remiſſion or Pardon of Sin is for ever: <hi>I will remember their Sins no more,</hi> they are blotted out for ever; <hi>he hath caſt our Sins into the Depth of the Sea,</hi> put them behind his Back; yea, he hath put them far away from him, as the <hi>Eaſt</hi> is from the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Adoption is the Fruit and Effect of Chriſt's Death; <hi>He hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, that we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>the Adoption of Sons.</hi> God takes us through Chriſt, or by virtue of Chriſt's Death, into the Relation of Sons; which Privilege we have for ever, we ſhall never ceaſe being Sons and Daughters of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Free Acceſs to the Throne of Grace, or unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the Effect of Chriſt's Death: <hi>Having therefore, Brethren,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 19, 20. <hi>Reader, theſe things were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon when this Sermon was preached, which I am forc'd to leave out here.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>boldneſs to enter into the Holieſt by the Blood of Jeſus, by a new and living Way, which he hath conſecrated for us through the Vail, that is to ſay, his Fleſh,</hi> Chriſt's Blood: His Death opened this Way, it is by him we have acceſs to the Throne of Grace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Another Fruit and Effect of the Death of Chriſt, is, Redemption from all Iniquity: <hi>He gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. Therefore this Glorious Effect his Death ſhall have upon all Redeemed Ones; it
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59949:138"/>
was not to redeem only from the Curſe of the Law, as ſome talk, but from the Guilt, Pollution, Power and Puniſhment of Sin; therefore Believers ſhall never periſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Juſtification is alſo another Effect of the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt; which is to acquit, abſolve, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce us Righteous in God's Sight; God accepting us Righteous by the Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs which is ever the ſame. Now Chriſt's Death being the Meritorious Cauſe thereof, we are ſaid to <hi>be juſtified by his Blood,</hi> Rom. 5. 9. And pray ſee the Apoſtle's Argument from hence; <hi>Much more then being now juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Blood, we ſhall be ſaved from Wrath through him:</hi> It is more to be reconciled and juſtified, than it is to be ſaved; ſuch are juſtified, and Chriſt's Blood having done the former, will much more effect the latter: thoſe that Chriſt juſtifies, he will glorify; nay, and his Death and Reſurrection cannot be without this Effect: <hi>And by him all that believe are juſtified from all things,</hi> &amp;c. The Word <note place="margin">Acts 13. 39.</note> 
                        <hi>Juſtified</hi> is oppoſed to Condemnation; thoſe that are juſtified, are juſtified for ever. Juſtification is not a gradual Act, as Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is; it reſults not as the Fruits of our Repentance, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Holineſs, but as the Fruits of Chriſt's Death and Merits; it is never leſs nor more: as our Holineſs cannot add any thing to it, ſo the Sins and Infirmities of true Believers, cannot diminiſh any thing from it; there may be additions to our inherent Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but not to our Juſtification: Chriſt roſe again for our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. I may alſo challenge all the Men in the World to prove, that any Man that was juſtified in the ſight of God, did ever fall away and come under Condemnation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ninthly,</hi> Sanctification is another Effect of the Death of Chriſt: You may again read that Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13, 14. Chriſt died not only to juſtify Believers, but to ſanctify them alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, <hi>A Man may be ſanctified, and yet be defiled again: We read of ſome that eſcaped the Pollution of the World through the Knowledg of Chriſt, yet were again entangled and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 20.</note>

                     <p n="2">2. Thoſe that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of, were ſuch that only had eſcaped groſs Pollution through the common Operations of the Spirit; it appears, their <hi>ſwiniſh Nature</hi> was never changed: he therefore

                        <hi>turned to his Vomit again, and the Sow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the Mire.</hi> Such therefore never were ſanctified in Heart, they never experienced the Effects of Chriſt's Blood, not that Soul-puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Virtue that is in it; they were cleanſed from groſs Idolatry, through the Knowledg of Chriſt, and alſo from ſome groſs Acts of Prophaneneſs; they had obtained a reformed, but no renewed Life of Grace and Holineſs; therefore ſuch fall into Sin again, and are ſo overcome, that the latter End is worſe with them than the Beginning. As to true Believers, ſee what the Apoſtle ſays; <hi>For by one Offering he hath perfected for ever them that are</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>ſanctified.</hi> By this one Offering our Lord Jeſus hath procured our Sanctification perpetually to be continued; the Death of Chriſt hath ſpecial influence unto the mortification of Sin: in the Death of the Croſs, Our Old Man is crucified, that the Body of Sin might be deſtroyed: Sin is mortified, and we are ſanctified by virtue of the Death of Chriſt; and we hereby through his Grace come to be planted into the Likeneſs of his Death. And as <hi>Paul</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 5.</note> in another place ſaith, <hi>Being made conformable unto his Death:</hi> This <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 10, 11, 12.</note> Conformity is not in our Natural Death, or in our being put to death for him; but Chriſt dying for our Sins is the procuring Cauſe of our dying to Sin: therefore we muſt look for the Death of our Sins in the Death of Chriſt, as the proper Effect thereof. Virtue goeth from the Death of Chriſt, to the ſubduing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of Sin; his Death was not only a Paſſive Example, but is accompanied with Power, conforming and changing us into his Likeneſs: 'Tis the great Ordinance of God to this very End, it is by a fellowſhip or participation in his ſuffering; we are never made conformable to the Death of Chriſt, till we die to Sin: the Death of Chriſt was deſigned to be the Death of Sin. And as certain as Chriſt died for the Sins of all the Elect, ſo certain it is they ſhall all, firſt or laſt, feel the powerful Effects thereof in the Death of their Sins. <hi>The Corn fell into the Ground and died,</hi> and ſhall produce all the Increaſe that virtually was hid in it: <hi>Chriſt is our Life,</hi> the Spring, Fountain and Cauſe of it; therefore we have nothing but what we derive from him.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>He is,</hi> ſay ſome, <hi>the Author of Life</hi>; <hi>and as he taught the Way of Life, ſo he is our Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> He is our Life as he is our Head; and it would be but a ſorry Head that ſhould only teach the Feet to go, or the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to act and move, without communicating Strength unto
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59949:139"/>
them, and to the whole Body. Chriſt, <hi>Brethren,</hi> is an Head of Influence; and in theſe ſpiritual Influences, or Life, that Strength which he communicates to us, doth conſiſt in the killing of Sin: <hi>He loved his Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctify and cleanſe it with the waſhing of Water, that he might preſent it to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 25, 26, 27.</note> 
                        <hi>himſelf a glorious Church, not having Spot or Wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be Holy and without Blame.</hi> And if this was his End in his Death, be ſure his Death ſhall perfectly effect this glorious Work in the End upon every Soul of his.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tenthly,</hi> and laſtly, Glorification is alſo an Effect of the Death of Chriſt; it is the Fruit of his Suffering, it was by his own Blood he entred as our Head and Repreſentative once into the Holy Place, <hi>having obtained Eternal Redemption for us.</hi> The Crown of <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 12.</note> Glory is the Purchaſe of his Blood: and as ſure as his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his Holy Life and Obedience, and Meritorious Death carried him to the Father, and ſet him down at the right Hand of the Majeſty on high; ſo will his Merits as certainly bring all the true Heirs to that Glory above, where the Fore-runner is for us already entered: <hi>For it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many Sons to Glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect through Sufferings.</hi> Firſt he brings thoſe Sons into a State of Grace, as the Effects of his Death and Reſurrection, and unto a State of Glory: <hi>And whom he juſtified, them alſo he</hi>

                        <hi>glorified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall draw up the Sum of this Argument: If ſuch are the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <note place="margin">The general Argument.</note> Fruits and Effects of Chriſt's Death; (1.) If it hath appeaſed the Wrath of God for all that are in him: (2.) If it hath made their Peace, and for ever reconciled them unto God: (3.) If the Holy Spirit is purchaſed, and procured as the Effects of his Death for them, by which they are renewed, quickned and helped to mortify Sin; and is to them an <hi>Earneſt, a Witneſs,</hi> and <hi>Seal</hi> of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life, and ſhall <hi>abide with them for ever:</hi> (4.) If Juſtification is the Effect of Chriſt's Death, and they are for ever acquitted from all Sin, and accepted as Righteous in Chriſt's Righteouſneſs: (5.) If all that believe in him are ſanctified, as the Effects of his Death, and ſhall be perfected for ever: (6.) If Pardon of Sin is an Effect alſo of Chriſt's Death, and all Believers have and ſhall have their Sins forgiven for ever, or remembred no more: (7.) If they are adopted Sons and Daughters to God, as the Effect of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59949:140"/>
Chriſt's Death: (8.) And alſo if Glorification is an Effect of his Death; and as certain as is the Cauſe, the Effect will be; or as ſure as Chriſt is glorified in Heaven, all that are his Members ſhall be glorified. Then it is impoſſible that any one of them ſhould ſo fall away as eternally to periſh: But all theſe things are true, and none dare to deny them ſo to be, therefore they cannot fall, ſo as eternally to periſh.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall apply this, and come to the next Argument.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>APPLICATION.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> To Sinners.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Hath the Death of Chriſt ſuch Virtue in it, even to renew, quicken, regenerate all that believe in him? Is God through the Death of his Son reconciled, and ſhall all that take hold of him be juſtified? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O then, Sinners, look up unto him and never ceaſe looking, until you find the Effects of his Death in your own Souls.</p>
                     <p>Object. 1. <hi>But alas, Sir, I am a vile and abominable Sinner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Well, notwithſtanding that, yet there is Virtue enough in Chriſt to ſave you.</p>
                     <p>Object. 2. <hi>But I have been a Drunkard, a Swearer, an Adulterer, a Thief.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> So had ſome of thoſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Such were ſome of you, but you are ſanctified, but you are juſtified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Object. 3. <hi>But I have been an Old Sinner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Well, let it be ſo, yet but a Sinner, and Chriſt died for Sinners, for the chief of Sinners, therefore there is hope for you; nay, if you can believe, and apply the Virtue of Chriſt's Blood, you ſhall find Mercy.</p>
                     <p>Object. 4. <hi>But I fear Chriſt did not die for me.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. Thou haſt as much ground to believe that Chriſt died for thee, as any ungodly Perſon hath that dwells on the Face of the whole Earth. Sinner, look up. Nay,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thou haſt as much ground to believe that Chriſt died for thee, as any of thoſe had once who now feel the Effects of his Death.</p>

                        <pb n="267" facs="tcp:59949:140"/>
4. Did ever any Sinner throw himſelf at his Feet as a poor loſt and undone Creature, and take hold of him, that was rejected?</p>
                     <p>Query. <hi>What is the firſt Effect of Chriſt's Death?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The firſt Effect of Chriſt's Death in the Soul, is Life; Life is infuſed: And if thou haſt a vital Principle in thee, thou wilt cry out under the Senſe of thy Sin. Thruſt a Sword into a dead Man's Bowels, and he will not ſtir nor cry out. Sin is in wicked Men, like a Sword in the Sides of ſuch as are dead; but as ſoon as Life is infuſed, there will be Senſe, and a crying out. <hi>Now when they heard this they were pricked in the Heart, and ſaid unto</hi> Peter <hi>and to the reſt of the Apoſtles, What ſhall we do?</hi> Some of <note place="margin">Acts 2. 37.</note> theſe had been the Murderers of the Lord of Life and Glory, yet they found Mercy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Another Effect is this, <hi>viz.</hi> You will perceive a mighty Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in your Soul, as it was with the <hi>Prodigal Son;</hi> all your old Hopes of Heaven will be gone, Poverty of Spirit will overtake you: An awakned wounded Sinner deſpairs of all Supplies or Help in himſelf; he is diſtreſſed with pinching Hunger, and ſo flies home to his Father: (1.) Yet may not get Power over Sin preſently. (2.) But O he trembles at the Thoughts of God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, by beholding the Spear in Chriſt's Side. (3.) He throws down his Weapons as being conquered and overcome, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to do as the four Lepers did, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 3, 4, 8, 9. (4.) He ſees nothing but Death if he abides where he is, and believes not: And if he returns to his old Courſe, he ſees he muſt die; and therefore ventures to throw his Soul upon Chriſt, or ventures him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on Chriſt, and lies at the Feet of Chriſt, and ſays, If I periſh, I periſh, I can but die; and if he will pardon me, heal me, and have compaſſion on me, I ſhall live. O Sinners, that you could but do thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We may infer from hence, that it is in vain for any Perſon to talk of Chriſt's Death, or to ſay Chriſt died for Sinners, nay, for the whole World, and therefore for me, unleſs they come to feel the Virtue and bleſſed Effects of his Death on their own Souls. O ſee you reſt not, without finding the Power of the Death of Chriſt. Sirs, though the Sacrifice is over, yet the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and excellent Cauſality of it remains; and not only to juſtify and abſolve a believing Sinner, but alſo to quicken, regenerate, and to ſanctify and make him Holy alſo. Therefore labour to know and experience the Power of Chriſt's Death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="268" facs="tcp:59949:141"/>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From hence alſo we may infer, that this is the only Way to know Chriſt died for us; namely, when we find the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his Death, that we <hi>die to Sin, that the Body of Sin is cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in us with him.</hi> Hath the Life of your Sins been let out? O ſee to this you that proſeſs the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This ſhews us alſo what a dangerous thing it is for any to build their Faith upon the general Love of God to Mankind. What ſay ſome? I believe Chriſt died for me, becauſe he died for all; and becauſe for all, therefore for me. Brethren, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid this is the ruin of many Souls, becauſe it may be but a falſe Faith that thoſe poor Creatures have, they may not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the Effects of Chriſt's Death; may be it is not preſt upon their Conſciences, but this of Chriſt dying for all, they think is enough. Now pray conſider, and O that all ſuch miſtaken Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would conſider it alſo;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That a general Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> to believe that Chriſt died for all, gives no Man any particular ſaving Intereſt in Chriſt's Death: for if it did, then every Man that ſo believeth, hath a ſaving In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in his Death. But thouſands perhaps ſo believe, and yet are as vile and ungodly People as any in the World: Therefore to build on that general Faith, without a particular Application of the Promiſe, or Promiſes of God, and experiencing the Effects of Chriſt's Death, is a falſe Faith, and deceives the Soul.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That that Faith which a Man may have, that may leave ſuch that have it and truſt in it, under the Power of Sin, is a falſe Faith, and will deceive the Soul: but Men may have that Faith, namely, believe Chriſt died for all, and therefore for them, and yet be under the Power of Sin; therefore that may be a falſe Faith.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That Faith that doth not change the Heart, purify the Heart, is a falſe Faith: But many that believe Chriſt died for all, and therefore for them, have that Faith, and yet it doth not change their Hearts, purify their Hearts; therefore it is a falſe Faith.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. From hence I argue, that it follows undeniably, that all thoſe People that believe Chriſt died for all, muſt come to a particular Application of Chriſt's Blood, and not truſt to that general Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; they muſt feel the Effects of Chriſt's Death upon their own Souls, or elſe they are undone: nor do I doubt in the leaſt but many of them of that Judgment do ſo, divers of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as gracious Chriſtians as any others; and have Experiences that clearly contradict their own Principles.</p>

                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and Laſtly, Here is Comfort for Believers. O ſee what the Death of Chriſt hath and will effect for you, and in you. 1. God's Wrath is appeaſed in him towards you. 2. Juſtice is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in him towards you. 3. The Law is ſilenced. 4. Peace and Pardon procured. 5. Life is infuſed. 6. The Guilt, Power, Pollution and Puniſhment of Sin, removed and gone for ever. 7. You are juſtified. 8. Satan is conquered. 9. The World is overcome, you are and ſhall be ſanctified, and Heaven is opened; you are in Chriſt's Hand, and ſhall not periſh, but have Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life.</p>

                        <hi>To do whatſoever thy Hand and thy Counſel determined to do.</hi> And if it may thus be taken here, then this may be the Senſe of it, <hi>viz.</hi> All the Elect, all the Sheep and Lambs of Chriſt are, by God's Eternal Purpoſe and Counſel, ordained to Eternal Life, and none can pluck them out of his Election, or change his Purpoſe: For like as the Death of Chriſt was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Hand or Counſel of God, ſo were the Effects thereof, I mean, what Perſons ſhould be ſaved thereby, even all and every one of them that he had given unto his Son as he is Mediator. The Deſign and Purpoſe of God, by Jeſus Chriſt, was to ſave all the Elect; and the End and Deſign of Chriſt's Death cannot be fruſtrated, they are in God's Hand, that is, it is his Purpoſe and Counſel to ſave them; and <hi>his Counſel ſhall ſtand, and he will do all his Pleaſure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. All the Counſels of God then from Eternity, and all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Declarations that hold forth thoſe Counſels, having a ſpecial Relation to Chriſt's dying for his People, and their actual Salvation, muſt and ſhall have their abſolute Accompliſhment; for the End of a thing is that for which the thing it ſelf is: And
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59949:142"/>
had it not been for that, the thing had never been at all, it being that the chief Agent principally aimed at, and purpoſed to bring about.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Therefore the Salvation of Chriſt's Saints muſt be certain, <hi>from the conſideration of the Immutability</hi> of God, in which the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Divine Nature ſhines forth, and requireth a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent Affection of all the Internal and External Acts of his Mind and Will.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From his Soveraignty, in making good and executing all his Purpoſes, which will not admit of any Mixtures of Conſults as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, (the Lord may do what he will with his Creatures, we are but as Clay in his Hand; and ſuch as he will make Veſſels of Honour, who ſhall contradict him or reſiſt his Will?) Shall any change God's Mind, or render his Thoughts liable to Alteration? Alſo is it not from his Sovereign and Diſtinguiſhing Grace to ſome, that makes the Apoſtle break out, <hi>O the depth of the Riches both of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note> 
                        <hi>the Wiſdom and Knowledg of God! how unſearchable are his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his Ways paſt finding out!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. If we conſider how his abſolute Purpoſes doth excite his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency to the actual accompliſhing of them, who can once ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any one Believer ſhould miſcarry! <hi>The Lord of Hoſts hath ſworn, ſaying, Surely as I have thought, ſo ſhall it come to paſs; and as I have purpoſed ſo ſhall it ſtand.</hi> As God is able to do whatſoever <note place="margin">Iſa. 14. 24.</note> he hath purpoſed, ſo we may aſſure our ſelves there is nothing that ſhall fail which is according to his determinate Counſel; <hi>He is of one Mind, and who can turn him?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. And what Folly and unreaſonable Incredulity is it once to imagine, there ſhould be any manner of ſuſpending the Acts and Purpoſes of the Will of God, upon any actings of the Creatures whatſoever, ſeeing it cannot be done without ſubjecting Eternity to Time, and the Will of Man to the Will of God, or the <hi>Firſt</hi> Cauſe to the <hi>Second,</hi> the Lord to the Servant?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Now then ſeeing God hath taken the Salvation of his Elect into his own Hand, Power, and Eternal Purpoſe, and hath been at ſuch vaſt Expence of Rich Treaſure, in order to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of his great Deſign herein, who can imagine that any one of his Saints ſhould miſs of Everlaſting Life? Suppoſe a Prince ſhould have a wonderful Project in Hand, which he carries on with the Advice of his Council, to make ſo many of his Subjects that his Love and Affections are let out upon, Great and Happy on Earth; and in doing of which, ſhould expend all, or the greateſt

Or ſhould a moſt wiſe and cunning Artiſt, contrive a curious Piece of Workmanſhip, which might coſt him thouſands, it being his whole Work, and taking up all his Time, for forty or fifty Years, to bring it to Perfection; ſuppoſe it be a rare Piece of Clock-work, would he ſuffer any one part of it to be disjointed from the reſt by an Enemy, whilſt he look'd on, if he could prevent it, or were it in the Power of his Hand? Alas, what are all the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>reſt, the richeſt or moſt curious Things in Nature, that are or ever have been in the World, to this Work of God in the Redemption and Salvation of his Choſen Ones? What Treaſure hath he ſpent, (as I may ſay)? Hath it not coſt him the parting with <hi>the Pearl of great Price,</hi> even the breaking of it into pieces, that ſo he might enrich and make great and glorious every one of his Elect? Nay, and after he hath cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly formed his own Image upon each of their Souls, to the Joy and Wonder of the Holy Angels, and to the Perplexity and Sorrow of Devils, and this as the Contrivance of his Eternal Council; will he, after all, think you, ſuffer Satan to deface this his Image in the Souls of any one of them, and ſo ſpoil and bring to nought part of that glorious, expenſive, and curious Piece of his own Workmanſhip, which was the abſolute Reſult of his Council to compleat and deliver from miſcarrying from all Eternity? Now then ſeeing that all the Elect, or all true Believers, are thus in the Father's Hand, <hi>viz.</hi> put under his Abſolute and Eternal Decree and Purpoſe, to ſave, through Jeſus Chriſt, what can obſtruct or hinder this God from effecting of his own Glorious Deſign herein? To talk of Conditional Purpoſes concerning <hi>Perſeverance,</hi> ſaith Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> are either <hi>impoſſible,</hi> implying Contradictions, or <hi>ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous,</hi> even to an unfitneſs for a Stage. See the 29<hi>th</hi> Verſe, <hi>My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that gave them me, is greater than all; and none can pluck them out of my Father's Hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My Father, as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, is equally concerned with me about my Saints Perſervation, and final Perſeverance; and they are in his Hand, he hath put them into his own Power, and he is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than all, he is greater than me as I am Mediator, tho as God I and my Father are one; tho he hath put them into my Hand, as I am Mediator and their Surety, yet he hath not let go his own hold of them, he will ſee not one of them be loſt for whom I lay down my Life. If any would get them out of my Father's Hand, it
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59949:143"/>
muſt be againſt his Will, his Purpoſe, his Decree, and they muſt do it by <hi>Force,</hi> by Violence, they muſt pluck them or rend them out of my Father's Hand: Mind the word <hi>pluck</hi> twice mentioned; <hi>Neither ſhall any pluck them out of my Hand;</hi> and <hi>none is able to pluck them out of my Father's Hand.</hi> Not that any are able to pluck them out of the Hand of Chriſt as Mediator: But our Saviour adds that, in this 29<hi>th</hi> Verſe, as a farther Confirmation, and as an aſſurance of their ſafe ſtanding. Who is too ſtrong for Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence it ſelf? Can any bring his Counſel to nought, or deſtroy ſuch that he holds in the Hand of his Eternal Decree, in the Hand of his Everlaſting Love and Affection, and alſo in the Hand of his amazing, inconceivable and irreſiſtable Power? That Enemy that will deſtroy one Saint, muſt be a Match for the Infinite God, and overcome him, and rob him of his chiefeſt Treaſure, or of his precious Jewels. O who dares to ſay this can be done! Well then, aſſure your ſelves, that not one Sheep of Chriſt can periſh: Sin muſt be ſtronger than God if it deſtroys one of the Elect; and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan more mighty, greater in Power than God: which to think is Blaſphemy. Why ſhould our Saviour here add, <hi>My Father is greater than all,</hi> were it not to ſignify the impoſſibility of their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, or to ſhew how impoſſible it is that any Enemy ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By their being in the Father's <hi>Hand,</hi> may be meant Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who is called <hi>the Power of God, and the Wiſdom of God;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 18.</note> becauſe by and through him, God exerts his Power, or his Strength to ſave; or the Glory of his Power is manifeſted, as well as of all his other Attributes. Sin ſeem'd to eclipſe the Power of God in ſaving his People, becauſe Divine Power could not ſave in a way of Omnipotence, to the Impeachment of his Juſtice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; but in Chriſt Juſtice and Holineſs is as much magnified as Mercy and Goodneſs; and thereby ſo too, that the Power of God might ſhine forth in its full Glory: <hi>Father, glorify thy Name,</hi> ſaith <note place="margin">John 11. 28.</note> Chriſt. <hi>Then came a Voice from Heaven, ſaying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it:</hi> Thy Name, that is, however thou art made known, or glorify all thy Glorious Attributes. Almighty Power was ſeen in creating the World; and alſo as it wrought in conjuction with Divine Juſtice, it ſhone forth in caſting the Angels out of Heaven, and <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe; as alſo in the Flames of <hi>Sodom:</hi> And as Divine Power joined with Divine Mercy and Goodneſs, it ſhone forth in ſaving the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at the <hi>Red Sea.</hi> But the Strength and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59949:144"/>
Glory of every Attribute never ſhone forth in their equal brightneſs and ſplendour, as all are united and in conjunction together, and meet in ſweet Harmony, as they do in the ſaving of Man by Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that Jeſus Chriſt may be well called the Wiſdom of God, and the Power of God. Chriſt is <hi>the firſt-born of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Col. 1. 15.</note> And as the Firſt born is the Strength of the Parent, ſo is Chriſt the Strength of God. The tranſcendent Excellencies and Glories of the Divine Being, that were ſcattered (as it were) in the Creation, are all united and gathered in Chriſt; that like as when a bundle of Rods united and bound up together cannot be broke, or as ſo united are very ſtrong, ſo God in Chriſt ſhines forth, as having all his Glorious Perfections united in one; and in this ſenſe Believers may be ſaid to be in the Father's Hand, and ſo that none can pluck them out, God hereby appearing in his united Strength. And thus Chriſt may be ſaid to be, <hi>that Branch that God hath made</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>ſtrong for himſelf.</hi> And again, <hi>The Man of thy right Hand, the Son of Man whom thou haſt made ſtrong for thy ſelf,</hi> in whom thou ſheweſt the greatneſs of thy Power to ſave, or to manifeſt his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power by. O what a Hand is the Hand of God in Chriſt! Who can pull one Soul out of the Father's Hand, or out of Chriſt, who is the Father's Hand of Power to ſave all his Elect? Believers are in Chriſt's Hand, and Chriſt is the Father's Hand, yea the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Right Hand: the Power and Glory of all the Divine Attributes are united together in Chriſt; herein they ſhew the Perfection of their Strength, and are all exerted in the Salvation of every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; therefore it is impoſſible one of them ſhould periſh. In the uniting of all the Attributes of God together doth the ſtrength of God appear to ſave. And in this reſpect Believers are in God's Hand, God is concerned to ſee the Salvation of his People per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by Chriſt as Mediator; who is, as ſo conſidered, his Right Hand, or the Greatneſs of his Power, or the Perfection of his Power and Strength.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> To proceed; as they are in the Father's Hand, ſo he hath, you heard, put them into Chriſt's Hand as their great <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, Mediator</hi> and <hi>Surety;</hi> and that before the World began, in that Covenant and Bleſſed Compact the Father and Son entered into, in order to the Eternal Salvation of all his Saints: And the Holy God hath fixed on ſuch Ways and Means, and in ſuch manner, that the Thing deſigned cannot miſcarry. Men indeed may miſs of their Ends they aim at; but what is directly in the Hand of God,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59949:144"/>
and is put by him into the Hand of his Son, to effect and finally to accompliſh, ſhall never miſcarry, it being, as I have told you, done according to his Eternal Counſel. God's Abſolute Purpoſe ſhall ſtand, let it be what it will; much more that Grand Purpoſe and Deſign of his, of ſaving all true Believers by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is a proof of it already as to Matter of Fact: Many thouſands of the Souls of his Elect are gone to Heaven, in ſpight of Sin, Hell, Death, World and Devils.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the Salvation of Believers by Chriſt, all Intereſts concerned are ſecured.<list>
                           <item>(1.) God is Juſt, and herein he declares his Juſtice with a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And,</item>
                           <item>(2.) Yet the Sinner is juſtified.</item>
                           <item>(3.) Vengeance hath to the full took hold of Sin. And yet,</item>
                           <item>(4.) Mercy is magnified to the higheſt Degree in ſaving the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Juſtice is ſatisfied, and yet the Sinner is forgiven.</item>
                           <item>(5.) The Law of God hath its full and juſt Sanction; and the Violence offered to it is retrieved.</item>
                           <item>(6.) And Jeſus Chriſt who did all this, in beholding his Seed and Fruit of his Soul, and their Eternal Bleſſedneſs ſecured for ever, is well pleaſed and fully ſatisfied.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The way of accompliſhing this Deſign, is ſuch as will certainly compaſs the End, Divine Power being ingaged in it, which reſteth not in the leaſt on the Concourſe or Compliance of any fruſtrable Inſtruments; nay every Attribute being hereby mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, they join hand in hand for the effecting of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> No Power can ſuperſede God's Decree, nor obſtruct Jeſus Chriſt in his compleating the Whole of his Work: <hi>I will work, and who ſhall let?</hi> And again it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall bring forth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 42. 3. &amp; 53. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Judgment unto Victory.</hi> He ſhall not fail nor be diſcouraged: <hi>The Pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his Hand.</hi> And ſeeing then that the Final Accompliſhment of the Salvation of every Believer is put into Chriſt's Hand, for a farther Demonſtration how this tends to ſecure them all from Danger, and to preſerve them to Eternal Life,</p>
                     <p>Take here a ſhort Induction of Particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Conſider the Nature of that Covenant, by virtue of which all the Elect are put into Chriſt's Hand: It is a Covenant made and entered into by the Son as Mediator with the Father; not only to redeem and purchaſe Life for them, and to infuſe Life in them, but to preſerve them in a State of Life, ſo that none of God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Children
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59949:145"/>
might depart from him any more for ever, which the firſt Covenant failed in; and therefore God found fault with that or rather with them with whom it was made, who failed in continuing their Obedience thereunto, but ſinned, and fell from God. Now ſay I, God to prevent the like again, hath entered into a New Covenant with his Son for us, which is ſo <hi>well ordered in all things, and ſure,</hi> as that not one Soul ſhall ever eternally miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry that is comprehended therein. O remember that this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was the Reſult of Infinite Wiſdom, as well as it reſulted from inconceivable Love and Goodneſs in God; and it was to fruſtrate and deſtroy the Works of the Devil for ever, ſo that he might never have Cauſe to inſult over the Majeſty of God, in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of his Hand one Soul that he deſigned in his Eternal Counſel to make happy, and ſave for ever.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Conſider, Jeſus Chriſt to this End, in this Covenant, hath took all that the Father gave unto him into his Hand as their Surety. Pray conſider, all Believers are thus in the Hand of Chriſt: Hence he is called <hi>the Surety of a better Covenant.</hi> He is their great Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor; <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22.</note> if any be loſt, he muſt anſwer for them. Let me read that Text in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. I ſhall only allude to it to clear up this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the better to weak Capacities; <hi>Thy Servant went out into the midſt of the Battel, and behold, a Man turned aſide, and brought a Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 King. 20. 39.</note> 
                        <hi>me, and ſaid, Keep this Man: if by any means he be miſſing, then ſhall thy Life go for his Life.</hi> I know this was ſpoken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet parabolically, yet it may ſerve to ſhew you the Nature of Suretiſhip, where one engageth for another, or for others. Thus <hi>Judah</hi> became Surety to his Father for <hi>Benjamin; I will be Surety for him; of my Hand ſhalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 43 9.</note> 
                        <hi>thee, and ſet him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever. Reuben</hi> alſo became Surety for <hi>Benjamin; And</hi> Reuben <hi>ſpake unto his</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 42. 37.</note> 
                        <hi>Father, ſaying, Slay my two Sons if I bring him not to thee, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him into thy Hand.</hi> This was more indeed than was required of him, or that his Father <hi>Jacob</hi> could accept of without Sin, had he failed. But O ſee the Nature of Suretiſhip; Jeſus Chriſt hath taken all his Saints into his Hand, as their Surety to the Father; and God hath accepted him in this Caſe, and looks for them all at his Hand; the Father ſubſtituted him, not to be a Shepherd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but a Surety alſo.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And let it be conſidered, that Jeſus Chriſt became not our Surety to pay our Debts, or to ſatisfy for our Sins which we ſtood charged with before our Converſion, but alſo for all our Sins after
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:59949:145"/>
we believe: his Blood was a plenary Satisfaction for all; ſo that Chriſt ſays (as it were) to the Father, as <hi>Judah</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> I thy Servant am become Surety for theſe, and every one of theſe that thou haſt given to me; and if I bring them not to thee, and ſet them not before thee in Heaven, then let me bear the blame for ever. Or he may ſay, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh concerning his Son <hi>Oneſimus; If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on my Account.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Philem. 18, 19.</note> 
                        <hi>I</hi> Paul <hi>have written it with my own Hand, I will repay it,</hi> &amp;c. Thus Chriſt may ſay, Father, charge the Sins, the Debts that my Saints have, and ſhall commit, to me, I will be accountable for them: And indeed he hath already done it, once for all; and not only ſo, but to bring them all to Heaven, and this in a moſt high and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Covenant and Holy Compact he made with the Father before the World began: therefore not one Soul of them can periſh.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Conſider alſo, that in purſuit of this Covenant and Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Jeſus Chriſt hath ſuffered Death, ſpilt his own precious Blood, which the Father doth accept of as their full Diſcharge: and ſhall any once ſuppoſe that one Soul of his People for whom he thus ſtruck Hands and died for, and took into his Care and Charge, ſhall eternally miſcarry?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Conſider, that as they are in Chriſt's Hands, and he hath ſuffered Death for them, and in their ſtead, ſo alſo, that the Merits of his Blood might become effectual to them, he is every ways fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, endowed and qualified with all things whatſoever that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in order to his actual Diſcharge of this great Truſt he hath taken upon him.<list>
                           <item>(1.) He hath received the Spirit without meaſure, to the end he might have that and all Grace that is needful, to communicate to every one of his Saints as he ſees neceſſary for them; and it is laid up in his Hand, not given all at once to them; but they ſhall have all their Wants ſupplied according to his Riches in Glory.</item>
                           <item>(2.) He hath Wiſdom enough alſo, for he is Wiſdom it ſelf. <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 19.</note>
                           </item>
                           <item>(3.) He is clothed with Power alſo; he is a Saviour, a great One: Pray hear what he himſelf ſaith; <hi>I that ſpeak in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>

                              <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 18, 19.</note> &amp;c. He cannot fail for want of Power as Mediator, let the States or Straits of any Soul of his, be what they will, or of any that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie upon him or come unto him; <hi>Wherefore he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come to God by him.</hi> Nay, and this Power is <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> given to him to this very end, namely, not only to quicken and renew them, but alſo to perfect Holineſs in them, and to bring

Now upon this Account we ſay, that Work is in his Hand: And thus Chriſt hath undertaken the Work of our Salvation; we, and that Work of Grace in us are in his Hand, and he will perform it, and perfect it before he hath done.</p>

Others may take an Offence againſt their very Favourites, though Children, and turn them out of all Places of Honour, and utterly degrade them: But ſo will not he. <hi>Chriſt exceeds all Gardiners</hi> or <hi>Vine-dreſſers;</hi> a Drought may come and ſpoil a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or Vineyard, let the Dreſſer do what he can; or through his careleſneſs Weeds may overrun and utterly ſpoil it: But he hath promiſed to prevent the Danger of Drought; his People ſhall then <note place="margin">Jer. 17. 8.</note> not ceaſe bearing Fruit, Sin ſhall not have dominion over them; thoſe Weeds ſhall never ſpoil his Garden. <hi>Chriſt exceeds all Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pilots;</hi> they may loſe a Ship in a Storm let them do what they can, it may be drove either upon Rocks or Sands: But Jeſus Chriſt hath the command of the Wind, <hi>the Winds and Sea obey him;</hi> he can lay any Storm that may ariſe in the Soul at his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſave from all Rocks of Preſumption, or Sands of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. O happy Soul that art in Chriſt's Hand, be thou whoſoever thou wilt!</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Believers are in Chriſt's Hand as an Inheritance or Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he hath bought and purchaſed for himſelf, and hath taken actual poſſeſſion of: or as Jewels or choice Treaſure is in the Hand of the Owner; even ſo are the Saints in Chriſt's Hand. Brethren, what will not a Man do to keep and preſerve his Right, or his Riches? True, Thieves may notwithſtanding get all he hath from him, or Fire may conſume it, or by Injuſtice it may be torn away; but Chriſt's Riches, his Inheritance, his Jewels, which are his People, who are to him of an ineſtimable Value, there is no Theft, no Fire, or no Violence that any can uſe, can deprive him of the leaſt part of; I mean, of the pooreſt or meaneſt Saint.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The Saints are in Chriſt's Hand, as a curious Piece of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip caſt in a rare Mold by a skilful Artiſt is in his Hand, which hath coſt him vaſt Treaſure, Time and Pains, which is not fully compleated, nor can any do it in all the World but himſelf alone: Even thus, I ſay, are all Believers in Chriſt's Hand, who hath caſt them into the Mold of his own Likeneſs, whom he, as the great ſpiritual Artiſt, after infinite Coſt, Time, Wiſdom and Labour, hath renewed or regenerated; and none can finiſh or make up that Work begun in them, but himſelf only; nor is it by the Father put into any other Hand, but into his alone to do it.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59949:148"/>
And as the finiſhing any curious Piece of Workmanſhip is counted no ſmall part of the Curioſity or Art, ſo it is here, the perfecting of the Saints is no ſmall part of the Workmanſhip of God: And ſhall Chriſt leave that to the Wiſdom of Man to do, or ſhall he ſuffer the loſs of all his Travels, Coſt and Time? For if the Work be not perfected, all is loſt that ever Chriſt did. O think on this, you that are ſuch <hi>rare Artiſts,</hi> as to venture to take Chriſt's Work out of his Hand, or that ſay it is the Work of the Creature; for that is the Purport of your Doctrine.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. They are in Chriſt's Hand as a great Victory is in the Hands of a prevailing Conqueror, who hath brought the Strength of his Enemies down, and there remains only ſome ſcattered Forces who lurk in Holes, which he is alſo concerned to root out, and finally to ſubdue; and ſhould he not purſue his Conqueſts, (for alas, they may get Head again) all his Pains and Expence of Treaſure would prove in vain: Thus I ſay the Soul of every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is in Chriſt's Hand, the Body and Power of Sin is deſtroyed, and there only abides in them ſome remainders of Corruption, which none but he by his Spirit can finally vanquiſh, overcome, and root out for ever: And ſhould he not purſue his Victory, all he hath done will prove fruitleſs and in vain; therefore be ſure he will never ceaſe, until he hath brought all his Foes, not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Foot, but deſtroyed them for ever more.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. They are in Chriſt's Hand, as a poor <hi>Orphan</hi> is in the Hand of his Guardian, who commits himſelf wholly to his Care, Faithfulneſs and Compaſſion, whilſt in non-age, not being able to help himſelf or ſhift for himſelf: Thus, I ſay, Believers are in the Hand of Jeſus Chriſt, they are as poor helpleſs <hi>Orphans,</hi> under-Age, and have every one of them choſen him to be the only Guardian and Truſtee of their Souls, or have wholly committed themſelves to his Care by a holy Reſignation of themſelves to him, to be his and no more their own for ever; and will not he be faithful, think you, to every one of them, eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring they did it alſo at his Command, and by the Influence of his Spirit?

If it be folly to imagine any of his Purpoſes ſhould be ſubjected to the Will of Man: (5.) If Chriſt be the right Hand of God, or in whom all his Attributes are united to the Perfection of his Power to ſave Believers: (6.) If Chriſt alſo hath them all in his Hand, as God's faithful Servant, and as their Surety or Truſtee: (7.) If many of them are gone to Heaven al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: (8.) If all Intereſts concerned in our Salvation are well pleaſed in Chriſt's Undertaking: (9.) If the Glory of every one of the Divine Attributes are raiſed in the Salvation of each Believer: (10.) If Chriſt hath received a Charge to keep every one of them, and to loſe none, as he hath promiſed to do: (11.) If Chriſt is every ways fitted to ſupply his Saints with all things they <hi>need</hi> or can <hi>need:</hi> And (12.)

But the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will not caſt away a poor Soul (ſaith that Worthy Perſon) although he cannot make ſo good Muſick in God's Ear as others, or anſwer not the breathing of the Spirit with that Life and Vigour, but he will take Pains with them and mend them; who in a ſpiritual ſenſe are like a bruiſed Reed, broken and bruiſed under the ſenſe of their Sins, Weakneſſes and Unworthineſſes. <hi>Smoaking Flax,</hi> or a little <hi>Flax</hi> that hath <hi>a Spark</hi> of <hi>Fire kindled</hi> in it; or a <hi>Wick</hi> of <hi>Candle,</hi> wherein there is not only no Profit, but ſome Trouble and Noiſomneſs.

Fire in the Flax (let our Saviour refer to what he pleaſes) is meant, no doubt, Divine Grace in the Soul of a poor, weak, and deſponding Chriſtian, and this Chriſt will not quench; that is, he will tenderly cheriſh it, and cauſe it to kindle more and more, until he makes it flame forth and burn clearly: And he will heal, cure, and ſtrengthen the bruiſed Reed; that is, he will never ceaſe until the Soul doth obtain a perfect Victory over Sin, Satan, the Fleſh, the World, and over all Enemies. Grace ſhall prevail over Corruption, though there ſeems more Smoke than Fire, more Sin than Grace, more Weakneſs than Strength, more Darkneſs than Light, more Fear than Faith, yet Grace ſhall be victorious; Grace is that Principle of Life in the Soul, the Law of God writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Heart, which ſhall never finally be obliterated any more, or God's Image, that ſhall not utterly be defaced.

Can it ſtand conſiſtent with his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> to let his precious Grace, which is an Impreſſion of his own Image and Likeneſs in the Soul, be blotted, blurr'd and defaced for ever; this Likeneſs being a Likeneſs unto him in that moſt high and beloved Perfection of his Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> his Holineſs, which Work on the Soul is curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wrought by his own Spirit, and more valued by him, than ten thouſand Worlds; will he, I ſay, neglect that which is ſo dear and like unto him, and ſuffer it to be cruſh'd under the Foot of filthy Corruption by the Luſts of his implacable Enemy?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Can it ſtand conſiſtent with the Honour of God's moſt Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Majeſty, to let Grace be deſtroyed and come to nothing in the Soul, whoſe End in all he doth is principally to advance his own Glory? What is it, I pray you, that tends more to bring Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God in the World, than that Grace which he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into the Hearts of his People? If Sin brings the greateſt Diſhonour to him, then certainly Grace brings the greateſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him, which ſtrives to root out and utterly to deſtroy Sin, ſo that God and Jeſus Chriſt might reign alone in the Soul. If a King hath but one ſpecial Favourite that aſſerts and maintains his Right, and ſeeks to uphold his Throne, be ſure he will, if poſſible, preſerve him, and ſuffer none to undermine and ſupplant that Favourite, ſo as to root him out of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In regard had to Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Purchaſer and <note place="margin">Chriſt is the Purchaſer, the Author and finiſher of Grace.</note> immediate Author of Grace, I further argue; Grace ſhall at laſt become Victorious, or never finally be ſuppreſſed in the Hearts of Believers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Chriſt by his Death purchaſed that Grace which every true Chriſtian is poſſeſſed of: He died <hi>to redeem us from all Iniquity, and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>to purify unto himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</hi> It is upon the Account of his Death, as the Effects of his Death, the Spirit and the Graces of the Spirit are ſhed abroad in our Hearts: <hi>Therefore being by the right Hand of God exalted, and having received</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 2. 33.</note> 
                        <hi>of the Father the Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed forth this which you ſee and hear.</hi> Certainly if he purchaſed us, and Grace for us, when we were his Enemies, he will preſerve it in us ſince we are actually now reconciled to him. Shall he be at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59949:153"/>
of his Blood to buy it, (as one notes) and ſpare his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſecure it? <note place="margin">Charnock.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chriſt was manifeſt to take away Sin, to diſpoſſeſs Satan, and will he let Satan take Poſſeſſion again? He came to deſtroy the <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 5, 8.</note> Works of the Devil? And what are Satan's Works but Sin? Will not Chriſt accompliſh that which he came into the World to do?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He is called the Author and Finiſher of our Faith: If this be ſo, we may aſſure our ſelves he will perfect it; he that begins <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> it, will end it; he hath not left it to another after he hath begun the Work of Faith, to finiſh it: No, no, he ſtill keeps it in his own Hand, and he will ſee it done.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is for the Honour of Chriſt, that Grace lives and is ſtrengthened in his People: <hi>Wherefore alſo we pray for you, that our God would account you worthy of this Calling, and fulfil all the good Pleaſure of his Will, and the Work of Faith with Power.</hi> Part of the good Pleaſure of the Will of God had been fulfilled in them; they were called, juſtified, adopted, and the Work of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was begun; and <hi>Paul</hi> prays, that with Power it might be compleated, and then ſhews us how it tends to the Glory of Chriſt to have this done; <hi>That the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt may be</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Verſe 12.</note> 
                        <hi>glorified, and you in him according to the Grace of our God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Brethren, the Glory of Chriſt, and the final Salvation of the Saints, are wrap'd up together; Grace tends to Chriſt's Glory here, and to his Eternal Praiſe and Glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Jeſus Chriſt's Work, now he is in Heaven, is to intercede <note place="margin">The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Chriſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the Saints in a State of Grace.</note> for his Saints: And be ſure as he prayed when on Earth that the Faith of his <hi>Peters</hi> might not fail, ſo he makes the like Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for them in Heaven. Hence the Interceſſion of Chriſt is part of the Saints Holy Triumph, in that of <hi>Romans</hi> 8. 34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again, who alſo maketh Interceſſion for us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the Interceſſion of Chriſt hath great Power and Prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in it, in order to our final Perſeverance in Grace.<list>
                           <item>1. Becauſe he pleads continually with God the Virtue of his own Merits: what he hath purchaſed for us, he intercedes for; but he purchaſed Grace for us, and he prays for the final continuation of it in us; therefore it ſhall abide in us to the End.</item>
                           <item>2. By his Interceſſion, he prevails with God that we may be delivered from all our Spiritual Enemies, that they may never have
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59949:154"/>
Power over us, of whom Sin is the chief: That which Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes for, he is heard and accepted in; but he intercedes that we may be kept and delivered from the Power and eternal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin, therefore Sin ſhall never have Power to condemn us.</item>
                           <item>3. He intercedes that our Prayers may be heard, and that we may be helped to pray; and part of our Prayer is that Sin may not have Power over us to condemn us; therefore Sin never ſhall ſo condemn us, becauſe Chriſt cauſes our Prayers, with the Incenſe of his own Interceſſion, to come up as a ſweet Savour in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils of God.</item>
                           <item>4. Chriſt intercedes that all our Sins may be pardoned and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: <hi>If any Man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father.</hi> He <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 2.</note> carries this Cauſe for us in the Court of Heaven; therefore our Sins ſhall never work our Ruin.</item>
                           <item>5. It is by his Interceſſion we come to the Throne of Grace with boldneſs; Chriſt our Friend and High Prieſt appearing <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25. Heb. 10. 21, 22.</note> evermore in the Preſence of God for us.</item>
                           <item>6. And alſo it is through Chriſt's Interceſſion that all our Good Works and Holy Services are accepted of God.</item>

                        <hi>ſuch a Bleſſed Principle, ſuch a Spark that Sin nor Satan can't quench, ſuch a Seed that no Enemy can get out of the Ground of our Hearts; if Grace through the Spirit is Life, Eternal Life in the Soul; if Grace be the Darling of Heaven, hath ſuch great and Almighty Allies; if the whole Trinity ſate in Council about the Birth of Grace, or the Way of its infuſion into the Soul; if it be the Gift of the Father's Free Love, and a part of his Holy Nature; if it be wrought in us to ſhew forth his Praiſe; if Grace be God's great and glorious Workmanſhip; if the Power of God be engaged to preſerve it in us; if God hath promiſed to maintain its Life in us; if it cannot ſtand conſiſtent with God's Wiſdom, Love, Faithfulneſs and Holineſs, to let it be totally overcome and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed in the Souls of his Elect; if Chriſt purchaſed Grace for us; if he was manifeſt to take away Sin; if Chriſt be the Author and Finiſher of Grace in the Soul; if the Life of Grace tends ſo much to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Chriſt; if Chriſt's Work now in Heaven is to interceed for the continuation of Grace in us, that it may never fail in the Seed or Habit of it; Then no true Believer can fall ſo from Grace, as eternally to</hi>

                        <hi>periſh. But all this is true; therefore no Believer can ſo fall from Grace as eternally to periſh.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of Information.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt from the whole we may learn, that the State of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, through the Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, is far better than <hi>Adam</hi>'s was by Creation: for though we have no natural and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Power of our own, yet we have a ſupernatural Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to help and uphold us; we <hi>are kept by the Power of God.</hi> He ſtood by the Strength of Nature, and Power of Free-Will, before the Fall: We by the Strength of Grace, and Power of the Mediator, who hath a Charge to uphold us in a State of Grace, which was not allowed to <hi>Adam,</hi> nor the Angels; we have not only the Word of Grace to encourage us, but alſo the Power of Grace to eſtabliſh us. <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood by his own Original Righteouſneſs; our ſtanding is by the Suretiſhip, Righteouſneſs and Undertakings of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Who of God is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and Redemption. Adam</hi>'s Life was in himſelf, our Life is <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> hid in Chriſt; and ſo out of the Power of our worſt Enemies to come at it, or deprive us of it: and as <hi>Adam</hi> and all his were condemned, ſo Chriſt and all his are juſtified.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It may inform us, that ſuch who make a Profeſſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, without attaining to a State of true Grace and real Union with Chriſt, are in danger of eternal Ruin, notwithſtanding what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever their Knowledg, Gifts and common Improvements may be, and their Hopes thereupon; and that they are of this ſort that frequently fall away and periſh in their Sins: which if well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may put every Profeſſor into ſerious Thoughts, and upon a thorow Work of Self-examination about their preſent Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore in this reſpect, there is need enough of thoſe Cautions and Take-heeds in the Scripture, <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> How many are there who do but think they ſtand, or that their State is ſafe and good, when in truth they are in no better Condition than the Fooliſh Virgins, or the thorny and ſtony-ground Profeſſors? <note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. It alſo may inform us, that all thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, are ſuch who take care <hi>to make their Calling and Election ſure.</hi> It is a palpable Demonſtration, that they are under ſtrong Deluſion, who ſuppoſe Election only refers to the End, and not to the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59949:155"/>
Means; or that Men that are elected, ſhall be ſaved, let them live how they pleaſe: No, no, the Caſe is quite otherwiſe; we are elected to be Holy, as well as to be Happy; the whole Deſign of God herein, being to make us Holy, and alſo to preſerve us in a Way and State of Holineſs: Therefore if thou doſt begin well, haſt obtained true Grace, and doſt continue in a Way of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing; or doſt bring forth good Fruit, and doſt not waver nor faint in thy Mind, it may be an Evidence, that thy State is Good, and that thou art one of Chriſt's Sheep, who follow him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and wilt ſo follow him unto the End.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> This may be Matter of great Comfort to weak Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and ſuch who may be under ſpiritual Deadneſs, and feel Corruption too ſtrong for them. O do not be diſcouraged, the weakeſt Grace gives a deadly wound to Sin, and a good ground of Hope thy State is ſafe: your Names are written in Heaven, which is, as our Saviour notes, the greateſt Cauſe of Joy; which <note place="margin">Luke 10. 20.</note> it could not be if their Names might be blotted out again. 'Tis no wonder Sin is in thee, and makes thee mourn, when it made <hi>Paul</hi> to cry out, <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>from this Body of Sin and Death!</hi> 'Tis one thing to have the Law of Sin in our Members, and to have Sin in our Converſations; and another thing to have it reign in us, or to have it in our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Soul, remember that weak Grace, weak Faith, ſhall become victorious: Thou haſt Grace enough in thy Head, though thou haſt but little in thy Hand. O cry to God, be much in Prayer that God would give thee more Grace, and ſupply thy Wants, and quicken and revive thy Soul, as he hath promiſed. A weak Faith renders the Soul as perfectly juſtified in Chriſt, as the ſtrongeſt Faith any Man hath whoſoever he be; and gives a Title to Eternal Life: he that had but a weak or a dim Eye, that look'd up unto the Brazen Serpent, was as well healed, as he that had a ſtrong Sight or good Eyes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Doctrine yields much Comfort to the ſtrongeſt Saint alſo; for if he that hath never ſo ſtrong and lively Faith, might fall finally away and periſh, what would Regeneration, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſignify to him? Would not his Spirits droop, and his Fears torment him! But here, by virtue of the Doctrine of final Perſeverance, is Comfort both for the Weak and Strong, both have equal Intereſt in Chriſt, in God's Love, in the Covenant; both are elected, both are in Chriſt's Hand. Such who
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59949:155"/>
have now a ſtrong Faith, had once but a weak Faith; it was but a little Seed once: and Chriſt's Charge extends to thoſe that are weak, <hi>He carries the Lambs in his Arms:</hi> and the Stock in Chriſt's Hand is ſure, and his Promiſe of ſupply ſhall not fail; and the <note place="margin">Iſa. 40. 11.</note> Strong cannot ſtand of themſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly, Caution.</hi> Judg not of the Truth of thy Grace by the weakneſs of it; a little Gold, a Dram is Gold as well as a great Wedg.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let not this encourage thee to be negligent or remiſs in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: God has promiſed thee Victory, but thou muſt ſight: <hi>Grace</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 11, 12.</note> 
                        <hi>teacheth us to deny all Vngodlineſs.</hi> He that is not under the Influence of Grace, never had the Truth of it in him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Always conſider this in thy Heart, that thy ſtanding is by Grace, and that thou art in Chriſt's Hand: O depend on him for all, and fly to him for whatſoever thou doſt need.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer; <hi>All People</hi> doth not intend every individual Perſon; to <hi>all People,</hi>
that is, the good News is not to you only, but to both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> I have ſhewed you before that <hi>[all],</hi> and <hi>[every],</hi> and <hi>[whole World],</hi> is taken in many places of Holy Scripture with reſtriction, and takes in but a <hi>part;</hi> as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when the <hi>Vniverſality</hi> of the Subject is intended, it is expreſſed by ſingular; <hi>If a Man die, ſhall he live again?</hi> Which refers to every Man. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved;</hi> it ſignifies <hi>all</hi> that ſo do. So, <hi>I will pour out of my Spirit upon ALL Fleſh,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joel 2. 28.</note> as you have it in <hi>Joel;</hi> that is, upon Perſons of every <hi>Age, Sex,</hi> and <hi>Degree;</hi> upon <hi>Young, Old, Maſters, Servants, Sons</hi> and <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> ſo it may be taken here, and in ſeveral other places; as that in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Who will have all Men ſaved,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>Kings</hi> as well as <hi>Peaſants, Noble</hi> as well as <hi>Ignoble, Rich</hi> as well as <hi>Poor, Gentiles</hi> as well as <hi>Jews,</hi> or ſome of <hi>all ſorts.</hi> The Goſpel is ſaid to be <hi>preached</hi> in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Time <hi>to every Creature under Heaven,</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. Was the Birth of Chriſt Matter of Joy in the Effects of it to <hi>Judas,</hi> and to the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> and to many more?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I argue thus; If the Birth and Death of Chriſt was cauſe of greateſt Joy to all Perſons, individually conſidered, it muſt be thus either in reſpect of the Deſign, Purpoſe and Intention of God, becauſe of ſuch Joy unto them, or elſe in reſpect of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Effects of his Birth and Death: But (1.) Who will ſay that God, according to his Eternal Purpoſe and Deſign, did intend it for the Salvation of every individual Perſon? None can be ſo weak ſure to aſſert that; for who ſhall reſiſt God's Will, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand God's abſolute Deſign, Purpoſe and Intention? Chriſt muſt accompliſh or effect the Salvation of all, if in that ſenſe it was Matter or Cauſe of Joy unto all, or that he died for all, or that God would have all, that is, every individual Man and Woman in the World ſaved. (2.) And as to the Effects of the Death of Chriſt, it is evident quite otherwiſe, for Multitudes have no ſaving Benefit thereby: Therefore it follows clearly, that that is not the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59949:156"/>
ſenſe of the Text nor Mind of the Spirit of God; though in ſome ſenſe the Birth and Death of Chriſt was Cauſe of Joy to all, ſince every one received all that Good thereby whatſoever it is they are poſſeſſed of.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Did not <hi>Simeon</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt ſay, that <hi>this Child</hi> (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt) <hi>is ſet for the Fall, and riſing again of many in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael?</hi>

                     <p n="5">5. Alſo it is ſaid, <hi>Every Man ſhall have praiſe of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 5. which can refer to none but to good Men, or godly Men only: So it is ſaid, God is the Father of <hi>all; One God and Father of all,</hi> Eph. 4. 6.

A Child of God may ſin and fall grievouſly, and greatly diſhonour God, and bring Reproach on the Goſpel, which may tend to grieve ſome, and harden others; nay, he may loſe his Comfort and Joy of God's Salvation, therefore hath need to watch. Satan is a ſtrong, a vigilant and cunning Enemy: O ſee what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons you have from thence to watch and pray.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If you grow careleſs, carnal, or indifferent in the Matters of Religion, it may be a ſign that your Hearts are not right with God: Many of the Members of the Churches to whom the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were directed, were no more than Profeſſors; and if ſo, they were liable to fall away and periſh for ever.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have alſo fully anſwered this Objection already; ſee the Argument taken from our Union with Chriſt: There is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold being in Chriſt, an External being in him by a Profeſſion, and a true Spiritual being in him.</p>
                     <p>Object. 6. <hi>If Chriſt died not for all, what ground have I to believe he died for me?</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. What doth it ſignify to believe Chriſt died for all, unleſs thou findeſt the Effects of his Death in thee? Many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſhall periſh, notwithſtanding Chriſt died for them in their Judgment that make this Objection, yea the generality of them for whom he died; therefore unleſs all were ſaved, what Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement is there to believe from hence?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He that believes, ſhall be ſaved: If thou therefore doſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, thou ſhalt be ſaved. Is not this a better Ground of Faith, than that of Chriſt's dying for all?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A bare believing that Chriſt died for all, I have proved is no Ground of thy Intereſt in his Death, for that may be without any Fruits or gracious Effects.</p>

the Salvation of Man. For if it be to be taken in their ſenſe, then it would follow that Man is his own Saviour; for if I procure my own Salvation by Works, or by working it out for my ſelf, <hi>I ſave my ſelf,</hi> or am my own Saviour; or I do appropriate part of it to my ſelf, which is the worſt part of <hi>Popery:</hi> They ſay, that Chriſt's Merits, with their own good Works, do juſtify and ſave them. And what do the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſay leſs, who join Faith, Inherent Righteouſneſs, and Sincere Obedience, with the Merits of Chriſt, both in Juſtification before God, and in the Salvation of their Souls? They ſay, all Men are in a capacity, or have Power to work out their own Salvation if they will. Mr. <hi>William Allen</hi> ſays <note place="margin">Rom. 4, 5. Allen<hi>'s Glaſs of Juſtificat.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. It is evident, that the Perſons to whom the Holy Apoſtle <note place="margin">What Work of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work out.</note> wrote this Epiſtle, were Saints and Juſtified Perſons, or ſuch who were quickned, renewed or regenerated by the Holy Spirit.

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. They could not appeaſe the Wrath of God, nor ſatisfy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice; that ſure was not in their Power to do, nor is it here intended.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They could not deliver themſelves from the Curſe of the Law, becauſe by their uttermoſt endeavour they could not arrive to a compleat or perfect Righteouſneſs, nor ſatisfy for the breach of it, by Original Sin, and by Actual Sins formerly by them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They could not change their own Hearts, or <hi>create in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a new Heart,</hi> they had no <hi>creating Power;</hi> certainly they dare not ſay they had Power, or were capable <hi>to form Chriſt</hi> in their Souls, or <hi>reſtore God's loſt Image in them.</hi> Again,</p>

4. They could not raiſe themſelves from the Dead, for they were once <hi>dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes;</hi> and ſure they will ſay, that <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 1, 2.</note> to raiſe and quicken the Dead is Chriſt's Work only: <hi>You hath he quickned;</hi> he does not ſay, <hi>you have ye quickned.</hi>

                     <p n="5">5. They could not bind the ſtrong Man armed, who formerly had the ruling Power in them, and in whoſe Chains and Fetters they were once bound: Will they ſay, that all Men have a greater Power in them, than is the Power of Satan, ſo that Man may tranſlate himſelf if he will, <hi>out of the Power and Kingdom of Satan, into the Kingdom of God's dear Son,</hi> as all Believers by the irreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Power of God are?</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What Work is it then? What were they to work out?</hi>

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But can the Creature do theſe things you mention of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle ſeems very jealous of theſe Saints, leſt they ſhould catch up ſome <hi>Arminian Notion,</hi> (which is too much rooted in Man's corrupt Nature); and therefore to vanquiſh Free-Will, or the Power of the Creature for ever, (nay, the Power that is in regenerated Perſons) he adds, <hi>For it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his own good Pleaſure;</hi> who worketh in them powerfully, effectually carrying on the Work through all Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Obſtacles with victorious Efficacy: God works not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Grace in them at firſt, but ſtill by his Spirit, through freſh Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, does aid, influence and aſſiſt them, and will until the Work is perfected, or <hi>until the Day of Chriſt.</hi> We cannot mortify Sin, pray, nor do any good Work without the Spirit: <hi>If ye through</hi>

This our Lord ſpoke to his Diſciples who were converted, no doubt but they had paſs'd through the New Birth before that time, yet by reaſon of Pride that budded forth afreſh in them, they muſt be humbled again, repent again, or find, as it were, a ſecond Converſion, or they could not be ſaved: No Perſon that yields to Sin, unleſs he repents and turns from it, can enter into God's Kingdom. But doth the Words of our Saviour ſignify a Poſſibility that they might or might not repent, and ſo might or might not be ſaved? No ſuch matter, but rather the abſolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Humility, and leaving off every Sin in all that ſhall be eternally ſaved.</p>

It would alſo follow, as he obſerves, that thoſe who are gone to Heaven, have nothing more of Chriſt's to glory in, and to praiſe him for, than thoſe who are periſhed and gone to Hell: For, according to the Principle of General Redemption, Chriſt did and doth for all alike, and not a Jot more for one Party than for another. Alſo, as he notes, it tends to make Men preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and carnally ſecure. How many have ſooth'd up themſelves in their Impenitency and hardneſs of their Hearts, and fenced themſelves againſt the Word, upon this very Suppoſition, that Chriſt died for all, and therefore for them, and why ſhould not they look to be ſaved as well as others? To which I might add, their Notion of that Power which they ſay is in the Creature to believe, leads Men out to defer looking out for Salvation: for why may they not delay to do that to Day, which is in their Power to do to Morrow, and may be perhaps ſome Years hence as well as now? But let them and all others know, Chriſt's Death will have its Effect on their Hearts, if he died for them, and they
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59949:164"/>
muſt look to him when he calls, and wait upon him for the moving of his Spirit, in the uſe of that Means which he hath ordained in order to Faith and Regeneration, and in the ſeaſon of it, who ſays, <hi>To day if you will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts,</hi> &amp;c. but the <hi>Will,</hi> the <hi>Deed;</hi> they muſt wait upon the Lord to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and work by his Spirit in them.</p>

Praiſe God for the Knowledg you have of the Myſteries of Chriſt, and the Goſpel of Free-Grace: Brethren next unto the Grace of God in my Converſion, I have often ſaid, I do look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſelf bound to admire the Riches of God's Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me, in opening my Eyes to ſee thoſe <hi>Arminian Errors,</hi>

which when I was Young, I had from ſome Men of corrupt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſucked in; nay, and when I was about 23 Years Old, I wrote a little Book for Children, in which ſome of thoſe Errors were vindicated; which after, my Eyes were inlightned, and the Book with Alterations being again Reprinted, I left out, and now do declare my diſlike of the firſt Impreſſions, and do diſown what I there aſſerted: <hi>When I was a Child, I thought as a Child, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as a Child,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. And let me intreat you to ſtudy the Nature of the Covenant of Grace; for until I had that opened unto me, I was ignorant of the Myſteries of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. O do not forget, that the Deſign of God in contriving our Salvation in his Eternal Wiſdom by Jeſus Chriſt, was wholly to advance his own Glory, and the Freeneſs and Riches of his Grace, and to abaſe and humble Man unto the Duſt; therefore be ſure never err on that Hand: And I think it is not eaſy for Men well to err on the other, I mean, in exalting God alone, Chriſt alone, though I deny not but that ſome good Men, who in ſeeking to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Free-Grace, perhaps have erred, and taken up ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Notions, as that of Actual or Perſonal Juſtification, before Faith and Actual Union with Jeſus Chriſt. O what need have we to ponder well the Paths of our Feet, and not with Pride to magnify our ſelves, or ſtrive to promote any corrupt Notion, under any Pretence whatſoever! Our Days are Evil, many dangerous Errors abound, and it is cauſe of greateſt Grief to ſee what a Generation of Men are riſen up of late, who ſtrive to mix God's pure Gold with their Droſs, and his Wine with their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Though on the other Hand, let us bleſs and praiſe the Lord for raiſing up ſo many brave Champions in the mean time, of our Brethren of the <hi>Congregational Way,</hi> to defend the Goſpel of God's Grace, and the Truth as it is in Jeſus: Yet I could wiſh there was not ſo much Gall in ſome of them againſt us their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who in all the great Truths of Chriſtianity are of one Mind and Judgment, and yet are expoſed to Reproach for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing to a Truth of Chriſt that lies as plain in the Goſpel as any one Truth or poſitive Precept of Chriſt whatſoever; I mean, that of Believers Baptiſm. Why ſhould we be cenſured for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that Truth which the Holy Ghoſt ſo fully bears witneſs unto? I long to ſee more of the Spirit of Love and Charity; would to God that Chapter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. was more read and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>

4. This may alſo ſerve to reprehend ſuch who ſtrive to caſt Reproach upon this Holy Doctrine, and ſuch that maintain it as if it tended to incourage People in Sin, or open a Door to Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs: Let all for ever forbear ſuch Reflections; Is not this the Purport of that Doctrine which we vindicate?</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) That there is wrought and preſerved in the Minds and Souls of all Believers, by the Holy Spirit, a Supernatural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Grace and Holineſs, whereby they are made meet, and enabled to live unto God, and diſcharge all Duties of Obedience which he requireth of them, and accepteth through Chriſt; which Principle or Habit of Grace is eſſentiaily diſtinct from all Natural Habits, Intellectual and Moral, however, and by what Means ſo ever acquired or improved.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) That the Holy Spirit by his effectual Operations, doth enable us, according as we are required by his immediate Influences, in all Acts of Obedience; whether internal only in Faith and Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or External alſo; even ſo, that all the Powers of our Souls, and Members of our Bodies, are or ought to be in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner governed and influenced thereby, and unto all Duties of Holineſs, in our daily walking with God: and that all this is the Effect of God's Free-Grace to us in Jeſus Chriſt, who hath communicated of the Spirit without meaſure, to our Bleſſed Head and Mediator, that he may give it forth to all his Saints that have Union with him, and believe in him.</p>
                     <p>Brethren, God hath circumciſed the Hearts of his People, to love him with all their Souls, and with all their Strength: He writes <note place="margin">Deut. 30. 6.</note> his Law in our Hearts, as he promiſed; <hi>I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts.</hi> This gracious Habit or <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 33.</note> Principle in the Soul, is nothing but a Tranſcript of the Holy Law of God, implanted and abiding in our Hearts, whereby we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, with Chearfulneſs and ready Inclination of our Spirits, to act in the Duties of Obedience and Holineſs unto God, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us: and alſo our Likeneſs and Conformity unto God, doth conſiſt herein; I ſay, it doth conſiſt in this Divine and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Principle, or Spiritual Habit that is infuſed into the Soul, it is our Spiritual Life, whereby we live unto God; it is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Sum of all Internal Excellencies; no Works, no Duties, are accepted, where this Principle is not. It is a Vital Principle of Holineſs, and it makes Religion co-natural to us: Moreover, it is a certain, a permanent, and an abiding Principle; it is that
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:59949:165"/>
Seed that remains in Believers, and will have good and ſpiritual Fruit to attend it: therefore this Doctrine muſt needs promote Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that is thus founded on ſuch a Sacred Principle, and the Motives are every way as ſtrong.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It appears, Brethren, that our ſtanding by Grace is moſt firm and ſure, it is like the ſtanding of thoſe who are in their conſummate State in Glory: The Good Angels, and Bleſſed Souls above, are confirmed in that State by ſuperabounding Grace; for by Nature (as one obſerves) the Angels are mutable: What was the Reaſon ſome of them fell, who beheld the Face of God? The bare beholding the Face and Glory of God, will not continue one Creature in a happy State, without an Act of Divine and Confirming Grace; it is a continual Addition of Grace, and Supplies of Grace, that preſerves our Souls in a State of Life: and to this End are we united to Jeſus Chriſt; I mean to ſuch an Head, that of and from his Fulneſs we might have a Communication of Strength, and all Divine Influences, as our Souls do ſtand in need.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And this being ſo, labour after the Exerciſe of Grace, reſt not in a ſmall Degree thereof; the more Grace you have, the more Glory you will bring to God, and the more eaſy it will be for you to reſiſt Temptations.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The more Grace, alſo the more Peace: Holineſs is that which God calls for; it is that which becomes his Houſe for ever, and without it no Man ſhall ever ſee the Lord. Therefore let this be the Uſe of all the Sermons you have heard from this Text, even to work up your Hearts to Thankfulneſs, to Holineſs, in all the whole Courſe of your Lives, and to depend upon Chriſt alone, into whoſe Hand you are committed by the Father, that he would give you freſh Supplies of Grace, and keep you from falling. To whom, with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, be Glory and Praiſe for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

They ſeemed but Infants <hi>or Babes in Knowledg,</hi> and had need to <hi>be taught again which were the firſt Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt.</hi> And from hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle acquaints them with the Danger of not perſevering in the Knowledg of Chriſt, and of not preſſing forward, or going on to Perfection: And alſo intimates, that this would give juſt Cauſe or Ground to fear, that they were not ſincere Chriſtians; and from thence gives them an Account of thoſe that might ſin the Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, or of the miſerable State and Condition of ſuch who after high Illuminations and great Knowledg of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth, and a Profeſſion of the Goſpel, do fall away; whoſe Apoſtacy, though at firſt it might be but partial, yet might (they not being truly regenerated) end at laſt in a total and final fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away: And that deadneſs, dulneſs, and non-proficiency in Godlineſs, might and would end (if their Hearts were not right with God) in a final Apoſtacy: Or, as a worthy Writer notes,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> David Dickſon.</note> he preſuppoſeth, "Except they ſtudy to make Progreſs, they ſhall go backwards; and that going backwards, tendeth to Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: And that voluntary and compleat Apoſtacy from known Truth, doth harden the Heart from Repentance, and cutteth off a Man from Mercy: He accounteth our natural Security ſo great, that there is need of moſt fearful Threatnings to awaken us out of it; and that the way to be freed from final falling, is to make a good Progreſſion." From hence note,</p>
                     <p>Doct. 1. <hi>That the ſevereſt Doctrine is not only uſeful, but exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary towards Perſons that are obſerved to be remiſs and ſlothful in their Profeſſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet Charity becomes a Miniſter nevertheleſs, and not to cenſure a People from hence. And this we may gather from what he ſaith, with the Connexion of the Words with what ſucceeds: <hi>But Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, we are perſwaded better things of you, and things that accompany Salvation, though we thus ſpeak,</hi> ver. 9.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſhall conſider the Perſons here ſpoken of, under <note place="margin">What the Perſons are that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here intends.</note> their divers Qualifications and great Attainments, which are five<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold;
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59949:168"/>
and yet notwithſtanding all that, they might fall away and periſh for ever: and if they did fall totally, before they were tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regenerated, their Apoſtacy would be final; or it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to be renewed again by Repentance, either to that State in which they were before, or unto a better, from whence there is no poſſibility of their final falling.</p>
                     <p>In this general Deſcription of the Perſons here mentioned, let us conſider four or five things more particularly.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> Conſider the Apoſtle's Deſign, which is to declare or diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the fearful State and juſt Judgment of God againſt the Perſons here meant or intended.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> That thoſe five Attainments he here ſpeaks of, are acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſome who had been Profeſſors of the Goſpel, and look'd upon as eminent Chriſtians, ſuch that had made a Profeſſion of Repentance from dead Works, and of Faith towards God, and had been baptized, and owned all other Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt. See <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3.</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> That all thoſe high Privileges and Attainments, whereof they were made Partakers by the Goſpel, they afterwards deſpiſed; or, when under their Apoſtacy, did contemn: which loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims their Deſtruction from God to be juſt and deſerved.</p>
                     <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> That all their Privileges and Attainments, (as Reverend Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> obſerves) do conſiſt in certain Operations of the Holy Ghoſt, under the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel; and therefore not ſuch Perſons that never profeſſed it, or had been enlightned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
                     <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> And let it be well and for ever obſerved, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle mentions not one of thoſe ſpecial and diſtinguiſhing Marks or Characters of true Believers or Sanctified Chriſtians. As,<list>

                           <item>6. Nothing is mentioned of their Election, of Adoption, nor of their Love to God or to his poor Saints; none of theſe things are expreſſed or aſſigned unto them, which do all appertain to every true Chriſtian.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6<hi>thly.</hi> It ought alſo carefully to be noted, that when the Apoſtle <note place="margin">What things do accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> comes to ſpeak of his Hope of the Saints to whom he wrote, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they were not ſuch, he lays down or deſcribes by way of Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the Characters of true Believers, by other diſtinguiſhing Qualifications: <hi>But Beloved, we are perſwaded better things of you, and things that accompany Salvation, though we thus ſpeak.</hi> Now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 9.</note> if thoſe Perſons he mentions that had been once enlightned, and had taſted of the Heavenly Gift, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had been true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; what better things could the Apoſtle be perſwaded was in theſe <hi>Hebrews</hi> than was in them? Are there better things than <hi>Vnion with Chriſt,</hi> than <hi>Juſtification,</hi> than <hi>Regeneration,</hi> true <hi>Faith, Pardon of Sin, Love to God</hi> and to his People, <hi>Sanctification of the Spirit</hi> and <hi>Adoption?</hi> No, no, there are no better things that any Chriſtian can attain unto in this Life than theſe. Moreover,</p>
                     <p n="7">7<hi>thly.</hi> The Apoſtle clearly intimates, that they were ſuch who were like the Ground which the Rain falls oft upon, that never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs brings forth Briars and Thorns, and no good Fruit.</p>
                     <p n="8">8<hi>thly.</hi> There is one thing particularly noted by the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe Hebrew Chriſtians, which they had, and which the other had not, therefore not gracious Perſons: See <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>For God is not unrighteous, to forget your Work of Faith and Labour of Love, which ye have ſhewed toward his Name, in that ye have miniſtred to the Saints, and do miniſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) This he mentions as a Reaſon of his good Opinion of them, <note place="margin">Love to the poor Saints, a bleſſed ſign of true Grace.</note> and why he was ſo perſwaded of them; and which was better than all thoſe high Attainments of which he ſpeaks concerning ſuch that are in danger of Final Apoſtacy: Love to the poor Saints in miniſtring to them for the ſake of Chriſt, or becauſe they are the Members of his Body, is more than all thoſe five Attainments men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the 4<hi>th,</hi> 5<hi>th</hi> and 6<hi>th</hi> Verſes. Now alſo let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that if this Fruit of true and ſaving Grace, I mean, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or Love to the poor Saints, as ſuch, had been in the Perſons he ſpeaks of, who were in danger of falling finally; how then could this be an Argument of ſuch Confidence in <hi>Paul</hi> concerning
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:59949:169"/>
them, or of Comfort to thoſe Saints he wrote unto? Alas, what are common Illuminations? What is it to have ſome <hi>tranſit taſte of the Heavenly Gift,</hi> or to be made Partakers of the common Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit in Convictions of Sin or of Duty, to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of the Spirit, or unfeigned Love to Chriſt and to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God? Or what is it to have ſome taſte of the good Word of God, to a ſpiritual feeding and digeſting it, or to be affected with the powerful Doctrine of the Goſpel in reſpect of the World to come; or with the Reſurrection of the Dead and laſt Judgment, to the gracious Experience of the Power of Chriſt's Reſurrection, and ſo feel in our Souls a Diſcharge from the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Great Day, through Faith in Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) The Apoſtle was perſwaded concerning theſe Hebrew Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that they had ſuch things in them that <hi>did accompany Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> that is, ſuch things that are inſeparable from Salvation; <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch who have them ſhall certainly be ſaved. He deſcribes ſuch who are ſincere Chriſtians, by the Fruits and Effects of true Grace, namely, <hi>the Work of Faith, and Labour of Love,</hi> by which their Obedience unto God did appear.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He notes the Principle from whence they acted in their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Conſtancy of their Obedience; they continued in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of that good Fruit, they had miniſtred to the Saints, and ſtill did miniſter to them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He takes notice of the Principle from whence they acted, or did what they did, <hi>viz.</hi> they miniſtred to the Saints in Love to God, and to Jeſus Chriſt; it was Love ſhewed to his Name.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He adds that in their Preſervation in their happy State, the Faithfulneſs of God: <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget your Work of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. which comprehends his Covenant and Promiſe to them; which for their farther Comfort, he enlargeth upon, <hi>ver.</hi> 13 to <hi>ver.</hi> 19. to which he ſubjoins the Promiſe and Oath of God made to all that are ſincere Believers, or Heirs of the Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed, to ſpeak to thoſe <hi>five Qualifications</hi> or Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Perſo she ſpeaks of in our Text, who may fall away and finally periſh for ever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The firſt is their being <hi>once enlightned.</hi> They might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Doctrine of the Goſpel beyond many, or be illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, not only by learning the literal Knowledg of the Goſpel, as Men learn <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> but alſo may attain to ſome ſupernatural Light by the common Illuminations of the Spirit; and may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

                     <p>Doct. 2. <hi>That it is a high Privilege and an Attainment for Men to be enlightned with the Knowledg of the Goſpel; yet nevertheleſs Men may attain to much Light therein, and yet not be ſavingly enlightned, but may finally fall away and periſh notwithſtanding at laſt.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. As to the horrid Guilt thereof, as it expoſeth the Soul to God's Wrath: Thus was <hi>Judas</hi> enlightned, his Conſcience was convinced that he had <hi>betrayed the Innocent Blood:</hi> Thus alſo <hi>Felix</hi> was enlightned under <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From theſe Convictions they may alſo with much horror con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their Sins: <hi>Cain, Judas,</hi> and many others did this.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From theſe Illuminations and Convictions, they may reform their Lives, and do many things, like as <hi>Herod</hi> did upon his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>John the Baptiſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Nay, common Illuminations may diſcover to the Sinner much of that Evil that there is in Sin, that God abhorreth it, and that it is contrary to his Nature, as well as a violation of his Holy Law; and this Light they may receive, from what God declares concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin, and of his abhorrence of it in his Word, as alſo by thoſe fearful Judgments which he inflicteth upon, and pronounceth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch that ſin, live in Sin, and make a Trade of it. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the Knowledg they may attain concerning Chriſt's ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Sin, and by the Puniſhment of the Damned in Hell; and no doubt but the Devils know the great Evil of Sin in all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
                     <p>But pray obſerve, that although theſe Perſons may know that Sin is againſt God, contrary to his Holy Nature, and that he doth abhor it; yet this Light and Knowledg they have, never brings them to loath and abhor it in themſelves becauſe of the evil Nature of it, and as it is againſt God.</p>

2<hi>dly.</hi> They alſo by theſe common Illuminations, may come to know that God is Man's chiefeſt Good: The <hi>Heathen</hi> found this out by the Light of Nature, conſidering in themſelves that nothing in this World could ſatisfy the Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe Perſons attain unto a farther Sight and Knowledg of it, by the Word, in a ſupernatural manner; but yet remember that the Light they have, never leadeth them to make choice of God as their chiefeſt Good and only Happineſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> They may attain unto the Knowledg of all the great and eſſential Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, and be able to diſpute and contend for them alſo, againſt Oppoſers; nay, may be able Preachers of that Holy Doctrine: <hi>Have we not propheſied in thy</hi>

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59949:170"/>
Ghoſt intimates here and in other places, as well as by all our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, that Light or Illumination is the firſt thing God doth create in the Souls of all that are renewed; and if it be but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Light, the Work that flows therefrom will be but a common Work of the Spirit; and <hi>if that Light that is in Men be Darkneſs, how great is that Darkneſs!</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now as touching the ſpecial and ſaving Illuminations of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they differ from the common.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In reſpect of Convictions of Sin: Evangelical Illuminations <note place="margin">The Nature of the ſpecial Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit.</note> of the Spirit, diſcover to the Soul its fearful State; not only that Sin is of a hateful Nature, but that he is condemned as a Perſon dead in Law, and trembles at the ſight and ſenſe thereof, not knowing but that the Sentence may be ſuddenly executed upon him: <hi>They were pricked in the Heart, and cried out, Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>

                        <hi>what ſhall we do?</hi> It was their Sin that made them cry out. But pray obſerve, that the ſight and ſenſe of Sin never breaks the Heart throughly and kindly, till the Soul ſees the pardoning Grace of God in Chriſt. Shew a Condemned Malefactor a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don from his Prince, (that was hardned before under the Senſe of the Severity of the Law) O then he is melted and wounded, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy overcomes him; ſo it is with a poor Sinner, when he ſees God's Love and Grace in Chriſt; or a bleeding Chriſt, who has born the Puniſhment due to him for his Offences: then he is kindly broken, and mourns that ever he grieved or offended God; <hi>They ſhall look unto him whom they have pierced, and ſhall</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. Common Convictions reach only to ſome Sins, perhaps ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Sins; they chiefly, if not only, torment the Conſcience, under ſome awakening Providence, or under the preaching of Wrath and Judgment; <hi>And as he reaſoned of Righteouſneſs, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>

Pſal. 38. 7.</note> upon this reſpect it was that <hi>David</hi> compared his Sin and Polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a loathſom Diſeaſe. The one cries out, that he has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended an angry God; this is the Nature of legal Convictions, ſuch would fain get out of God's Hands, he flies from him: But the other cries out, I have grieved a Good and Gracious God, and he flies to him, as the <hi>Prodigal</hi> did to his loving and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Father.</p>

Common Illuminations in Convictions, lay the Soul half dead, he ſees he is Wounded; but ſpecial Illuminations of the Spirit, diſcover the Soul is quite Dead: <hi>When the Commandment came, Sin revived, and I died.</hi> The one diſcovers that the Perſon <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 9.</note> is a Sinner, but not in a helpleſs State; for though he ſees he is undone by his Sin and Diſobedience, yet he thinks he may riſe by his Duties and Obedience: But a Perſon truly enlightned, ſees he muſt have a Principle of Life infuſed, before he can riſe, live, or act; and that all his own Righteouſneſs he hath, or is capable of obtaining, is but as <hi>Dung</hi> and Filthineſs in his ſight.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Common Illuminations cauſe a Man to ſee Sin, as it is a great Evil againſt himſelf; <hi>I have killed a Man to my hurt,</hi> ſaith one of this ſort: But ſpecial Illuminations diſcover Sin to be the greateſt Evil, as it is againſt God: the one may know that God hates Sin, but the other is brought to hate it himſelf, and becauſe God hates it: <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned, and done</hi>

6. Common Illuminations give a Perſon a ſenſe of Death and Wrath due to Sin; but ſpecial Illuminations give a Man a ſenſe and an effecting ſight of the Death of Chriſt, and of that Wrath and Curſe he hath born for him in his ſtead: Legal Convictions diſcovered only to them under the Law (who ſaw no further) that the Life of the poor Beaſts went for Sin; but Evangelical Convictions ſhew that nothing can atone for our Sins, and ſatisfy God's Juſtice, but the Life of the Son of God, not the Blood of Bulls or Lambs; no, it muſt be the Blood of the Lamb of God.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Common Illuminations are a Man's Torment and Affliction, and fain he would be eaſed and freed of them, and of the ſmart thereby; but the ſpecial ones tend to make a Man fear that he is not troubled enough, he would be ſearched thorowly: <hi>Search me,</hi>

The Devils cried, <hi>Why doſt thou torment us before the Time?</hi> So unſound Perſons would not be tormented; but Conſcience hath got hold of them, and they cannot get out of its Hand. But one truly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, ſaith, with <hi>David, I will be ſorry for my Sin;</hi> I chuſe it, I deſire it: The one deſires to be freed from the Effects of Sin, from the Pain and Puniſhment thereof; but the other cries out to be delivered from the Sin, which is the Cauſe of all Pain and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The one is like the Swine, who likes not the Whip, yet loves the Mire; they like not the Laſh of the Law, but hate to come under the Yoke of the Goſpel: The one cries out for a Plaiſter to eaſe his Conſcience, may be he is willing to let ſome Boughs and Twigs be lop'd off; but the other would have the Ax laid to the Root of the Tree; he would have the Body of Sin, as well as the Branches, to be deſtroyed; he is for cutting off the right Hand, Luſts of Profit, and for pulling out the right Eye, Luſts of Pleaſure: The unſound Soul is, like <hi>Saul,</hi> for ſparing ſome of the Fat of the Cattel, and <hi>Agag</hi> the King, I mean his chief and beloved Luſts; but a ſincere Chriſtian is for yielding up all to the Sword of the Spirit.</p>

cauſe the Soul to draw nearer to God in Jeſus Chriſt: The one is like a Slave under the Rod, fain would get away from his Maſter; the other is like a Child under the Rod, that deſires to ſee and behold his Father's reconciled Face and Favour. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Illuminations wound, but the Soul ſees not the Way of Cure, nor will he bear the Inſtrument which would let out the Life and Power of Sin, but perhaps catches up ſome thing or another to apply to his Sore, may be his changed Life, his Duties and good Deeds: from hence he hopes that his State is good, he being as he thinks not the Man he once was. But as he who is under ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Illuminations, comes to be wounded, by beholding a bleeding Saviour, which is the alone way of Cure; ſo he chiefly deſires that Faith, that Grace which will deſtroy the Life and Power of all Sin, and thorowly cleanſe and purify his Soul. Brethren, the Spirit of a Sinner may be torn into pieces by legal Terror, the Heart of Stone may be broken, and yet no Heart of Fleſh be given; the Ground may be plow'd up in part, yet the Seed of Grace not ſown in the Heart: Senſuality, ſaith one, may be kept down by a Spirit of Bondage, when it is not caſt out by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption: They have the Law to convince them, but not Grace to renew them; it is not being once enlightned that is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, unleſs truly enlightned; it is not great Knowledg, unleſs it be ſanctified; it is not the fair Fruit of Reformation, nor Oil in the Lamp of the outward Life and viſible Profeſſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; it is not your ſeeming pious Duties nor legal Convictions that diſcover you to be a true Chriſtian: no, nothing ſhort of Union with Chriſt, and Faith that works by Love, avails any thing. <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 10.

                     <p n="9">9. Common or Legal Illuminations doubtleſs flow from a ſenſe of God's Power, who is able to puniſh and reward the Creature according to his Work; not that they would be like God, but can't alas get out of the Hand of God: But true ſpiritual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightnings riſe from a ſenſe of God's Holineſs, by beholding the Excellency of it, and ſeeing a neceſſity of a Conformity thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; the Convictions of the one at the beſt is at a ſtay, they do not grow, however they never terminate in Converſion; the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect cannot exceed the Cauſe, they only tend to reform the Life, and oft-times ſuch return with the <hi>Dog to his Vomit again:</hi> but <hi>the Path of the Juſt,</hi> in ſpiritual Convictions, <hi>is as a ſhining Light that</hi>

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> By the Word of God is meant, the Word of the Goſpel; <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi> Again it is <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17. 1 Theſſ. 1. 8.</note> ſaid, <hi>From you ſounded out the Word of God,</hi> that is, the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is a Declaration of that good and gracious Counſel and Purpoſe of God in ſaving poor Sinners by Jeſus Chriſt: it is Heavenly, Sublime; the Nature and Glory of God in all his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes is made manifeſt thereby.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is good in the bleſſed Effects thereof. That which is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and precious in it ſelf, and alſo doth as much good, we eſteem very good. Now as divine Truth is pure, <hi>Thy Word is pure, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy Servant loveth it; ſo it is precious above Gold,</hi> in the Effects <note place="margin">Pſ. 19. 10.</note> of it on the Heart.</p>

                     <p>Sirs, if you have never taſted how good the Word of God is, your State doubtleſs is bad; but it is not enough to have a taſte of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:59949:175"/>
it, but you muſt feed upon it: <hi>Eat, O Friends; drink, yea drink a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, O Beloved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall proceed to ſhew you what a kind of taſte an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Chriſtian may have of the Word of God. It is evident, that the Apoſtle here carefully keeps himſelf to ſuch Expreſſions as we have in the Text, to ſhew he intends not ſuch Perſons, who by Faith truly receive and ſpiritually feed on Jeſus Chriſt; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>have taſted.</hi> True, by taſting ſometimes is meant a ſpiritual feeding; <hi>O taſte and ſee that the Lord is good:</hi> Compared with <note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 8. 1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> that in <hi>Peter, If ſo be ye have taſted that the Lord is gracious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Brethren, every one that feeds, may be ſaid to taſte, though he doth more than taſte; but every one that taſteth, may not be ſaid to feed; no, nor be ſaid to love, approve of, nor digeſt that which he taſteth of. Pray remember, to feed is more than to taſte; <hi>I did but taſte a little Honey,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jonathan:</hi> And it is ſaid of our Saviour, <hi>When he had taſted thereof, he would not drink;</hi> he <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 34.</note> taſted, but did not drink: So Men may taſte, and yet may not eat, not feed upon that they taſted of.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now come to ſhew you what a taſte they may have of the Word of God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As taſting reſpecteth Experience, or ſimple Knowledg of the Truth of a thing, ſo theſe Perſons may have a taſte, <hi>i. e.</hi> may have a ſimple Knowledg or Experience of the Truth of the Word of the Goſpel; they may taſte in this ſenſe, they may believe or be fully convinced in their Conſciences by what they have heard, and have met with by ſuch Operations of the Spirit that have paſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that the Goſpel is true, and that Chriſt is the only Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and that the Inſtitutions and Ordinances of the Goſpel are his Bleſſed Appointments. Thus many of the Jews taſted of Chriſt's Word, <hi>i. e. They believed in his Name, when they ſaw the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 2. 23, 24.</note> 
                        <hi>Miracles which he did; But Jeſus did not commit himſelf unto them, becauſe he knew all Men:</hi> They gave a true Aſſent to the Propoſition of his Word, yet did not cloſe in with him, they did not conſent to receive him, to deſire, love and obey him, they had no Union with him by ſaving Faith; and the like may be ſaid of theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in our Text.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Nay, theſe Perſons finding Jeſus Chriſt to be the true and great Saviour, they may taſte the Word, or believe with ſome kind of Joy, though it be a falſe Joy; Who would not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or have Chriſt as a Saviour? This they like, they would be
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:59949:176"/>
ſaved from Hell and Wrath, but do not conſider that Chriſt came to ſave his People from their Sins; He will ſave none who abide in their Sins, who hold them faſt, and reſolve not to let them go: Many may taſte ſome ſweetneſs in hearing of the Power of Chriſt to ſave, who go on preſumptuouſly in their ungodly Practices: It is expreſly ſaid, that the ſtony-ground Hearers <hi>received the Word with joy,</hi> they had a taſte of it. A common Faith ſeems to give a <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 20.</note> taſte, the Name of a Saviour reliſhes ſweet.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They may taſte of the Promiſes of the Word, but may not like the Precepts of it, or what ſometimes follows and overtakes ſuch who profeſs the Goſpel; or may like ſome Precepts, but not like ſome others of them; every Word of God with theſe is not precious, they cannot deny themſelves and follow Chriſt whither ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he goes: They are not like <hi>David,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Every Word of God is pure, therefore I love thy Commandments above Gold, yea, above</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 127, 128.</note> 
                        <hi>fine Gold. Therefore I eſteem all thy Precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every falſe Way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. A bare taſte or a ſimple taſte of the Word is enough for theſe; a great deal of the World may be they think is too little, yet a little Religion, a little of the Word, ſhort Prayers, and little Preaching will ſuffice them: A great Portion is too little for their Children, but Six-pence or a Shilling they may think is too much for the poor Saints, or a ſmall matter a great deal to be given to the Children of God. It is evident theſe Perſons gave little or nothing to the poor Saints, by what the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the Verſes following our Text, and therefore no ſincere Believers: For <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget your Work of Faith and Labour of Love, in that ye have miniſtred to the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. You, as if he ſhould ſay, are not of that ſort I am a ſpeaking of, they do not love the Children of God, though they have had a taſte of the Word: This one Vertue, Brethren, is more than all thoſe five Attainments mentioned in my Text, when that which a Man gives is given in love to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Yet this bare taſte, as you have heard, might have ſome Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon theſe Mens Hearts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They might find ſome kind of delight in that Knowledg they have of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and might ſpeak in the Commendation and Vindication thereof. Thus <hi>Balaam</hi> ſeemed wonderfully to be affected with the State of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and with the Tabernacle and Tents of <hi>Jacob,</hi> yet he loved the Wages of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="339" facs="tcp:59949:176"/>
2. It may work, as you heard laſt Day, a viſible Change in them, ſuch a Power may go along with that taſte; they, like <hi>Saul,</hi> might become other Men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They might have the ſame <hi>Lamp of Profeſſion</hi> with true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and be taken for real Converts, not known to the Godly but to be ſuch. The wiſe Virgins doubtleſs thought well of the Fooliſh, they did not know they were unſound or fooliſh Ones.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Such a Work and Effect the Holy Spirit and taſting of the Word might have, that they might be full of great Expectation of b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing embraced by Chriſt when he comes, if they fell not away before. 'Tis ſaid, the fooliſh Virgins <hi>went out to meet the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom;</hi> they had much Confidence, may be more Confidence (tho it was Self-confidence) that the Wiſe, for true Believers may be attended with many Doubts.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſpeaking of this ſort mentioned in my Text, ſaith, (and no doubt ſaith the Truth) "That there is an inferiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Work of the Holy Spirit in the Diſpenſation of the Word on many to whom it is preached, cauſing in them a great Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Change, as to Light, Knowledg, Abilities, Gifts, Affections, Life and Converſation, when the Perſons ſo wrought upon are not quickned, regenerated, or made new Creatures, nor united to Jeſus Chriſt; that in the Perſons thus wrought upon, there is or may be ſuch an Aſſent, and Light, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the Truth propoſed and preached to them, as in its kind is true, not counterfeit, giving or affording to them a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Faith." That is, they are blinded, and know not that they are unſound in the Main, their Hearts for want of true Light deceive them, as in the Caſe of the fooliſh Virgins; nay, and they may perhaps hold out in their Profeſſion conſtantly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death; nay, <hi>may give their Bodies to be burned.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 1, 2.</note> O ſee, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that your Faith is the Faith of God's Elect, and that you are ſavingly renewed: O look about you ſince it may be thus. The Doctor adds, "That among theſe Perſons are oft-times ſome that are endued with excellent Gifts, and lovely Parts, Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and Abilities, rendering them very uſeful to the Church of God, being Veſſels in his Houſe to hold and convey to others the precious Liquor of the Goſpel, though never had their own evil Hearts changed."</p>
                     <p>To which let me add, they are ſuch, or of this ſort of Perſons who are liable to ſin the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, or ſo fall, that it may be impoſſible for them to be renewed by Repentance:
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59949:177"/>
Yet before they ſo fall, it may not be impoſſible for them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come true Converts. The Nature of which Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, I purpoſe to open before I cloſe with this Text.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I ſhall proceed to ſhew you what a taſte of God, and <note place="margin">
                           <hi>What a kind of taſte a Believer hath of God and his Word.</hi> Pſal. 42. 2.</note> of his good Word it is which all true Believers have.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. 'Tis a taſte that ariſes from Spiritual Hunger: There is a true ſenſe of Want, they have a craving Appetite, and nothing but God in Chriſt can ſatisfy their Souls; <hi>My Soul thirſteth for God, for the living God,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> And hence it is that they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced bleſſed; <hi>Bleſſed are they which hunger and thirſt after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>for they ſhall be filled;</hi> not have only a taſte, No, no, but they ſhall be filled, they ſhall eat to ſatisfaction. They ſee that they want a Righteouſneſs whereby they may be declared Juſt and Righteous before God, namely, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and alſo a Righteouſneſs that may declare them to be righteous before Men, namely, a holy and blameleſs Life: the one is the Righteouſneſs of Juſtification, the other is the Righteouſneſs of Sanctification. Others may have a taſte of both theſe; they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a Worth in, and a Want of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, but do not hunger after it, and ſo accept it as a poor hunger-ſtarved Perſon on Goſpel-Terms; and may attain to ſome degree of inward as well as outward Sanctification.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Theſe therefore <hi>taſte</hi> and <hi>eat</hi> alſo, and that too out of pure Neceſſity: If I, ſaith the Soul, feed not upon Chriſt, <hi>eat not his Fleſh, and drink not his Blood,</hi> I ſhall periſh. Give me Chriſt or I ſhall die, is the Voice of this ſort: Others take a taſte, as if they cared not whether they eat or eat not.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A true Believer doth taſte, eat, and alſo digeſt the Word; 'tis that which they live upon, and hereby they come to have Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt by Faith: The Soul partakes of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But a common Taſting, or a common Faith, or a bare Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Truth of the Goſpel, doth not do this, which the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in our Text only had.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The good Word of God is to all true Chriſtians as their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Food; nay, eſteemed more, or above their neceſſary Food, as <hi>Job</hi> experienced it; therefore to theſe the Word, and God in <note place="margin">Job 23. 12.</note> the Word, Chriſt in the Word, is exceeding ſweet: How ſweet is Food to a hungry Perſon? O ſays the Soul, the Lord is good, his Word is good, his Promiſes and his Ordinances are exceeding good; I can reliſh the Word of God, I eſteem it <hi>above Gold; it is alſo</hi>

                        <hi>ſweeter than Honey, or the Honey-comb;</hi> I have an appetite to it: <hi>O how love I thy Law! it is my Meditation all the Day.</hi> This diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <note place="margin">Pſal. 110. 97.</note> to us the goodneſs of our Condition, when there is nothing that we value or eſteem, love and delight in, above God's Word: <hi>Thy Words were found, and I did eat them, and thy Word was unto me</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. The Word of God, without the God of the Word, will not ſatisfy theſe Mens Souls; 'tis not a bare Ordinance, no, no, but they muſt have God in and with the Ordinance; 'tis not the Shell without the Kernel, it is not the Cabinet without the Jewel; it is not a Lamp without Oil that will ſatisfy the wiſe Virgins; Prayer and Preaching will not do with theſe, though they pray and hear every Day, except they meet with God and Chriſt in thoſe Duties; the Word and Ordinances without Chriſt, are but like dry Bread and lean Meat, that have but little Juice or Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in them; they muſt be delighted with Fatneſs, knowing it is ſuch things God has prepared for them; <hi>Eat ye that which is good,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>and let your Soul delight it ſelf in Fatneſs;</hi> they eat it appears to full ſatisfaction. Others labour for that which ſatisfies not; but of all true Believers <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. That which true Believers taſte and eat, is turned into Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Nouriſhment in the Heart: And in order to this,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is required a laying up the Word, or hiding of it: <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 11.

Like as Food when it is well digeſted is turned into Fleſh and Blood, and Spirits; ſo where a Perſon feeds on the Word by Faith, or eats and digeſts it, it is turned into a Principle of Life and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Strength: As ſome Men who have for want of Food been brought ſo low and faint, that they were ready to die away; but by feeding on good Food, and digeſting it, ſoon perceive a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Strength, Life and Vigour ſeems to return to them again; ſo by feeding on the Word, the Strength of the Soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides, it communicates abiding Strength, Faith and Experience; and 'tis hereby the Soul grows Day by Day, and his Love to God is increaſed, and by the Power of it he walks with God in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Lowlineſs of Mind, and brings forth all the Fruits of the Spirit, like as the Ground bringeth forth, by the Showers of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 6, 7.</note> Herbs meet for him by whom it is dreſſed.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Theſe are delighted and cheared by the Word, as in a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet of Wine, and get great Power over their Corruptions: But ſuch a taſting and eating as this, and ſuch bleſſed Effects of the Word on the Soul did the Perſons never attain unto, who are ſaid in our Text to have <hi>taſted the good Word of God,</hi> &amp;c. Evident it is, that the Apoſtle clearly notes concerning the Perſons in my Text, that whatſoever taſte they might have of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, called the Heavenly Gift, or of the good Word of God, yet they were fruitleſs Souls, even like the Earth that the Rain falls upon, and yet brings forth Briars and Thorns; See <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>APPLICATION.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Learn from hence the deplorable Condition of all ſuch who ſatisfy themſelves with the meer Notion of Truth and empty Speculations about it, without getting ſo much as ſuch a taſte of the goodneſs of the Word, which may be had by thoſe who are not ſavingly renewed. How many thouſands are there at this Day, that do not deſire ſo much as a taſte of heavenly Things, their Hearts are ſo filled and glutted with the things of this World, nay, with their abominable and filthy Luſts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But for the Lord's Sake take heed you reſt not ſatisfied with a bare taſte of heavenly Things, or with ſome ſeeming reliſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59949:178"/>
Such indeed may not be far from the Kingdom of Heaven: But alas, alas, if they go no further, they will never come there; and if they totally fall away, their State will be worſe in the end than it was at the beginning; nay, far worſe than their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who never were enlightned at all, but remain under the Power of natural Blindneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. You that are Profeſſors, may alſo, from what hath been briefly hinted, perceive whether you have had a right taſte of God, and of his good Word, or not: Whether you have received Chriſt, and do live upon the Bread of Life, or not: Or whether you have by Faith applied the Word, and by Meditation digeſted it, or not.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Hath the Word changed your Hearts? Have you got Power over your Corruptions and Temptations thereby? Doth nothing ſatisfy your Souls ſhort of God and Jeſus Chriſt; and it is as well a Likeneſs to him as an Intereſt in him? Will not the Word and Ordinances quiet you, unleſs you meet with Chriſt in them?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This may be for a uſe of <hi>Terror</hi> to ſuch who reſt ſatisfied with the common Operations of the Word and Spirit of God; they may go far, yet fall away, nay ſo fall, as it may be impoſſible for them ever to be renewed by Repentance. But,</p>
                     <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> I ſhall now come to the fifth and laſt Thing or Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mentioned in our Text concerning theſe Profeſſors who are in danger of Final Apoſtacy, <hi>And of the Powers of the World to come:</hi> They have not only taſted of the good Word of God, but alſo of the Powers of the World to come.</p>
                     <p>Two things I ſhall propound to do here.<list>
                           <item>1. Shew you what is meant by the World to come.</item>
                           <item>2. Shew what a kind of taſte theſe Perſons may be ſaid to have of it.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Some by the World to come aſſert, is only meant, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Church-State, <note place="margin">What is meant by the World to come.</note> or Spiritual Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which begun in the Apoſtles Days: Nay, I find Reverend Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> is much of this Perſwaſion, as you may ſee in his Expoſition of the firſt Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> "By the World to come, ſaith he, the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle intends the Days of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that being the uſual Name of it in the Church at that time, as the <hi>New World</hi> which God had promiſed to create, whereof theſe Powers, by Signs, Wonders, and mighty Works were then wrought by the Holy Ghoſt, according as it was foretold by the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59949:179"/>
Prophets that they ſhould be ſo, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Theſe the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſpoken of, are ſuppoſed to have <hi>taſted;</hi> either they had been wrought in and by themſelves, or by others in their ſight, whereby they had experience of the glorious and powerful working of the Holy Ghoſt in the Confirmation of the Goſpel. Yea, (ſaith he) I do judg that they themſelves, in their own Perſons, were partakers of theſe Powers in the Gift of Tongues, and other miraculous Operations, which was the higheſt Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation poſſible of their Apoſtacy." I will not deny this to be intended by <hi>the Powers of the World to come:</hi> But this Expoſition ſeems too much to interfere with the <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>third</hi> Attainment mentioned of theſe Perſons: and if this be granted to be intended hereby, yet it muſt be carried alſo further, I mean, to the after-State of Chriſt's Kingdom; for the Kingdom that is now expected, and the latter-day-Glory, we all allow to be the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> Nor can any doubt of a World yet to come, or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious viſible Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt to be ſet up in the laſt Days; the Holy Ghoſt poſitively affirming, That <hi>the Kingdoms of this World ſhall become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt;</hi> And <note place="margin">Rev. 11. 15.</note> that when the <hi>ſeventh Angel ſoundeth his Trumpet,</hi> and not till then, which brings in the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>laſt Wo</hi> upon the <hi>Antichriſtian State and Kingdom.</hi> Yet I queſtion not but that the beginning of the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was in the Apoſtles Days, and did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence from the Reſurrection of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, being uſhered in and eſtabliſhed with the miraculous Gifts and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Holy Spirit: Which wonderful Appearance of God's Power, doth no doubt appertain to the Kingdom of Chriſt as ſuch: And at the pouring forth of the latter Rain, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect as great, nay a greater miraculous working-Power, than ever accompanied it to this Day; becauſe <hi>the Glory of the latter Houſe ſhall exceed the Glory of the former.</hi> And there ſeems to me to be the like Parity of Reaſon for thoſe miraculous Operations in the laſt Days, in order to the ſpreading the Goſpel over all the World, and the eſtabliſhment of Chriſt's more viſible Kingdom, as there was at firſt; the Appearance of Chriſt will be with Power and great Glory.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Therefore let it be conſidered, and not doubted of, but that there is yet a World to come, and another kind of World than this World is, and a more glorious Kingdom of Chriſt than at preſent we behold: That the World to come will conſiſt of <hi>a new Heaven, and a new Earth,</hi> which we look for, as the Apoſtle

                        <hi>Peter</hi> obſerves, is evident according to God's Promiſe, this preſent World, yea, theſe Old Heavens and Old Earth ſhall paſs away and be diſſolved: <hi>Nevertheleſs we, according to his Promiſe, look for a New</hi>

                        <hi>Heaven and New Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs.</hi> It was not then come, but expected to be revealed in the laſt Days.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It will be a World between this and the ultimate Glory in <note place="margin">What is meant by Chriſt's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the Father.</note> the Kingdom of the Father, I mean, when Chriſt ſhall give up his Kingdom to the Father, that God <hi>may be all in all;</hi> that is, Chriſt will yield up his Rule and Government as Mediator: for his Mediatorial Kingdom ſhall ceaſe, and the Kingdom and Glory of God, <hi>i. e. Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſhall only be magnified; Chriſt ſhall then, as Mediator, no longer ſit and rule upon his Throne, his Work will be done, and the Date of his Commiſſion be expired.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Let it alſo be conſidered, that the World to come in the Glory of it, ſhall not be revealed until this preſent World paſſes away, is burnt up and diſſolved, and therefore cannot be expected until the Reſurrection of the Juſt; For <hi>Man lies down and riſes not</hi>

But to proceed:</p>

                     <p n="2">2. The World to come ſhall be a World without Sin, a Holy World, a Righteous World: this preſent World is a wicked World, an ungodly World; but all the Inhabitants of that World to come ſhall be Holy, they ſhall be all filled with Righteouſneſs: Hence it is <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>We, according to his Promiſe, look for a new</hi>

                     <p n="5">5. The Riches of the World to come, are Soul-ſatisfying Riches: Gold and Silver ſatisfy not, but Believers <hi>ſhall ſee God</hi> in the other World, have a glorious Viſion of God; <hi>they ſhall be like him, for they ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Nothing but a Poſſeſſion of <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 2, 3.</note> God, and a Likeneſs unto him, will ſatisfy a gracious Soul: <hi>I ſhall be ſatisfied,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, when I awake in thy Likeneſs:</hi> I ſhall not <note place="margin">Pſa. 17. ult.</note> be fully ſatisfied until then, (as if he ſhould ſay) but then I ſhall be ſatisfied to the full indeed.

2. The Joys of the World to come will be the Fulneſs of Joy and Delights: <hi>Thou ſhalt make them drink of the Rivers of thy Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 36. 8.</note> Rivers of Pleaſures denote fulneſs, Pleaſures to full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: all the Pleaſures of this preſent World are but a Shadow of the Pleaſures of Heaven, and of the World to come; and though theſe ſatisfy not, yet thoſe will ſatisfy the Soul.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They are Pleaſures for evermore; we ſhall ſwim in Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in that World. <hi>Thou wilt ſhew me the Way of Life; in thy Preſence is fulneſs of Joy, and at thy right Hand are Pleaſures for</hi>

                        <hi>ever more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Joys and Pleaſures of the World to come will be ſo ſweet, that, as Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> ſaith, a whole Eternity will ſeem to be but as a Moment.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. They will be Pleaſures without Pain, without a Sting: O what a Sting have ſome Men found to be in, or to attend their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pleaſures! Here are Sorrows cleaving to Men as well as Joy; Pain and Miſery, as well as Delights and Pleaſure: but in the World to come there will be all Sweet, and no Bitter; all Pleaſure, and no Pain; all Joy, and no Sorrow.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Is God able, think you, to delight, to rejoice, and to fill the Souls of his Saints with Joy and Pleaſure? Be ſure then he will do it: God's Love is ſuch, ſo infinite, ſo inconceivable to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that he will fill them with the fulleſt Joys imaginable: Will not earthly Parents make the Lives of their Children as ſweet and happy as they can? They are <hi>called Joys unſpeakable and full of Glory:</hi> All the lawful Pleaſures of this World are, Brethren, but a Figure or Shadow of them: <hi>The Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man to conceive the things that God hath prepared for thoſe that love him.</hi> The Eye hath ſeen much, and the Ear hath heard of more than the Eye ever ſaw, and the Heart conceives of more than ever the Ear heard; but the Heart cannot conceive how ſweet the Joys of Chriſt's Kingdom will be, or comprehend how tranſcendent the Joys of Heaven are.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Pleaſures of the World to come, are the Effects of God's infinite Love and Goodneſs, according to the Perfection thereof: And as none know the Power of God's Anger and Wrath in Hell, that is let out againſt ungodly Sinners that hate him; ſo none know the Power of his Infinite Love, Grace and Goodneſs, let out in Heaven to delight and raviſh the Hearts of all them that love and ſerve him.</p>

                        <pb n="352" facs="tcp:59949:183"/>
8. The Pleaſures of the World to come never will ceaſe indeed, no ſhorter a Time than an endleſs Eternity can ſerve to let out the infinite Goodneſs of the Eternal Deity, and thoſe varieties of Joys and Delights that flow and will flow like Rivers from him: as none can imagine what the Nature of that perſonal Communion which the Saints ſhall have with Chriſt will be, ſo alſo they will be Eternal; Eternal Joys, ſaith one, are the longeſt, and yet the ſhorteſt. Longeſt in reſpect of Duration, yet the ſhorteſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Apprehenſion. An Eternity of Joy will ſeem to us no more tedious than one Minute or ſmall Moment, 'twis be ſo full of Joy and Pleaſure: 'tis ſuch Satisfaction that breed no weariſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it doth not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They are certainly blind or unthinking Perſons that do not ſee how the Deity or Holy God delights in Varieties; it may eaſily be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by beholding the different Varieties of Creatures, Faces, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, or varieties of things to delight all our Senſes here in this World. O no doubt, the Joys and Varieties of the World to come, will be Wonderful, and take up a whole Eternity for God to let out; Joys will be as it were every day freſh, and renewed upon us.</p>
                     <p>From hence ſaith a beloved Writer, freſh Appetite, and fulneſs of Satisfaction, are perpetually interchangeable, the Joys are ſo many, the Years ſeem ſo few. Eternity of Joys makes Eternity but as a Moment, as eternal Pain and Torment makes every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeem an Eternity.</p>

4.

This I find our late Annotators intimate to be meant here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: "Some of them (ſay they) were affected with the powerful Doctrines of the Goſpel concerning the Final Judgment, as their Natural Conſcience was wrought on by the Spirit in the Word; they felt it as if it were begun in them, the Sparkles of God's Wrath having ſet their Conſciences in a light Flame for their Sins." This is a taſting of the Powers of the World to come with a Witneſs.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. They may taſte of the conſtraining Powers of the World to come; ſo that their Conſciences might curb them, and put a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle on their Luſts, ſo that they might not run into Sin as others do: the fear and dread of another World keeps them in awe, and reſtrains them for a time from committing any open or ſecret Acts of Wickedneſs; and by the Power of this conſtraining Grace they might, as you have heard, reform their Lives as to become other Men and Women.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Moreover, as <hi>the Powers of the World to come</hi> may refer to the Everlaſting Joy and Comfort of the Saints, they might alſo have ſome ſeeming taſte of the ſweetneſs thereof, I mean, they might have a ſight and ſenſe of that happy State the Righteous ſhall be in in the World to come; and they finding Chriſt to be a Redeemer, and that he came to ſave Sinners from Wrath, and to purchaſe Everlaſting Bleſſedneſs, may have ſome hope of Intereſt in that Redemption from Wrath, and of being made happy eternally in the World to come: they might promiſe to themſelves a part in the firſt Reſurrection, and their Hopes herein might be as a ſweet taſte of the Joys and Conſolations of that Day. Mr. <hi>David Dick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſpeaking of this Paſſage, ſaith, They may taſte of the Powers of the World to come, that is, ſaith he, in contemplation of the Bleſſedneſs promiſed to the Saints in Heaven; and have a natural deſire of it, as <hi>Balaam</hi> deſired to die the Death of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.

2. It is not a taſte that makes them out of love with this World, or to be weary of it, or to die to it: though they ſeem taken with the Thoughts of the World to come, yet they value this World, no doubt, too highly; 'tis this World that is in their Hearts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p n="4">4. O bleſs God for the leaſt degree of ſaving Grace: Have you love to God, to his poor Saints?

                           <hi>How it is impoſſible for theſe to be renewed unto Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Heb. 6. 6.</note> to renew them again unto Repentance; either to ſuch a Repentance they once had, or to true, ſaving, and Evangelical Repentance: The Reaſon is by the Holy Ghoſt added; <hi>Seeing they crucify to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to open ſhame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is not doubtleſs impoſſible, in reſpect of God's Abſolute Power, had he not limited himſelf by an unchangeable Decree: But if he hath determined to deny Grace, and all ſaving Influences of his Spirit, to theſe Apoſtates, that makes it impoſſible for them ever to be renewed; which ſhews us that the Power to change the Heart is not in the Creature, it is God's Work on the Soul, 'tis he that ſtamps his own Image upon us; and if he withdraws the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of his Holy Spirit from Men, or refuſes to give Grace to them, in order to bring them to Repentance, and to believe in Chriſt, they muſt periſh. Now God will not afford theſe Perſons that ſo fall away, the Aſſiſtance of his Spirit, in order to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great Work of Faith in them; therefore it is impoſſible for them to be renewed. "He ſaith not (ſaith one)<note place="margin">Dickſon.</note> it is impoſſible they ſhould be ſaved, but that it is impoſſible they ſhould be renewed unto Repentance; theſe Apoſtates Salvation is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, becauſe their Repentance is impoſſible." He that never

repenteth, can never be ſaved; for he that repenteth not, ſhall not have Remiſſion of Sin: and if the Holy Spirit be utterly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from Men, it is impoſſible they ſhould ever be renewed to Repentance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Perſons therefore here intended, do not repent, cannot repent, Repentance is hid from their Eyes; they never endeavour after Repentance, they are left to hardneſs of Heart, and to final Impenitency by the Lord, as a juſt Judgment for their horrid Evil and curſed Apoſtacy: poſſibly they may fall under <hi>Terror</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,</hi> yet never deſire or look after Repentance on God's Terms. Brethren, it is not impoſſible for the greateſt Sinner in the World to be renewed, that hath not ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt, or whom God hath not wholly given up to blindneſs of Mind, and to hardneſs of Heart: <hi>All manner of Sins and Blaſphemy againſt the Father and the Sun, ſhall be forgiven unto Men; but the Blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi>

He ſaith unto his Spirit, <hi>Let them alone,</hi> move them, or excite them to perform Religious Duties no more, ſtrive with them no more for ever; No Doctrine, no Word, no Rod, no Affliction or Judgment ſhall do them good any more for ever. This Spiritual Judgment is the worſt of all Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo makes it impoſſible for them ever to be renewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Repentance; for there <hi>remains no more Sacrifice for Sin, but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation, which ſhall</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. God puts an end unto all expectation concerning them; he looks for no more Good from them, he exerciſes no more Care about them, no more Labour, Pains nor Patience towards them; God affords no more Means of Grace for their Converſion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is hid from their Eyes; he ſays, <hi>Let this Ground lie bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren for ever,</hi> it ſhall never be plowed, ſowed, nor watered any more for ever: He looks for no more Fruit, he will not dreſs it nor dung it any more; his Sun ſhall ſhine upon it no more, nor ſhall the Rain fall upon it from Heaven any more: wo unto ſuch

                     <p n="3">3. The Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is not every Sin that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the Holy Ghoſt; for he that grieves the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that quencheth the Holy Spirit, ſins againſt the Holy Spirit; nay, all wicked Men who ſit under the Preaching of the Goſpel, no doubt, ſin againſt the Spirit whilſt they reſiſt the Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and Motions thereof.</p>

So much in the Negative, what Sin the Sin againſt <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 9.</note> the Holy Ghoſt is not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew you, in the Affirmative, according to that <note place="margin">What the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is.</note> Light I have, what Sin this Sin is, or open the Nature thereof, and what ſort of Perſons they are who do or may commit it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Perſons that may commit the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, our Text informs us, are ſuch who have <hi>been once enlightned,</hi> and that have attained to the Knowledg of the Truth, or true way of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, and have had ſuch a kind of Taſte of the <hi>Heavenly Gift,</hi> and of the <hi>good Word of God,</hi> and <hi>Powers of the World to come,</hi> more or leſs, of which I have ſhewed: they have received the Gifts and common Graces of the Spirit.</p>

2. And alſo have eſcaped the Corruptions of the World, through the Knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt, or attained to a great Reformation of Life in ſo much that they were look'd upon as <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 20.</note> Saints and eminent Chriſtians, many of them being Profeſſors of the Goſpel, and might be great Preachers thereof: Tho it ſeems that others who never profeſſed the Goſpel, were and may be guilty of committing of this Sin, as thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> no doubt were, who ſaid, our Bleſſed Saviour <hi>did caſt out Devils</hi> by <hi>Beelzebub the</hi>

                        <hi>Prince of Devils.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is a ſinning wilfully, after a Perſon hath received the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Truth, or Goſpel of Chriſt; <hi>For if we ſin wilfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have received the Knowledg of the Truth, there remains no more</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>Sacrifice for Sin.</hi> Though every wilful ſinning is not this Sin, yet every one that is guilty thereof, doth ſin wilfully, and that in the higheſt degree. Pray note it, 'tis a wilful caſting off and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the Truth of God, and an utter deſerting the Church and People of God, nay, a wilful rejecting the Truth which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had embraced, and taſted ſome ſweetneſs in, oppoſing and contradicting that which the Holy Spirit teſtifies to their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences is the Truth of Chriſt; therefore they wilfully reject the Motions of the Holy Ghoſt, nay contemn the Operations thereof.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And as it is a rejecting of the Motions and Operations of the Holy Spirit, after thoſe Illuminations they had received, ſo alſo it is done maliciouſly, or from Spite and Malice; <hi>And hath done Deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace:</hi> They wilfully deſert the Aſſemblies <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 29.</note> of God's Church and People, and <hi>eſteem the Blood of Chriſt</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was conſecrated a Sacrifice unto God, or (as ſome) whereby they thought once they had been ſanctified) an unholy Thing, and accounting the Motions of the Holy Spirit, and his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a meer Deluſion of the Devil: And thus ſome of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> ſinned. Chriſt healed one poſſeſſed of an unclean Spirit, a Work wrought by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt; they imputed it to the Devil, ſaying, <hi>This Fellow caſteth out Devils by the Prince of Devils.</hi> This was a wilful Sin, and done no doubt in Malice, and <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 22, 24.</note> againſt the Convictions of their own Conſciences: for they could not certainly but know, that he was the Son of God by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works he did. See <hi>ver.</hi> 31, 32. Upon this our Saviour doth intimate, that they were guilty of ſinning the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, that ſhall never be forgiven unto Men.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is a <hi>treading under Foot the Son of God,</hi> contemning and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying him, as theſe <hi>Phariſies</hi> ſeem'd to do; and which, as it is
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:59949:189"/>
thought by many, <hi>Julian the Apoſtate</hi> was guilty of, who in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, when he was wounded, threw his Blood up towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, crying, <hi>Thou Galilean thou haſt overcome me,</hi> or to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; he in reproach and hatred, ſeemed to call Chriſt a <hi>Galilean,</hi> would not call him by any one of his own proper Names.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And laſtly, It doth conſiſt in a fatal and utter renunciation of the Chriſtian Religion, and all the Inſtitutions, Doctrines and Principles thereof, and a turning to Judaiſm or Idolatry, or elſe to perfect Atheiſm, and all this, as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſignifies, with an avowed and profeſſed Enmity to Chriſt and Chriſtianity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not without the higheſt Reproach and Contempt imaginable, againſt the Perſon of Chriſt, as well as againſt the Goſpel, imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Love of Sin, or of the Riches and Honours of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evil World, valuing their Luſts above the Comfort of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Take heed of thoſe Sins that tend or lead to this unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Sin.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Take heed of a malicious Thought againſt the Holy Ghoſt; don't think it is the Devil that diſquiets and diſturbs you about Sin, Wrath and Hell; you convicted Sinners look to it, that you charge not theſe Convictions you have of the Evil of your Sin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Satan. He you may be ſure will not trouble you for your Sins, but let you go on peaceably in your wicked Ways; though when you are awakened, he may perſwade you that there is no Mercy for you. Doubts and deſparing Thoughts commonly riſe from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, but not Sorrow and Grief for Sin: No, no, that is from your Conſcience a it is influenced by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Beware of harbouring a malicious Thought of Religion, or of praying by the Holy Spirit; as I heard lately or a wicked Man, who hearing a Miniſter pray in a moſt excellent manner, that ſaid, <hi>How doth the Devil help him?</hi> or to that effect; O this is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous?</p>

                        <pb n="365" facs="tcp:59949:189"/>
3. Take heed of blaſphemous Words againſt the Holy Spirit: Will any dare to ſay, that the Devil is in God's People, that they are ſo reſolute in their Ways, and will not conform to the National Church?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Beware, you that make a Profeſſion of Religion, and that have been enlightned, how you fall away and turn again to Folly, and to your ſinful Practices; for this is the high Way to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable Sin, or Sin unto Death; you know not but that a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> Apoſtacy may end in a <hi>total</hi> one at laſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Above all things, look to it that you reſt not on a common Work of the Spirit, without a real Work of Faith and Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Reſt on nothing ſhort of Chriſt, neither on Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Duties, nor inherent Grace, for it is dangerous ſo to do.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But why is it impoſſible for theſe to be renewed unto Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is becauſe the Decree is gone out againſt them, God will not renew them, and none elſe can.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. More directly and immediately it is, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt hath utterly forſaken them, and withdrawn all his Operations from them for ever, whoſe work it is alone to renew and work Repentance in the Hearts of Sinners: Men cannot repent, when the Holy Spirit hath utterly left them; no, nor have any deſire to repent: think of this you that magnify the Will of Man.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Sinners,</hi> love the Holy Spirit, cheriſh the Motions thereof, and do not grieve him, nor reſiſt his Motions and Operations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> By way of Conſolation to Believers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Here is ſtill comfort for you that are the Children of God, born of God, you cannot ſin this Sin, you cannot ſin unto Death, the Seed remains in you: you mourn that you cannot repent as you would do; your Hearts are tender, you need not fear your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Do you fear to offend God, to grieve the Spirit? O that is a bleſſed Sign: Do you love God, love his People? do you miniſter as you have miniſtred to the poor Saints?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. O remember you are in Chriſt's Hand: <hi>We are perſwaded better things of you, and things that accompany Salvation, though we thus ſpeak.</hi>

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What things are they that accompany Salvation?</hi>

That is, we cannot eſcape, or it is impoſſible we, or any Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, ſhould eſcape, if we or they neglect ſo great Salvation. <hi>Eſcape what?</hi> That is implied here, which is not expreſſed, namely, the Wrath of God: How ſhall we eſcape the dreadful Judgment and Indignation of God, or Eternal Damnation in Hell, <hi>if we neglect</hi> or ſlight, deſpiſe or reject the Means of this Salvation?</p>
                     <p>He confirms what he aſſerts, or aggravates the Greatneſs of their Sin who do neglect this Salvation, and the impoſſibility of ſuch ever to eſcape God's Wrath.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the Power and Authority of Chriſt, who not only wrought this Salvation out, but only firſt declared it, or made it known; <hi>which firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord.</hi> Which ſome think may refer to his firſt declaring of it from the beginning to <hi>Adam</hi> upon his Tranſgreſſion, and to the Fathers under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But I conceive he means chiefly our Lord's preaching this Salvation in the Days of his Fleſh, when he entred firſt on his Miniſtry, as <hi>verſe</hi> 1. of the firſt Chapter; <hi>God hath in theſe laſt Days ſpoken unto us by his Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="369" facs="tcp:59949:191"/>
2. From the confirmation of it, <hi>by Signs and Wonders.</hi> I ſhall be very brief in ſpeaking unto the Terms of our Text.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>How ſhall we eſcape,</hi> avoid, get clear of, or deliver our ſelves from God's Wrath and Vengeance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If we neglect,</hi> if we mind other things more than this Salvation, or ſeem to be indifferent in and about this great Buſineſs, like thoſe that made light of the Invitation to the <hi>Marriage-Supper,</hi> Mat. 22. Luke 14. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>So great Salvation,</hi> namely, the Salvation of the Goſpel. <hi>Great,</hi> as it refers to God, denotes the glorious Perfections of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the <hi>Great God;</hi> it ſignifies the infinite Power, Wiſdom, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Mercy and Glory of his Majeſty. <hi>Great,</hi> as it refers to things, may be conſidered as to the Nature and Quality of them, as <hi>Great Riches, Great Light;</hi> as the Sun is called a great Light, that is, a Glorious Light, excelling all other Natural or Created Lights, or Artificial Lights. <hi>Great Peace have they that love thy Law;</hi> that is, Glorious Peace. So, great Salvation denotes Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Salvation, exceeding all Temporal Salvation. <hi>So Great,</hi> this [<hi>ſo</hi>] raiſes the Greatneſs and Glory of this Salvation. <hi>God ſo loved the World:</hi> So, how? Even ſo, that it cannot be conceived, much leſs expreſſed. So, this great Salvation is ſo wonderful, ſo amazing, ſo glorious, and ſo affecting, it calls for all to admire it, conſider it, imbrace it, and by no means to ſlight or neglect it.</p>
                     <p>From hence I ſhall note three Points of Doctrine.<list>
                           <item>Doct. 1. <hi>That the Salvation of the Goſpel is a Great and Glorious Salvation.</hi>

                     <p>I purpoſe to ſpeak to all theſe three Propoſitions, and ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the firſt, namely, That the Salvation of the Goſpel is a Great and Glorious Salvation.</p>

                        <item>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall improve it by way of Application.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>It is a Great and Glorious Salvation comparatively:</hi> or when it is compared with all other Salvations.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="370" facs="tcp:59949:192"/>
1. That was a Great and Glorious Salvation which God wrought <note place="margin">Goſpel-Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation great Salvation compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</note> for <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the <hi>Red Sea.</hi> But what a Salvation was that? Who were they ſaved from? It was from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> a bloody and cruel Perſecutor: but this is from Satan and all cruel Enemies of our Souls.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That was from the Wrath of Men; this is from the fearful <note place="margin">Pſa. 91. 11.</note> Wrath of God, which none are able to conceive of: <hi>according to thy Fear, ſo is thy Wrath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That was a Salvation of the natural Lives of the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> this a Salvation of our Immortal Souls and Bodies too for ever.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That was a Type of this Salvation, a Shadow of it: and as far as the Subſtance exceeds the Shadow of a Thing, ſo far doth this Salvation exceed that and all other Salvations.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That was a Temporal Salvation, this is an Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now that Salvation at the <hi>Red Sea</hi> being one of the greateſt Temporal Salvations that ever was wrought, I need not mention any other. <hi>Iſrael</hi> had many great Salvations wrought for them afterwards, and ſo have many of the Saints had great Salvations and Deliverances wrought for them in the Times of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Nay, we in theſe Nations have ſeen and heard of great and wonderful Things which God hath wrought for us, and for our Forefathers. It was a great Salvation that was wrought in 1588, at the Spaniſh Invaſion, and from the <hi>Powder-Plot;</hi> and alſo that in 1688, when We, and the Proteſtant Intereſt, were brought very low, and we could not ſee which way Relief and Deliverance could come. But alas, what are all theſe Salvations to this in my Text? Pray remember that Goſpel-Salvation is Great and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious comparatively. But,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Salvation of the Goſpel is not only great comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Goſpel-Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation great in it ſelf.</note> 
                        <hi>but alſo poſitively:</hi> not only in reſpect of all other Salvations, but alſo in regard of it ſelf. And to demonſtrate this, conſider, that it is great and glorious in reſpect of the Time (or rather that Eternity) in which it was contrived and graciouſly promiſed.</p>
                     <p>This Salvation, Brethren, was contrived and found out by the Wiſdom of God, before the World began. Hence Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>be a Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World;</hi> that is, in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, <note place="margin">Rev. 13. 8.</note> Counſel and Purpoſe of God: Chriſt was ſet up from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting as the great and glorious Mediator and Saviour of all that ſhould believe in him, or that were given unto him by the Father.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>God thought of us poor Sinners, and found out this way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation before we had a Being, yea even from Eternity, foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us fallen in the Firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> brought into a deplorable Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Wrath and Miſery.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Salvation of the Goſpel is great and glorious, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Goſpel-Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation great in reſpect of that Counſel held in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</note> 
                        <hi>of that Counſel that was held before all Worlds about bringing of it in.</hi> Chriſt the great Saviour was <hi>delivered up according to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Counſel of God,</hi> Acts 2. 23.

                     <p>Alas! what is a Counſel held by all the wiſeſt Men and greateſt Potentates on Earth, of the higheſt Concernment here, to that Council held by the Glorious Trinity in Eternity, about bringing in of this Salvation? O of what Moment is the Salvation of our Souls? None but the Great God could effect it, it was the Reſult of Infinite Wiſdom and Counſel. God ſeemed, Brethren, to call a Council about the firſt Creation of Man; <hi>Let us make Man after our own Image,</hi> &amp;c. But how much more of the Glory of God's Wiſdom, according to his Eternal Purpoſe, ſhines forth, as the Reſult of that Counſel held about the Reſtauration of Fallen Man, than what ſhone forth in the firſt Creation of him? <hi>And the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Peace was between them both;</hi> that is, between the Father and <note place="margin">Zech. 6. 11.</note> the Son.</p>

                        <pb n="372" facs="tcp:59949:193"/>
Fourthly, <hi>The Salvation of the Goſpel is great and glorious in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">'Tis a great Salvation in reſpect of the Deſign of it.</note> 
                        <hi>of God's Deſign therein:</hi> Which more generally and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſibly I may open in three reſpects.<list>
                           <item>1<hi>ſt.</hi> His own Glory in all his Attributes.</item>
                           <item>2<hi>dly.</hi> The confounding and baffling of Satan, and the utter Deſtruction of his Kingdom and Helliſh Deſign.</item>
                           <item>3<hi>dly.</hi> The Eternal Salvation of Man; I mean, all that believe in Jeſus Chriſt, or are given to him by the Father.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> God before all things hereby deſigned his own Glory, or to make all the Perfections of his Holy Nature manifeſt to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which he had made, and to open a Way by which each of his Attributes might gloriouſly appear, and to vanquiſh that Cloud that ſeem'd to eclipſe their ſhining.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For God's Mercy could not be extended in another Way to the Help and Relief of Mankind under Wrath and Miſery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Juſtice was injured, and called for the Sentence to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on us for our Sins.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And his Juſtice could not be executed, but his Mercy and Goodneſs would have been brought under Obſcurity, and been vailed for ever. And had Mankind for ever been brought under the juſt Deſert of Sin, God had, it is true, glorified his Juſtice; but Mercy is as well a Property of his Bleſſed Nature as Juſtice: and had that been done, how had any of his Creatures known any thing of his Mercy and Goodneſs? certainly Mercy had never been manifeſted at all, no more than is ſeen in the caſting off the Fallen Angels. God to them appeared only Juſt, not Gracious; but in Chriſt to Mankind, he appears not only Juſt, but alſo Good and Gracious. Yet the Salvation of our Souls could not conſiſt with the Holineſs and Juſtice of God in a way of Mercy, without a Satisfaction be made to Divine Juſtice. Therefore Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in ſubſtituting Jeſus Chriſt to die in our Nature and Stead, makes God's Juſtice a full Compenſation for the Wrong and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we had done by our Sins and Tranſgreſſions; and from hence it appears that Infinite Wiſdom, Juſtice, Holineſs, Power, Mercy and Goodneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are diſcovered and magnified equally in God's bringing in this Great Salvation of the Goſpel: and this was, I ſay, the grand Deſign of God herein, by which he removes and ſolves all thoſe ſeeming Contradictions and great Difficulties that appeared in the way of our Eternal Recovery, and magnifies the entire Glory of God, that ſeemed to be loſt by our Sin, or was before hid under Obſcurity; it is hereby fully repaired, and to the Joy of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:59949:193"/>
Saints and Angels is made known and magnified in Chriſt. And from hence it is that the Goſpel is called <hi>the Wiſdom of God;</hi> and Chriſt is alſo called <hi>the Wiſdom of God,</hi> and <hi>the Power of God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 6. 1 Cor. 1. 24.</note> in him all the Strength of God, I mean the Power and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all his Attributes, are joined or united together, and ſhine in equal Glory in our Salvation.</p>
                     <p>But more of this hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Hereby alſo Satan is overthrown, and his grand Deſign marr'd and fruſtrated for ever, and his Kingdom ſpoiled; our Lord Jeſus <hi>having ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, he made a ſhew of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Col. 2. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>them openly, triumphing over them in it:</hi> and this was done by the Death of his Croſs, and by his Reſurrection; <hi>To this purpoſe was</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>the Son of God manifeſt, that he might deſtroy the Works of the Devil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Moreover hereby God deſigned to make Man, even all that believe in Chriſt and embrace this Salvation, happy again, and bleſſed for ever; nay (as I ſhall ſhew you, before I have done with this Text, God aſſiſting me) even to raiſe him up into a higher and better State than that was in which he was at firſt created.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>The Salvation of the Goſpel is Great and Glorious, if we</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Goſpel-Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation great conſidering how low Man was fallen, and the ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of it.</note> 
                        <hi>conſider how low Man was fallen and ſunk by his Tranſgreſſion, and what kind of Wrath he was laid under;</hi> As alſo if we conſider how helpleſs he was, having no Friend nor Brother that could give to God a Ranſom for him; no nor could the Angels of Heaven do it, whoſe Power is very great: No, no, none but Chriſt alone, with his Almighty Arm, could ſave us from the threatned Wrath and Vengeance of an angry God. Beſides, this Salvation muſt needs be great and glorious, if we conſider the ſeaſonableneſs of it; it was a timely Salvation, it was brought in juſt as the Hand of Juſtice was up, and ready to ſtrike the fatal Stroke. Juſtice ſtood (as it were) with his Ax in his Hand to cut off all our Heads; and Chriſt to ſave us, ſtept in and laid down (as I may ſay) his own Neck, and took the Blow: Or we may conceive that Juſtice ſtood with his Spear in his Hand, ready, as it were, to run it into our Bowels; and Jeſus Chriſt run in between Divine Wrath and our poor Souls, and cried out, <hi>Let thy Spear, O Juſtice, be thruſt into my Heart,</hi> I will die for theſe condemned and guilty Wretches. See what <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>When we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the Vngodly.</hi> So <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>While we were yet Sinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 6.</note> Though I deny not but that this Text may refer to the Fulneſs of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:59949:194"/>
Time prefixed by the Almighty for Chriſt to come, and take our Nature upon him, and to die in our room; and that was the due Time, or Time God had appointed: Yet Chriſt was as a Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the World, nay, before the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. And we may ſay, that as ſoon as our <hi>firſt Parents</hi> ſinned, even then, and at that very Seaſon, Jeſus Chriſt ſtep'd in, and yielded up himſelf to God as a Sacrifice for us: and had he not then been accepted, we had been loſt for ever. O how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, how ſweet and how welcome is it to a poor condemned Criminal, when he is brought to the Place of Execution, to ſee the Sheriff pull out an Arreſt of Execution, a Reprieve, nay, an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Pardon, and tell him, You have met with a Friend, the King has accepted of one that he ordained and ſubſtituted to be your Surety, and to die for you, and ſatisfy the Law and Juſtice for you; Friend, you are acquitted. Brethren, thus it is here, Chriſt offered himſelf, and the Father accepted him in our ſtead to die for us, and to bear that Wrath that was due to us for our Sins; and this he did then, even when we firſt ſinned in <hi>Adam.</hi> So that we may ſay, in due time Chriſt died for the Ungodly, juſt as the Stroke of Wrath and Divine Juſtice was falling on us, for it was all one as if he had then actually ſuffered: And alſo his Blood was as efficacious to ſave and abſolve <hi>Adam,</hi> and all that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and apply the Virtue thereof, before it was ſhed, as it is to us who believe in theſe latter Times of the World, after it has been ſhed more than ſixteen hundred Years. Would not ſuch a guilty Malefactor I mentioned, ſay, O this is a great Salvation indeed! nay, ſtand and admire at it, he expecting nothing but Death, and had none to help him, or afford any hope or relief to him in the leaſt!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>APPLICATION.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1.

Ranſom: No, no, I have, ſaith God, found a Ranſom; <hi>the Juſt for the Vnjuſt,</hi> or in the room and place of the guilty Sinner. It is not, I have found Man's good Works, Man's reformed Life, his Repentance, his Faith, his Tears, his ſincere Obedience; no, but it is the Obedience of Chriſt, the Blood of Chriſt, the Sacrifice of Chriſt, the Merits and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, this God hath found to be our Ranſom. God hath found a full Ranſom, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Ranſom. God accepted of Chriſt's Sacrifice for a Compleat Satisfaction; it is more ſatisfactory than if we had lain in Hell for ever, for we muſt always have been paying, but never could have made Satisfaction. O who could have thought of ſuch a Ranſom, of ſuch a way of Salvation! in this lies the Depth of Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Great Myſtery of the Goſpel: How ſhould we adore and admire the Grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt!</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To you poor Sinners let me ſpeak one word by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation: Did God ſo early contrive our Salvation? O then do you ſet your Hearts on work to ſeek this Salvation, I mean, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in it; be early at it, do not defer it: You young Men, think upon it in the morning of your Days, this Salvation calls for your utmoſt diligence to underſtand and find out; the Goſpel is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, 'tis not eaſily underſtood. The Preaching of a Crucified Chriſt is to ſome Men Fooliſhneſs; but to them that are ſaved, it is the Power of God. Many ſtumble at the Stumbling-ſtone God hath laid in <hi>Sion.</hi> Chriſt is to ſome a Stumbling-ſtone, and a Rock of Offence, but take heed he is not ſo to you.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Was there a Council held in Eternity about our Salvation? O then conſult with all Wiſdom the grand Deſign of God herein: It is to exalt his own Glory, his own Name, his own Free Grace; and this being ſo, let it be all your care to advance the Riches of his Grace, and let God be wholly exalted, and do you lie low at his Feet. O cloſe in with God's Counſel, accept of this way of Life, do not think there is any other way.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And laſtly, Conſider that the Greatneſs of God's Mercy and Divine Goodneſs to us, was alſo one grand End and Deſign in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out this Salvation: It doth diſplay his unſpeakable Love and Bowels towards his poor Creature Man. True, he had the like regard to his Juſtice; but his Juſtice had been magnified in our Deſtruction, if his Mercy had never appeared. But that his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy might be manifeſted, what hath he done, his own Son hath born our Sins, he hath laid the Hand of his Juſtice, and let out that Wrath that muſt have lain upon us for ever upon his own
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59949:195"/>
Son, that Mercy might flow forth to us. This ſhould teach us to ſtudy Acts of Mercy, and contrive that way to be like unto the Holy and Merciful God: This is that which he requires of us, even to <hi>do juſtly, love Mercy, and to walk humbly with our God.</hi>

                     <p>I have ſpoken to this already under five Conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>

We commonly judg of the Greatneſs of the Undertaking, and the Glory of the Work, by conſidering the Dignity, Glory, Wiſdom, Power and Greatneſs of the Perſons concerned in it.</p>
                     <p>Now if this Work, I mean the Salvation of ſinful Man, had been put into the Hands of the mighty Angels, and they had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Council about it, and ſhewed their uttermoſt Skill, Wiſdom and Power, in order to the actual accompliſhment thereof, would not all ſay, this muſt needs be ſome great and wonderful Work, or a great Salvation? But alas, they could neither have ſound out a way of Salvation for us, much leſs have wrought it out: Could they any way have thought how the Glory of every Attribute of God might have been raiſed, and have ſhone forth in equal Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre? could they have ſecured the Glory of God's Juſtice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and have made up the Wrong we had done to God by our Sin, and ſo have opened a Way for Mercy and Goodneſs to run down like a mighty Stream, and ſecured the Sanction of the Law, and yet have delivered Man from the Curſe thereof? God muſt not, will not loſe the Glory of any one of his Attributes, let what will become of the Rebellious Sinner. Alas, they could never
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:59949:195"/>
have found out a way whereby the Attributes of Mercy and Juſtice might meet together, and Righteouſneſs and Truth kiſs each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the Perſons then who found and wrought out this Salvation, were not the Holy Angels of God; No, no, none but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could do it: <hi>The Salvation of</hi> Iſrael <hi>is of the Lord;</hi> He is our <note place="margin">Pſal. 25. 5.</note> Saviour: How often is this expreſſed in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and in other places of the Holy Scripture. Salvation is aſcribed to the Lord, to him only; yea to his own Arm, to the greatneſs of his Power: <hi>Therefore my own Arm brought Salvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Brethren, each Perſon in the Trinity hath a part in it; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Iſa. 63. 5.</note> hath his Part, the Son hath his Part, and the Holy Ghoſt hath <note place="margin">What part of this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is attributed to God the Father.</note> his Part alſo. Remember, that theſe three are one; though three Perſons or Subſiſtences, yet but one and the ſame God, one in Eſſence, though diſtinguiſhed as to their diſtinct Perſonalities: the Perſon of the Father is not the Perſon of the Son; the Father took not upon him Fleſh and died for our Sins, but the Son; the Son ſent not the Father, but the Father ſent the Son: The Father and the Son do not proceed from the Holy Ghoſt, but the Holy Ghoſt doth proceed from them.</p>
                     <p>But a little to open and inſiſt upon the diſtinct Parts which each Perſon hath, and how concerned in the accompliſhing of this great Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Father is held forth in the Scripture, as the Contriver or firſt Author of this Salvation: <hi>All Things are of God, who hath reconciled us unto himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> All Things in and about <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 18.</note> our Salvation are of God the Father, as he is the Fountain and Spring of it: <hi>He hath deviſed means, that his baniſhed might not for ever be expelled from him. I have found a Ranſom:</hi> Where did God find it? (ſaith Reverend <hi>Caryl)</hi> Certainly in his own Boſom, in his own Heart: Jeſus Chriſt came out of the Boſom of the Father, there he was, and God found him in and with himſelf; he did not find the Ranſom by chance, but he found it in his own Wiſdom, Love and Goodneſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Father was injured, his Glory ſeemed to be eclipſed by Sin, therefore muſt be righted, and his Honour repaired; and he ſought out the proper way to do it: I know, as if God ſhould ſay, how to do the poor Sinner good; I know how to ſave him, and do my own Honour, my Juſtice, Truth and Holineſs, no wrong; my Honour is ſecured, my Juſtice is ſatisfied; and yet the Sinner whom my Heart is ſet upon, ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="378" facs="tcp:59949:196"/>
3. The Father could only appoint the Terms and Way of our Salvation: Who but God could tell, or did know what would comport with his Truth and Juſtice, and with the Sanction of his Righteous Law and Infinite Holineſs? And he ſaw it did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with his Truth, Juſtice, Holineſs, and Bleſſed Law, to ſave Man meerly as an Act of Sovereign Mercy; but it did agree in his Infinite Wiſdom to transfer the Puniſhment of the Sinner to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, namely, to his own Son, he taking our Nature on him; who from the Union of the two Natures in one Perſon, procured an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Satisfaction, or made a Plenary Compenſation for our Sins.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. God the Father is therefore held forth as the Perſon who ſubſtituted his own Son as Mediator and Surety in our ſtead and room, to work out our Redemption, or this great and glorious Salvation; and to this end prepared him a Body: <hi>A Body haſt thou prepared me.</hi> And the Father is ſaid alſo to ſend his Son: How <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 5.</note> many times doth our Bleſſed Saviour aſcribe this unto the Father, in the Goſpel recorded by <hi>John?</hi> I am perſwaded not leſs than forty times: <hi>The Father that ſent me, is with me. God ſent not his Son into the World to condemn the World. This is the Will of him that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>ſent me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. All the Bleſſings of our Salvation are aſcribed to the free Bounty, Mercy, Love and Goodneſs of God the Father: <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for he hath viſited and redeemed his People, and hath raiſed up an Horn of Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore he is ſtiled, <hi>The Father of Mercies, and God of all Comfort.</hi> Now this <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 3.</note> being ſo, what an abominable thing is it for the <hi>Socinians</hi> to ſay, That the Doctrine of Satisfaction renders the Son more merciful and kind than the Father; ſee <hi>Penn</hi>'s <hi>Sandy Foundation ſhaken:</hi> No, this is very unjuſtly and unrighteouſly thrown upon this great Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Truth. Certainly it exalts the Goodneſs and Mercy of God the Father, far more than their idle and abſurd Notion of God's pardoning Sin in a way of meer Mercy, without a Satisfaction to his offended Juſtice; ſeeing God in a way of Mercy and Divine Goodneſs, is ſo ſet upon this Work of our Salvation, that though it coſt him the Life of his own Son, yet it ſhall be done, he will not ſpare him: <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> 
                        <hi>for us all.</hi> The Father did not ſpare him as an Act of his own Love and Goodneſs to us; <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son.</hi> Certainly that Perſon ſhews greater Love and <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 16.</note> Pity to another, who to ſave him gives <hi>a Million,</hi> than he that
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:59949:196"/>
gives but <hi>a Pound.</hi> Muſt God by theſe Men be deemed to have no Mercy at all, becauſe he ſeeks the Honour of his Juſtice equally with the Glory of his Mercy? Is he not Merciful, becauſe he is Juſt as well as Gracious?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Brethren, it was the Father that loved us and choſe us in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt before the Foundation of the World, which is the Spring of all Spiritual Bleſſings, even of Redemption and Salvation it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Moreover, the Father is ſaid to raiſe Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead: Though the Son being God could raiſe himſelf, yet as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, the Power to quicken whomſoever he will, is ſaid to be given to him by the Father. Beſides, it is the meer Grace and good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God the Father, to accept of Chriſt and his Obedience for us, and to accept of us in Jeſus Chriſt: Alſo it is the Father <hi>that bleſſeth us with all Spiritual Bleſſings in Heavenly Places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 3.</note> Nay, no Man, Chriſt ſays, can come unto him, <hi>unleſs it be given by the Father;</hi> that is, Power muſt be given to him to come. And again he ſaith, <hi>No Man can come unto me, except my Father that ſent me draw him.</hi> We ought therefore to ſee we do not leſſen the Glory of God the Father in our Salvation, who is the Efficient, the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and moving Cauſe thereof: <hi>My Father</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto</hi>

                        <hi>worketh, and I work.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Brethren, we are not to attribute the Works of Creation and Providence to God the Father only, for he hath a great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Hand in the Work of Redemption, I may ſay, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh this Work, even the Salvation of his Elect; <hi>he worketh hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> and Chriſt alſo worketh: which brings me to conſider of the next Perſon in the Trinity concerned herein.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As the Father hath, as you have heard, his part in <note place="margin">What a Part Chriſt hath in working out this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> bringing in the great Salvation of the Goſpel, ſo Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, hath his part in working of it out; the Father fix'd on him, as the great Agent, actually to perfect it: he is in ſuch a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner concerned in it, that his Name is <hi>Saviour,</hi> his Name ſhall be called <hi>Jeſus; Jeſus</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Saviour:</hi> certainly this muſt needs be a great Salvation, if we conſider the Greatneſs, Dignity and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Perſon, whom God hath ſent to ſave us. And becauſe it is mainly from this Foot of account, that the Apoſtle in the Text draws his Inference, and calls Goſpe-Salvation Great Salvation, I ſhall a little further enlarge upon this particular;</p>

the Keys of Hell and Death.

                     <p n="7">7. Moreover, Chriſt is as willing to ſave poor loſt and undone Sinners, as he is able; he had his Name given to this end, <hi>i. e.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Power, willingneſs and readineſs to ſave Sinners.</p>
                     <p>Brethren, this doth not only beſpeak this to be a great Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but alſo it diſcovers the greatneſs of God's Love even the greateſt Pity, Power and Wiſdom that ever was manifeſted.</p>

We were ſick of a fearful and incurable Diſeaſe, and the Father found out the Medicine; the Blood of Chriſt is that Medicine, and the Holy Spirit applies it to the Soul. We were in Debt, in Priſon, and bound in Fetters and cruel Chains, and the Father procured a Friend to pay all our Debts; The Son was this our Friend, who laid down the infinite Sum; and the Holy Spirit knocks off our Irons, our Fetters and Chains, and brings us out of the Priſon-houſe. The Father loved us, and ſent his Son to merit Grace for us; the Son loved us, and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:59949:198"/>
died, and thereby purchaſed that Grace to be imparted to us; and the Holy Spirit works that Grace in us. O what is the Nature of this Salvation; how Great, how Glorious! That the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, both the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, are thus imployed in and about it, that we might have it made fure to us for ever.</p>

And ſhall any dare to ſay there is no need of this Garment? We may work a Robe out of our own Bowels by the Operations of the Spirit, that will ſerve to hide our Nakedneſs, trouble not us with your old Divinity: We are for rational Religion.

2. Dare any of you think that this Salvation is but a ſmall Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that you need not trouble your ſelves about it? O trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you who never had one ſerious Thought about it to this Day: You have other things to mind, are full of Buſineſs; but, O Sirs, what is of ſuch Moment as this Salvation? Yet nevertheleſs ſome will not ſpare time to hear it, or to attend upon the Word of this Salvation: Others will not part with the Love of this World, to have a Part in it; they value their earthly Riches, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Honours, above it; nay, too many eſteem their filthy Luſts more than an Intereſt in this great Salvation. But what contempt do ſuch Perſons caſt upon the great God, who hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted ſuch Depths of Divine Wiſdom, Grace and Goodneſs in bringing of it in, and working of it out for our precious Souls: Did they know what God is, Chriſt is, Salvation is, certainly they would change their Opinion, and not a little blame themſelves for their great Folly. Brethren, a true and ſpiritual Knowledg of the Great Salvation of the Goſpel, makes all the Things of the World ſeem little, nay nothing in compariſon thereof: All things that Carnal Men have their Hearts ſet upon, are poor, thin and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly Things, when compared to Grace here, and Glory hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. No ſooner had <hi>Paul</hi> a true ſight of this Great Salvation, but immediately he <hi>conſulted not with Fleſh and Blood.</hi> When the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 16.</note> of Chriſt and Salvation is taſted, and a Soul knows how good and ſatisfying it is, every thing that hath a Tincture of Fleſh and Blood, all carnal Intereſts, and fleſhly Counſels expire. A full ſight of this Salvation ſeems to make Life uneaſy, and Death deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in Peace, for mine Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation.</hi> Nothing in this World could be worth a Thought of his Heart, ſince his Eyes had ſeen God's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Why what did he ſee? It was Jeſus Chriſt the Author of Salvation, in whom he knew was Salvation, and in no other: He that lives ſo long as to ſee Chriſt by an Eye of Faith to be his Saviour, and his Salvation, will be willing to leave this World, be willing to die, becauſe he then ſhall die in peace. None can die happily that have not a ſight of this Great Salvation; nor can any have a true ſight of this Salvation, but they only who have by Faith a true ſight of the Bleſſed Saviour. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he came to the Knowledg of Chriſt, and of Salvation by Chriſt, eſteems every thing in the World to be no better than <hi>Dung,</hi> and longs to be diſſolv'd, and to be in Chriſt's Arms, and taſte how good Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in the full poſſeſſion of it in Heaven.</p>

3. This reproves ſuch who delay ſeeking after the Knowledg of this Salvation: If it be ſo great, it muſt and ought firſt of all be regarded: <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> May be 'ere long you will wiſh you had ſought after Chriſt <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 33.</note> and Salvation by him, before all things, when you come to lie upon a ſick Bed. O Sirs, you will need it at laſt, and may be ſeek it when too late. Were a poor condemned Criminal ſenſible of a Way how to be ſaved from Death, or that a Pardon might be had, would he delay the Time, or would he not make it all his Buſineſs with his uttermoſt Care to ſeek for a Pardon, leſt the Day of his Execution ſhould come before he hath got it? And if ſo, he knows die he muſt: Alas Sirs, what is it to be delivered from Natural Death, to our being delivered from Eternal Death! The Time when you muſt die may be near; and if you have not an Intereſt in this Salvation when you die Naturally, your Souls muſt die Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. Pray obſerve the Argument I am upon to excite and ſtir up your Souls to a Holy Diligence, in attending on the Means of this Salvation; it is the ſame the Apoſtle uſes, it is called Great Salvation, conſidering the Dignity of Chriſt's Perſon, who laid down his own Life to purchaſe it for us; and alſo was the firſt great Miniſter and Preacher of it, <hi>which at firſt began to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Lord:</hi> It was preached by the Lord of Life and Glory, the great Mediator, Head of all Principalities and Powers; and it is again by one of his poor Servants this Day offered unto you, in the Name of my Great Maſter, therefore refuſe it at your Peril: If you receive it, imbrace it, you ſhall be happy; but if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it, you will be miſerable, and at laſt die in your Sins.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The Evil of Sin opened.</note>Brethren, the Evil of Sin comprehendeth many things, as it reſpecteth God, and is directly againſt him, his Holy Nature, hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and loathſom in his ſight: and in reſpect had to Man, which takes in our firſt Apoſtacy from God, the loſs of his Holy and Bleſſed Image, as alſo his Love and Favour; and ſo the Pravity of all the Powers of our Souls, and Faculties thereof, as the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Minds, and Darkneſs of our Underſtandings; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and Stubbornneſs of our Wills, and hardneſs of our Hearts; the Carnality and Vanity of our Affections; the horrid Guilt, Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and Filthineſs that cleaves to the Soul and Conſcience; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Shame, Bondage, Nakedneſs, Poverty and Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, Slavery to Satan and to this World, having contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a Likeneſs to the Devil, or an Impreſs of his Image, doing his Will, and ſerving our own Luſts: All theſe, and many other things, comprize the Evil of Sin, from which by this Salvation we are delivered.</p>
                     <p>But to ſpeak a little more particularly; let us,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Conſider the Evil of Sin: As it is contrary to God's moſt Holy and Pure Nature, it is that thing which his Soul is ſaid to hate. Would not we be greatly concerned, if any ſhould do that in our ſight and preſence, which they know we hate and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Sin is a Diſhonour to God, and it is called a Deſpiſing of God: <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 30.</note> Certainly Sin muſt needs have a great Evil in it, if it be a deſpiſing of God: if a Man be deſpiſed, he thinks
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:59949:201"/>
himſelf greatly wronged; loſs of Honour is no ſmall loſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Sin is a croſſing of God's Will, acting directly contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; nay, and it is a doing the Will of the Devil: How are you troubled if your Servants croſs your Will in that which is juſt and right, and wherein your Intereſt and Honour lies, and is nearly concerned. Sin is a croſſing of the Will of God; not only when the Sinner doth not what God commands to be done, which is a Sin of Omiſſion, but alſo in doing that which he hath poſitively forbid, which is a Sin of Commiſſion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Sin doth caſt contempt upon God, as when Men ſin preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly with a high Hand, as if it were in defiance of Heaven, as if they bid God do his worſt, intimating that they will have their Way, their Wills, their curſed Luſts, or ſinful Pleaſures and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, let what will come of it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Sin is a renouncing of God's juſt Authority and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over us; it is <hi>a breaking his Bonds, and caſting his Cords from</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>us.</hi> What is the Voice of Sin? God ſhall not reign over us, we will not be under his Government, but will live as we liſt, our Tongues are our own; and who is Lord over us? Nay, and as Sin doth caſt off God, and diſown him, contemn him, rebel againſt him, will not have him reign, but ſtrive to pull him out of his Throne: So by Sin the Sinner ſets up the Devil in God's Place, puts him into God's Throne. The Heart is the Throne of God, but there the Sinner will not allow God to rule, God to be, but gives way to Sin, and will ſin; and in ſo doing he exalts Satan, and puts him into the Government, and ſubjects to him. O what is the Evil of Sin?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Sin in the Nature of it, is a manifeſtation of the Sinner's hatred of God: God declares againſt Sinners in his Word, as ſuch that hate him; the leſſer Love is accounted a Hatred in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But alas, Sinners ſeem to have no Love to God at all, they proclaim War againſt him, even wiſh there was no God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul them, to judg them, to puniſh them, ſo that they might ſin the more freely, and with the more impudence, if it be poſſible for them ſo to do: <hi>The Fool ſaith in his Heart, there is no God.</hi> He would have no God, he would be glad it there was no God; ſuch is his hatred of God.

Nay, and by Afflictions we are purged, and are ſaid to partake of the Holineſs of God; therefore there is much Good in Affliction: but Sin hath nothing but Evil in it, hurtful Evil, Soul-defiling, and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damning Evil.

Suppoſe a Man was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die for High-Treaſon, or for ſome other great Crime, nay to be burned alive, or to be flead alive, and juſt as the Sentence was going to be executed upon him, one ſhould bring him the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that the King had pardoned his Offence, and therefore he ſhould not die; would he not look upon this to be a great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But, alas, what can reach or be compared to the State of condemned Sinners? What is it to be thrown into a Fire, or to burn for half an Hour, nay, to be put into a lingering Fire, to be dying a whole Day, nay, a whole Year, or if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be dying forty or fifty Years, to lie burning in Hell to all Eternity? Every Sinner is condemned by the Law of God to be burned, to be burned alive in Hell for ever, where the Damned are always dying, but yet cannot die. If this were well and ſeriouſly conſidered, certainly every one muſt acknowledg the Goſpel-Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to be a Great and Glorious Salvation, that delivers all that imbrace it, from ſo great a Death as the <hi>ſecond</hi> Death, or the Wrath of God in Hell. Brethren, this Salvation doth not only free and deliver the Souls of all that believe from Wrath, from all Wrath and Miſery, but the Bodies alſo, as I ſhall ſhew you hereafter before I have done with this Text. The Body ſhall be delivered from Sickneſs, Lameneſs, Blindneſs, Poverty, Hunger, Nakedneſs, nay, and from Corruption it ſelf, even from whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, that is either grievous or deſtructive here or hereafter.

Or if People who feel the bitterneſs of War, Famine, or Peſtilence, were delivered and ſet at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, would they not account it a Great Salvation, a Great Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance? But what are all theſe Salvations to this Great Salvation I am ſpeaking of! What is the Sickneſs of the Body, or Death of the Body here, to the Sickneſs and Death of Body and Soul for ever? What is an Impriſonment in the worſt of Jails, and to lie in Chains and Irons put upon us by Men like our ſelves, and to bear their Wrath for a few Days, to the eternal Priſon? What is a dark Dungeon here <hi>to the Blackneſs of Darkneſs for ever?</hi> What is the Wrath of Man to the Wrath of God, or Chains of Iron to everlaſting Chains of Darkneſs? What is a little outward Want or Poverty, to the Want of God's Favour and Love to Eternity, being ſeparated from his Preſence for ever, and to lie in Fire, burning and broiling, and cannot have ſo much as one Drop of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cool the Tongue; for one Drop is denied to the Damned in Hell. The <hi>rich Glutton</hi> when in Hell, begged that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might be ſent to him and dip the Tip of his Finger in Water to cool his <note place="margin">Luke 16. 24.</note> Tongue, but it was not granted. Alas, all Miſeries here are nothing (as they paſs away in a Moment) when compared unto Eternal Wrath and burning in Hell, which is the pourings forth of the unſpeakable and righteous Vengeance of a provoked and angry God.</p>
                     <p>There is no Parallel, nothing to expreſs the Nature of that deſtructive Evil that is in Sin; there is nothing left us to illuſtrate it withal: therefore to be delivered and ſaved for ever from the juſt Puniſhment and diſmal Wrath of God, muſt needs be deemed Great Salvation; and the Excellency of it will at length be known to them who ſlight and deſpiſe it, when they come to fall and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh under the want of it. He that is delivered from lying in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for a thouſand Pound Debt, where he muſt have lain till Death, having nothing to pay it, and being fallen into the Hands of Juſtice it ſelf, but meeting with a Friend who paid all he owed, he cannot but cry out, O great Love and Compaſſion, that would be a Deliverance indeed! But it is nothing to this, we in a ſpiritual Senſe being delivered from Hell by Jeſus Chriſt, who payed our Debts for us, each of us owing not leſs than ten thouſand Talents, I mean, ſo many Sins, and every Sin a greater Debt than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds.

O what a precious thing is the Soul of Man! what pity is it that it ſhould be loſt and damned for ever, (and how doth this tend to demonſtrate the Glory and Greatneſs of this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!) for it was under Wrath and the Curſe of God by Sin. Sirs, the Nature of the Soul is ſuch, that it leads a Man out to behold and magnify God in the Works of Creation and Providence, tho it want, ſupernatural Light and Knowledg: But O when it comes to be divinely inſpired, what does it diſcover through the help of the ſame Spirit of God in Chriſt, and of the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption? For all Knowledg to this Knowledg, is but of little worth: <hi>Paul</hi> therefore determined to know nothing but Chriſt and <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 1, 2.</note> him crucified; nay, and accounted all natural Knowledg, Gifts, Wiſdom and Improvements, or whatſoever he once eſteemed of, to be but Dung in compariſon of the Excellency of the Knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt his Lord.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Soul is precious doth yet further appear, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Nothing but God himſelf can ſatisfy the Soul.</note> an enjoyment of God, or a part and intereſt in him, it can never by happy, nothing ſhort of God himſelf can fill its Deſires. This ſome of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> by the dim Light of Nature, came to underſtand; it is reſtleſs until it comes to find God, Reſt, Peace and Satisfaction in God, who is the beſt of Beings, and our chief Good. The Soul is much like unto <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Dove</hi> which he ſent out of the Ark, that found no reſt for the Sole of her Foot, until ſhe returned unto him in the Ark: Therefore miſerable will all thoſe be that for ever ſhall one Day be ſeparated from God, ſhould they meet with no worſe Torment than that. A Man accounts it no ſmall Miſery to be deprived of that which he eſteems to be his only Happineſs, though he knows he can enjoy it but a ſhort time: Suppoſe it be his Riches, his Houſes, his Lands, or his Gold and Silver, or his Pleaſures, or his Honours, or his dear Relations, in whom his very Life ſeems to bound up; he is upon the loſs of that
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:59949:209"/>
which he eſteems ſo highly of as a dead Man. Now ſure if the Soul is of ſuch an excellent Nature, that no created Good can fill its Deſires, nothing in this World, nothing but God himſelf, it muſt needs be a very precious thing: But ſo it is; for as <hi>Rachel</hi> ſaid once to <hi>Jacob</hi> her Husband, <hi>Give me Children, or I die:</hi> So this is the Voice of the Soul of Man, Give me God, give me Chriſt, or I die. Nay, to be deprived of God, is the Death of the Soul; and it was that which brought Death on the Soul of Man original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; by Sin we were deprived of God, and that was the Death of the Soul: God is the ſpiritual Life of the Soul, as in a moral ſenſe the Soul is the natural Life of the Body; for as the Body is dead without the Soul naturally, ſo the Soul is dead without God ſpiritually. Therefore the Salvation of the Soul muſt needs be a great and glorious Salvation, that which brings God again to the Soul, that which reſtores God, a loſt God to the Soul, that gives Life to a poor dead Soul and makes it live again, and ſo be happy again, yea and that for ever more.</p>

The Soul is precious, and a moſt excellent thing it appears, <note place="margin">God's Thoughts greatly let out about the Soul of Man.</note> becauſe God's Thoughts are ſo let out upon it. What care hath he taken of the Soul of Man! How early did he concern himſelf for the redemption of it! and what a way did he ſeek out and contrive to reſtore it to a ſtate of Peace, Joy and Happineſs again, when he foreſaw it brought under Death, Sin and Miſery: it ſeems to be the <hi>Darling of Heaven;</hi> as it was formed (as it were) by the Breath of God, ſo nothing he thinks too good to impart for its Ranſom to redeem it, nor nothing too precious to feed it, heal it, or comfort it: He gives the Bread of Heaven, the very Fleſh and Blood of his own Son to feed it, the Righteouſneſs of his own Son to clothe it, the Graces of his own Spirit to deck and adorn it; nay, and his own Spirit is ſent to lead, to guide, protect and govern it. Certainly theſe things clearly ſhew and demonſtrate its great Worth, or that it is a moſt excellent thing in God's ſight.</p>

O what Ways, diverſe and cunning Stratagems doth he uſe, that ſo he may ſpoil the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or deſtroy the Comfort of our Souls: For as it is God's great Concern to ſave our Souls, ſo it is Satan's great Buſineſs to damn and deſtroy our Souls for ever; and as God contrives Ways and Means to make our Souls happy for ever, ſo the Devil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives Ways and Means to make our Souls miſerable for ever. The Soul is (as I may ſay) that ſweet Morſel Satan hungers after, and fain would tear in pieces and devour if poſſible; it is not ſo much to deſtroy our Bodies by natural Death, as our Souls and Bodies by eternal Death. O how great is that Salvation, that is the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our precious Souls! God's Care, Coſt and Labour to preſerve our Souls, to ſave our Souls, ſhews that it is of great Worth. And it is this that makes Man to differ ſo much from bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Creatures, and to excel all the Works of God in this nether Creation: Had it not been for our Souls, would God have been any more concerned for us, than for the Beaſts that periſh?

                        <hi>ago, (whether in the Body, I cannot tell, or whether out of the Body, I cannot tell, God knoweth) ſuch an one caught up to the third Heaven—How he was in Paradiſe and heard unſpeakable Words, which it is not lawful for a Man to utter.</hi> In the third Heaven, or in Paradiſe for certain he was; but whether caught up Body and Soul together, or in the Soul only out of the Body, he could not tell. From whence I argue, that <hi>Paul</hi> knew that the Soul was capable of being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Body, and in that ſeparated ſtate capable of the Divine Raviſhments of Heaven, or of the Viſion of God, if he had not been of this Judgment, ſince he was in the third Heaven, he might be ſure he was taken up in the Body.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, <hi>Peter</hi> there only refers to the Body of <hi>David,</hi> that is not aſcended, for his <hi>Sepulchre is with us to this Day,</hi> ſaith he; <note place="margin">Acts 2. 29.</note> and therefore he argues <hi>David</hi> means Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe Soul was not left in Hell, that is, his Body was not left in the Grave, for the Body is often in the Scripture called by the Name of the Soul. But when we read of the Soul as diſtinguiſhed from the Body, and as that which Man cannot kill, it intends the ſuperiour Part of Man, or that which in our common acceptation is called the <hi>Soul,</hi> or Spirit of Man; in which the Image of God was chiefly created, and which is fed with Spiritual Food, and capable of ſweet Communion with Jeſus Chriſt, as you have heard. Now then if the Soul be Immortal, and goes to Hell or Heaven at Death, I mean to Joy or Sorrow, or to a Priſon of Pain and Darkneſs, or to a Palace of Joy and Pleaſure; O what a great Salvation is Goſpel-Salvation! How ſoon doth eternal Miſery or Torment
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:59949:211"/>
ſeize upon the Ungodly; even no ſooner do they die but their Souls are in Hell, and no ſooner do Believers die but their Souls are in Paradiſe: and had not Chriſt came and wrought out our Salvation, our Souls muſt have lain under Wrath and Miſery for ever in an eternal ſeparation from God and all true Joy and Happineſs.</p>
                     <p>O what a fearful and an amazing Loſs is the loſs of the Soul! Sirs, pray remember, this Salvation is the Salvation of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Souls; thy Soul, O Sinner, is dearly concerned in it: Our Soul is our All, what have we more? A Man is never utterly undone till his Soul is utterly loſt: if the Soul is ſaved, all is ſaved; but if the Soul is loſt, for ever loſt, all is loſt. But,</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> The loſs or loſing of the Soul, is the loſs of the Body too; that muſt have periſhed for ever with the Body of Beaſts, whilſt our Souls muſt have lain in Torments, had not Chriſt came to redeem us. Moreover, The Salvation of the Soul is the Salvation of the Body; Chriſt came to ſave both the Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too: And hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Even we our ſelves groan within our ſelves, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the Redemption of</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>glorious Body.</hi> This Salvation ſaves not our Souls only from Wrath, but our Bodies alſo, they ſhall riſe to Life and Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; the Bodies of the Wicked as well as their Souls ſhall be caſt into Hell, but the Bodies and the Souls of the Godly ſhall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Heaven for ever. O what a grievous thing it is to think of the loſs of the Body, to have the Soul taken away from the Body! But how ſweet is it to think of that Day, when thoſe two old Friends ſhall meet together again, and when both ſhall be delivered from all Evil, from all Deformity and Pollution, and be glorified, and alſo ſhall never part more, or be ſeparated from each other to the Days of Eternity.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Reproof to ſuch who deſpiſe their own precious Souls: What Fools are they, who to ſave their <hi>Hutts,</hi> loſe their <hi>Heads;</hi> or who to ſave their <hi>Goods</hi> in a fearful Fire, loſe their dear <hi>Child</hi> in the <hi>Cradle?</hi> As I once told you of a Woman that did thus, her Houſe was on Fire, and ſhe beſtirred her ſelf to get out her beſt

Goods; and at laſt when ſhe could go in no more, ſhe rejoiced that ſhe had ſaved her Goods; but ſaid one to her, Woman, where is your Child? <hi>O my Child, my Child;</hi> then ſhe cried her Child, when it was too late, for that was burned to Death in the Cradle. Juſt thus ſome, to get and ſave their Goods, to get the World, loſe their Souls. We read of ſome, who to ſave their Lives or their Bodies from being burned to Aſhes for Chriſt, denied Chriſt; they could not burn for him: What ſaith our Saviour? <hi>He that ſeeks to ſave his Life, ſhall loſe it.</hi> What Fools are they then who think that way to ſave their Bodies; for as they loſe their Souls, ſo they loſe their Bodies alſo: And it is not worſe to have the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <note place="margin">Job 27. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Hope of the Hypocrite though he hath gained, when God taketh away his Soul?</hi> He makes a bad Market that puts off his Soul at any Price; <hi>What ſhall a Man give in exchange of his Soul?</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, who knew the great worth of it, laid down a Price of infinite Value to redeem and purchaſe it. <hi>Witches</hi> they ſay ſell their Souls to the Devil out of Malice, to be revenged on ſome that have offended them: What a diſmal thing is that, how fearful is their State? But pray, Brethren, what do they loſe who ſell their Souls to the Devil, as it were, for the ſake of their brutiſh Luſts, or out of love to Sin? Thus the <hi>Whoremongers</hi> and <hi>unclean Perſons</hi> ſell their Souls, and <hi>Drunkards</hi> who will have their merry Bouts, their Cups and Pots, and ſilthy Companions, and may be their Whores too, let what will become of their immortal Souls: others will have their <hi>Pride</hi> and haughty Hearts, <hi>gay Clothes,</hi> and their <hi>deteſtable Dreſſes,</hi> though their Souls are clothed with Rags, and a <hi>crawling Worm knaws</hi> on them, and to Hell muſt be thrown at laſt, <hi>where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</hi> Moreover, the carnal <hi>Worldling</hi> will be rich, he will lay up Gold and Silver, he will gain the World though he loſe thereby his own Soul. But remember, Sinners, Chriſt died for the Soul, this Salvation is the Salvation of the Soul; and does any wretched Sinner deſpiſe his Soul, or is it think you not worth his Pains to part with his Cups, with his ſinful Companions, with his or her Pride, unlawful Gain, or the love of this World, to ſave it for ever?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. How does this tend to reprove ſuch who do expoſe their precious Souls to eternal Wrath, for the unjuſt Gain of <hi>Six-pence</hi> or
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:59949:212"/>
a <hi>Shilling?</hi> Are there not too many ſuch in the World, who will cheat, lie and defraud their Neighbours for a ſmall matter of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit? O how dear will they one Day pay for that Gain!</p>
                     <p n="4">4. How does this reprove likewiſe ſuch Parents that think they can never do enough for to enrich their Children, or get them great Portions, and care not what they eat, drink, wear, or how richly their Bodies are deck'd and adorned, but take no care of their immortal Souls, but rather indulge them in their Sins and vain and wicked Practices, and ſet alſo Soul damning Examples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually before their Eyes?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We may alſo infer from hence, what a mighty Charge, an amazing Charge Parents have committed to them; as alſo the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel, who are to take care and watch over the Souls of ſuch who are committed to them, as ſuch that muſt one Day give an Account of them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Moreover, wo be to ſuch who deceive and blindly lead the Souls of Men to deſtruction, that are ſo exceeding precious: <hi>If the Blind lead the Blind, they will both fall into the Ditch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Shall I exhort you, Sinners, to look to Chriſt for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Souls.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He bids you look to him; <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved, all ye Ends of the Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Conſider, that there is no other way to ſave your Souls, there is but one Saviour, and one way of Salvation: <hi>There is no other Name given under Heaven whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi> He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives <note place="margin">Acts 4. 12.</note> Chriſt, believes in Chriſt, ſhall be ſaved; and <hi>he that believes not ſhall be damned.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. If Life be more worth than all the World, certainly the Soul is more worth than ten thouſand Worlds. O do not part with it on any Terms, for it coſt Chriſt dear, the Price of his own Blood; his Heart-Blood was let out to ſave our Souls. Alas, there are ſome nevertheleſs that are like the falſe Prophets of old, who <hi>ſold the Souls of the People for a handful of Barley, and for a piece of Bread.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. How near may ſome of you be to Death; and if you have not got an Intereſt in Chriſt before then, what will become of your precious Souls?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Will you conſider what Means of Grace God is pleaſed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you for the good of your Souls, and know it is by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel that God commonly ſaves the Souls of Men, I mean, that it is the Means he uſes for the begetting of Faith: Shall
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:59949:213"/>
the Word have ſome good Effect upon your Souls this Day?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Conſider, all your Prayers, Tears, Alms-deeds, all Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life, Services, Duties and inherent Holineſs, cannot ſave your Souls; no, none but Chriſt, nothing but the Merits of Chriſt, it is his Blood alone that made your Peace, and muſt waſh away all the Guilt and Filth of your Sins. Your Souls, your precious Souls, O Sinners, are wounded, polluted, naked; what will you do? Nothing but Chriſt's Blood I tell you can heal them; nothing but his Fleſh, his Blood, can feed them; and nothing but his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs can clothe them; and nothing but the Graces of Chriſt's Spirit can inrich, can deck and adorn your Souls; and without Faith you cannot obtain any of thoſe Bleſſings.</p>
                     <p>O what ſhall I ſay to you, if going down upon my Knees could move you to lay to Heart what a ſad State you are in, who have not received by Faith this Salvation, and incline you now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, I would readily do it; but alas, it is God's Gift: O look up to him, do what you can, pray and attend on the Word: What do you ſay, do you believe that this is a Great Salvation? Will you eſteem it, and look after it above all things in the World? It is, Sirs, that one thing needful; <hi>chuſe</hi> with <hi>Mary that good Part that ſhall never be taken from you.</hi> Shall there be Joy in Heaven this Day? how can you ſlight ſuch a precious Soul, and ſuch a precious Saviour, who ſpilt his Blood to ſave the worſt of Sinners? Will you tread his Blood under your Feet? If ſo, what will you do at the Day of Death, and in the Day of Judgment? Should your Souls be loſt, there is no repairing that Loſs, no redemption of the Soul out of Hell, no other Price, no other Saviour, no other way; if this be ſlighted, you muſt periſh.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Conſider the Blood of Chriſt is the way of Goſpel-Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, no Remiſſion of Sin <hi>without the ſhedding of Blood; there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi>

                        <hi>through his Blood, even the Forgiveneſs of Sins.</hi> It was by his offering himſelf an Expiatory Sacrifice to God; there's no Salvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Pardon of Sin, and no Pardon of Sin without a Compenſation be made by Jeſus Chriſt to the Law and Juſtice of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Conſider who are pardoned, even all that believe, though they were never ſuch great Rebels againſt God; ſuch were Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Enemies once, who are now forgiven. Here is a Pardon for the vileſt Sinner, that ſees his horrid Evil and Rebellion, and takes hold of Jeſus Chriſt, or looks up to him by Faith.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Conſider the Nature of this Pardon and Goſpel-Remiſſion: Such are pardoned for ever; <hi>I will remember their Sins no more,</hi> they are blotted out for ever. God promiſes to all penitent and believing Sinners, to throw their Sins into the Depth of the Sea.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Conſider the Terms of Pardon, it is a free Forgiveneſs, we having nothing to pay: God of his meer Grace and Goodneſs doth forgive us through the Atonement of Chriſt's Blood freely; <hi>Even</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 43. 25:</note> 
                        <hi>I am he that blotteth out thy Tranſgreſſion for my own ſake, and will not remember thy Sins:</hi> This is ſpoke to a People that had wearied the Lord with their Iniquities. O what a glorious Salvation is this, that here is Remiſſion and free Pardon for rebellious Sinners, ſuch that deſerve nothing but Wrath and Hell!</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is a Pardon of all Sins, great and ſmall, Sins of Omiſſion, and Sins of Commiſſion, Sins of all ſorts and ſizes.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. 'Tis God that blotteth out our Sins; he that can forgive, he whoſe right it is to pardon, he againſt whom we have ſinned; and he who when he gives a Pardon, none can ſuperſede it nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke it, let them do what they can.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with God is another Bleſſing of this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: God doth not only forgive us, but he takes us into his Boſom, he is fully reconciled to us in Jeſus Chriſt; he cries, <hi>Fury is not in</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, By this Salvation we come to have Union with God, <note place="margin">Union with God a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and to be made one Spirit with Jeſus Chriſt: and how great and glorious is this ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>w. Moreover, we are not only brought into a State of Union but are alſo admitted to have Communion with the Father, and the Son. Brethren, it is one thing for a <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> to be pardoned, and another thing for him to be admitted into the King's Preſence, and to become one of his great Favourites: <hi>Truly our Fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 3.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, By this Salvation alſo we are juſtified: Juſtification is a high Privilege; <hi>By him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes. Let me <note place="margin">Acts 13. 39.</note> ſhew you what it is to be juſtfied, that ſo this Salvation may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the more great and glorious to you.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To be juſtified, is more than to be pardoned. A Man may be forgiven, and yet not have the Guilt removed from him, nor <note place="margin">The Nature of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> be declared Righteous and Innocent. To be juſtified, is to be pronounced Juſt and Righteous in God's Sight, through the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, or to be actually acquitted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Trial, or diſcharged from the Guilt and Puniſhment of Sins; not that we are not Sinners in our ſelves but as Chriſt was made <hi>Sin for us who knew no Sin</hi> (in himſelf) <hi>ſo we are made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> who knew no Righteouſneſs in our ſelves. As our Sin was imputed unto Chriſt, ſo his Righteouſneſs is imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us: God in Juſtification deals not with us in a way of Mercy only, (as he doth in Pardon of Sin) but in a way of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs alſo; we paid all that was due to vindictive Wrath and Juſtice in Jeſus Chriſt, (I mean, Jeſus Chriſt for us as our Surety hath done it).</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Juſtification is ſo great a Bleſſing, that the Juſtice of God hath nothing to lay to the Believer's Charge, for Juſtice as well as Mercy does acquit him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Nor hath the Law any thing to lay to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>arge of them that God juſtifies, Chriſt in our ſtead having anſwered all the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:59949:214"/>
Demands thereof, and born the Penalty it denounces upon the Tranſgreſſors of it: <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>Law, being made a Curſe for us.</hi>

Sixthly, By the Grace and Means of this Salvation, we are eſpouſed to Jeſus Chriſt. O what an Honour and Dignity is this, Believers are the Bride, the Lamb's Wife! And how is, and ſhall the Spouſe of Chriſt be clothed? Even in <hi>Gold of Ophir: She ſhall be brought to the King in Raiment of Needle-work.</hi> She is all glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">Pſal. 45. 9, 10.</note> within, and ſhe ſhall be all glorious outwardly in Body too e're long, as well as ſhe is ſo now in her Soul and inward Parts. Jeſus Chriſt puts Chains about the Necks of all that are his, or that he eſpouſes, I mean, thoſe precious Graces of his Spirit which he hath purchaſed for them; <hi>For they ſhall be an Ornament of Grace unto thy Head, and Chains about thy Neck.</hi> The Father called for the beſt <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 9.</note> Robe to be put upon his Son, as ſoon as he returned home, <hi>and a Ring on his Finger.</hi> The inward Beauty of the Spouſe does even <note place="margin">Luke 15. 22.</note> raviſh the very Heart of Chriſt: <hi>Thou haſt raviſhed my Heart, my Siſter, my Spouſe; thou haſt raviſhed my Heart with one of thine Eyes, with the Chain of thy Neck.</hi> With one of thine Eyes: ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by one of her Eyes, the Eye of Faith; no doubt that is a precious Grace in Chriſt's ſight. Every Believer partakes of Grace, and all Spiritual Gifts; every Grace is a glorious Ornament, and of great Price in the ſight of God. This Salvation makes Men and Women glorious Creatures, new Creatures, every one reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Son of a King; they hereby come to partake of God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nature: And as the Grace of this Salvation makes glorious Chriſtians, ſo it does alſo make glorious Churches, <hi>Candleſticks of pure Gold.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seventhly, This Salvation brings Peace with it. Peace is a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bleſſing, we receive Grace firſt, and then Peace: <hi>My Peace I give unto you, my Peace I leave with you.</hi> The Peace of God is ſo <note place="margin">John 16.</note> excellent a thing, that <hi>it paſſes all Mens Vnderſtanding.</hi> What would <hi>Spira</hi> or <hi>Child</hi> have given for true Peace and inward Sereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mind? O it is a great and glorious Salvation! Were theſe things conſidered, and could be fully opened, it would appear more abundantly; true Peace of Conſcience is never known to the Worth of it, but to ſuch who have known the want of it.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, I might alſo ſpeak of Sanctification, which Bleſſing all they alſo partake of that have an Intereſt in this Salvation: Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is an Heaven on Earth, it is Heaven begun here, and it fits and makes every Believer meet for that bleſſed Inheritance of the Saints
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:59949:216"/>
in Light; the Spirit and Graces of the Spirit are given to this end, I mean, to make us holy in Heart and Life.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, Free acceſs unto the Throne of Grace, is another Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Privilege which all Believers receive who have a part in this Salvation. Chriſt hath made the Way eaſy for us to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it is by <hi>a new and living Way which he hath conſecrated for us</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>through the Vail, that is to ſay, his Fleſh,</hi> or by his Death.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, All the Promiſes of God belong to Believers, and are procured for them in and by this Salvation: They are great, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and precious;</hi> there is a Fulneſs in them: the Promiſes <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> as they are ſure in Chriſt, Yea and Amen in Chriſt, ſo they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer every State and Condition any Believer can be in.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, All the Ordinances of the Goſpel belong to this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and are no ſmall Privilege; they are as <hi>golden Pipes</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey Heavenly Riches, or Sacred Treaſure to our Souls.</p>
                     <p>Nay, and in the laſt place, there is a Crown of Glory that every Believer ſhall be raiſed unto, that hath a ſaving Intereſt in this Salvation; and not only a Crown, but a Kingdom alſo. Now is not this a great Salvation, which raiſes poor Creatures who were fallen as low as Hell, up to Heaven, and of being Slaves of Sin and Satan, to be Sons and Daughters of God? It was a great Salvation that <hi>Joſeph</hi> had when he was brought out of Priſon, where he lay in Irons, to be the chief Ruler under the King in <hi>Egypt:</hi> And it was a great Advancement of <hi>David</hi> from following the Sheep, to ſit on a Throne; but nothing like this of Believers. What is an Earthly Throne to an Heavenly one? He that overcometh, ſhall <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 21.</note> ſit down with Chriſt in his Throne, and reign for ever and ever.</p>

                        <hi>APPLICATION.</hi>

4. Be exhorted, you that are Saints, to ſtrive to exerciſe Faith in reſpect of your Juſtification: Believe the Goſpel-Teſtimony; <hi>He that believeth is juſtified from all things,</hi> &amp;c. You have the Word of that God that cannot lie to aſſure you of it. Do not judg of your Juſtification according to the degree of your Sanctification, as if you were no further juſtified than you are ſanctified, or that your Sanctification is any Cauſe of your Juſtification; nor do not think you are more juſtified when you are in a lively frame of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than at another time when deadneſs and dulneſs takes hold of you.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>I cannot believe ſo, as to riſe to a full perſwaſion that I am juſtified, and ſhall be ſaved, though I can relie upon Chriſt as a poor Sinner for my Juſtification and Eternal Life.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Well, bleſs God for that Faith: for a full Aſſurance doth not appertain to the Eſſence of true Faith, but it is the higheſt degree of it; and no doubt many are gone to Heaven that never attained to that degree of true Faith.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I knew a Godly Miniſter who told me in his Sickneſs, a little before he died, All his Hopes were gone, he could not come to Chriſt as a Saint, his Evidences were ſo clouded; this he uttered with Tears, as I remember, and with no ſmall grief: He preſently broke forth, and ſaid, <hi>But, Brother, I can come to him as a poor, burdened, loſt and heavy-laden Sinner, and I am ſure he will not refuſe me,</hi> or to that purpoſe. If thou canſt do ſo, certainly great Peace will come in; it is from the weakneſs of our Faith that a ſtrong and full Perſwaſion is wanting: a direct Act of Faith I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded muſt needs bring in the greateſt Joy and Comfort; a looking for all the ſigns of true Grace in us, oft-times confounds a poor Chriſtian. If there is no Sin that thou doſt allow thy ſelf in, but doſt hate Sin as Sin, and loveſt Holineſs, and art willing to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt in all things according to thy Light, and loveſt all the Saints of God as ſuch, no doubt but thy State is good and ſafe.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. Take heed you do not look for a Righteouſneſs in your ſelves to recommend you to God, or to truſt in for Juſtification: Alſo know that it is not for the ſake of Chriſt's Merits, or for the ſake of his Righteouſneſs that we are juſtified, but that it is his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that is the Matter of our Juſtification alone before God,

                     <p n="1">1. Sinners, are you dead, <hi>dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes?</hi> Chriſt is come to quicken you; <hi>I am come that you might have Life:</hi> There <note place="margin">John 10. 10.</note> is in this Salvation Life for dead Sinners; Chriſt hath a certain Water to give, that whoſoever drinketh of it, though he be dead, yet he ſhall live; that Water is his Spirit, 'tis by that by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his Spirit into the dead Soul, that the Soul comes to be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: the Spirit of Chriſt is his quickning Voice; <hi>The Dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> Chriſt <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 25.</note> is our Life, not only as he purchaſed Life for us, but as he by his Spirit infuſes it in us. The Spirit is that Vital Principle in us; <hi>You hath he quickned, that were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins.</hi> And he puts <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 1.</note> forth his Almighty Power to do this, as the Apoſtle had declared to the Saints at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> juſt in the Verſes before in the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhewing to them that the ſame Power is put forth in raiſing us from a Death in Sin, (or in working Faith in our Souls) that was wrought in Chriſt when he was raiſed from he Dead; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid <hi>to be the exceeding Greatneſs of his Power to us-ward, who believe according to the working of his mighty Power,</hi> as before. Can <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 18, 19, 20.</note> any Man do this, can he raiſe himſelf? Dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> might quicken and raiſe himſelf as ſoon out of the Grave, as a dead Sinner can quicken himſelf, or believe of himſelf: no, Faith is God's Gift, and it is the vital Principle of our Souls. I wonder what ſome Men mean, when they ſay, Sinners muſt come up to the Rule of the Promiſe, before they lay hold of the Promiſe. Can they quicken themſelves? True, if they can, the Promiſe runs, <hi>Chriſt will give them Life.</hi> Get Life, create Life in your Souls, and lay hold of the Promiſe: ſtrange Notion! I am ſure Life muſt be firſt in the Soul, before the Soul can do any thing that is truly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually Good; before Life is infuſed, there is no motion towards God, let the Motives be what they will.</p>

Not that he had loſt his new Heart, but he would have God recover him from his Fall, and put him into a holy and ſpiritual Frame, which none but he that hath an almighty creating Power can do. And if we cannot quicken our ſelves from a State of ſpiritual Deadneſs, how ſhould poor Sinners raiſe themſelves from a State of ſpiritual Death?

                     <p n="4">(4.) A Portion for thy Soul, and a Portion that will laſt as long as thy Soul ſhall laſt, and that is for ever. Sirs, many have great worldly Portions, but they are ſometimes ſoon ſpent, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come poor and miſerable. Some alſo have great earthly Portions, bodily Portions, but have no Portion for their poor Souls: O get God to be your Portion, <hi>i. e.</hi> believe in Chriſt, receive by Faith this Salvation, and God is thy Portion, Chriſt is thy Portion.</p>

(5.) God is a preſent Portion, and alſo a future Portion; you may feed on this Portion: and the more you live on this Portion, the more you have.</p>
                     <p n="6">(6.) God is an infinite Portion, an inconceivable Portion; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is in God ſo far as it is communicable, or God ſeeth good to impart of himſelf to us, ſo much of God we ſhall have: what God i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, and what God has, is a Believer's.</p>
                     <p n="7">(7.) Sinner, a Portion thou muſt have, and God too to be thy Portion, or thou muſt periſh for ever. The loſs of God at firſt was the undoing of all Mankind, that was our ruin; nor can that Loſs be ever repaired until we have God again: an eternall loſs of God will be the Torment and Miſery of the Damned.</p>
                     <p n="8">(8.) The Reaſon why the Father ſent Jeſus Chriſt to work out this Salvation was, that we might have God to be our God: Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, God ſaith to every one of you that are Believers, as he ſaid to <hi>Abraham, Fear not,</hi> Abraham, <hi>I am thy Shield, and thy exceeding</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="9">(9.) Brethren, God in this Salvation breaks up (as I may ſay) the Fountain of the great Depths of his Divine Grace, Love and Goodneſs: The Paſſage was ſtop'd by our Sin, till Chriſt opened it by ſhedding his Blood; there was no other way whereby God might let out of himſelf in his Eternal Goodneſs to us, but this Way only, to the Glory of all his Divine Attributes.</p>
                     <p n="10">(10.) Hereby we have not only God to be our God, our Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but he is ſo reſtored to all that believe, that they ſhall never loſe him again for ever.</p>
                     <p n="11">(11.) Did we want a Surety, not only to pay our Debts, but alſo to ſecure us in a State of Grace, and to preſerve all our Riches for us; this Salvation provides ſuch a glorious Surety for us: Alas, we are like poor Orphans under Age whilſt in this World, and are not able nor fit to be intruſted with what is our own, I mean, to have it in our own Hands; therefore we and all our Riches are put into the Hand of Chriſt, to keep and improve our Riches for us, and to give of it forth to us as he in his Wiſdom ſees beſt for us. They that ſlight this Salvation, ſlight this Portion, this God, and all true Happineſs in him: in this Salvation, this Portion is offered to you Sinners, God is willing to be your God, your Friend, your Father and Portion for ever. Here is God in this
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:59949:221"/>
Salvation, Chriſt in this Salvation, the Holy Spirit in this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; God, and all the Fulneſs of God; Chriſt, and all the Riches of Chriſt; the Holy Spirit, and all the Graces and Bleſſings of the Spirit: the <hi>Pearl of great Price</hi> is thine, if thou haſt a Part and Intereſt in this Salvation. Here is the Spirit to quicken thee, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new thee, to ſanctify thee, to ſtrengthen thee, to comfort thee; here is Grace to deck and adorn thee, rich Robes to cover thee, the Promiſes to chear thee, feed and ſupport thee, the Ordinances to feaſt thee, and Angels to guard, protect and preſerve thee. O what a full, compleat and comprehenſible Salvation, Brethren, is the Salvation of the Goſpel!</p>
                     <p n="23">23. And laſtly, here is Heaven in this Salvation, Heaven, and all the Glory of it; here is a Kingdom in this Salvation, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory, of Light, of Joy and Pleaſure; here is a Crown that fadeth not away, in this Salvation, a Crown and Kingdom for every Chriſtian; therefore this Salvation is great and glorious.</p>

Now I will try them: as if God ſhould ſay, they may know the Matter is of great Moment, and I am in good Earneſt, and look for Fruit from them. Sirs, Jeſus Chriſt, by Calling or Office, when he was upon the Earth, was a Miniſter, a Preacher: O what great Condeſcenſion was this in him, who is the true and eternal God! and what an honourable Employment is this! What a high and ſublime Office is the Office of a Goſpel-Miniſter! With what Trembling and Fear ought it to be undertaken! <hi>I come not to be</hi>

But O how great is this Salvation, that God ſhould pleaſe to ſend his own Son to preach and publiſh this Salvation! Brethren, ſhould a King lay aſide his Crown, and throw off his Princely Robes, and come into the Pulpit and preach the Goſpel, would not all wonder at it, and flock to hear him? <hi>David</hi> was a King, and yet a Preacher; <hi>Solomon</hi> was a King, a mighty King, and yet a Preacher: but what poor and igneble, low-born Kings, nay, baſe-born Kings, were they to this King, who <hi>is the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords?</hi> Certainly this is Matter of higheſt Concernment, or of greateſt Moment of all things in the World, and before all things to be regarded. Did Chriſt in Perſon ſpeak from Heaven to Men on Earth, and make known to them this Salvation? Moreover, he ſpeaks ſtill, he it is that ſpeaks to you now, Day by Day, by us his poor Miniſters, who may be you are ready to ſlight and deſpiſe in your Hearts; yet know Chriſt's faithful Miniſters perſonate him, they are his Ambaſſadors, they repreſent the very Perſon of Chriſt: <hi>Now then we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us,</hi>

Moreover, the Eſteem and Honour that is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an Ambaſſador in receiving his Word, or in hearkening with awe and reſpect to what he ſays in his Maſter's Name, is ſhewn to the King.

                        <pb n="434" facs="tcp:59949:224"/>
                        <hi>things the Angels deſire to look into.</hi> They look into it with the greateſt diligence, do, as it were, bow down <hi>to pry into it;</hi> they ſtand, as it were, aſtoniſhed to ſee the Son of God in Fleſh, or having taken Man's Nature upon him; he that is their mighty Lord and Soveraign, to abaſe himſelf to ſuch a degree, and to die the ſhameful Death of the Croſs, to work out Salvation for ſuch vile and rebellious Creatures as Mankind are: 'Tis ſaid, <hi>He was ſeen of Angels.</hi> The Angels knew of Chriſt's coming, no doubt, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> long before he was manifeſt in the Fleſh. The Angel told <hi>Daniel</hi> of the <hi>ſeventy Weeks,</hi> and of the cutting off of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and the Angels alſo brought the firſt News of his Incarnation and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity: but nevertheleſs with what Wonderment was he ſeen of the Angels! The natural Knowledg of the Angels which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not, no doubt is great; but they have alſo an experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Knowledg, they learn of the Church <hi>the manifold Wiſdom of God.</hi> They were likewiſe Witneſſes of our Saviour's Reſurrection, <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 10.</note> and miniſtred to him in his <hi>bloody Agony:</hi> Lo the Salvation of our Souls doth not a little affect the Holy Angels; they ſee God's Love is more to Mankind, than it was to thoſe Creatures of their own Nature that fell, I mean, the Evil Angels. O, my Brethren, ſhall the Angels look into this Salvation, whom it concerned not as it doth us, (they did not need a Saviour to redeem them) and ſhall not we look into it, pry into it, and be affected therewithal? Shall all in Heaven contemplate it, and not we? Is it ſo great, ſo glorious, and ſhall we not mind it above all things?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifteenthly,</hi> It is great Salvation, becauſe it is a free Salvation, it <note place="margin">Goſpel-Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe it is a free Salvation.</note> is all of Grace; <hi>You may have it,</hi> Sinners, <hi>without Money, and without Price,</hi> Iſa. 55. 1. True, ſome things you muſt part with, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are, that will have a part in this Salvation: But what is that? Nothing of any Worth, nothing that will do you any good: You muſt part with your Sins, with your filthy Luſts, with the Love of this World. Chriſt came <hi>to ſave his People from their Sins;</hi> not in their Sins, no, no. They that will not part with their Iniquities, with their carnal and ſinful Pleaſures, Profits and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, are never like to have any Part or Lot in this Matter: Nay, and they muſt part with all their own Righteouſneſs too, I mean, in point of Truſt and Dependance, and muſt ſee that they have nothing which can recommend them to God, nothing that can juſtify them in the ſight of God; unleſs a Man denies himſelf in all theſe Reſpects, he cannot be Chriſt's Diſciple. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:59949:224"/>
this, yet the Salvation of the Goſpel is free; the worſt of Sinners have an Offer of it, they whoſe Sins are as <hi>red as Scarlet,</hi> or as <hi>red as Crimſon;</hi> here is <hi>Wine and Milk without Money,</hi> or any <note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 1, 2.</note> thing the Creature hath to purchaſe it, or to give for it: it is not to be had for the ſake of any thing done by us, or can be done by us, or wrought in us. Sinners, the <hi>Water of Life is freely</hi> tendred to <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 17.</note> every one that thirſteth, nay to every one that <hi>will,</hi> that has a Will inclined to accept it; if it could not be had unleſs we firſt cleanſed our ſelves from our Sins, or made us a new Heart, it would not be free or alone of Grace, nor to be had on eaſy Terms, nay not at all: But you have heard that a new Heart is one part of this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, 'tis contained in it; and thoſe that would be waſhed, muſt come to the Fountain of Salvation, they muſt come to Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, or by Faith apply his Blood to waſh and cleanſe their polluted Souls.</p>
                     <p>Brethren, if there was a Salvation for rich Men only, what would become of the Poor? But this Salvation is offered unto the Poor as well as unto the Rich; nay, and they chiefly indeed do receive it, as our Saviour teſtifies. And if it was a Salvation for Righteous Men only, what would become of ungodly Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? But remember, this Salvation is only for Sinners, I mean, ſuch that ſee their Sin, and know the want of a Saviour; <hi>Chriſt came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance.</hi>

                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Such who do not think upon this Salvation, they do neglect it: Some do not regard it at all, it is not in their Minds; they do not trouble their Thoughts about it, though it be ſo great. That which a Perſon thinks not of, let it be Matter of never ſo great Moment, be ſure he doth neglect. Have you, ſaith a Man to his Friend, done that Buſineſs I deſired of you? No truly, ſaith he, I never thought of it; this diſcovers he hath neglected it: So it is here in reſpect of this great Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such neglect the Goſpel Salvation, who do not ſtudy it, pry into it, and labour to find out the great Myſteries that lie hid in it. As he that is put out an <hi>Apprentice,</hi> to learn ſome curious Art or Trade, that never ſtudies the Matter, or pries not into the Myſteries thereof, neglects his Trade: So they who do not ſtudy
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:59949:225"/>
the Goſpel, and the Myſteries of Chriſt crucified, do neglect the great Salvation thereof. <hi>Paul</hi> determined to know nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Learned <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but Jeſus Chriſt and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; this ſhews he did not neglect the Salvation of his own and <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 1.</note> other Mens Souls. <hi>Without controverſy, great is the Mystery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> 'Tis not eaſy to underſtand the Goſpel, it is ſo great a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; if it were only a Law, with Promiſes annexed to thoſe who lived up in Obedience to the Precepts of it, and Threats to ſuch who were diſobedient to its Precepts, it would not be a Myſtery; nor would the <hi>Learned Greeks</hi> have counted the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch a Goſpel to be Fooliſhneſs; for ſuch a Goſpel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports with Man's Carnal Reaſon and with Natural Religion: But to preach Salvation by a Man that was <hi>hanged on a Tree,</hi> or by a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Saviour, that is a Myſtery. And hence it was contemned by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they could not underſtand how they could be juſtified by another's Righteouſneſs, or that Chriſt could ſatisfy for their Sins; or how our Sins could be made his, that his Righteouſneſs ſhould be made ours; this is a Myſtery, and this Myſtery ſome People do not, will not ſtudy, and ſo neglect this Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Such neglect it, that will not hear the Goſpel preached, but either lie at Home, or walk in the Fields, or content themſelves to hear Morality or good Manners only preached, which is all the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation too many preach in ſome Places: they think they need not trouble themſelves about any other Matters of Religion, but only <hi>to do to others as they would be done unto;</hi> or to live ſober Lives, and to do juſtly: This is good, and it is in a right manner held forth in the Goſpel, and preach'd by ſuch that preach this Salvation: But if this were all, in vain was it that God ſent his Son into the World; nay, if Morality could ſave Mens Souls, or any Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Creature, or inherent Holineſs, Chriſt is dead in vain. Theſe Men know not what the Goſpel is; and thoſe who preach no other Goſpel than Morality do but go about to make the People good Heathens; for what is this, but the Religion of the Heathen Philoſophers?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Such alſo neglect this Salvation, who though they come to hear Chriſt preach'd, yet only come out of Formality, Cuſtom or Curioſity, or to divert themſelves; having little elſe to do, they will go and hear what ſuch or ſuch a Man will ſay, it is not to be inſtructed in the Myſteries of Salvation: nay, may be ſome of them may come with a Deſign to catch up things to improve to the Reproach of the Miniſter. Now be ſure theſe Perſons
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:59949:226"/>
are ſuch who neglect the Salvation of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Such likewiſe who are careleſs Hearers, who hear as if the things preached did not concern them, or that ſleep under the Word, theſe alſo neglect this Salvation. I have heard of one that would go to the Place of Worſhip, becauſe ſhe could ſleep ſooner and better there than at Home; and no wonder, ſince the Devil rocks the Cradle, (as I may ſay) or hath ſuch Influence upon them, and makes them comply with his Temptations: and you ſhall have help, no doubt, as ſome who have hanged themſelves; it has been obſerved to be ſtrange how they could do it after ſuch a manner: alas, Satan helped them, he knows how to tie the Rope, and to choak them too, when they enter upon this Work. Perhaps ſome ſhall have their Thoughts in a wanton manner, run out after this or the other Object they have before their Eyes, when with Holy Diligence they ſhould attend upon the Word of this Salvation to the profit of their Souls; or elſe have their Hearts and Thoughts run out upon their worldly Affairs; ſome on their Riches, Trades, and how to order their Buſineſs the Week following, and others upon their Poverty. All theſe I muſt ſet down as Neglecters of this Great Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Such who ſlight or neglect the Convictions of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, or that ſtrive to ſtifle their Convictions, whilſt under the Word, or when gone from hearing it, like as <hi>Felix</hi> did when he ſent <hi>Paul</hi> away; the Fire the Word had kindled in his Conſcience, being too hot for him to bear.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Such who comply not with the Call of the Word, and Offers of this great Salvation, but reſiſt and quench the Motions of the Spirit, out of love to their Luſts, and ſo reject the Word, like them of old; <hi>Lo they reject the Word of the Lord, and what Wiſdom</hi>

                     <p n="8">8. Such who regard not the Time, the Day and proper Seaſon of this Salvation, do neglect it: <hi>Behold, now is the accepted Time; behold, now is the Day of Salvation.</hi> But this is not their Time, they <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 1, 2.</note> delay the great Matters of their Souls, God's Time is not their Time: <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near,</hi> ſaith the Prophet. But they will not do this, they <note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 5, 6.</note> think it is too ſoon, they reſolve to take more of the ſweet of Sin, and feed on the Vanities of the World a little longer. God calls
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:59949:226"/>
now, whilſt it is to Day, <hi>To Day if you will hear his Voice;</hi> but they will not regard it: <hi>Becauſe I have called,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and</hi>

                        <hi>you refuſed, I have ſtretched out my Hand, and no Man regarded.—But ye have ſet at nought all my Counſel, and would have none of my Reproof;—I alſo will laugh at your Calamity, and mock when your Fear cometh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. Such who prefer their ſinful and earthly Pleaſures, Profits and Honours, above this Salvation, do alſo neglect it: 'Tis ſaid of ſome of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that <hi>they believed on him, but did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the Synagogue; for they loved</hi>

                        <hi>the Praiſe of Men more than the Praiſe of God.</hi> I once told you of a Man who living a looſe and ungodly Life, and was by that means in danger of loſing his Eye-ſight, inſomuch that his Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian told him, He muſt leave that exceſs of Prophaneneſs, or he would be blind; <hi>Ah,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is it ſo? Then farewel my ſweet Eye-ſight,</hi> or to that Effect. Juſt thus do many poor Sinners, they will not part with their Sins, their ſinful Ways, and ſinful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; for when they hear what they muſt do if ever they are ſaved, namely, believe in Jeſus Chriſt, repent and turn from all their ſinful Courſes, they ſay in their Hearts, Farewel then <hi>Great Salvation;</hi> if theſe things muſt be done, they will have none of it. I remember I heard in our Countrey, when I was young, of <hi>a prophane Perſon,</hi> that ſaid in plain words, <hi>That he would have his Luſts, his Pleaſures, his merry Bouts,</hi> or to that purpoſe, <hi>for it was all the Heaven he look'd for.</hi> O how juſt will it be in God to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſuch to eternal Flames!</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Such neglect this Salvation, <hi>who ſay in their Hearts to God, Depart from us, we deſire not the Knowledg of thy Ways:</hi> They like <note place="margin">Job 21. 24.</note> not, approve not of God, nor of the Ways of God, therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to depart; they would not have God come ſo near them, as to diſturb their Thoughts, nor diſquiet their Spirits about their eternal State, therefore they ſtrive to divert themſelves. <hi>The Wicked</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>through the Pride of his Countenance will not ſeek after God; God is not in all his thoughts:</hi> he will not trouble <note place="margin">Pſal. 10. 4.</note> himſelf with God, and the things of God, and ſo neglects this Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Moreover, all ſuch who believe not, give not credit to the Revelation of the Goſpel, they do not believe the Report of it; <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Who hath believed our Report?</hi> Though the Report of the Goſpel is given out upon the higheſt Evidence <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 1.</note> imaginable, yet, Brethren, there is an humane Faith that a Man may
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:59949:227"/>
attain to and exerciſe without Divine and Supernatural Grace, which Men do not exert; which if they did, it would (were it impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) deter them, and put a ſtop to many of their abominable Practices: but as ſome in other caſes ſay, I will not believe ſuch or ſuch a thing, though it is confirmed ſufficiently; ſo it is here, Men will not believe, they will not give Credit to the Report of the Goſpel, it is not agreeable to their carnal Reaſon: What! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is no Salvation but by the Righteouſneſs of another? How can this be? Can his Righteouſneſs juſtify me, be made mine? I believe that if I do live an Honeſt Life, and do good to my Neighbours, I ſhall be ſaved. Says another, I can't believe that all ſhall be damned unleſs they are born again, and experience ſuch a Change as ſome Miniſters talk of; for if it be ſo, Lord have Mercy upon us, what will become of the greateſt part of the World? Says a third ſort, God is above the Devil, and I cannot believe he will ever ſuffer Satan to get away the greateſt Number of Mankind. Ay ſays a fourth ſort, we can't believe that Sin is ſo great an Evil, or ſo great a Matter, or that God will be ſo ſevere as to caſt us into Hell for it: What's Drunkenneſs? 'Tis for our Health to be drunk now and then: and what is ſimple Fornication? Tuſh, will God think you ever caſt us into Hell for ſuch ſmall things as theſe, or throw us into a Furnace of Fire? It cannot conſiſt with his Mercy and infinite Goodneſs. Now, Brethren, as all theſe Perſons neglect this Salvation, ſo they make God a Liar: God hath ſaid, <hi>There is no other Name given under Heaven whereby</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 4. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>we muſt be ſaved;</hi> no other way but through Chriſt's Blood, by his Merits and Righteouſneſs: but they ſay there is. He alſo hath ſaid, <hi>That the Wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>

                        <hi>Heaven;</hi> but they will not believe it. O what is the Condition of theſe Men, Unbelief is the damning Sin in this reſpect, as well as it is in reſpect that it leads Men out to refuſe and contemn the Remedy God hath appointed, I mean, the Application of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. Theſe periſh as the Man did, who was told of his Danger, but would not believe it till it fell upon him to his Ruin.</p>

But they have no regard of this great Concernment, it is not weighed, nor thought upon by them: yet what can be of like Importance; and what Fools are they, whoſe chiefeſt Care is to live well for one Day, and regard not what will become of them afterwards? Alas, what do the greateſt part of Mankind more than provide for one Day! Nay, ſhould the whole Time of our natural Lives be ſeventy Years, it is not as one Hour to Eternity.

                     <p n="1">1. Some are ignorant of the Way of Salvation, and from hence neglect this Goſpel-Salvation: Thus it was with the Jews; <hi>For they being ignorant of God's Righteouſneſs, went about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 10. 3. Suppoſe a Man that is ſick were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make uſe of ſuch or ſuch a Medicine to cure him of his Diſeaſe, which he is told the Nature of, and that it is an infallible Potion; yet if he knows not how to apply it, he underſtands not
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:59949:229"/>
that: why now from thence he utterly neglects to make uſe of it at all, but ſeeks ſome other way of Cure. Even ſo it is here, many hear of Chriſt, and Salvation by him, but underſtand not how to apply his Blood, how to fly to his Merits and Righteouſneſs, and therefore ſeek to be ſaved ſome other way, and ſo neglect the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Jeſus Chriſt. Or ſuppoſe that a Man who is going a long Journey, yet he knows not the Way, but thinks he is right, and ſo rides on boldly, but goes the quite contrary Way, now he neglects the right Way through Ignorance: even ſo it is with many blind and deceived Mortals, they think they have the right and proper Medicine, or are in the right Way to Heaven; and they go confidently on, take their own Courſes, apply their own Antidote, when alas it is a Counterfeit.</p>
                     <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> May be think that is Chriſt and the true Saviour, which is nothing but the Dictates of natural Conſcience. Some ſuppoſe the Light of Nature, or a ſober and moral Life, will bring them to Heaven, and eternally ſave their Souls.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Others conclude, their being Proteſtants, and born of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Parents, and owning the Chriſtian Religion, is ſufficient, and that they need not trouble themſelves any further about their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Mankind generally ſee not, know not that they are born in Sin, and by Nature are Children of Wrath; they know not that they are under the Curſe of the Law, and under the Sentence of Eternal Death, being Enemies to God, and having Enmity in their Carnal Mind againſt God, and great Mountains of Guilt lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: I ſay, thus it is with them, but they know it not. It is with them as it was with the Church of the <hi>Laodiceans; Becauſe thou ſayeſt I am Rich, and increaſed in Goods, and have need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>

                     <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> Some conclude they believe, and have true Grace; they make a profeſſion of the Goſpel, and have been baptized, having great Gifts and Parts; and yet for all this never were effectually changed, never obtained the Faith of God's Elect, but through Ignorance they are perſwaded all is well with them, and ſo they

                     <p n="1">
                        <note place="margin">From whence Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Blindneſs of Men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</note>(1.) Chiefly it ariſes from that natural Darkneſs that is in them, and which naturally cleaves to all Mankind; Sin has put out the Eyes of our Underſtanding. But,</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) It may alſo ariſe partly from the Ignorance of thoſe blind Guides, whoſe Teachings and Doctrine they may (I mean, ſome of them) ſit under; <hi>My People are deſtroyed for lack of Knowledg:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hoſ. 4. 6.</note> and the Cauſe was, thoſe that taught them cauſed them to err. <hi>If the Blind lead the Blind, they will both fall into the Ditch.</hi> O take heed under what Miniſtry you venture your Souls: The Phariſees and Scribes were learned Men, and ſome of them great Preachers, but wholly ignorant of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Jeſus Chriſt: Many, like the falſe Teachers of old, <hi>Cry, Peace, Peace, when there is no Peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) Moreover, this Ignorance ariſes partly from Satan, he hath too great an Influence on the Hearts and dark Minds of Men; <hi>But if our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt: In whom the God</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 3, 4.</note> 
                        <hi>of this World hath blinded the Eyes of thoſe that believe not, leſt the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi> Satan hath a mighty Power over ſinful Men, by his cunning Devices, to keep them in Ignorance, and to hinder them from ſtudying, knowing, and believing the Goſpel, and by this Means they neglect this Salvation: Such are blinded by Satan that believe not; he may perſwade them that a general Faith, or a common Faith, is <hi>true Faith,</hi> and ſufficient, and ſo he cheats them with a Counterfeit inſtead of ſaving Faith: or Satan blinds Mens Eyes by moving them to ſeek Salvation in ſome other way, than by Chriſt alone, and by believing in him, reſting, relying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on him; like an evil Perſon who puts a poor Traveller out of his way, or directs him the direct contrary way, that ſo he may be robbed and murdered by him, and by other Thieves that may <hi>way-lay him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Some neglect the Salvation of the Goſpel, from that inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Love they have to the things of this World: Thus the <hi>young Man</hi> that came running to Chriſt neglected it, he had his Heart ſo ſet upon his great Poſſeſſions, that he went away from our Saviour ſorrowful, and refuſed the Salvation of his own Soul; he could not part with the World for a Part in Chriſt and Eternal Life. So they that were invited to the Marriage-Supper, out of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:59949:230"/>
Love to the things of the World, refuſed to come: <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King, which made a Marriage</hi>

                           <hi>Ver.</hi> 5.</note> is this great Salvation; but the things of the World are more valued by moſt People than the Salvation of their Souls: <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>And he ſent forth his Servants at Supper-time, to ſay to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luke 14. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>them that were bidden, Come, for all things are now ready.</hi> Many Perſons refuſe to feed on Chriſt,, they believe not, will not eat of this Supper, will not feed on a crucified Chriſt, or eat his Fleſh, and drink his Blood by Faith, through Love to their carnal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Honours, and worldly Profits. <hi>And they all began with one conſent to make excuſe: The firſt ſaid unto him, I have bought a Piece of Ground, and I muſt needs go and ſee it; I pray thee have me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.</hi>

                        <hi>And another ſaid, I have bought five Yoke of Oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me excuſed. Another ſaid, I have married a Wife, and therefore I cannot come.</hi> Lawful things may be abuſed, and the Heart ſo ſet upon them, that they drown Men in Perdition and Deſtruction: Mens Hearts naturally are earthly and ſenſual; and as they know not, ſo they deſire not the Knowledg of God and Jeſus Chriſt, they are ſatisfied with that Portion they have, this World is for them; they care not, regard not the things of another Life.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Some neglect this Salvation, out of Love to unlawful things: They will feed on forbidden Fruit, I mean, on their filthy Luſts; they will <hi>ſwear, ſteal, whore,</hi> be <hi>drunk, grind the Face of the Poor, deal unjuſtly,</hi> give way to <hi>Pride,</hi> &amp;c. and from hence neglect the Salvation of their Souls. I was lately told of a gracious Woman living near this City, whoſe Daughter wore a very high Head-dreſs, or that ſhameful Mode now in faſhion, which ſo grieved the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſhe gave her a rich Ring, upon condition ſhe would leave off that Dreſs, or Top-knots: Her Daughter took the Ring, and conformed for a while to her Mother's juſt Deſire; but it was not long before ſhe gave her the Ring again, and repented of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and got on her old Dreſſes again. Alas, ſome will not leave off and forſake their Luſts for Chains of Gold; they will live in their Sins, perſiſt on in their ungodly Courſes; let what will come, they matter not who they grieve: they prefer their cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Luſts and Pleaſures above this Salvation, though it be ſo great, as you have heard.</p>

                        <pb n="447" facs="tcp:59949:230"/>
4. Moreover, ſome neglect Salvation, becauſe there is a Croſs joined to the Crown; they muſt take Chriſt's Yoke upon them, and be expoſed to Reproach for his ſake, and this they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, the Yoke is uneaſy to the Fleſh, the Fleſh cannot bear it. No, it is only eaſy to ſuch whoſe Hearts are renewed, who have got a new Nature. The Croſs makes many loſe the Crown; but, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, had Jeſus Chriſt refuſed the Croſs, where had we been?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Some Perſons neglect Salvation, through the treachery and deceitfulneſs of their own Hearts: 'Tis ſlighted out of an Opinion or Perſwaſion, that all is well with them; <hi>They believe in Chriſt, hope in God's Mercy:</hi> Chriſt, ſay they, died for Sinners. And thus the Devil, and their own deceived Hearts, cauſe them to neglect ſeeking out after the ſaving Knowledg of Chriſt and Salvation by him on Goſpel-Terms; for Sin predominates in them, reigns in them, notwithſtanding all their Hopes and Confidence. What ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies ſuch Faith that does not purify the Heart and Life, or ſuch Hope? Alas, it will be but like the <hi>Spider's Web,</hi> vain Thoughts reſt in thoſe, and deſtroy them; vain in their Riſe, vain as to the Ground they build their Hopes upon; a vain Bottom, vain as to the Motive: and vain as to the Fruit or Product thereof; they think they have hold of Salvation, yet are dropping into Hell.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Some neglect the Salvation of the Goſpel, partly out of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile and ſlaviſh Fear, and partly out of pretended Modeſty; they dare not be ſo bold to take hold of Chriſt, or venture their Souls on Chriſt, becauſe they are ſo vile, filthy, and abominable, unleſs they had ſomething to bring, ſomething to preſent to Chriſt, to render them acceptable or welcome to him; they will not come, they pretend they dare not come, they can't think ſo great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be beſtow'd freely on ſuch as they are: if they could be rid of their Sins, or waſh themſelves from their Sins, then they would come; or could they get themſelves ſome new Clothes, make themſelves a new Heart, or get ſome inherent Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own, then they would come. Sad Caſe! but it is no wonder ſome are carried away with this Deluſion, conſidering what a kind of Doctrine is preached in theſe perilous Times. But, Sinner, know thou muſt come to Chriſt to be waſhed, come as one that ſees what need thou haſt to be put into the Fountain, which is ſet open for Sin and Uncleanneſs; and come as one naked, that Chriſt may clothe thee. Chriſt calls Sinners to him; may be you will ſay, What is it to come to Chriſt? Why, to believe in him, to lay hold by Faith upon him: And if thou doſt thus, though
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:59949:231"/>
thou art never ſo great a Sinner, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Others neglect Goſpel-Salvation out of <hi>Idleneſs</hi> and curſed Sloth: 'Tis a hard thing to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, Self-denial <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 13, 14.</note> is of abſolute neceſſity. O but this is too difficult for this ſort, they can't <hi>pray, read, meditate;</hi> they don't love to hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, they do not care to put themſelves upon Spiritual Duties, as to ſeek the Kingdom of Heaven, nay, and to take it <hi>by Violence;</hi> they can take pains to damn their own Souls, but cannot, will not take that pains they are enabled to do to ſave their Souls. Sirs, Men will not be condemned for not doing that which they had not Power to do, but for neglecting that which they might have done; their Deſtruction is of themſelves, though their Salvation is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God, and of the free Grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt: Have not Men Power to leave all groſs Acts of Wickedneſs, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the Means of Salvation? They who ſay we put the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do nothing, falſly charge us; we preſs Men to leave their wicked Practices upon a right foot of Account, and to wait upon God in his Bleſſed Ordinances, which he has appointed for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of Faith. True, we ſay a Man can't change his own Heart, yet he may leave the groſs Acts of Sin; 'tis one thing to have the Life reformed, and another to have the Heart renewed: 'Tis the changing the vicious Habits, or the Work of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we ſay muſt be done by God's Almighty Power; Grace muſt be infuſed into the Soul, which works <hi>phyſically.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. Moreover, it is through Pride in ſome that they neglect this great Salvation; they have ſuch a good Opinion of their own Righteouſneſs, they cannot ſee they have any need of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt: they are ſuch that our Saviour ſpeaks of; <hi>And he ſpoke a Parable unto certain which truſted in themſelves that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 18. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>they were Righteous, and deſpiſed others.</hi> Theſe are ſo conceited of themſelves, that through pride of what they have got of their own they regard not an imputed Righteouſneſs to juſtify them; Man naturally affecteth to ſtand by a Righteouſneſs of his own. <hi>Adam</hi> was a rich Man, a noble Man, he had enough of his own to live upon; and his Sons retain a proud Spirit, like ſome Sons of a decayed Gentleman: their Father was a Knight, a Lord, and they are great in their own Conceit, (though their Cloak perhaps is nothing but Patches) they ſcorn to beg, or to dig, no they will ſooner ſteal, and ſtand on the High-way.

in their Salvation, by ſeeking it ſome other Way, even in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Way; this is no better than a ſpiritual robbing Jeſus Chriſt of having the whole Glory and Honour of the Salvation of the Soul: and yet they do not enrich themſelves hereby neither, it is but only in conceit; they fancy themſelves rich, and truſt in their own Righteouſneſs, as if it were choice Treaſure, when it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but filthy Rags which they pride themſelves in and boaſt of.</p>

Some are like a poor ignorant Wretch that I heard of, who being lately ſick, and a Chriſtian Neighbour being ſent for to come to him, he asked him ſome Queſtions about his Soul, who replied, that he had been a Sinner; but if God ſpared him, he hop'd to make God amends for all. Some ſin, and commit horrid Evils in the Day, and then pray at Night, and confeſs their Sins; and may be drop a few Tears, and that they think cures all, and makes them as ſound again as a Fiſh, and ſo go on the next Day in their old trade of ſinning as briskly as before. Some have a humane Faith, an hiſtorical Faith, and from thence do many things, though they do not live up to that Faith neither, nor improve what Knowledg and Light they have received to that degree they ought, and ſo ſhall be condemned, like as was the Man that improved not his one Talent. I call it a humane Faith, becauſe it is the Act of the Creature, by virtue of his natural Powers and Capacity: the Spring and Motive of their Faith is Humane, therefore their Faith cannot be Divine.</p>

Come, let us ſlight all thoſe Arguments he uſes to win us over to him, yea, ſpurn at them, and diſregard all the Hopes and Fears theſe Cords would put us into, could they get us under their Power. What are all theſe things but Fancies, vain Dreams? Tuſh, our State is good enough, we can repent hereafter: What is the Goſpel but to <hi>do as we would be done unto?</hi> Let us not trouble our Heads with any other Notions of Religion. And thus they ſlight and caſt contempt upon the infinite Wiſdom of God, who found out and contrived this way of Salvation, and by which <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>his manifold Wiſdom</hi> is revealed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They alſo who neglect and ſlight the Salvation of the Goſpel, do caſt Contempt upon the higheſt Goodneſs, Love and Mercy that was ever ſhewed to Man: <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him might not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life.</hi> Love, to the wonderment of Men <note place="margin">John 3. 16.</note> and Angels! Shall ſuch a Marriage be offered by the great King, ſuch a Banquet be prepared that coſt ſo much, and ſhall any make light of it, and deſpiſe Infinite Goodneſs for the ſake of their own filthy Luſts, and think they may be ſaved ſome other Way? They thereby render the Holy God cruel to his own Son, in his giving him up to die, and to become a Sacrifice for Sin.</p>
                     <p>Brethren, if Salvation be neglected, it is either out of Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Deſpair.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) Now ſuch that preſumptuouſly neglect it, ſeem to magnify God's Mercy in their own Conceit, being wholly ignorant of his Juſtice and Holineſs, and ſo ſlight the conſtituted Method of his declared Goodneſs in Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo whilſt they ſeem to magnify God's Mercy, they impair, nay contemn his Soveraignty, by chuſing and preſcribing other Ways of God's communicating of himſelf to his Creatures, than what he in his Eternal Counſel fixed upon, and found out.</p>

                        <pb n="455" facs="tcp:59949:234"/>
(2.) If it be neglected through Deſpair, they caſt Contempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt's Blood, as if there was not a Sufficiency in it to cleanſe and ſave them from their Sins; and not only ſo, but alſo render God not to be believed, who hath ſaid, <hi>There is Life in his Son, and whoſoever believes in him ſhall not periſh.</hi> Therefore Deſpair makes God a Liar, as it is a high degree of Unbelief: Moreover, it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders God to be cruel to his Creatures; for though they fall down at his Feet, and humble themſelves, yet the Voice of Deſpair is, God is only an angry Judg, and clothed with nothing but Wrath and Fury. Nay, and it caſteth a diſparagement upon the Power and Sufficiency of God to ſave when he appears in his full united Strength, for ſo he does manifeſt himſelf in Jeſus Chriſt. And hereby ſuch ſeem to intimate, as if a multitude of Sins could throw God's Mercy into the Depths of the Sea, inſtead of Mercy's caſting our Sins therein, notwithſtanding Juſtice hath received a full Satisfaction for them by the Hands of our Bleſſed Saviour and Surety.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From hence it appears that they who neglect this Salvation through Unbelief, do caſt alſo Contempt upon God's Power to ſave, rendering him unable to do it by his right Hand, even by Jeſus Chriſt: Man is very apt to queſtion God's Power, like them of old; <hi>Can God ſpread a Table in the Wilderneſs?</hi> All Diſtruſts ariſe from Fears and Jealouſy, either of the Strength, or elſe of the Faithfulneſs and Juſtice of the Object addreſſed unto in a Time of Diſtreſs; that either the Perſon is weak and unable to help, or elſe diſhoneſt and unjuſt; and though he hath promiſed to ſave, to help, yet he will not. Even ſo it is here, all they that neglect the Salvation of the Goſpel, from Unbelief and deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Thoughts, either ſeem to ſtrip God and Jeſus Chriſt of his Power to ſave, or elſe of his Truth and Faithfulneſs, who hath ſaid, <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved, all ye Ends of the Earth.</hi> And again, <hi>He that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> A convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <note place="margin">Iſa. 45. 22. Joh. 6. 37.</note> Sinner, before he comes to Chriſt (nay and ſometimes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards too when under Temptation) is apt to ſay, Can God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my Sins? Can God remit my Sins that are ſo great? Pray take notice of two Texts of Scripture, the one reſpects ſuch Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that are not awakened, and ſo ſeem to preſume; the other refers to convinced and awakened Sinners who ſeem to deſpair, and yet go on in their Sins.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) Iſa. 57. 10. <hi>Thou art wearied in the greatneſs of thy Way; yet ſayeſt thou not, There is no Hope?</hi> Thou goeſt on in thy unjuſt and

ſinful Ways, till thou haſt even wearied thy ſelf, as if the Lord ſhould ſay, and yet thinkeſt thy State good, wilt not ſay there is no Hope; but contrariwiſe thou haſt Hope, and doſt conclude all is well: theſe are bold preſumptuous Sinners.</p>
                     <p>Compare this Text with that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>But thou ſayeſt, There is no Hope; No, for I have loved Strangers, and after them I will go.</hi> We are very vile, our Conſciences reprove us, convince us of our abominable Evils, but there is no Hope, God will not pardon us, nor take us into his Favour; therefore we will go on in our own Ways, and take our ſwing: Theſe were aſhamed of their doings, as the next Verſe ſhews, and yet not ſo aſhamed as to leave their Sins and Doings, and to return to the Lord, but doubted of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Grace. We ſee, ſay ſome, there's no ground of Hope, there is no help for ſuch as we, our Hearts are ſo hard, Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo ſtrong in us, there is no Salvation for us; we will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take our Courſe, cleave to our Sins and Lovers, and to our old Companions; we will even follow our Trades, and purſue the World, and ſatisfy our Luſts with Pleaſures. Deſpair ſometimes makes Perſons deſperate; others of this ſort grow melancholy, and ready, through Satan's Temptations, to lay violent Hands on themſelves, when it prevails far upon them.

                        <hi>themſelves to the Righteouſneſs of God:</hi> they magnified their Wills <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3.</note> above the Will of God, liked not of that way of Salvation that he in his Eternal Counſel fixed upon; they will be ſaved by their own Righteouſneſs; that which God accounts but as filthy Rags, they eſteem as a choice Robe. Suppoſe, <hi>Brethren,</hi> there was ſome other Way to be ſaved than by Chriſt, yet is it not meet that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comply with the Will of his Creator? Shall he rebel againſt his Soveraign? Were there two ways to ſuch or ſuch a City, one by Sea, and the other by Land, and a Prince commands his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to go by Sea, and not by Land, ſhall he attempt to go by Land, and ſo croſs his Maſter's Will, and violate his expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? But it is not ſo here, there is but one Way of Salvation; <hi>There is no other Name given under Heaven:</hi> therefore ſuch muſt <note place="margin">Acts 4. 12.</note> needs be more inexcuſable, who neglect this Way, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition dangerous; for let them think what they will, damned they will be at laſt, whoever they are that neglect this Salvation. But more of that hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Thoſe that neglect the Salvation of the Goſpel, do ſlight and caſt Contempt on Jeſus Chriſt; they ſeem to undervalue all that he has done: certainly that was not worth his coming from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Earth to effect, that you do not think worth your while to go a Mile or two to attend upon the Means of, nor worth ſetting your Thoughts ſeriouſly upon. Was our Salvation ſo great, that he parted with his Life to procure it, and is it not worth your parting with your Sins to have an Intereſt in it? What is the Voice of the Hearts and Ways of ſuch Sinners? Do not they reproach the Son of God after this manner, Why waſt thou ſo unwiſe to ſhed thy Blood to purchaſe Salvation for us? We do not value it above the Pleaſures of the World, we eſteem our carnal Delights and earthly Profits more than that Salvation which thou haſt wrought.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Nay they ſlight the Perſon of Chriſt, who ſays, <hi>Behold me, behold me,</hi> look unto me; Can you ſee me ſtand knocking at the Door of your Hearts, and refuſe to let me in?

he ſtands ready to imbrace you in his Arms, to eſpouſe your Souls, but you ſlight and deſpiſe him and his precious Love in your Hearts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Nay ſuch who neglect this Great Salvation, <hi>ſlight the Voice of Chriſt's Blood.</hi> Sirs, the Blood of Chriſt cries, his Death has a Voice in it: Hath Chriſt's Blood been ſhed to redeem you, to cleanſe you from Sin, to ſave and ſanctify your Souls, and will you not hear the loud Cry thereof? Nay, doth not Chriſt himſelf cry to you after this manner, Wilt thou continue in thy Sin, and neglect the Salvation I have purchaſed? What greater Ingratitude, what worſe Indignity canſt thou caſt upon me, and upon that Sacrifice which I have offered up to make thy Peace, and reconcile thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God? After this manner Chriſt ſeems to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To neglect this Salvation, is to croſs or contradict the grand Deſign of God in ſending his Son into the World; was it not to exalt Jeſus Chriſt, to magnify him? <hi>Laſt of all he ſent unto them his</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 37.</note> 
                        <hi>Son, ſaying, They will reverence my Son.</hi> God requires and commands all to honour his Son, believe in his Son, receive and imbrace his Son, ſubject to his Authority; to this End he ſent him into the World: But how do ſuch ſeek to croſs the Deſign of God herein, who prefer their earthly Profits and Pleaſures, nay their ſinful Ways and wicked Practices, above Jeſus Chriſt and that Salvation he hath purchaſed? O how great is the Sin of ſuch who neglect this Salvation!</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Hereby alſo they abuſe the matchleſs Love, the unſpeakable Love and Favour of Jeſus Chriſt; they do not only ſlight his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, contemn his Blood, and croſs the Deſign of the Father, but they alſo abuſe and diſdain his precious Love, which cauſed him to take upon him the Form of a Servant, and to yield himſelf up to the curſed Death of the Croſs. <hi>Greater Love hath no Man than this, that a Man lay down his Life for his Friend:</hi> But Jeſus Chriſt laid <note place="margin">John 15. 13. Rom. 5. 10.</note> down his Life for his Enemies; <hi>Whilſt we were yet Enemies, we were reconciled unto God by the Death of his Son.</hi> And ſhall Sinners, after the manifeſtation of ſuch Love, ſlight him, and the Salvation wrought by him at ſuch a dear Rate? Nay, ſhall Chriſt's repeated Calls, Wooings, and Intreaties, be not regarded, <hi>who ſpreadeth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 65. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>forth his Hands all the Day long?</hi> Shall any be ſo ungrateful, ſo blind, ſo rebellious, as to let Chriſt ſtand all Night at the Door of their Hearts, <hi>even till his Head is wet with Dew, and his Locks with the Drops of the Night?</hi> This ſhews the great Evil and Wickedneſs of <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 5.</note> thoſe who neglect this great Salvation: Doth not this tend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:59949:236"/>
the Son of God to ſhame, to be thus ſlighted, as if not worth the leaſt regard? Should a Prince come a thouſand Miles to court, or offer his Love to a low, a contemptible and baſe-born Damſel, and ſhe ſhould nevertheleſs ſlight him, and give him no entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would not this be deemed an abominable Abuſe of his Love, as well as great Contempt caſt upon his Perſon? Sinners are ready to ſay, there is <hi>no comelineſs</hi> in him <hi>that we ſhould deſire</hi> him: but <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 2, 3.</note> alas, 'tis becauſe they do not know him; they are blind and ſee him not, 'tis the carnal Eye that can ſee no Beauty in Chriſt; were the Eyes of their Underſtandings opened, they would be of another Opinion concerning him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Evil in neglecting of this is ſo great, that it is (as it were) a piercing of Chriſt again; nay, and when a poor Sinner is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of this great Iniquity, he cries out, What have I done? Have I not grieved, nay, wounded afreſh my dear Saviour, by not believing in him, and not receiving the great Salvation offered by him? Though I never ſaw the Perſon of Chriſt, yet I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Violence to him in reſiſting his Authority, deſpiſing his Love, and ſlighting his Salvation. As a Man is guilty of Treaſon, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing the Statue or Image of a King, ſo are Men guilty of the Blood of Chriſt, and of trampling upon it, when they count it as a Trifle, or unprofitable to their Salvation, ſeeking Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſome other ways, or are wholly regardleſs about it; it is as a Stab at his very Heart, a tearing out (as it were) his Bowels: he ſuffered willingly all thoſe great Torments which were inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to remove from us a neceſſity of Suffering; had he not ſtept in to bear our Sins, we had been loſt for ever. O why then is not he imbraced by Faith that works by Love! It implies a Sinner has no Love to him, no not ſo much as to his Sins and Folly; it is a denying the Excellences of Chriſt, the Preciouſneſs of Chriſt: for as Faith accounts all things but Dung in compariſon of Chriſt, ſo (as one obſerves) Unbelief counts Chriſt but <hi>Dung,</hi> Union and <note place="margin">Charnock.</note> Communion with him but <hi>Dung,</hi> in compariſon of this World and the Pleaſures of Sin.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Thoſe that neglect the Salvation of the Goſpel, thinking to be ſaved ſome other way, do ſeem to reflect upon, if not deſpiſe the Wiſdom of Jeſus Chriſt: Do they not charge him with Folly and Inconſiderateneſs, in undertaking ſuch a Task, ſuch a Work, on ſuch hard Terms, when it might be had ſome other way? What, ſuffer ſuch Pain, Sweat, great Drops of Blood, and be nailed to the Croſs to procure Salvation for us, which might be
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:59949:237"/>
obtained by a ſober Life, or by doing to all as they would be done unto, or by following the Dictates of the Light of natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or by our own Inherent Holineſs? What did Jeſus Chriſt aim at by ſhedding of his Blood, but the appeaſing of God's Wrath, and the bringing in of an Everlaſting Righteouſneſs, and to purchaſe Grace to ſanctify Mens Souls, and to open the Gates of Heaven, which Divine Juſtice had ſhut and barr'd up againſt us? Now certainly thoſe who neglect this Salvation, do either fancy theſe Bleſſings are not worth regard or looking after, or elſe they may be procured by ſome other Way, and on eaſier Terms, than by Faith in the Blood of Chriſt: And is not this to charge our Lord Jeſus with Folly; and with the <hi>Greeks of old,</hi> to account <hi>the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Croſs Fooliſhneſs?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. They render, it is evident, the ſhedding of Chriſt's Blood to be in vain, who neglect the Means of this Salvation, and ſo thereby ſlight the Bleſſings which he hath purchaſed: it muſt be an undervaluing of the price of Redemption; for that which a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon regards not, though procured at never ſo dear a rate, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares was in vain purchaſed: this is, with a Witneſs, therefore, <hi>lightly to eſteem of the Rock of their Salvation:</hi> it is to ſtop their <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 15.</note> Ears to the Cry of Chriſt's Blood. His Blood (as you heard) cries to Sinners to apply it to their periſhing Souls, and to leave their ſinful Ways; but they regard it not, though it ſeems afreſh to ſtream forth from his Heart in the Virtue of it, and flows through the Pipes of the Goſpel in the Offers of it. Did not they who refuſed to come to the Marriage-Supper, declare, that the King had in vain prepared all thoſe coſtly Dainties, for let who will come and eat thereof, they will not? And thus many render the bloody Sacrifice to be offered up in vain, by neglecting the Salvation offered in the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Such alſo who believe not, but reject and turn their Backs upon the Goſpel-Salvation, put Jeſus Chriſt to Grief again: It is <note place="margin">Mark 3. 5.</note> ſaid, <hi>He was grieved becauſe of the hardneſs of their Hearts.</hi> So God ſaid, he was <hi>grieved forty Years</hi> with thoſe who believed not in the Wilderneſs. O how many Years have ſome of you grieved both the Father and the Son, (to ſpeak after the manner of Men) and is not this a great Evil? Will you grieve and weary out the Heart of God, and the Heart of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
                     <p n="10">10. It alſo gives occaſion to Satan, to vaunt, boaſt and triumph over the Son of God: See, ſays he, how little theſe Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for whom thou gaveſt thy ſelf to die the Death of the Croſs,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:59949:237"/>
do mind the Salvation thou haſt purchaſed for them; they like and approve of my Ways and Motions, my Offers, better than any thing thou haſt procured for them, and doſt offer to them. May not Satan inſult after this manner over the Lord of Life and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whilſt Sinners cloſe in with his Temptations, and cleave to their Luſts, earthly Profits and Pleaſures, and neglect the great Salvation of the Goſpel?</p>
                     <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Such who neglect this ſo great Salvation, offer Violence to the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They do reſiſt the Holy Spirit, whom God hath ſent as his great Meſſenger, to influence, enlighten and convince their Hearts and Conſciences about the Worth and Weightineſs of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern: <hi>He will reprove the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 16. 8, 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Judgment. Of Sin, becauſe they believe not on me.</hi> Becauſe they neglect attending upon the Means of this Salvation, believe not the Neceſſity there is of this Saviour, nor of Faith in him, and ſeek it not above all things: Is it a ſmall Matter to reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt? O lay it to Heart.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They grieve the Holy Spirit alſo, yea, and hereby tire him out ſo, that he at laſt withdraws his Influences from the Sinner, and will ſtrive with him no more, like as he did by the World; and if ſo, the ruin of the Soul will be unavoidable: for without the Holy Spirit no Man can repent, believe, or be renewed, be regenerated, and ſo come to have Intereſt in this ſo great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Such quench the Spirit who neglect this Salvation, and do not believe; it is to caſt Water on that Divine Spark which the Holy Ghoſt ſtrives to kindle in the Soul of a poor Sinner, or to blow out the Candle of the Lord, (ſo far as the Sinner is able to do it) whereby Spiritual Light and Knowledg comes to be let into the Heart.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Nay, to neglect this Salvation in the Means of it, is as much as may be to hinder the Work and Office of the Holy Spirit in and about this Salvation. The Holy Spirit hath more immediately to do with Sinners; his ſpecial Work is to enlighten, to convince of Sin, to work Faith in the Soul, and to renew and ſanctify the polluted Heart; and all that neglect this Salvation, or that ſlight thoſe Convictions they have of the Evil of Sin, or Senſe of their woful Condition, do ſeek to obſtruct the King's great Officer and Meſſenger in the diſcharge of his Office. Look to it, Sinners, for
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:59949:238"/>
if it be deemed a dangerous thing to reſiſt a <hi>Conſtable</hi> in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his Office, becauſe he is the King's Servant, what Danger do you expoſe your ſelves to, that oppoſe, withſtand, and ſtrive to hinder the Spirit in the diſcharge of his great Work and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? It is to contemn the King's Ambaſſador; the Holy Spirit is ſent to treat with Sinners in Chriſt's Name, it is hereby Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſpeaks to them from Heaven: and they that adhere to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit, do adhere to Jeſus Chriſt; and they that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or reſiſt his Motions, do oppoſe and reſiſt Chriſt alſo. The Holy Spirit is the great Goſpel-Bleſſing promiſed, to infuſe Grace in the Soul: all Grace is from the Spirit; Sinners cannot believe without the Holy Spirit, nor love God: <hi>The Love of God is ſhed abroad in the Hearts</hi> of Believers <hi>by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> There is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation without the Spirit: Thoſe that are born again are born <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 5. John 3. 5.</note> of the Spirit; no Union with Chriſt without the Spirit, no broken Heart, no Cries, no Tears that will prevail with God without the help of the Spirit: Such that will not adhere to his Motions and Influences, ſay in their Hearts, that they will not be <hi>changed,</hi> will not <hi>believe</hi> nor <hi>repent,</hi> nor have Chriſt to be their Prince and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. The Spirit awakens the Conſcience, and ſtirs up Fears in the Soul, and ſets before the Sinner's Eyes, his great Evil, Guilt and horrid Pollution; therefore if they refuſe the Wooings, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties and Influences of the Spirit, they muſt periſh for ever.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. What do you think of your ſelves, Sinners? to you I ſpeak that neglect this ſo great Salvation. O this is your Sin, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the only Remedy God hath found out to heal and ſave your Souls, therefore your Damnation will be juſt and deſerved with a witneſs: You love Darkneſs rather than Light; you contemn the higheſt Good, the beſt of Beings, and the higheſt Expreſſions of his Love and Favour; that God that made you, that Chriſt that ſpilt his Blood to redeem the worſt of Sinners, thoſe Bowels that pitied you, you refuſe, and reſiſt that Spirit that would renew you, ſanctify you, and make you meet for Heaven, and all this out of love to your baſe Luſts, your cruel Enemies that ſeek to deſtroy and murder your precious Souls. Abhor your ſelves: Alas, Men do not ſee what Monſters of Wickedneſs they are, whilſt they neglect this ſo great Salvation. You ſin, I ſay, againſt the Remedy, the coſtly Remedy, the only Remedy, againſt the Remedy that Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom hath found out, and Infinite Goodneſs hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed: Yet if you return to God, there is Mercy for you; ſay, O Lord, now we ſee our Sin: O that you could but ſay ſo in truth, and fall down at the feet of God, and ſay, Thou haſt overcome us with thy Love.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Laſtly, Here is Comfort for Believers who have received this ſo great Salvation. O bleſs God for Faith, cheriſh the Motions of the Holy Spirit that hath broken your Bonds; you prefer Chriſt, and the Salvation by Chriſt, before all things: live worthy of a Part and Intereſt in this Salvation; you have Salvation, and ſhall not loſe it. O walk ſo that you may never loſe the Joy of it; for that you may do, God may hide his Face, Chriſt may withdraw himſelf: if he hath done it, enquire when you had him, and conſider what you have done that he hides his Face from you; let the Cauſe, if it be Sin, be bewailed, and let the loſs of him be more grievous to you, than the loſs of Comfort from him, and be willing to do any thing to enjoy Chriſt again.</p>

But before I proceed to ſpeak to this, let me premiſe one thing, namely, That we ought firſt to be ſenſible of that Evil which is in this and in all Sin, as it is againſt God; for if our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions ariſe not from hence, our Trouble is not right, it flows not from a true Spring or right Principles: It is not ſufficient to ſee our Sin and Evil, as it is againſt our ſelves, as it hurts and wounds our own Souls, but chiefly as it is againſt that God that made us, and ſent his Son to redeem us; or as Sin is loathſom and abominable in his ſight, tending to eclipſe his Glory, nay, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne him, and fruſtrate his gracious Deſign in our Redemption, and bring his Honour under contempt. This, I ſay, ſhould firſt of all and chiefly be lamented: Such ſin againſt the Remedy, and higheſt Goodneſs, that neglect this Salvation, and the gracious Operations of the Holy Spirit, and ſo rather adhere to Satan than to God.

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>They ſhall not eſcape the Curſe of the Law,</hi> (which all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and unbelieving Sinners lie under); for no Man is, nor can be delivered from the Curſe thereof, but only thoſe who believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and embrace the Salvation of the Goſpel; <hi>For Chriſt is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs, to every one that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>believeth:</hi> to them that believe, and to every one of them, but not to thoſe that believe not. Chriſt hath born the Curſe of the Law, he by his actual Obedience fulfilled the Righteouſneſs thereof; and by bearing the Penalty of it (which our Sins incurr'd) by his Death, he hath delivered all that believe from the Curſe thereof: but the Curſe of it remains on all them who receive not Jeſus Chriſt, it hath its full blow and ſtroke on all Goſpel neglecters, becauſe it is by him and no other ways we can be delivered from the Curſe thereof.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Therefore it follows in the ſecond place, that they cannot be delivered from the Guilt and Puniſhment of their Sins, their Sins lie upon them, they are charged upon all that neglect or refuſe the Salvation wrought out by Jeſus Chriſt: It is the Decree of the Eternal God, that all ſuch that believe not ſhall bear their own Sins, becauſe they reject Jeſus Chriſt who hath born the Puniſhment that was due to Sin. Some conceit that they need not this Salvation, need not the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, or Faith in Chriſt, and this through Ignorance, concluding their State is good. <hi>Jeſus ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, If ye were blind, ye ſhould have no Sin: but now ye ſay, We</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 9. 41.</note> 
                        <hi>ſee; therefore your Sin remaineth.</hi> They thought their own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs was ſufficient, and were ignorant of God's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and hence the Guilt of their Sin remaineth upon them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. All thoſe that neglect this ſo great Salvation, ſhall not eſcape the Wrath of God: This follows as the natural Conſequence of the former; Divine Wrath parſues them, and every Soul of them that believe not, but refuſe the Grace of God offered by Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel, like as the avenger of Blood purſued the Man ſlayer under the Law: The Cities of Refuſe were a type of Chriſt; 'tis to him all guilty Sinners muſt fly, if they eſcape the Wrath and Vengeance of God: Divine Juſtice is only ſatiſfied in
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:59949:243"/>
Chriſt; and Sinners for not accepting and receiving by Faith that Atonement, and pleading that Satisfaction he hath made, Wrath follows them even at their Heels, and will ſtrike them down: <hi>He</hi>

And as it is Chriſt's Righteouſneſs that is our Title for Heaven, ſo it is his Death, his bearing the Puniſhment of Sin, that delivers us from eternal Damnation in Hell. Hell is a fearful Place, it is made deep and large; <hi>The Fire is not quenched, and the Worm dieth not:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mark 3.</note> and that Place is prepared for all Unbelievers, for all who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their Sins, and under the Power of Unbelief, and neglect this ſo great Salvation, the Damnation of which they cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is becauſe this is the way, yea, the only way which Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom hath found out for the Salvation of our Souls: If there is but one way to cure a Mortal Diſeaſe that may ſeize upon a Perſon, then if he neglect that one Remedy, he muſt die. Sirs, as there is but one way to eſcape ſtarving, and that is, to eat; ſo there is but one way to eſcape periſhing, and that is by believing, or by feeding on Jeſus Chriſt, or by eating of his Fleſh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Blood. There are many ways to be damned, but there is but one way to be ſaved. <hi>Verily verily I ſay unto you, Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 6. 53.</note>

                        <hi>in you.</hi> If you neglect this way of Salvation, there is no other way whereby you can be ſaved; <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 4. 12.</note>, <hi>for there is no other Name given under Heaven whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such that neglect this Salvation, cannot, ſhall not eſcape the Wrath of God, becauſe it is juſt and equal that all ſuch Perſons who ſlight and neglect this Salvation, ſhould be deſtroyed, and that for ever. (1.) By reaſon they neglect an Offer of Pardon and Peace, contrived by the Infinite Wiſdom of God, and it is the higheſt Demonſtration of admirable Mercy and Goodneſs; therefore there cannot be a higher Indignity and Contempt caſt upon God's Sovereign Grace and Favour. Many of thoſe Sinners that neglect this Salvation, are ſo vile and ungrateful, as not to enquire what this Grace means, nor on what Terms this Salvation may be had: And is not this in plainneſs to tell the Holy God, that they ſcorn his Love and Goodneſs, and deſpiſe the Offers of Peace and Reconciliation by Jeſus Chriſt, and fear not what he can do unto them; and ſo no leſs than a trampling the Blood of Chriſt under their Feet? Let Men deal thus with their provoked Rulers, or with an earthly Prince, when guilty of High-Treaſon, and ſee how unpitied they will die, yea, be drawn, hang'd and quartered. What, guilty of the worſt of Treaſon, and have an Offer of Pardon, and ſlight or neglect the ſuing of it out? How equal and juſt a thing would it be that ſuch ſhould die? So it will be here, Brethren, God will not be mocked: Sinners ſhall one Day ſee what it is to neglect the Salvation wrought out by Jeſus Chriſt, I mean, the Way and Means of the Application thereof; they will be forced to ſubſcribe to the Righteouſneſs, Juſtice and Equity of their own Damnation, in loving and cleaving to their Luſts, and counting their earthly Riches, Pleaſures and Honours, better than Jeſus Chriſt, and a part in this Salvation. Remember it is the Sinner's own Salvation that he neglecteth, it is his own Good, his own Cure, his own Relief, his own Happineſs: Can any periſh more juſtly and deſervedly, than ſuch who refuſe to be ſaved, who chooſe Death rather than Life, and Darkneſs rather than Light?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They cannot, ſhall not eſcape, becauſe it is Salvation in ſuch a way, a way that coſt ſo dear, even the Blood of the Son of God: Should the King yield up his own Son as a Sacrifice to anſwer the Law for a curſed Traitor, and yet he ſhould deſpiſe and ſlight his Goodneſs, how would that aggravate his Guilt? O with what a
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:59949:244"/>
Price is this Salvation procured, by what a Sacrifice! What Tears did Chriſt ſhed! O what drops of Blood did he ſweat! and what Wrath did he bear! What a Curſe did he undergo, to ſave us from Hell and Death! How can any think to eſcape that neglect the Means of this Salvation?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Becauſe it is Salvation on ſuch eaſy Terms as to us; had God offered Sinners Salvation on hard and difficult Terms, their Sin might not ſeem to be attended with ſuch Aggravations. Had God required a <hi>thouſand Rams,</hi> or <hi>ten thouſand Rivers of Oil</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Mich. 6.</note> one that would be ſaved; or to ſacrifice their Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or <hi>their Firſt-born, the Fruit of their Bodies for the Sin of their Souls,</hi> this would ſeem hard: but none of this God requires of us, it ſhall not be, muſt not be our Son, our Child, our Firſt-born, but his Son, the <hi>holy Child Jeſus,</hi> his <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> that muſt die or be a Sacrifice for our Sins: it muſt be my Son, as if God ſhould ſay; and all that I require of you, is to apply his Blood, and to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice your Sins in love to me.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That which the Apoſtle builds the Righteouſneſs of God's proceeding againſt ſuch that neglect this Salvation upon, and ſhews the unavoidableneſs of their periſhing from, is the greatneſs of the Salvation it ſelf. Shall God's Juſtice be eclipſed, ſhall his Honour be marr'd, his Goodneſs be deſpiſed, his Law be violated, his Holineſs ſtained? it would be thus, ſhould ſuch be ſaved who neglect and ſlight this Salvation: Therefore all ſuch cannot eſcape his Wrath.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Apoſtle further argues the impoſſibility of their eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who neglect this great Salvation, from that impoſſibility there was of their eſcaping who refuſed to hear <hi>Moſes: For if the Word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every Tranſgreſſion and Diſobedience</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 2, 3.</note> 
                        <hi>received a juſt Reward; How ſhall we eſcape?</hi> &amp;c. It was a juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they received for their Sins and Diſobedience: And if ſo, how ſhall theſe eſcape? God will render a <hi>juſt Retribution,</hi> a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and proportionable Puniſhment, it will be far worſe, or much greater; howbeit, it is againſt greater Light, greater Grace, and deſpiſing a Perſon of far greater Honour and Dignity: <hi>He that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes <hi>Law, died without Mercy, under two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Of how much ſorer Puniſhment ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 28, 29.</note> 
                        <hi>worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Blood of the Son of God?</hi> &amp;c. Sirs, to love Sin, to love this World, or any Perſon or Thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Jeſus Chriſt, is in effect to tread the Son of God under your Feet, 'tis ſuch an undervaluing and vilifying of him. God doth,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:59949:244"/>
as it were, propound the Caſe to us, he would have Sinners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Judges how juſt their Condemnation will be if they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect this Salvation; and alſo the Nature and Quality, or Degree of it; <hi>Of how much ſorer Puniſhment ſuppoſe ye ſhall he be thought worthy?</hi> &amp;c. God at the laſt Day will ſo juſtly and righteouſly proceed againſt wicked Men, that their Reward ſhall be judged reaſonable in their own Judgment, and by their own Conſciences.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. They ſhall not eſcape, becauſe Mercy and Grace is ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, principally, by all that neglect this Salvation: Mercy will, as you have heard, plead againſt them. And if Mercy be their Enemy, if Goodneſs it ſelf riſe up againſt them, where will they find a Friend to appear for them?</p>
                     <p n="8">8. They ſhall not eſcape, becauſe God hath abſolutely and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably decreed the Deſtruction and eternal Damnation of all thoſe that believe not, but neglect this Salvation: His Decree, his Counſel and Purpoſe ſhall ſtand; <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mark 16. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>damned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. It is becauſe the Sinner is not able to deliver himſelf out of God's Hand: If he eſcape, it muſt be from one of theſe two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.<list>
                           <item>1. That either God muſt change his Purpoſe, his abſolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and Counſel.</item>
                           <item>2. Or elſe the Sinner muſt get out of God's Hand, and ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelf.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it is impoſſible God's Mind ſhould change, or his abſolute Decree be made void; his Decree ſhall ſtand, and he will do all his Pleaſure: God will be true, and not make himſelf <hi>a Liar</hi> to ſave the guilty Sinner. And that it is impoſſible for the Sinner to get out of God's Hands, is evident, becauſe God is <hi>Omnipotency it ſelf:</hi> whither can he fly from his Preſence? <hi>Who can ſtand before</hi> (or eſcape) <hi>his Indignation?</hi> Therefore there is no way for ſuch <note place="margin">Nah. 1. 6.</note> to eſcape God's Wrath, who neglect this Salvation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>APPLICATION.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. O bleſs God for this Salvation, and value it according to the Nature, Worth, and Greatneſs of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Bewail all ungodly Perſons, who are found ſlighters and neglecters of it, and mourn over them. O how ſad is their Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! May be you have ſome in your Families that are Neglecters of it, may be a Wife, a Husband, or Children, that do not regard
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:59949:245"/>
it, but are ungodly, and neglect the Means of Grace; how ſhould what you have heard move you to pity them, to weep over them, to pray for them, and ſtrive with them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Examine your ſelves, whether you have not, or do not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect this Salvation? Do you make it your chief Buſineſs to get an Intereſt in Chriſt? Do you prefer the Means of Salvation above all things in the World? What time do you take to ſeek God, to pray to him, to hear his Word? And with what Zeal, Love, Faith and Diligence do you do all theſe things? Do you not defer Soul-Concernments to another time? O ſee to it, and examine your ſelves; Do you not reſt upon ſomething or another ſhort of Chriſt? Doth the Power of Grace appear in your Hearts and Lives?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This may teach Believers to bear up under all Trials and Fears: Let what will come, they are ſafe who have an Intereſt in this great Salvation; other Salvations are nothing to this, and if we ſhould not be ſaved from the Wrath of Man, but muſt loſe our Liberty, and be expoſed to Death and Dangers here in this World, yet it will go well with us if this Salvation is ours. Let what Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can come upon the Land, thou haſt got a ſure Sanctuary, God is thy Help and thy Salvation. Brethren, there are many ſad Effects that do attend thoſe that neglect, continually neglect this Salvation, whilſt they are in this World, as Manifeſtations of God's Diſpleaſure, As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God withdraws the Influences of his Spirit from them, after they have for a long time reſiſted it, in the common Motions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, even to ſuch a Degree, that it ſhall ſtrive with them no more: thus God dealt with the old World.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God gives ſuch up at laſt to blindneſs of Mind, ſo that they <hi>in ſeeing, ſee not; and in hearing, hear not, neither do they underſtand.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 13, 14.</note> 
                        <hi>And in them is fulfilled the Prophecy of</hi> Eſaias, <hi>By hearing ye ſhall hear, and ſhall not underſtand; and ſeeing ye ſhall ſee, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi> The Word of God, if neglected, and not received, that it may become a Savour of Life unto Life, will become a Savour of Death unto Death, it either ſoftens or hardens Mens Hearts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. God gives them up to their own Hearts Luſts, as God by the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays, <hi>My People would not hearken to my Voice: and</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me. So I gave them up unto their own Hearts Luſts;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 81. 11, 12.</note> 
                        <hi>and they walked in their own Counſels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Nay ſometimes God takes away the Goſpel from them, as he did from the Jews that rejected Chriſt, refuſed the chief corner-Stone:
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:59949:245"/>
                        <hi>Therefore I ſay unto you, The Kingdom of God ſhall be taken</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 43.</note> 
                        <hi>from you, and given to a Nation bringing forth the Fruits thereof.</hi> What can be a worſe Judgment? this befel that People, and it hath not been reſtored to them ever ſince. When God removes the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, it may be long before he lets a People have it again, nay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps never.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Moreover, for neglecting the great Salvation, God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brings upon a People or Nation fearful temporal Judgments, and puts them, it may be, into the Hands of cruel Enemies: For thus he dealt with the unbelieving Jews, he brought the <hi>Romans</hi> in upon them, that burned their City and Temple; ſo that it is ſaid, <hi>Wrath came upon them to the uttermoſt.</hi>

                     <p n="6">6. God ſometimes will not ſave Perſons with Temporal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe they neglect Spiritual Salvation, ſo that they may read their Sin (if the Lord opens their Eyes) in their Puniſhment. But it is not God's uſual way under this Diſpenſation, to inflict Temporal Puniſhment on ſuch that neglect the Salvation of the Goſpel, but he reſerves his Wrath to another World; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let none think, though they eſcape his Judgments here, that they ſhall eſcape his Judgments and Wrath hereafter; that they ſhall not be able to do, as you heard.

                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. To preach God a Juſt and Holy God, is no Legal Doctrine, though the Law, it is true, holds him forth ſo to be, that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that God is Juſt; but his Mercy was vailed under dark Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, Types and Legal Sacrifices. But now the Goſpel ſets forth the infinite Juſtice of God beyond the Law; for in a Ceremonial Way, the Blood of Beaſts ſeemed to pacify God's Wrath. Though we deny not but the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the great Sacrifice (which alone in a proper ſenſe can ſatisfy for Sin) was held forth thereby. But in the Goſpel, the Juſtice and Holineſs of God ſo clearly ſhines forth in Jeſus Chriſt, that it is with open Face mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted unto all; all may behold therein the <hi>Juſt actually ſlain,</hi> and made a Sacrifice for the <hi>Vnjuſt.</hi> Never did God's Juſtice appear ſo fully, as it doth in the Suffering and Death of Chriſt for Sin. Therefore to preach the Severity and Juſtice of God againſt Sin and Sinners, can be no Legal Doctrine.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To preach Repentance, the Neceſſity of Repentance, Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Holineſs, is no Legal Doctrine; but it is pure Goſpel. The Law allowed of no Repentance: For <hi>thoſe that ſinned againſt</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Law, died without Mercy, under two or three Witneſſes.</hi> Do <note place="margin">Heb. 19. 28.</note> not miſtake me, I do not ſay that there was no Repentance for ſuch who lived under the Diſpenſation of the Law; for tho the Law, or firſt Covenant, allowed of no Repentance, yet the Goſpel was preached to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Moſes, David,</hi> &amp;c. But pray remember, and conſider it well, that Repentance came in, not through the Law, but through the Goſpel, upon the account of Chriſt's Satisfaction; and therefore it is only a Goſpel-Bleſſing: which being duly conſidered, Men have little reaſon to think Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance a harſh Doctrine; no, no, it is ſweet and bleſſed Tidings
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:59949:253"/>
to hear that there is Repentance vouchſafed to poor Sinners, yea, for the worſt of Sinners. Beſides, was not Repentance the very firſt Doctrine Jeſus Chriſt preached when he entered upon his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry? He calls upon Men to repent, and believe the Goſpel; he declares there is a Way found out for Pardon and Remiſſion of Sin. And what can ſo kindly and ſweetly excite, or ſtir up Sinners to Repentance, as the ſight of the infinite Mercy and pardoning Grace of God through the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt? His Mercy only melts and breaks the hard Heart of guilty Criminals.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To preach the Combinations and Threatnings of God's Wrath and Vengeance againſt all ungodly and impenitent Sinners, who ſlight and neglect the Salvation of the Goſpel, can be no Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Doctrine.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe the Goſpel abounds with them, yea, and more fearful Threatnings than thoſe were under the Law; for the one were Threats of Temporal Puniſhment, but the other are Eternal, even the Denunciation of God's Wrath in Hell for ever.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) Becauſe of the greatneſs of that Mercy and Divine Grace and Goodneſs, which ſuch who ſin under the Goſpel do abuſe and tread under their Feet.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) To ſhew the Juſtice, Headſhip and Authority of Jeſus Chriſt, who is God as well as Man, that ſo all Men may ſtand in awe of him, and dread and fear him, becauſe of his great Love and Goodneſs extended through his ſuffering for Sin, and enduring the heavy Wrath of God for us; and for many other Reaſons which you have heard.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4.) Becauſe the Threatnings of the Goſpel do not only ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God as a juſt Revenger, but alſo as a merciful Redeemer; not only as a Judg to paſs Sentence, but as a gracious Soveraign, ready to give forth Pardon to all convicted, broken and ſelf-condemned Rebels. The Law threatens Death, but affords no Offers of Life on any Terms that can be attained to, therefore no Encouragement given by it to Sinners to humble themſelves: it commands perfect Obedience, but affords no Strength to perform it; pronounces the Sentence againſt us, but produces no Pardon for us; it commands us to truſt in God, but reveals not a Mediator, who is the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Object of Faith and Truſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">(5.) The Threatnings of the Goſpel are a Manifeſtation of God's Goodneſs: As a Father threatens his Child from that Love and Bowels he hath to it, that ſo it might not feel the Laſhes of his Rod and Anger. And O how are Goſpel-Threatnings mixt with
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:59949:253"/>
alluring Motives and endearing Arguments and Perſwaſions, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating how ready God is to paſs by our Offences, if we ſubmit our ſelves to him, and accept of the Offers of his Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. If ſuch preaching of Wrath therefore be Legal, I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg my great Ignorance of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, how long are the Threatnings of the Goſpel deferred before executed? The Contemners of the Law died preſently, as well as it diſcovered no Remedy: But ſo it is not here, God ſeems to be ready to forgive, and ſlow to Wrath; he waits long before he ſtrikes, and brings Wrath and Judgment upon Offenders, as well as he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them to a way to eſcape.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew you what is a Legal Doctrine, or Legal Preaching.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Doctrine or Preaching of ſuch Perſons is legal that ſay, that all who will be eternally ſaved, muſt arrive to a perfect and ſinleſs Righteouſneſs in themſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> keep the Law perfectly and ſin not in their own Perſons, or they cannot be juſtified. <hi>William Penn,</hi> ſpeaking of that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Not the Hearers of the Law are juſt before God, but the Doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified,</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pen'<hi>s San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhaken,</hi> p. 26.</note> "From whence, how unanſwerably may I obſerve, that unleſs we become <hi>Doers</hi> of that Law, which Chriſt came not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, but, as our Example, to fulfil, we can never be juſtified before God; nor let any fancy, that Chriſt hath ſo fulfilled it for them as to exclude their Obedience from being requiſite to their Acceptance, but only as their Pattern." Now this is a Legal Doctrine with a witneſs, theſe Men would be look'd upon as true Preachers of the Goſpel, but let all Men be aware of them. Is any Man able perfectly to keep the Law? if ſo, why doth the Apoſtle ſay,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 2, 3.</note> 
                        <hi>What the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Fleſh, God ſending his Son?</hi> &amp;c. Beſides, if <hi>there had been a Law that could have given Life, verily,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law.</hi> And again, he ſaith, <hi>By the Works of the Law, no Man is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 16, 21.</note> 
                        <hi>juſtified: and if Righteouſneſs come by the Law, then is Chriſt dead in vain.</hi> Chriſt it ſeems, by what this Man ſaith, came only to fulfil the Law, as our Example, that we might conform to him therein, and ſo be juſtified by it. But he forgot that we and all Mankind have broke the Law, and ſtand charged and condemned thereby unto eternal Condemnation; and who ſhall make Atonement for that Breach, and deliver us from the Curſe thereby incurred? No Doctrine can caſt higher Contempt upon Chriſt, and invalidate his
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:59949:254"/>
Suffering, and Juſtification by Faith alone in him, than this Doctrine doth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such preach a Legal Doctrine, who preach up Obedience by us to the Law or Goſpel, either as the procuring or moving Cauſe and Condition of our Juſtification and Eternal Life.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Such alſo preach a Legal Doctrine, who preach up Wrath and Divine Vengeance, to ſcare or frighten Men out of their Sins; and as if by the bare leaving and forſaking of Sin, Men might eſcape Death and Wrath. Such a Doctrine, as Reverend Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> notes, may fill an unregenerate Man with Horror and ſervile Fear; whereby, as Bond-Servants, or Slaves, by the Whip of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, they may be forced to break off from ſome groſs Acts of Sin, and perform ſome outward Duties of Religion, which otherwiſe they are unwilling to do: for, as it is not from Love to God, nor from Faith in Chriſt, ſo they find no Delight nor Sweetneſs in it; but being often remiſs, and ſeeing cauſe to doubt of the Sincerity of their Obedience, they fall under Terror and ſlaviſh Fear, they only acting from an enlightned Conſcience, and not from Faith, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing Grace. Theſe Men neither love the Law nor Goſpel, tho they are forced to keep up in ſome degree of Obedience to it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Such preach a Legal Doctrine, that affirm Man's own Faith and inherent Righteouſneſs for the ſake of Chriſt's Merits, is part of our Righteouſneſs to Juſtification in the ſight of God; and that Chriſt hath procured or merited a mild Law of Grace, of Faith and ſincere Obedience, in the room of the Law of perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: Which Law of ſinleſs Obedience Chriſt having given to God a full Recompence for our Breach of, he hath taken that Law-away; and that ſo far as we faithfully live up to this new Law of Grace, we are juſtified in God's ſight, and accepted for the ſake of Chriſt's Merits: Not that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs alone is the matter of our Juſtification excluſive of all our inherent Righteouſneſs and Obedience; no, no, but rather it is our Righteouſneſs which doth juſtify us. The Goſpel, according to theſe Men, is propounded as a Law, and God as a Rector, or juſt Governour, commanding Obedience thereunto, as the procuring Cauſe of our Juſtification: So that our Faith and Obedience is a Cauſe and Condition of Life, as Unbelief and Diſobedience is the Cauſe of Eternal Death. But having formerly detected this dangerous Error, I ſhall not further inſiſt upon the Confutation of it here.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Such preach a Legal Doctrine, that render Man a Co-worker with Chriſt in the Salvation of their own Souls, by which means
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:59949:254"/>
there is room left for him to boaſt and glory. Such a Doctrine they preach, who magnify the <hi>Will</hi> of Man, or the Power of the Creature; which I hope I have, by the Aſſiſtance of God, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detected and refuted in this Treatiſe: All boaſting being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the Grace of God in the Goſpel, Man being abaſed, and God alone exalted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>APPLICATION.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall now come to make the general Application of what I have ſaid unto you from this great Text, and ſo conclude with all I ſhall ſay from it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt Inform.</hi> Firſt by way of Information; the Doctrine which hath in theſe Sermons been inſiſted on may inform us, That Goſpel-Sins are the greateſt Sins, and that the blind Heathens are not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo guilty and culpable before God, nor in ſuch a dangerous Condition as thoſe are who live under the preaching of the Goſpel, and yet ſlight, and neglect the Salvation of it. O what will they do in the Day of Judgment, that live in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> in a Land and City of ſo great Light, and periſh through their Sin, and Contempt or Neglect of Goſpel-Grace!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> This may alſo inform us, how ſtrangely Mankind are blinded and deceived by the God of this World; in that ſmall things are accounted great, and that which is of the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, is little, or not at all regarded, but eſteemed as a <hi>trivial</hi> matter. O, ſays ſome, we muſt mind <hi>the main Chance!</hi> they mean the main Buſineſs in reſpect of their Earthly Subſiſtence, which is to get Bread, and to provide for the Body, for their Wives and Children. Now the Doctrine which you have heard, ſhews you how you are deluded, that look upon Earthly Things to be the main Buſineſs you ſhould look after. What is of ſuch Importance as the Salvation of your precious and immortal Souls, and to be providing for an endleſs Eternity?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I may infer from hence, That the greateſt part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are Unbelievers; for all that neglect this Salvation, and look not upon this matter as their chief Buſineſs, are doubtleſs in a State of Unbelief: They do not credit this holy Doctrine, they believe not God's Word. If one ſhould tell you that are going a Journy, that if you go ſuch a Way, you will certainly be deſtroyed by Thieves, or wild Beaſts, yet you will go on; Would it not follow clearly that you believe not what was told you? Why thus it is
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:59949:255"/>
here, Sinners are told and aſſured from the Word of God, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as God is true, and his Word true, that if they leave not their Swearing, their Pride, their Drunkenneſs, their Lying, their Luſts and Uncleanneſs, their Worldly-mindedneſs, and their preferring Earth, and the things of the World above the things of God; or if they do not believe, repent, and be born again, they ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly periſh for ever; yet they go on and live in thoſe ways of Sin, and believe not, repent not: this is an evident ſign that they do not give Credit to what is told them, and ſo are Unbelievers; and if they ſtill perſiſt in their way, they will be certainly damned.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 3.</note> ye ſhall not eſcape eternal Wrath, be ye great Sinners, or not Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the firſt Rank. <hi>The Wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and all the Nations that forget God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that believeth not, the Wrath of God abideth on him:</hi> and they that do not believe, are told there is no other <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 36.</note> way to eſcape this Wrath, and that this Wrath will be poured forth upon them like Fire, unleſs they believe in Chriſt, receive Chriſt, obtain an Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt; nay, that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already; but they believe not.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Moreover, ſuch who live a ſober moral Life, are told, that notwithſtanding that, yet unleſs they are born again, unleſs they get Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and <hi>their Righteouſneſs exceed the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> and they obtain the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, <hi>they cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Now they will not believe this, but conclude their State is good, and that Morality is ſufficient to ſave their Souls: which ſhews that theſe are Unbelievers alſo.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Others are told, that their good Deeds, their good Duties, their Prayers, their hearing of Sermons, or their being Baptized, and having Communion with God's People, will not do, unleſs they are ſavingly renewed and ſanctified, having the true Grace of God in their Hearts, and lead a Godly, Holy and Spiritual Life, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the powerful Operations of the Spirit changing them into the Likeneſs of Jeſus Chriſt: but they believe it not, but reſt upon their Duties and outward Privileges, tho they are told the Kingdom of God is not in Meat and Drink, but in Righteouſneſs, and Truth, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt; or that the Kingdom of God is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward only, but in Power alſo, and that Lamps of Profeſſion will not ſave them, except they have Oil in their Veſſels: many of theſe are like the fooliſh Virgins, and believe it not, but reſt on a bare Name
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:59949:255"/>
of Chriſtians, on a Form of Godlineſs, and may be fall ſhort too as to an outward Profeſſion of Godlineſs; for ſo do they who pray not in the Cloſet, nor in their Families, neither read God's Word, nor make it their Buſineſs to hear the Word preached, in Seaſon and out of Seaſon, but every ſmall Matter takes them off of thoſe Duties. Be ſure, all prayerleſs Souls are graceleſs Souls; it is to be feared many of this ſort make Religion but little of their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, who neither read, pray nor meditate, nor perhaps call upon their Children and Servants ſo to do, but let their Children have their Carnal Luſts, their Pride, ambitious and wanton Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations indulged and nouriſhed in them. O how little is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Part of God's Worſhip kept up in the Families of ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This may ſerve alſo for a Uſe of <hi>Terror</hi> to ſecure Sinners. <note place="margin">Terror.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. May not Cry out, <hi>Fire, Fire?</hi> Such a Cry hath often ſtartled and amazed many of you that live in and about this City. Sirs, a Fire is juſt a breaking out, which you cannot eſcape, unleſs you look about you the ſooner. When People hear the Cry of Fire in the Night, how do they cry out, <hi>Where, Where?</hi> Alas, this Fire ſeizes not on your Houſes, nor Goods, no nor on your Bodies only, but on your Souls; it has already kindled even the Wrath of God, which no Sinner can eſcape that neglects this Salvation. God's Wrath is compared to Fire, and it has perhaps already taken hold of ſome of your Conſciences; but if it be not kindled there, yet it is kindled in God's Anger: <hi>For a Fire is kindled in my Anger, and ſhall burn unto the loweſt Hell. O that they were wiſe, that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Is the Wrath of God ſo terrible, and can no Unbeliever or impenitent Sinner eſcape it; what cauſe is here for them all to tremble? Suppoſe you ſhould be told, that this Night you ſhall certainly not eſcape Death, neither you, nor your Wife, nor Children, but that your Houſe ſhall be burned down, your Goods, Self, Wife and Children ſhall all be burned to Aſhes, and that this Judgment you ſhall not eſcape; would it not be ſtartling and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Tidings if you ſhould believe it?

                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It may be for a Lamentation, to ſee how few underſtand the Nature of this Salvation, and ſtudy the Myſteries of it, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire an Intereſt in it; and alſo to ſee how many make light of it, whilſt others by dangerous Errors ſeek ways to eclipſe the Glory of God's Free Grace therein.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> This reprehends ſuch who are more affected with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Salvation, than with the Spiritual and Eternal Salvation of <note place="margin">Reproof.</note> the Soul; and alſo all ſuch that defer looking after, and ſtriving to get an Intereſt in it.</p>

                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> By way of Exhortation.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <note place="margin">Exhortat.</note>Let me exhort you to praiſe God for Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Author and Finiſher of this Salvation: Chriſt is all, and in all, in our Salvation: God hath ſent us an Almighty Saviour.

Therefore it remains, that you endeavour to ſhew forth the Praiſes of him who hath called you out of Darkneſs into his marvelous Light, and hath given you a true ſight of, and intereſt in this great Salvation wrought by Jeſus Chriſt; To whom with the Father and the Holy Spirit, be Glory, Honour and Praiſe, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
