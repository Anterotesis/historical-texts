            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of truth: for why may not the Earth moove, we departing from the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and they stand still, as well as the Earth bee thought to stand still, and the <hi>heavens</hi> moving, seeme to depart us?

their speeches, opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and actions, but whole professions, nay flourishing Nations by their apparant cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes demonstrate this assertion: First, for Professions; who seeme more devout then Clergy-men? or who seeme to take more delight in Law then Lawyers? or in medicines then Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians?
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:11458:37"/>
and yet (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the saying of a learned Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Florence</hi>) Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers goe not to Law, Physitians take no physick, and some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines are scarce good Christians. Secondly for Nations, it is the fashion of the women of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> to love that Husband best which beateth them

most, and to thinke themselves never lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or regarded, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they be two or three times a day wel favouredly swadled.

            <p>In generall to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, have you not heard of men that stumble at strawes, and leap over blocks: Of <hi>Democritus</hi> a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, who having put his eyes out, that

travelled all over <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> which men thought so full of them, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned without his errand, and could find none. <hi>Omne meum, &amp; nihil meum,</hi> that saying of <hi>Macrobius</hi> is not so knowne as true.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:11458:40"/>
though the <hi>Greater sort</hi> thinke the Honor onely doth accrue to the receivers, yet the wiser few in their hearts confesse, and then in their tongues to the world expresse it chiefly to bee in the givers.

A man may be seene abroad, and yet walke invisible; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usuall speech, and yet verified of an able re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served man.

and prevent them, to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Masters honour, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dexterity, when they are fallen, to shift them, to his Masters content) for bad po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy may bee in the knowledge of good men, but in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of wicked.

as for that which is given him; an unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet a certaine truth: for it is knowne of the generous, who by taking a courtesie, parts with that hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts most deare, his liberty: I could bee yet infinite in instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (<hi>most Honour'd Sir</hi>) but that I study <hi>brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that I may like you in all things: I

presume any cleare iudgement may have satisfaction by these, so as not any way to offer to deny, since so many things are not as they seeme (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially adding to consideration things more unlikely are true, as for a creature to eate iron, as the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stridge</hi>; or to live in fire, as the <hi>Salamander</hi>)
