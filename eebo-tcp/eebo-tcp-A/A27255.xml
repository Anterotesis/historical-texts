            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94078:3"/>
               <hi>Petty Chapmen,</hi> who ſhall Travel the Country for ſome Miles, to lay out <hi>moneys</hi> in order to buy up Goods; as Wooll, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> buying <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> Tod in one place, and <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> in another, where they can meet with them: For it is not to be imagined, ſuch <hi>Chapmen</hi> as theſe: ſhall have their <hi>moneys</hi> remitted, by reaſon of the great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty in what place they ſhall buy their Goods: But my meaning is, That ſuch Perſons, who bring their Goods to a certain Town or Market, ſelling them for <hi>conſiderable ſums;</hi> and ſuch Perſons, who ſhall carry in their <hi>moneys</hi> to a Market or Fair to Buy with. (As for <hi>Example.</hi>) A Perſon living at <hi>Exeter,</hi> or any other place, hearing of a parcel of Wooll to be ſold at <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> or any other place Croſs the Country, though far <hi>remote;</hi> The ſaid Party, paying the <hi>moneys</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to lay out, into the <hi>Chamber</hi> of the Town afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, the <hi>Clerk</hi> of that <hi>Chamber,</hi> ſending up the <hi>Advice-Indenture,</hi> to the proper Clerk of the ſaid County, he ſhall <hi>Remit</hi> the <hi>moneys</hi> to the <hi>Chamber</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Town,</hi> with as much <hi>expedition,</hi> as the Poſt can make: And in like manner, may all <hi>Gentlemens Rents,</hi> or <hi>moneys</hi> for Portions, and Purchaſes be <hi>tranſmitted</hi> throughout the Kingdom. For if any perſon ſhall <hi>adventure</hi> to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel with Sums of <hi>money,</hi> after having ſuch <hi>convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> provided for their ſo ſafe and eaſy ways of <hi>Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances,</hi> I Judge the Country ought not to be Liable to make good what ſhall be ſo loſt by <hi>Robberies</hi> after ſuch Bold and Daring Adventures. And they may <hi>keep</hi> an exact <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance</hi> on all occaſions, in all places, and at all times throughout the Kingdom; by which means each Town may have a Bank of <hi>money</hi> by them, which, (as I conceive) will be no ſmall <hi>Increaſe of Riches</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdom, cauſing all <hi>manufacturies</hi> to flouriſh much more than hither to they have done, the failure of which is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94078:3"/>
thought to befor want of Moneys among them, which has occaſioned many Country people to try their Fortunes in <hi>London,</hi> where money is more plenty, which hath much <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populated</hi> the Country, thereby <hi>damnifying</hi> very much both Gentlemens Eſtates, and done great injury to all Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, There are ſeveral <hi>principal Towns</hi> and places of Trade; as <hi>Exeter, Norwich, Colcheſter, Hull, Leeds,</hi> &amp;c. wherein the Goods are bought by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the ſaid places, and there vended; which <hi>moneys,</hi> with the <hi>Kings Revenues,</hi> being paid into the Bank of the ſaid places, muſt inevitably be <hi>equivolent</hi> to the <hi>manufactures</hi> made in the ſaid Towns, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded elſe-where: For ſuppoſe each of thoſe do <hi>vend</hi> and make <hi>great quantities</hi> of <hi>Woollen manufacturies,</hi> being the <hi>Stable Commodities</hi> of the Kingdom, the more they make the better, being the <hi>greater number</hi> of People muſt be imployed therein; And we find by <hi>experience,</hi> That (by the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi>) <hi>Noblemen, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Shopkeepers, Merchants,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are ſo promiſcuouſly intermixed in Towns and Villages among Handicrafts, being ſubſervient one to another, as <hi>different members</hi> of one and the ſame body; and ſuppoſing there are <hi>Twenty</hi> or <hi>Thirty Thouſand</hi> Souls in each Town or place; Theſe muſt all be <hi>Fed</hi> and <hi>Cloathed,</hi> with all things according to their ſeveral Ranks and Qualities; and, by <hi>conſequence,</hi> muſt Trade in <hi>Linnen, Woollen, Silk,</hi> &amp;c, and in all <hi>Grocery Wares, Wine, Oyl, Tobacco, Iron, Lead, Tin, Copper, Glaſs,</hi> &amp;c. and in all ſorts of <hi>Grain, Cattle, Fruits, Dyes,</hi> and <hi>Druggs,</hi> without which, no place can well ſubſiſt. Now let the <hi>Traders</hi> of the ſaid Towns, and Villages nigh adjacent, pay into the Banks of the ſaid places, all the <hi>moneys</hi> which ſhall become due in Parts remote, for the Goods <hi>vended</hi> by them: The prime

coſt of all ſuch Goods conſumed, together with the Money Collected for <hi>Exciſe,</hi> the <hi>Land Tax,</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> being paid into the next Chamber, or Bank, in or nigh the place, muſt make a ſufficient Fund of Money in all the Banks of each County, Town, or City, to anſwer all Goods and Manufactories that ſhall come out of the Countries, being the prime Coſt of <hi>materials</hi> are allowed for: But if any Merchant or Dealer ſuppoſe the Manufactures made in the Countries, and ſent abroad, are of greater value than the prime Coſt of Goods, that are bought and conſumed in the Countrys; I beg to know how it happens, That ſuch Town or County has not gain'd the greateſt part of the Kingdoms Wealth; which, if any perſon ſatisfies me in, I ſhall look upon all my pains, and ſerious thoughts, about this <hi>Project,</hi> to be vain imaginations, and ſhall deſiſt further to urge it.</p>
            <p>AND ſo ſoon as the KING's <hi>Money</hi> ſhall be paid into any of the ſaid <hi>Chambers</hi> in the Country, it may be drawn off here from the <hi>Chief Chambers</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> at the pleaſure of the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Treaſury:</hi> Which will occaſion the Paying in of the Kings <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues</hi> into the <hi>Exchequer</hi> with more <hi>Expedition</hi> by the <hi>Sub-Collectors,</hi> being the firſt Charge laid upon the <hi>Moneys</hi> given <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> which will ſave the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 100000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> ſo much and more being now paid for <hi>Collecting;</hi> going through ſo many Hands.</p>

            <p>This I humbly conceive (if approved on by <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> and the Honourable <hi>Houſes of Parliament</hi>) may be worth <hi>Five hundred thouſand pounds, per Annum.</hi> or more, without hurting the <hi>Subject;</hi> paying no more for their <hi>Returns</hi> of <hi>Money,</hi> than they commonly now do upon occaſion of ſuch <hi>Returns</hi> by <hi>Carriers,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Therefore the <hi>Terms</hi> in my <hi>Propoſitions</hi> being ſo eaſy (and the Service of ſo great value) I hope no Man can rationally Grudge at it, obtaining ſo great a Benefit by it; For I clearly conceive, both <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> will Improve and Encourage ſuch an Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ſhall make <hi>Moneys</hi> Circulate upon all Occaſions to their great advantage.</p>
            <p>AND this being <hi>Propoſed</hi> for the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> I hope it will not be <hi>Poſtpon'd,</hi> but rather meet with that <hi>Encouragement</hi> from the <hi>Government,</hi> as may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it Uſeful for the Matter intended; which will not only be a <hi>Great Benefit,</hi> but alſo a <hi>Great Honour</hi> to the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> And I hope the <hi>Objections</hi> that may be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my <hi>Propoſals,</hi> are ſo Rationally Anſwered, as with Eaſe to be underſtood; relating to the Advance of Trade; the Improvement of Eſtates; the ſafe and quick Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmittances of Rents; the Benefit accrewing to the Poſt-Office: And in Removing of the Cauſe, it will moſt Effectually be the preventing of Robberies by High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Men.</p>
