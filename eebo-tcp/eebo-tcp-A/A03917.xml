            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOt longe agoo, after I had

being at London to talke

of hym, what be thought, and how he
lyked the same boke: and he answered, that
in his mynde, it was a boke moche necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
and very profitable for them that take
good hede to the holsome teachynges, and
warely folowed the same. And this moche

well accepted and allowed. And I sayd,
I pray god it may do good, and that is all
that I desyre. And thus in talkynge of one
boke and of an other, he came forthe and
sayde: that if I wolde take so moche peyne

and howe beneficiall to the common welthe
were it? For almoste into euerye parte of
this realme, this mooste foule and peyneful

therwith. Whan he had sayde thus his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasye,
and that I hadde bethought me and
well aduysed his wordes, I answered: If
I thought it wolde do good, I wolde take
the peyne with all my verye harte, and hit
were moche greatter, and yet (sayde I) I
feare me, it be as moche or more than I am
able to accomplysshe. For I doubt whether
I may com to the clere vnderstandyng ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
or not: It is in ernest a matter straunge
inough to translate, not onely for the names
of herbes and other dyuers thynges therin
conteyned, but also for the phrase and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quente
style. But what so euer aunswere I
made hym, I finally determyned to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate
the sayde boke, as I haue done in dede,
not so well I am sure, so playnly and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitely
as many other coude, if they wold

I haue not moche erred from the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge

forefathers (as it maye be
wel coniectured) vnknowen.
In the yere of Christ. 1493.
or there about, this foule and most greuous
disease began to spredde among the people,
not in Fraunce, but fyrste at Naples in the
fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chemens hoste, wherof it toke his name
(which kept warre vnder the frenche kynge
Charles) before hit appered in any other
place. By whiche occasion the frenche men
puttynge from them this abhorred name,
calle it not the frenche pockes, but the euyll
of Naples, reckenynge it to theyr rebuke,
if this pestilent disease shulde be named the
frenche pockes. Not withstandynge the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente
of all nations hathe obteyned, and we
also in this boke wylle calle it the frenche
pockes, not for any enuye that we beare to
so noble and gentyll a nation, but bycause
we fere, that all men shuld not vnderstand,
if we gaue it any other name.</p>

¶At the fyrste rysynge therof some men
supersticiously named it meuyn syckenes, of
the name (I know not) of what saynt. some
accompted it to come of Iob scabbe, whom
this syckenes (I thynke) hath broughte in
to the numbre of sayntes. Some iuged it to
be the infirmitie, wherwith the monke E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uager

he was in deserte. And therfore he also was
sought from ferre countreyes, with great
resorte of men, offeryng gyftes habundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

And bycause the name of sayncte. Euager
was not knowen amonge the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

for Euagers: Not enquerynge what

that these coulde helpe them. Suche opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
hadde the people, and thus they dydde
ryse: There was ymages offered and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

were newe remembred, whiche thynge if it

            <p>¶But the diuines did interpretate this to
be the wrathe of god, and to be his punys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shement
for our euylle lyuynge. And so dyd
openly preache, as thoughe they, admytted

<pb facs="tcp:4540:8"/>
But in this thynge all do agre, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

the lakes, fountaynes, flodes, and also the

venemus vapours to come downe from
the ayre, which lyuing creatures (in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge

was founde in other bestes lyke as in men.
The astrologers fetch the cause of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmytie
from the sterres, sayenge, that it
procedethe of the coniunctions of Saturne
and Mars, whiche was not longe before,
and of .ii. eclipses of the sonne: and they do

therof. For it semeth to edifye and fortyfie
a castell, there to reste a longe season, and
thens to disperse and caste into euery parte
of the bodye all maner of ache and peynes.
And the longer the sayde swellynges tarye
fro rottynge and rypynge, the more peyns
shall the pacient suffer. And aboue all other
peynes of this infirmitie, this is the violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
and that troubleth man mooste. I my

By this the senowes (at somme tymes) do

they shrinke, and some time the sicknes tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
it self into the gout, or into the palsey,
or into apoplexi, &amp; infecteth many one with

that for many reasons, whiche are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men

            <p>¶After all this there buddeth out and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere
smalle holes and sores, whiche tourne
them self into cankers and phistuls, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual

was so peinful, that many had leuer dy tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was eased, but shortly after fel down
again: so that his ese dured very few days.
wherby men may esteme, what I suffered in
this dysease, that proued this maner of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a .xi. tymes, with great ieopardy and
peryll, wrastling with this euyll .ix. yeres.
And yet in the mene time taking what so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thing was thought to withstand and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siste
it. For we vsed bathes &amp; herbes lapped
about them, and drinkes and coresies. And
for this we had arsnicke, inke, calcantum,
verdegres, or aqua fortis, which wrought
in vs so bytter pein, that they might be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
very desirous of life, that had not leuer
dy tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so to prolong theyr lyfe. but tho cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
were most bytter &amp; peineful, whiche
were made with ointmentes. And was also
so moch the more da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous bicause the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of it knewe not the operation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
For the surgions only dyd not vse it, but
euery bolde felowe went about playing the
phisition, gyuynge to all maner of men one
ointment, eyther as he had sene it ministred
to other, or as he had suffered it hym selfe.
And so they heled all men with one medy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,

as the prouerbe saythe, One shoo for

so with out order or rule, with tormente of
heate and sweat ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie, al were cured after
one facion, without regard of tyme, habyt,
or complection. Nother these ignorante a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynters
had not so moch knowledge, as
with laxes to take away the mater, whiche
caused the euyl, or to diete them, or appoint
any diuersite of meate, but at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth the mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
must come to this poynt, that they shuld
lose theyr tethe, for they were losed, theyr
mouth was all in a sore, and through cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the stomake and fylthy stenche, they
lost appetite. And all thoughe their thyrste
was intollerable, yet founde they no kynde
of drinke to helpe the stomake: Many were
so light in their brayne, that they coude not
stand: &amp; some were brought into a madnes:
and not onely theyr handes tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled &amp; shoke

som mumbled in theyr spekyng as longe
as they lyued, and cowde haue no remedy.
<pb facs="tcp:4540:13"/>
And many I haue sene die in the myddel of

powred it vppon vnsleyt lyme (that is it,

howe moche doth the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and ioye of his benygnite towarde vs,
passe the sorowe and pein of that infirmitie?
The vse of this wod was brought to vs out
of an ylonde namyd Spagnola, this ilonde
is in the west nigh to the contrey of Amerik,
set in that place where the length of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike,
stretchynge into the northe, doth ende:
and was founde of late dayes amonge the
newe landes, whiche were vnknowen by the
olde tyme. All the inhabytauntes of that
ylonde somtyme be diseased with the french
pockes, lykewyse as we be with the mesels,
and small pockes. Nor they haue no other
remedy for it but this.</p>
            <p>¶A certayne noble man of Spayne, being
tresaurour in that prouince, was grenously
troubled with that infyrmitie: And after
the people of that lande hadde taught hym
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4540:15"/>
that medycine, he broughte the maner and
vse therof into Spayn, shewyng of what po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wer
and vertue it was in those partes. The
phisitions wold not alowe it, perceyuynge
that theyr profite wolde decaye therby, not
withstanding at length they toke in hand to
cure with the same wod, but with suche ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie,
attributyng so moch to theyr pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceptes
and order, that except they were ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>serued,
they affirmed this woode shulde be
spent in vayn. Which thing I meruayle they
coude perswade to any man, and make hym
beleue it, seinge it is playnly knowen, that
in that ylande were neuer phisitions. And
yet hath this wood Guaiacum always ben
there vsed. But in this cure what besines is
mete for the phisition, I wyll here after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.
Now I wyl speke of the thyng inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
They haue gyuen it this name Guaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.
For so the Spaniardes wryte it with
latyne letters, folowynge theyr owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of founde, whiche worde the people of
that ylande pronounce with open mouthe
Huiacum.</p>
            <p>¶And Paulus Ritius shewed me at the cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of August, that he harde saye of a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyarde,
whiche had ben in that yland, that
the fyrste syllable Gua, of this name, was
<pb facs="tcp:4540:16"/>
not pronounced of the Spagnolenses with
G, but that his owne tonge dydde require
it so to be wryten. And they of that Ilande
founde it with, V, puffed out, as though it
were Huiacum, a worde of .iii. syllables
with theym, and not Guaiacum. We maye
gyue vnto it some excellent name, callynge
it lignum vite, as Philo the phisition called
his dregges the handes of god: and this

groweth lyke an ashe with vs in height, &amp; is
sounde, bryngyng forth a nutte moche lyke
a chesse nutte, his tymbre is oyle and fatte,
in colour lyke boxe, but somwhat blackishe.
And they iudge that the best, that hath most
blacke: but that whiche is lyke to boxe,
differeth from that, whiche is blacke. For
this is within, and thother without: or to
speke more playnely, the blacke is as hit
were the harte and marowe. The wodde is
meruaylous heuy, for the leest pece of hit,
caste into the water, synketh streyght to the
botom. There is no wodde so harde, as it.
For it is so harde, that it wyl not cleue: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hyther to haue we sene any, that was

chyned. And they that sell it saye, it wyl in
no wise yane or chap. Whan it bourneth and
flameth, it maketh a swete odour: and there
foloweth fro it, whan it burneth, a gomme,
which we yet knowe not, for what purpose
it serueth: This gomme is somwat blacke,
&amp; shortly after it is fallen away, it is verye
hard. The barke is not so thyck, but is mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uaylous
hard. Whiche tokens well marked,
I thynke he that shal counterfete this wod,
can not deceyue the byer. For be it, a manne
may be deceyued in the colour, howe is hit
possible all these thinges to be in one, a fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,

weyght as no wodde hath beside? Than the
go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from it, whan it flameth?
suche hardnes that may scantly be cut? And
the lest pece cast into the water wil not swim

suffre a man to erre, whiche as it is to
al men vnplesant, so it is to me ye very ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant.
They say it contynueth not after it be
sodden, but paullethe, in the sommer after
iii. dayes, and in the wynter somewhat la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And therfore we muste chose the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

            <p>IT is ordred after this maner.
The wod must fyrst be made
as small as maye be, whiche
thynge somme do, at a torne,
and thanne without any more
ado, they laye the shauynges
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4540:17"/>

they brynge them into pouder and duste, to
thyntente they maye the sooner be throughe
soked, and theyr strength sodden out. But
I wote not, whether that make any mater,
I haue sene some, that haue cut it fyrst with
a sawe, and thanne raped the peses with a
rape, and haue taken and putte theym in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
water. Howe so euer it be, whether it be
tourned, raped, or beaten to duste, they
soke a day and a nyght one pounde weytght
in eyght of water, taken eyther of a welle
or of a ryuer, or as I dyd, of a pyt, than
they sethe it in a newe glased pot, and clene
wasshed, with a softe fyre of coles, by the
space of fyxe houres, and more, vntyll hit
come to the one halfe, with great hede ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge
and diligence, leeste hit runne ouer
through moche heate. For that which ouer
runneth loseth (they say) moch of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and is of lesse power. And therfore it
may not be sodden in the flame, but it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
fewe cooles, and a potte not fylled al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moste
by the .iii. parte. The skome that flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
aboue, they taken away to anoynt the
sores with: for we knowe it to haue moche
power to drye. After it is thus sodden, they
<pb facs="tcp:4540:18"/>
streyne it, &amp; powre it in to a glasse. And than
they put to the grondes eyght pound water
and sethe it agayne (as before) as it were
a seconde messhynge. This thynner they
gyue them to drinke with theyr meate: the
fyrste is dronke in the stede of a medicyne.
And this is all to gether, that delyuerethe
vs from so great and greuous disease, this
decoction is it. This is the chiefe poynt and
anker of our helth. And it hath so lytel nede
of any other thynge, that it wyll not abyde
any maner mixture, or mynglynge, as I
wyll shortly after declare. Somme wolde,
that lyght water and clere shuld be gotten
for this purpose. Some admytte all maner

wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the skom is perceiued to ryse, it must be
softely opened, and the skomme taken out,
and so couered agayne. They putte this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cortion
(whan it is streyned) into a glasse,
onely bycause it shulde be sene, and bycause
a glasse of all vessels is purest and clennest.
The colour of this decoction is some what

this .iiii. vnces of hony. Whiche thynge, as
I do not improue, so do I denye it to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarye.
And I wolde nothynge shoulde be
added vnto suche a thynge, beinge of suche
power, where as it nedeth not. For what
nedeth a man there to bestowe his labour,
where as no nede is: And to say the trouth,
the relesse of Guaiacum is not so grenous,
that it requireth to be tempred with hony.
Yea were it not for my maysters the phisy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

Howe be it what nedeth me to name phisy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

or wynde, where fyre muste
be nourysshed contynually:
or els he must be in a stewe,
after the maner of Almain,
whiche shall not nede alwayes to be kepte
hotte, but must be close, and defended from
ayre, that noo ayre blowe vppon hym for
the tyme of this curation, he muste also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of colde. Therfore if he be cured in
wynter, or in Autumne, he must loke, that
he haue fyre in his chaumber, erely in the
mornynge specyally before daye: for than
is the colde fernente, he must cause the clef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of the wyndowes, if any be, to be stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with playster, or other lyke matter, and
vpon the chaumbre doore must he hang car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pettes,
or other lyke thynges, within and
without, that no colde or ayre entre into the
chaumbre, or come out. whan he is thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
his meate must be dimynisshed. First
the fourthe parte of that he was wonte to

after the one halfe, that he maye lerne to

beare hunger: and his wyne muste be well
watered: thanne muste he take a purgation,
other with regarde that hit be suche a one
as shall be thought sufficient to cutte away
the cause, or take awaye the matter, that
norisheth the disease, other such a one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute

pounde of water is required to the sethynge
of one pounde of wodde, and the one halfe
therof muste be consumed in the sethynge,
that so there muste .iiii. pound remayne, and

It must be dronke at one draught with

            <p>¶After he hath dronke, let hym rest more

that that noyeth. whiche thyng to do howe

cometh. And it shall not hurte, if he be close

            <p>¶He must take his meate in the myddaye,
and not before, and than as lyttell as maye
be, for this medicine aboue all thynges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth

muste eate, not to fyll his emptynes, but to
beare vppe the lyfe, not to gether strength,
but to kepe hym selfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feinting. Nother is
there any ieoperdy to be feared. For Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iacum
hath great strength in it selfe both to
refresshe, and also to comforte, not suche

Ye they saye, that none faylleth, eate he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4540:21"/>
this decoction. In the meane tyme, he shall
not be anoynted in the out syde, excepte he

or els drye it into pouder, and caste it
vppon theym. And besydes this skomme,
there is nothynge of this decoction occupied
in the out parte. Some be healed in shorte
tyme, and some in longe. The moste parte
in .xxx. dayes. They commaunde hym to
be pourged agayne the .xv. daye. For this
reason I thynke, bycause, as Alexander A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodicius
thynketh, they that hungre and
receyue not theyr meate as they were wont
to do, falle awaye, and gather a certayne

muste be auoyded, that the body of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

may be emptie. This decoction shall not be
dronken that mornynge, whan he receiueth
his purgation: but at nyght lette hym take
it agayne, and after that day, he maye eaie
more largely. And agayne the .xxx. daye
more lyberally: how be it this more liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and that more largely must be very lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
as I shall shewe you in the next chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

But some, leste any impedime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And althoughe the desyre of eatyng growe
dayly more and more, yet must he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre

            <p>¶Whan this cure is comme to an ende, so
that the sicke is almoste redy to goo abrode.
he muste than take agayne some medicine to
purge hym with, but so that after that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
he may drinke agayne as he dydde
before .iiii. or fixe dayes space, wherwith
they make vp the hole cure. Some wyl not
that he shulde go out of the chambre, where
he lyeth, before he be through hoole. Some
thynke .xxx. dayes suffyciente to kepe his
chambre: and that he may than go forthe.
But yet warely by lyttell and lyttelle, and
not streyght into the open ayre: but fyrste
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4540:22"/>
he must walke in the same house, from cham<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bre

house, not ferre of: vntyl he be vsed
to suffer the ayre. For there maye be no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne
chaunge, but muste vse hym selfe to
all thynges by lyttell and lyttell. And that
whiche remayneth of the syckenesse they say
wyll lyghtely be hoole, after he ones stere
abrode. And that to be trew I haue proued
in my selfe. For whan the .xxx. days were
passed, the soores of my legges were not
yet closed, and therfore I kepte .x. dayes
more. And whan those .x. days were gone,
yet was not I hoole. Wherfore, ferynge the
colde, bycause wynter than beganne. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to kepe in other .x. dayes: but I was
compelled by the phisitions counsell to goo
abrode, and put it in auenture, which thing
happed not amysse. Howe be it the soores

they had scantly the .xl. daye after I wente

made my iourneye frome Vindele into
Frannce. The causes of this slowe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng

suffred me to eate more mete (as I after per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyued)
than I shulde haue done, and also
he sodde my drynke thynner than he ought.
For I occupied not fully .v. pounde of this

that a lyttell thynge was sufficient to driue

haue loked what my body was thanne, but
what maner body it was wonte to be, and
agayn the nature of this medicine is suche,
that it wyl suffer none to faynt for lacke of

they ought not therfore to ministre the lesse,

drawe out and emptye the holle body. But
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4540:27"/>
what saye ye therto: In that rude countrey
where this Guaiacum groweth, are no phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
no straunge nor ferfetched wayes
nor rules of phisike. But perchaunce menne
vse there some herbe or rote to purge with,
and all do vse one thynge, not to take away
the grefe, but that whan the bely is emptied
Guaiacum may the better worke. wherfore
in this, my coumsel is, that ye tourment not
your belye with thynges costely prepared,
and speciallye to auoyde the compositions
made of many thynges.</p>
            <p>¶In this mynde I stycke surely, that I
wolde suffre nothyng to be poured into me,
but onely cassia by it selfe, and yet they offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me gladly many thynges, And I was
also wont before to poure in not onely Reu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>barbarum
but other thynges also more bar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>barous
than Reubarbarum, but my counsel
came to a very good ende. whiche counselle
if any wyll folowe, he hathe an exaumple,
commaundement he hath none. For we tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
not these thynges being our selfe taught
of other, but we monyshe you, that whiche
we haue proued, whiche thynge I wold all
shulde remembre, that I teache nothynge
here rasshely, but that whiche I haue ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by myne owne experience and proue, I
<pb facs="tcp:4540:28"/>
delyuer vnto other. And if I hadde lerned
ought els, it shulde not be kepte close: but
nowe seinge by diligent serche and studious
labour I haue founde oute the power and
vertue of Guaiacu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche if I do not well

seynge many well lykynge men of nature
are corrupted through the diuersitie of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
yea and some of them vtterly dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
my sentence is, that nothynge shall
be added to helpe this medicine, for this
wod of it selfe is sufficient to plucke vp this
dysease by the rootes. If any thyng be put
vnto if, specyally of these thynges, that are
inwardely receyued, this medicine takethe
no helpe therof, but rather is corrupted and
lette from his workynge. This thynge
muste be added thervnto, that they, which
drynke of this Guaiacum, of whatte soo

lytel nede of bathes, that they be vtterly for

And these, whan they were taught of them

dyspraysed this wodde Guaiacum, as a

that the marchauntes fained it to do these
thynges. But shortely after this lewde dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preiser
was called vnto the cure of a certain

And whan the man beganne to smelle the

he began fyrste to be more gentylle, and to
diminishe his cruelnes and malyce more and

            <p>¶And after this maner this medicine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

that the phisitions can handel this busynesse
more counnyngly, than they whiche knewe
it by experience in them selfe, consyderynge
howe that Guaiacum hath not continued so
longe with vs, that they might in that space
haue serched and lerned his nature. And to
speke in fewe wordes, men do yet meruayle

any cause of his operation shewed.</p>
            <p>¶Lette this therfore stycke fast in al mens

sufficient to cure and heale them, which we
teache by experience, in our selfe. Let them

Let them bede farewell for euer and a daye

that there is a seruant of my faders, which
with .iii. certayne herbes sodden in wyne,
hath healed a mannes brayne panne broken
to peces: and many sore and euyll woundes
hath he heled with a few herbes of our own
growynge, sodden in wyne or water, and
that within .x. or .xii. dayes, without any
feare of feuer. But this they thynke a vyle
medicine, sayinge it is not done after theyr
canons. And the same thynge do they iudge
of Guaiacum, whose nature and power,
howe clerelye they vnderstande, and what
maner wordes they vse to haue of hit, we
may perceyue by the answere of a certayne
noble phisition, not nowe yonge, that he

myndes of the Germaynes, for the mooste
parte, are meryly set, what shulde cause vs
to thynke, but that our region and men be
very apte vnto this medicine? Whiche thing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4540:35"/>
Paulus Ricius, a phisition of pure iugement
and hygh erudition, approuethe, and more
ouer affirmeth, that he knowethe by playne
experience, that no nation is more apte vnto
this dyete. But if we had not sene some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
vnto helthe throughe the helpe of
Guaiacum, and nowe shuld begyn to proue
hit: we oughte not beleue, that god were so
moche sette agaynste vs, that he wolde ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kepe this helthfull medicine from vs,
or defraude vs of the vertue therof, seynge
it was brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Spagnola into Spaine,
and had the same vertue there, whiche hit
hadde at home: excepte a man wylle saye,
that Guaiacum disdayneth to be caryed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, his nature fyrste not chaunged, or
whan it commeth to the Germaynes, that
than it suffreth that great and myghtye po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and strength of his, to be taken from
hym, and no where els. And it is playnely
knowen, that with vs his helpe is very pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent,
and peraduenture more presente than
els where. And our men, as they be moche
gyuen to surfetynge, so can they, if nede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
abyde very longe and strongely both
hunger and thurste. And more ouer as our
bodyes abunde with heate, so are they very
strong. For after the iudgement of Aristot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb facs="tcp:4540:36"/>
they that inhabyte cold countreys, haue
moche naturall hete in them, and they that
haue moche heate, for the moste part are of
great strengthe. And bycause the Almayns
vse moche eatynge and drinkyng, Ricius the
phisition was demaunded of late, what he
thought, whether it were best to remyt som<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>what
vnto them in this cure of this skle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der
and thyn dyete, and he sayd: No by sayncte
mary, not thus moche, but rather handle
them the strayter, lette these greatte belyes
vsed in eatynge and drynkynge, be dryuen
to a moche thynner dyete than these thynne
and leane Italians. And he shewed me hym
selfe, that he hadde punysshed with hunger
one of these fatte felowes .x. dayes lenger
than he ought to haue done, bicause he wold
haue nothynge remayne that myght let the
operation of Guaiacum.</p>
            <p>¶This thynge and suche other I do glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reherse by Ricius, and doo make often
mention of Stromer, that such as shal rede
this boke may vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, whom I cal good

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4540:36"/>
And that I delyte as moche in the
lernynge and amitie of them, that be good
and well lerned, as I hate these vnlerned
and foolehardy felowes, whiche after they
be for theyr moneye ones made doctours,
streyght professe, that they can reuyue the
deed, and restore lyfe to theym that are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed.
But I wyll retourne vnto these .ii.
whiche be of an other sorte, of the whiche
two Stromer, whan I asked hym the laste
yere a medicine to pounge me with, sayde,
Do not vexe thy stomake with medicines in
this age of thynne, in whiche nature is able
of her selfe to do all thynges moche better.
For as he is very scarse in pourynge in of
medicines, so bryngeth he all sycke people
vnto a verye strayte rule of dyet. Wherfore
whan he had taken in hande to cure one in
the cytie of August after these wayes, and
he sayd, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

hym selfe from women: Seinge than
(sayde he) thou haste decreed to dye, thou
hast no nede of my helpe, and so forsoke him
and lefte hym to his intemperauncie.</p>
            <p>¶Of this sorte there are two phisitions
moo, of excellent name: wherof the one is
thy phisition, mooste noble prynce, named
Gregory Loppus, whiche hath holpen me
<pb facs="tcp:4540:37"/>
no lyttell thynge in the wrytynge hereof,
the other continuethe in the archebysshoppe
of Colyns courte, called Iames Ebelly,
a man of so great auctoritie, that foure yere
afore, that he was made the commen phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
all phisitions were they neuer so coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge,
gaue place vnto hym. The other
was hadde in great honour of all the chiefe
lerned men of Papia, where this study flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryssheth,
as well for the knowlege in phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sike
as for other good lernynge, whiche he
had ioyned vnto phisik. But this is no place
to reken vppe the excellent lerned men, but
my purpose is to wryte myne experience of
Guaiacum. And therfore in this place I re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pete
this to conclude with, that I verylye
thynke, that this wodde wyll helpe al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of men, where so euer they be become,

            <p>IT semeth for somme causes
that folowe, that it is better
to proue this cure in sommer
than in wynter. Fyrst bicause
(as Galen saythe) the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
in sommer increasethe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4540:37"/>
and runneth in all the body, and dothe goo
and comme: and therfore the pestilente hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
maye lyghty be seperated from the
good, and they maye be expelled and banys<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shed:
and these that be holsome &amp; good kept.
Secondely bycause all diseases in wynter
do fasten theyr rotes deper, and take surer
holde, and in sommer contrarye wyse, the
humours be styll mouynge, and the body is
apte vnto all chaunges. But these consyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
apperteyne generally vnto all dise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
But as concernynge this our cure of
Guaiacum, for as moche as a great parte
of hit stondethe in dyete and sufferaunce of
great hunger, therfore it is most expediente
to beginne in sommer. In that season a man
may better away with this dyete thanne in
wynter, whan men are very hungry. For if
the body, beynge hotte and boylynge of it
selfe, as it is in sommer, shoulde moreouer
be loded with meate, hit wolde lyghtely be
dissolued into diseases. But in the wynter if
woll not soo, for so moche, as hipocrates
saythe, that in wynter a mannes bodye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
aboundeth with naturall heate, and
outwardly lacketh it, for so moche <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as than
it auoydethe and fleeth from the sharpnesse
of the cold, wherwith the body outwardly
<pb facs="tcp:4540:38"/>
is compassed, into the inwarde parties, as
vnto a stronge holde and castell: and there
closeth it selfe vppe: But contrary wyse in
sommer the same naturall heate in mannes
body foloweth, as Aristotle thynkethe, the
nature of the ayre, and therfore puttethe
forthe it selfe, and fleeth out to the extreme
partes of the bodye. But so it is, that the
very nature and propretie of this medicine
is, to reduce into the body, and bryng home
agayne suche naturall heate as is loste.</p>
            <p>And therfore this it semethe vnconueniente
to go in hande with, or pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e in experience
this cure in the winter. For tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is thought
daungerous, whan the hete of the outward
partes is drawen vnto the inwarde partes,

specyally in them that be colde of nature,
whiche other wyse in the wynter lose theyr
heate, and haue theyr bodys slayn through
the violence of colde, and be lyke vnto deed
folke.</p>
            <p>¶But here maye we not passe ouer that,
whiche Coppus admonyssheth, sayinge,
Guaiacum moueth a manne to sweate, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ull
to the body: Therfore sayth he, the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4540:38"/>
sommer is moste apte for this cure, whan
the humours are more subtylle, and the
skyn thynner. And in the wynter the wayes
and poores, by the whiche the sweate shuld
haue his course, and be expelled, are stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and the humours gathered to gether,
and clodded. But on the other syde for soo
moche as in this cure doone by Guaiacum,
the sycke are greued with nothynge more,
than with thurste, it is thought, that the syck
maye worse absteyne from drynke in somer
than in wynter. Wherfore in Spayne, and
where the heate is vehement, they durst not
hytherto proue this experiment in the som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
Furthermore in wynter (after the
mynd of Alexander Aphrodisius) there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth
on a man throughe moche eatynge
(For than haue men moche better appetite
thanne in other seasons) an humour called
pituita, that is fleume, which thyng mought
be auoyded, if this cure were than in hande,
in whiche, great abstinence must be obserued
and kepte. These thynges we haue spoken
as touchynge the tymes of feruente heate
and feruent colde, and nowe we wyll speke
of the other two seasons that be betwyxte
bothe, of the whiche two. Autumne semeth
the worste of both. For than is there great
<pb facs="tcp:4540:39"/>
abundaunce of all maner syckenes, and the
humours wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e worse and worse, bycause
this tyme of the yere is vnegall and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
order, alwayes chaungynge and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
brynging in many kyndes of diseases.
For as Celsus affyrmeth, Autumne killeth
many a one.</p>
            <p>¶Furthermore the french pockes are very
noyful to the synowes, and the sayd author
teacheth, that wynter and Autumne be not
mete nor apt tymes vnto medicines, for the
resolution of the synowes. But these are
the reasons of them that dispute generally
and speake not onely of the vse of Guaiacu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Wherfore this I thynke, that sommer (at
the lefte wayes in Almayne) maye be beste
taken: but that is that part of sommer, that
begynneth whanne vere endeth, as in May,
for than there is not here soo moche heate,
but the sycke maye well abyde and suffer
thyrst: And in wynter the cold is very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uente,
and lykewyse in vere and Autumpne
the colde is sharper, thanne the sycke maye
abyde in this cure. For it is one of the chiefe
poyntes for hym that is restored by Guaia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cum,
with all diligence to eschewe colde.</p>
            <p>And as for suche incommodities, as maye
happen in the sommer, to the intente they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4540:39"/>
maye the lesse be feared, I haue spoken of
before, and shal repete them agayne, whan
place shal be. And neuertheles at this tyme
I do affirme, that this drynke of Guaiacu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
doth meruaylously stere vp the naturall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and strengthe, and hathe power and
myght to quicken and to make lusty the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
whiche for lacke of naturall heate is
weake and consumed: Whiche thynges if
they were not as I haue sayde, and had not
Hipocrates in a certayne place, if I well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre

not that any man shulde vse suche his great
benefyte vnpurely. And therfore amonges

kepeth his course of workynge many

that were vexed with ache in theyr limmes,
whiche throughe one yeres abstinence from

herein. And fyrste of alle as moche as
appertaynethe vnto his dysease, howe the
sycke muste forbeare salte meates, not alle
maner, but onely suche as are very sharpe.
Lette it be asked of the phisitions, whiche
haue long before tyme prosecuted that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the vttermost, for this tyme, seynge
the medicine of Guaiacum is specyally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
of, we may say, that though all phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
knowe the vse of salte, excepte hit be
<pb facs="tcp:4540:43"/>
very lyttell, to be noyous and hurtefull in
all other passions of the synowes, and in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
diseases as sprynge of corrupte bloude,
and of yelowe and blacke colour, or salte
fleume, for so moche as with his tartshes, it
narpeneth coler, and burneth the bloudde,
and with his natiue drynes causeth the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and nutriment of the body to dry vp,
and by that meanes distroyeth all thynges,
that shulde helpe vnto helthe. Yet neuer the
lesse about the administration of Guaiacum
they forbede vtterly all maner vse of salte:
for the same consyderation they fordede all
sharpe thynges, and moreouer all thynges
penetratine: and amonges these, spices, and
wyne. For so moche as all suche throughe
theyr sharpenes and persynge power, do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
all poores and entreyes, and goo depe: whiche
violence runnyng through the body,
Guaiacum can haue no place to worke. If
these reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do not satisfie those mens min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
I wyl say vnto them, as the philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
say of the stone Magnes, if it be anoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
with garlyke, it draweth not yron to it,
so lyke wise Guaiacu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath a certayne secret
vertue, and can not tell whither it be as yet
knowen, to abhorre specially the vse of salt,
and whiche power is loste if salt ones come
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4540:43"/>
vnto it. And this haue we spoken of the for
bearynge of salte in this cure. Nowe wylle
we speke of the sklender fedynge and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

            <p>ALthoughe we spake before
of the smale and thynne fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge,
that the sycke muste
vse, and howe his meat must
be diminished, &amp; he brought

very necessary to warne you ones agayne of
the same thynge, in this place, not onely bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this medicine requireth a voyde and
an emptye body, frome all maner fulnes,
but also bycause I wolde declare, that in
olde tyme there was a lyke maner to cure
the sike. And we may also rede in Diodoro,
that the Egiptians dydde heale theyr sycke
other with fastynge or els with vomyt. For
they affirme, as he recyteth, that sycknesses
are ingendred specially of the superfluitie
of meate. And therfore they thoughte that
<pb facs="tcp:4540:44"/>
waye of curynge to make moste vnto helth,
that tuketh awaye the fyrste causes of the
disease. Let not therfore these dronkerdes,
these interpretate felowes, gyuen to surfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge,
be greued with this dyete, which as
Persius sayth, delyteth only in delitious fe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dynge,
and may lyue scantely halfe a daye
without meate: whose bealy as the prophet
saythe, is their god, and all theyr mynde
and lyfe is nothynge but fedynge. Let such
felowes, as I sayde, cesse theyr grudginge
agaynst this dyete, seyng that therby so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and so good a thyng is obteyned, and
so great an euyll is auoyded with so lyttell
labour. And let them not than in this thyng
speake of the great ieoperdye, whiche maye

tolde you, that this is no new maner of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge:
for alwayes the best phisitions haue
commaunded abstinence to the sycke. Of
the whiche nombre is Asclepiades, who, as
Celsus sayth, writeth, that the mooste so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

he hath proued it, to diminisshe the strength

Wherfore afterwarde whan it chanced him

            <p>¶And in Lucian Gallus the cocke Pitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
iugeth it a great benefit of god giuen
to Micyllus, bycause he coude alway with

was without such dysease. Nowe what shal
we saye to that, whiche as sayncte Hierome
wrytethe, that certayne dyseased with the
ioint ache and the goute, after theyr goodes
were gone, and were from them, and were
broughte to poore fare and symple meate,
they dydde recouer theyr helthe? For they

            <p>¶This story may be a lernynge vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

mete with a gentylman, who asked him whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
he was goynge? the abbotte made him
answere and sayd, that he must go vnto the
bathes. Why (quod the gentylman) are ye
sicke? Nay (quod the abbot) I am not sicke,
but I haue no appetite vnto my meate. I go
therfore now vnto the bathes to get againe
myne appetite, whiche I dydde of late lose:
for they are holsom therfore. Veryly (quod

certayne dayes hungerly: and than at laste
he asked hym, whether he had an appetite to

sayth (quod the gentylman) than is it reson
that thou gyne me a rewarde for my medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
and made hym pay two hundred crow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes,
and sente hym awaye in good helthe,
with suche an appetite, that he coude haue
eaten bothe beanes and lekes, where as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he refused all maner meate, were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

we haue spoken more than ynoughe of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4540:46"/>
this thynge, therfore let vs go vnto other
matters: But first I must tell you (to make
an ende of this chapiter) that Guaiacum
requyrethe not a bealy that is replenysshed
with varyetie of meates, or troubled with
wynde in the inwarde partes, but purified
and clensed from al rawnes and grosnes of

he maye not be holpen with meate, but with

howe it shulde chaunce in any manne, I can

            <p>Excepte any had leuer folowe that, whiche
Gellsius sayth, that Erastrat dydde write,
that the Scythians, whan they for somme
cause muste nedes suffer hunger, do thruste
together theyr bely and bind it round about
very straitly with brode swadlynge bondes,
thynkyng that by suche pressynge to gether
of theyr bealy, hunger may be putte away,
or the easelyer borne. For seing, as he saith,
hunger commeth of emptines, and is caused
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4540:47"/>
of the voydnes and holownesse of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayles,
and of the bealy, than whanne the
bealy is gyrded in harde, so that the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
is filled, and the holownes ioyned, there
can be no hunger where as these thynges be
not, and vtterlye forbearynge of meate,
may lightly be born. But why say I, vitterly
for bearyng of meate, whiche can not be in
this cure? I may well calle it hunger, what
so euer it be, that any abydeth. For it maye
be suffred well aud easely, thoughe a man
take nothynge in the worlde to helpe it. But
vnto these deynteous sycke persones what
thynge can be lyght? whiche can not onely
suffer no hunger, but also not to haue a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make

For the whiche if at any tyme they be
sycke, we mought praye god, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

            <p>¶Trewely the old Germayns mynded no
such voluptuous plesures, and they thought
it a very straunge thynge, to lyue any thing
wantonly or nycely. I haue harde some old

it was a suspecte thynge to weare a gowne,
whan we now a dayes do honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppe

            <p>They were couered with the skynnes of

example therof cometh fro them spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
that be called prestes? What they be

it hath pleased god to gyue trewer eyes to

<pb facs="tcp:4540:52"/>
the seruice of god, but euerye one of theym

For we be so farre gone, that we excede all

It had more becommed vs to haue dryuen

Ryche? For it medleth not with them that

me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s heedes, that fyrst receyued these euyls

vnworthy for the grauite of the Germains.
Truely they, oure forefathers, were none
suche, the whiche preferred the labours and
peines of Hercules aboue the fleshly lustes,
obone the delycate meatis and softe beddes
of Sardanapalus. But O lorde Chyrste,
howe delycate, howe holsomme fedynge is
breadde made of rye or whete, and gruelle
made of millio, oriza, ptisana, and otemele
porage? Adde thervnto so many kyndes of
herbes, and so many dyuers garden spyces,

whiche is the pure and cleane drynke of the
erthe, as Appollonius iudgeth: so that it be
vsed scarsly, whether it growe in France, or
vpon the bankes of Rhenus. We haue also
of our owne beestes fleshe bothe tame and

minister all thynges necessarye for the lyfe

is, that they neuer lacke the gowte, nor the
frenche pockes, that can not lyue withoute
pepper: And I pray god, they may ones be
brought to extreme hunger, whiche nowe
serche in all places, not for meate to lyue
with, but for delycates and deintees, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they may stere vp their swete mouthes
and prouoke theyr appetites. Howe iustely
dyd Galenus enuie helth to suche felowes,
whan he forbode all phisitions from the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe
of dronkerdes, and of theym that are
gyuen to the bely? If such at any time were
sycke, for they by and by (sayth he) through
intemperate lyuynge hepe vppe again grosse

that my regall abundaunce kepte me from?
<pb facs="tcp:4540:56"/>
By the which example we may knowe, that
they onely lyue in knowlege of theyr owne
lyfe, that lyue scarsely and soberly: And on

            <p>Howe be it within short space, whan they be

to fele and perceyue, what lyfe they haue
chosen, and what is the reward of the same.
For as Persius sayth, whan the harde, and

Thou woldest haue lyttie ioyntes, &amp; a hole

            <p>¶And Cicero bringeth in Cato saying: that
a libidinous and intemperate youth, maketh
age very feble. And he aduyseth and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saileth
vs to eate and drink so moch as may
susteine the bodily strength, &amp; not oppresse it,
thynkynge that nothing can be so vnfrendly
vnto the mynde of man, whiche he callethe

bereth rule, Temperance can haue no place:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4540:57"/>
Neither vertue may beare any stroke, where
luste and pleasure reigneth. And therfore he
iudgeth, that we ought to gyue great than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes

not to do that thynge, whiche we ought not.
For voluptuousnes, sayth he, beinge an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemye

And therfore he thinketh, that olde men

for they make the bodye colde: and

Fyrst bycause the body is emptied in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnynge

            <p>¶I haue lerned, that Guaiacum helpethe
by lyttell and lytell, and not sodaynly, and
gothe forwarde fayre and easely, and not
violently. For it is so far from the trouthe,
to thynke that it helpeth one sodaynely, that
somtymes, from the first daye to the .xxv. the
disease cometh so sharpe, and the peyne and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4540:64"/>

that a man wold thynke hym selfe in

and the rootynge vp is peynful, or els that
the alteration, whiche than is caused in the
disposition of the body, breakyng out with
a great violence and shaking, putteth a man
to greuous peyne. For vndoubtedly this me
dicine draweth out this myscheuous disease
by the rootis, and that dothe it vnto somme
forth with after they begyn to take it, and
to some other it tarieth a longer tyme: but
it doth so to no man before the .vii. day, and
to many (as it dyd to me) after the .xx. day,
if it tarye longer er hit worke this effecte,
than the defaute is other whyle in the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entis,
whan they wyll vse excesse in feding.
In me (as I sayde afore) the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>te was in

the phisitions in preparynge therof, made it

the longer er it wrought on me. And I haue
harde phisitions say, that accordynge to the
complexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the bodies it worketh soner &amp;
slowlyer. And this is sure &amp; certayne, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
thyng Stromer ofte affirmed vnto me,
<pb facs="tcp:4540:65"/>
that if they, the whose wyt is more subtyle,
and are ryghte attentiuely gyuen vnto study,
happe to falle sycke, theyr diseases shall be
more vehemente and longer continue. And
many thynke, that it skylleth greattely, as
well in this disease, as other, in what placis
of the body the syckenes shuld chaunce, for
the ryghte part is more healeable than the
left. Bycause, saythe Alexander, by larger
exercyse the matter is stopped, and made
more apte to heale. Also they say, it is more
harder to heale the vttermost partis, bicause
they be farre of from the body, it is longer
they can be nouryshed and fedde. And there
it is to be taken hed, whether the grefe doth
ascende or discend. Celsus sayth, that what
so euer grefe goth downeward, is the more
curable. And agayne. All grefe, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth
vpwarde, is worse for the medycyne
to come vnto. And that suche diseases, that
chaunce in our secrete partys, as they are
moste plentefull and sharpe, by reason of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation
(whervnto those partes are spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
subiectes) so are they forth with and
soonest healed. Whiche as in all other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
they maye be moued, so for the newe
vse brought vppe of Guaiacum, I wote not
whether it be alway so or no. But this lette
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4540:65"/>
euery man take hede of, that where so euer
the grefe be, and with what soo euer kynde
of the pockes they be peyned, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
well Guaiacum, and after they haue
dronke so long therof that it be spredde and
ronne into the veynes: thanne ye maye be
sure theyr ache lyttell and lytel goth away.
And otherwhyle the ache commeth agayne,
and is more sharpe and peynefull: and goth
away agayne. For after it ones begynneth
to swage, and than waxeth soore and peyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
it endurethe not longe. And they that
haue soores, shall haue the flesshe eaten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
about the soores of a greate breadthe.
And that is a token, they begynne to heale.
For vnto me it cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced, as it neuer did afore,
that about the .xxv. daye my legges were
eaten so bare, that ye myghte haue sene the
bone the breadth of a mannes nayle, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
thynge putte me in great feare: but with
out any difficultie, within a fewe daies after
the fleshe grewe and was restored agayne.
And by this I perceyue well, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this medicine is to purifie and clense
the soores vnderneth and vnder the fleshe,
to proue and shewe fyrste the vertue therof.
Hytherto haue I sene fewe or none, whose
soores were cleane healed, that were kepte
<pb facs="tcp:4540:66"/>
close tyl they healed. And therfore I haue
hard many expert therin say, that tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iacum
maketh an ende of his operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whan
the pacient returneth to his meate, and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
thynge taketh agayne his olde custome
of ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inge. I tolde you before, that it was
necessary for me to kepe in, tyll the .xl. daye.
Al thynges wel pondered, I perceyue, that
this medicine requyrethe a longe season to
worke perfectly. For the nature of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
is not to breake, or plucke awaye the
bloud, but by lyttel and lyttel to amend and
purifie it (in whiche bloud beinge corrupte,
resteth all the force and strength of this dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease)
and to expel and diuide fro the body
the hurtful humours, that are norysshmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of this disease, from some in theyr vrine
and sweatynges, and from other somme in
their sieges. And whan of this disease a man
begynneth to waxe whole, than the fyrst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
of Guaiacum is to make a man to
sweate, and secondly by the passages of the
vrine it purgeth, by which menes it fetcheth
out &amp; voydeth marueylous foule fylthynes.
And than the handes and feete waxe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylous
colde, in so moche that they seme to
haue no heate in them at all. Wherof physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
saye this is the cause, that than this
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4540:66"/>
medicine draweth the heate from the vtter
partes to the inner, the whiche inward par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
after they be warmed and made hotte,
than the heate spredeth it selfe in to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
parties. For this, without any doubt
is proued, that theyr lymmes, that be heled
with Guaiacum be moste hotte. And .vi. or
vii. wynters nexte folowynge, my legges
and fete wolde be so colde, that I coude ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
gette them warme inoughe, thoughe I
wrapped them in neuer soo many clothes,
nowe they waxe so warme, that with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thyn hose or suche lyke garment, I put a
way the colde. These thynges thus vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
and knowen, we muste comme to this
poynte, that is, to knowe the operation of
Guaiacum, and agaynste what sycknesses
it helpeth.</p>

            <head>¶What power Guaiacum is of,
and what sycknesses it hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth.
Cap. xxiiii.</head>
            <p>THe mooste principall and the
chieffest effect of Guaiacum
is to hele the frenche pockes
cleane, pluckyng them vppe
by the rootes, but specially
whan a man hath ben disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="tcp:4540:67"/>
with them of alonge tyme. For I haue
sene them, that many a day laye soore pey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the pockes, sooner and better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
vnto theyr helth, than they, on whom
the scabbes beganne newly to appere. Not
that on those, newelye diseased any thynge
shoulde be lefte vnhealed, but that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge
goothe forwarde more hardely, and
the disease stycketh faster and is more gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uousely
plucked out. For Guaiacum doth
resolue &amp; distroy meruailously swellinges,
getherynges to gether of yll matters, hard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesses,
bumpes, and knobbes. Fluxions or
runnynges it vtterly taketh awaye, eyther
consuminge or tournynge the same an other
waye. It causeth the soores to impostume
withoute any maner of grefe. And if any
thynge lye hydde within, it rooteth it oute.
And soo of some (as hit dydde to me) hit
maketh the bones bare, of some it shewethe
the synowes, and breaketh the veynes, or
eateth moste depelye in, and it healeth these
partyes that be infected with this disease,
and with suche stynche and fylthinesse, that
the sauoure canne not be abyden.</p>
            <p>And therfore the phisitions saye, that the
vertue of this medicine is to heate, to drye,
and to amende the fautes ol the bloude and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4540:67"/>
of the lyuer: but it worketh all these thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
with suche a temperaunce, that indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,
whether the cause be hotte or colde
it easethe the pacientes. Wherfore with the
drynes therof it restreyneth the flyde, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyenge
the hurtfull humours that flowe
oute, orelles plucketh vp by the rootes the
cause of theyr begynnynge, and restorethe
agayne the good disposition of the body. It
dothe extenuate fleme, and the poores or
passages of the vryne, that chaunce manye
tymes by perunctions to be shutte, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
other in this disease hit openethe, ye and
prouoketh &amp; compelleth the vryne to make
and haue way. For the whiche skylle some
thynke it helpeth them that haue the stone,
and that it compelleth the stones to issue out
of the bladder. I haue experyence, that hit
greately mynisheth blacke coler. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it maketh a man more gladsome, and
quencheth anger. Vndoubtedly hit hathe a
a greater vertue agaynst melancolye. And
hit taketh away runnynges and droppyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and it lyghtneth his heuynes, by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
(as it may be thought) the brayne. It
is sayde, that hit amendeth soores, whiche
were before yll healed, howe soo euer they
come, and cuttethe agayne the scarres. It
<pb facs="tcp:4540:68"/>
amendeth the leannes, whiche hath longe
contynued in the body. And therfore whan
this cure is done, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> waxe very fat al their
lyfe after. They saye it hath a meruaylous
vertue ageynst the stynkyng of the mouth, &amp;
doth amende the griefe of the brethe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
also cometh through the faute of anoyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tynge.
It helpeth the inwarde parties, and
specially the stomacke, the which it holle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neweth,
and maketh the brokynge as good
as euer it was before. His effect is excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
for the membres that be fallen awaye and
diminished, it increaseth theym and fyllethe
them vp, it stretcheth forth the sinowes that
are shro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke, and those that be lose it fastneth
and maketh stronge. It is also proued, that
suche parties as throughe this disease be
made deed and without felyng, are agayne
quickened and brought to theyr olde felyng
and lustynesse. I sayde before, that as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge
the bealy it varyed. For some it dyd
bynde, and some it made laxe tyl they were
wery. And agayne, somme it dyd bynde in
the begynnynge, and afterwarde hit losed
theym, and made them lanke belyed. And
that the verye shauynges broken as smalle
as coude be, to the mountenaunce of halfe
an vnce, was gyuen in drynke to prouoke
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4540:68"/>
a siege. I haue also sayde, that the measure
therof is not gyuen after the proportion of
his strength, that receyueth it. For hit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not one weaker whan it is mynistred.
And now this one thyng I affirme, that if it
be .iiii. tymes sodden, yet is not all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
gone out. Wherin I do not beleue other
men, but I my selfe haue proued it. Howe
be it I deny not, but the fyrst broth is moch
stronger. Somme there are, that stedfastly
beleue, that it is very good for fistules and
cankers, and for the parties that be eaten
with cankers. Certayne it is, it helpeth them
that fetche theyr wynde with peyne, and can
not breth, if that faulte come throughe this
sickenes, or throughe anoyntyng.</p>
            <p>¶And for as moche as I haue shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what euyls come with this sickenes, it
were but labour in vayne to repete them,
whiche all it taketh awaye, distroyeth, and
vanquyssheth, as I before tolde: and that
(if they be olde) very lyghtly. And in lyke
maner it helpeth the gowte. For I my selfe
haue sene two restored to helth, which were
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore vexed in their fete: but yet the physy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
saye, that it helpeth onely those that
haue gotten the gowte through colde, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
thynge I leue to them to complayne of.
<pb facs="tcp:4540:69"/>
It is also an helthfull remedy for the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey,
and especially whan it is new and late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begonne. For than it quencheth and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
it away: whiche thynge I doo wryte
vppon the reporte of faythfulle and sadde
men, that haue knowlege therof. For as for
me, I dyd neuer hytherto se any that was
so delyuered.</p>
            <p>¶Ricius tolde of a leper, the which though
he were not cleane delyuered by this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
yet was he made moch better and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and suche a man as men myght suffer
his company: so that Ricius iudgeth, that
this medicine is able to hyde and stoppe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie,
though it can not take it clene away.
But if this cure were vsed ones agayne or
often, than he beleued, that the great hurte
of that disease shulde be put of for a longe
tyme. And more ouer he hadde great hope,
that if this syckenes were thus preuented
in the beginninge, it myghte vtterly be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and clensed, and the syke restored. And
for as moche as this medicine hath vertue
to drye vppe, some go aboute to minister hit
for the water betwexte the flesshe and the
skynne, whiche is called the dropsie, the
ende wherof we loke for. It is well kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
to be profitable agaynste the fallynge
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4540:69"/>
euyll, as the phisitions saye, if the dysease
be of a colde kynde. I haue sene theym that
were inwardely dyseased and greued with
manye other syckenesses, that were of an
euyll and corrupted stomacke, and coulde
but badly digeste, and whan they wolde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
them selfes from theyr long feblenes
and sycklynes, and repayre agayne theyr
strengthe and helth, haue prepared theym
selfes vnto this cure, the phisitions not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uysynge
them the contrary. And Ricius ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth
the same in many. For so moche as
he knewe (as he sayde) that a hoole man, or
but lyttell acrased, myghte come vnto this
cure without any hurt: and he dyd perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleue, that the good lykynge of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
was kepte, preserued, defended, and
confirmed therwith. Let hit nowe contente
you, to haue harde spoken these thynges
of the helpes of Guaiacum, of the whiche
if any man wyll aske me the causes, I wyll
sende hym to the phisitions that be experte.
For as for me, I professe no suche thynge.
Neyther yet dydde I begynne this boke, to

sayinge: And thou lykewyse fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
in no meanes, seinge thou art suche one

            <p>¶The same Diogenes, that was wonte to
be so styffe a philosofer, what trow ye wold
he haue sayd, if he had beholde and sene me,
whan I was lykewyse vexed, as they that
hadde the palsey, and besydes that was so
lothe some both in syght and sauour, that al
were greued with me, and some dydde hate
me? And yet I dyd lyue and had some hope,
although I had ben oftentimes deluded and
mocked through the great promyses of the
phisitions. And lest any man shulde thynke
that my disease was eyther lyght, or in one
parte onely, I wyl shewe in what takyng I
was. Fyrst I coulde doo nothynge with my
lefte foote, for there had this euyl dwelled
viii. yeres and more, and in the mydlegge,
where the shyn is couered with flesshe very
thynne, there were sores inflamed through
the inflamation of the fleshe, rottyng with
great ache and bournynge, and as soone as
one waxed hoole, an other brake vppe. For
there were many, here some and there some,
whiche coulde by no helpe of the phisitions
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4540:71"/>
be brought to gether in one. Ouer them was
a knobbe soo harde, that a man wolde haue
thought it a bone, and in that was exceding
peyne and ache, beatyng and pryckyng with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
ceassynge. There was also verye nyghe
to the ryght ancle aboue, a certayne swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge
and gatheryng, which was also hard
lyke a bone, and was the oldest of all, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
remayned the remenantes of this pesty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
fresshe and newe rysen.</p>
            <p>¶Whan the phisition went about this with
yron, with fyre, with hotte yrons, or with
any other instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they profited nothinge:
somtyme it was swollen very vehemently,
with great peyne and akynge, somtyme hit
aswaged and was gentyller. And it greued
me lesse whan my foote was holde towarde
the fyre, and yet wold it not suffre to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
with moche geare: it ranne soo that a
man wolde haue thoughte hit wolde neuer
haue ben stopped. And as often as I wolde
reste or stonde vppon my foote, my peyne
was intollerable: than vpwarde the calfe
and the knee were meruayllous colde, and
as thynges deed. The thyghe was cleane
worne away and consumed to extreme lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and the skynne was so thyn, that there
semed nothynge els lefte to couer the boone
<pb facs="tcp:4540:72"/>
with. Moreouer the ioyntes were so louse,
that longe tyme I had moche adoo to stande
hilone, and to be shorte: the one of my but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tockes
was but a thynge wethered awaye.
In my lefte shulder there was suche peyne,
that I coulde not lyfte vppe myn arme: the
extreme partes of my shulders were weke
and woxen verye styffe: in the myddes of
the brawne of myn arme there was a swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge
as moche as an egge, and as for the
reste of myn arme euen to the verye hande,
was cleane worne away. And on the ryght
syde a lyttell vnder the lowest rybbe, there
had I a sore, whiche was not in dede peyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but it boyled out certayne fowle and
stynkynge matter, and issued very fylthyly
after the maner of a fystule with a narowe
mouth outewarde, and inwarde it was of a
large holownes. And aboue hym there was
also an other as thoughe a bone hadde bene
bredde there vpon a rybbe. And to conclude
I dyd playnly feele a streme and issue come
downe behynde from the toppe of my heed
vnto all these. And where it began the leeste
touche in the world made my heed to worke
as though the brayne panne had ben broken,
nother myghte my face be tourned backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
but as it was tourned with the hole

bodye. This one thynge yet wolle I not
passe, wherfrom if Guaiacum had delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me, and done nothynge elles, yet oughte
I to haue lauded and preysed his vertue
greatly, and that is noone slepe, whiche I
coueted so deedly, and was soo moche gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
thervnto, that almooste in .vi. yeres
space there scaped not one daye, whan the
phisitions cryed oute vppon me, sayinge:
that was the cause of all my diseases, and
yet I coulde not refrayne my selfe frome it.
But nowe is that gone so far from me, that
I trowe if I shuld enforce my selfe to slepe
in the day tyme, I coulde not. With all
these, and so great euyls all though I was
so maystred, that al men dispeyred my helth:
yet my good angel (I beleue) wylled me to
tary and loke for somwhat. And lo through
the helpe of Guaiacum I am bolde nowe to
lyue, and to drawe brethe agayne. Whiche

I say that it is so necessary to be done, that
who so euer hath recouered his helthe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he afterwardes take good hede, dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
obseruynge many thynges, and lyue
for a space vnder a certayne rule, as though
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4540:73"/>
he were yet shut vp: I say playnly that his
helth shall not longe endure. And therfore
thre monethes are appoynted vnto suche as
were eyther greattely consumed and lowe
brought in theyr syckenes, and hadde many
issues, and auoyded moche, or els were sore
hurt in theyr synowes and lymmes, or be so
weakened in their body, that a lyttell tyme
can not be sufficient to gether vp perfitely
theyr cromes agayne. And on the other side,
they that be stronge and not so farre gone,
nor broken, vnto suche .ii. monethes, after
their settyng out ar inough as it is thought.

               </gap>ut by cause I wolde prouyde surely for
them that wyll folowe me, I wyll aduyse
them to obserue and kepe this prescrypte

               </gap>shely acte: Bycause they that be recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
through Guaiacum, haue theyr bodyes
very tender and vtterly weake as yet, as
thoughe they had bene lately newe borne?
And therfore if they shoulde haue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

strength is weake and grene, and not yet ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped:
it wolde by and by dissolue and destroy

of carnall copulation bryngeth into perylle
not one membre by hym selfe but al the hole
bodye at one choppe: What other thynge
maye we saye, he pretendeth, that medleth
carnally with women (being so febled) than
wyllyngly to slee hym selfe, or at the leste
spedily to distroy his naturall strength, and
playnly caste his helthe away.</p>
            <p>¶And if some be forbodden the companye
of women, whiche be neuer the lesse of good
lykynge in body, and haue no disease at all:
Howe moche ought they to auoyde and flee
it, that thus haue lost theyr helth &amp; myght,
and must labour al that they can to repayre
the same agayne? And if before .xiiii. yere
of age none is stronge inough vnto that act,
bycause his strength is not full furnyshed to

How tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought be to beware and take hede,
that is thus nowe borne agayne, and hathe
so yonge and tender a body, that he offer not
hym selfe to be rashely plucked and torne
before he haue receyued his strength, and is
well hardned therin.</p>
            <p>¶The nexte poynte here vnto is this, that
thoughe they shall haue a gredye and sharpe
appetite to meate, beinge emptied with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
hunger, yet they muste resyste the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4540:74"/>
same, and as moche as maye be to behaue
them selfe very soberly and scarsely in their
fedynge. And therfore they muste fyrst vse
verye lyttell meate, and afterwarde some
what more, goinge forth by lyttell and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
soo that there maye be a good space e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
that they come to theyr olde custome of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge,
exercysynge them selfe softely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnynge
no newe thynge hastely or soden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
vtterly absteinyuge fro al wynes except
it be fyrste delayed with moche water, and
be also of hit selfe smalle and of good sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
and clere, and yet so, very moderatly.
Let hym also, that is cured, be well fensed
agaynst the violence of the ayer, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in those tymes, that be greuous with
colde wynde and rayne, orels let hym goo
forth abrode verye seldome. He maye take
meate twyse a day, but at euentyde very ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
and all that tyme he maye neuer fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
his appetite, but muste auoyde fulnes,
as the greattest euyll, that can be. He muste
also aboue all thynges forbeare fyshe, and
feade vpon yonge and tender flesshe, suche
as is of lyghte dygestion, and nourysshethe
purely, whiche they be ye maye knowe by
the phisitions teachynges. And these thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
must haue place, in the sayde two or .iii.
<pb facs="tcp:4540:75"/>
monethes, for other thynges whiche shall
be further obserued, maye be lerned more
playnly in the thynges folowyng. For nowe
I wyll aduyse and monyshe with fewe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
not onely theym that are recouered by
Guaiacum, but other as well from what so
euer disease they be delyuered, if they tender
theyr good helthe and wellfare, and desyre
to be longe in prosperitie, whatte thynges
they shall folowe. And here it is chiefely to
be noted (howe be it al doth nowe knowe it)
that this one thynge is hit that maketh this
sycknes to be verye greuous, bycause there
is great difficultie in dyetynge. For whan
this disease is ouercome, it is not one onely
that must be obserued in the order of our ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uynge,
but many thynges: and dyuerse must
be rekened vppon. In so moche as what so
euer thynges there be, whether they be with
or agaynst all the diseases, whiche I sayde
before folowed this syckenes, he that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered,
must set them before hym, endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge
him selfe with al diligence to obteyne
them, that make with hym, and to anoyde
them that be ageynst him. Wherfore he must
be alwayes very careful in his lyuyng, that
al thyng maye be done ordinatly. Not with
standynge if this medicine haue saued any,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4540:75"/>
there is for theym great comforte, bycause
they that are expert therof, plainly thynke,
that after the pacientes haue ones receyued
theyr helth, &amp; the time of obseruation, which
foloweth this cure be past, nothinge that is
not contrary to theyr olde maner of lyuyng
can putte them in any daunger, soo that they
vsed not before to lyue without order vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For that same order shal serue hym, that
is thus restored, as shall serue theym, that
neuer had the sycknes. Wherfore they thinke
it not so moche to be regarded, what a man
eateth, as howe moche he eateth: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no kynde of meate to be forborne, no
choise of meate to be hadde, concernynge
the qualitie of fedynge, nothynge to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
fore, but that whiche is knowen to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteygne
to the commen conseruation of
helthe, and to the vniuersall auoydynge of
all maladies and diseases. Wherin that that
Celsus teacheth, perchance shall not be the
leest, whiche is, that euerye man take hede,
leste whyle his bodye is in prosperitie, the
aydes and succour ageynst aduersite be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
and wasted.</p>
            <p>¶Helth is preserued (as the same Celsus
sayth) by dyet, by medicines, by oyntynges,
by frictions and rubbynges, by baynes, by
<pb facs="tcp:4540:76"/>
exercyse, by caryage aboute, by clere and
pleasant readynge: whiche thynges howe
they ought to be considered fully and holle,
I leaue you to aske of hym. Here wylle I
breuely touche a fewe thynges, and suche
as apperteyne to dyete. This I thynke they
muste fede pleasauntely and moderately,
and take suche meates and drynkes as be
of lyghtest dygestion. For as Poule saythe,
The chiefest poynt of education is, that the
meate be suche as wyll lyhgtly dygeste and
nourysshe well, not slowe in digestynge, nor
clammye, nor plentuous in superfluities:
and the drynke to be smalle wyne, whyte,
pure, and a lyttell delayde with water.</p>
            <p>And Celsus saythe, Se your meate be not
fatty, clammy, nor wyndy. And by his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
ye muste absteyne in all suche dyseases
from all maner salte meates, sharpe, sowre,
and bytter. For the same reason I thynke,
wherof I made mention before. And Paule
saythe, In eatynge, the greatteste faute is
satietie and fulnes. For all thoughe the bely
digeste well, yet the veynes to moche reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysshed,
labour soore, they swelle, they
breake, they be stopped and fylled with
wynde, and playne it is, that the worst dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
of all comme of sacie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie. He thynketh
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4540:76"/>
this onely to be auoyded, that no man fylle
him selfe. And I iudge the same but not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for I wolde more ouer nothynge to be
dressed deintuously, nothynge to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>auced
curiously, and that many dysshes of dyuerse
kyndes be not sette before vs, nother wyll
(as these ryche menne vse) sixe, or .vii. or
sometyme .x. messes at one soupper to be
broughte in. For a manne wolde not beleue,
howe moche these thynges hurte, not onely
the stomacke, but also the holle digestion.</p>
            <p>And therfore I wil repete again this thing,
whiche is spoken of the same authore: Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
of meates is greattely to be auoyded,
specially whan contrarye operations and
vertues be in them. For whan they be soo
thruste in, they resist digestion, and the same
thinketh Galene, and Auicene, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as be of pure iudgement in phisicke.</p>
            <p>¶Cato (as Tully wryteth) commandeth
so moche meate and drynke to be receyued,
as may refresshe the strength and power of
the body, and not oppresse it. Wherfore by
the counsell of Xenophon, we muste make
for the most parte a small dyner, that there
may be a place for the supper.</p>
            <p>¶Playnly this disease is of that sorte, that
Galenus thynketh to come of fulnes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
<pb facs="tcp:4540:77"/>
thynge is thus to be vnderstande, not
that I thynke all that lyueth in surfetynge,
streight waye to be cast into the french poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
(all thoughe suche shall not escape dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
no not most greuous) but if any haue
ben vexed before with them, and than hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
eate and drynke intemperately, he must
nedes fal agayne into theym. And therfore
the meate that is receyued, let it nother be
dyuerse nor moche, that the stomake be not
loded, and dygestion letted. And agayne let
it be (as I monysshed) easye in dygestynge.
Plinie sayth, all maner sharpe meates, all
that is to moche, and all that is hastely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
be harde in workynge, and harder
in somer than in wynter, and harder in age
than in youthe.</p>
            <p>¶It is wryten in Tully, he that medleth
not with exquysite meates, looded tables,
and often cuppes, shal not be combred with
dronkennes, rawnes of stomacke, or drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.
But for as moch as whan this cure is
done, we muste prouyde, howe the bodye,
that hath hytherto benne emptyed and made
leane, may be brought ageyn vnto his olde
state, therfore peraduenture those meates
muste be vsed, that increace and fyll the
body, not with noyfull humours, but suche
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4540:77"/>
as Celsus reherseth in the .iii. chapter of the
fyrste boke.</p>
            <p>¶Plinie also sayth, The bodies growe and
increace with sweate and fatte meates, and
with drynke, they diminisshe and go downe
with drye, leane, and colde meates &amp; thurst.
But this muste be wysely vnderstande, for
those thynges, whiche I haue often before
monysshed. But seinge Galenus warnethe
vs in all thynges to take hede to the bealy,
For what so euer, sayth he, is corrupted, in
that it is a cause of rot vnto al the body, and
so of diseases, I thynke it best to take those
drynkes and meates, as Celsus teachethe,
which do both noryshe &amp; make the bely soft.</p>
            <p>¶But if any, through the dyuelles prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
fyll hym selfe, and lode his stomake
with meate, more than it is able to beare:
if he lyste to seke helpe by slepe, let him here
Plinie, saying, To dygest in slepe, it maketh
more for the corpulentes than the strengthe
of the body. And therfore the phisytions
wolde haue the great fat wrastlers to make
theyr digestion by walkynge. But if he had
leauer ease hym selfe by vomyt, as many do
counsell, and Paule specially teacheth, for
throughe vomytes many euyls oftentymes
haue ben stopped, and withstande, lette him
<pb facs="tcp:4540:78"/>
rede his doctrine, shewynge howe one maye
lyghtly vomyt. And if nother of these be
regarded, or to late proued, than peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he muste go to phisike, whervnto if the
sycke be compelled, I can gyue hym none
other commaundement, but euen the same,
whiche I haue oftentymes spoken, that he
commytte hym self<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to a sober and lerned
phisition, or to a well experte, rather than
to one that is of high exquisite lernynge, and
to hym that powreth in no medicines, but of
very constrainte, ye and those medicines that
be symple and not compowned and mingled
with many thynges, and as moche as maye
be ministreth the thynges of our owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
growyng, and not thynges farre fette.
And if suche a phisition counsell you to take
a laske, than see ye remembre that whiche
Paule teacheth: whiche is that ye do it not
ofte, lefte through often prouokyng, nature
forgette the office of clensing of the body of
her owne motion.</p>
            <p>¶As concernynge meates, whiche be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
and whiche vnholsomme, and howe
euery kynde of meates helpeth or hurteth,
excepte a man declare it to the vttermost, it
were better speake nothynge therof: And
therfore I wolde haue the authors redde,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4540:78"/>
as Celsus, whiche entreateth shortly of the
kyndes of meates. And Paulus which hand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth
at large in .xxiiii. chapters the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
and vertues of meates: or els Galenus
whiche by hym selfe is sufficient for al, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyttynge
nothynge in the bokes of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rysshementes.
And so wolde I nowe haue
made an ende of feadynge, if there had not
chaunced to come to my mynd certaine thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
worthy to be noted. And fyrste I wyll
admonysshe you of egges. There is noo
meate (sayth Plini) lyke egges that nouris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
in syckenes, and lyethe not heuy, and
that is in stede of wyne and meate bothe.</p>
            <p>And Auicene affirmeth, that the yolkes of
egges of a henne, of a partrige, or of a phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunte
do passe all meates for theym that
haue theyr bloude diminished or their harte
faynted. Alexander Aphrodisius thynkethe
that it conteyneth in it selfe the qualites of
all the elementes, and to conclude there is
in an egge a certayne shewe of the worlde,
Bothe bycause it is made of the foure ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
and agayne bycause it is gathered
rounde in spere fascion, And hathe a lyuely
power. Egges fryed manye doo forbydde:
amonge the whiche are Paulus and Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.
And dothe not alowe the foode of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes.
<pb facs="tcp:4540:79"/>
And many other do forbyd the same, at
thoughe Marcus Cato praiseth brassicam
aboue the mone. He that eateth dayly his
fylle of ptisana, his nutrimente Galenus
thynketh can by none other meates be hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
And the same thynge wolde I saye
(sayth he) by beanes: if they fylled not with
wynde. Of the vse of milke both in meates
and also in medicines, Paule dothe entreate
verye goodly. Alexander saythe, mylke is
lyghte in digestynge, and nouryssheth well.
For that may lyghtly go into bloudde, that
is made of bloudde, and in a maner hit is
bloud made whyte.</p>
            <p>¶Of manye thynges I haue shewed you
a few, but yet he that desireth to haue helth,
ought, saythe Paule, to knowe howe great
power wyne hathe. And the same saythe, if
wyne frete any man, he muste drynke colde
water. And the nexte daye drynke the iuise
of wormewode, and walke vpon it, he must
rubbe his body and wasshe it, and than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresshe
hym selfe with lyttell meate. Wynes
that were lately must, and also wynes that
be to olde, must be auoyded, sayth Galenus.
For these heate to moche, and the other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
at all. That fedynge sayth Paule,
that kepeth a man bare and sklender, is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4540:79"/>
surer for the helth, thanne that whiche
maketh one fat. But for as moche as lyttell
meate gyueth nother strength nor stedynes
vnto the bodye, therfore he after addethe
sayinge. Suche meates as are of a meane
nature, are the chiefe nourysshementes of
all. For they ingender bloudde of a meane
substaunce. And as suche are mooste meteste
and conuenyent for our bodyes, soo be they
that brynge forth yll humours most noyful,
and therfore muste they alwayes be auo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
This saythe Paule. And he teachethe
more ouer, that rye breadde nourysshethe
more than all other, and that weaten bread
is of harde dygestyon and wyndy, and that
barly breade is of lyttell strengthe. He that
wyll knowe the vttermooste of fedynge, let
hym rede this Paule and Galenus as I
sayde. we in this countrey neuer vsed annoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tynges,
in Italy they haue vsed them, but
nowe they be al mooste leste. And Galene
commendethe rubbynges of the body aboue
all thynges, inculcatynge oftentymes and
many thynges therof, and specially in his
bokes of preseruynge helthe. And the same
doth Asclepiades hyghly auance, and Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates
also very greatly, whose saying this
is, whiche was after hym repeted of many.
<pb facs="tcp:4540:80"/>
Throughe rubbynge, if it be vehement, the
body is made harde, if it be softe and easye,
the body is made softe, if it be moche, it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minisheth,
if it be meane, it fylleth.</p>
            <p>¶In our days that high lerned man Eras<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mus
Roterodamus, vsynge thus dayly and
specially in the mornynge at his vprysynge,
thinketh therby that he preserueth his helth,
the weakenes of his body (whiche is verye
great) not withstandynge. And hathe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
me diligently, that aboue all other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
I and all other studentes shulde vse the
same. I folowe the counsell of my frende,
and fynde ease therin. Some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>orbidde was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shynges
and all maner bathes, and they say,
that they be vnholsom for all such as be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
from this disease. I thynke bycause
they mollifie the sinowes, and lose them, and
therfore they wyll not that water shoulde
touch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; yet they do not (sauing for that)
improue sweatynges. water hurteth the sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowes
though it be warme sayth Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der,
not bycause it is warme, but bycause hit is
moyst. Paule commending warme washyng
sayth thus: It taketh away werynes, it sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
downe fulnes, it heateth, it mitigateth,
it mollifieth, it disperseth, it prouoketh slepe,
and maketh all the body fatte. And is very
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4540:80"/>
commodious and agreable both to man and
woman yonge and olde, so sayth Paule. Not
withstandynge the Italianes nowe a dayes
washe not but very seldome, wherof I doo
not meruayll, seinge in tymes past they vsed
it dayly as wrytynge testifieth, and also the
tokens of the bates remaynynge at Rome,
whiche were buylded lyke vnto cities.</p>
            <p>¶In exercises Galene teacheth, that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
muste be kepte and obserued, sayinge,
Immoderatnes I reproue euery where. He
lykewyse sayth, As exercise before meate is
the chiefest thynge to preserue hel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, so is al
maner motion after meate most noyful. For
the meate is scatered out of the bely before
it be digested, and therfore gadreth manye
grosse &amp; rawe humours in the veines, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
al maner diseses are wonte to be ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
Paule auyseth vs, so longe to exercise
our selfe, vntyll the body begynne to swel &amp;
waxereed, our motions strong, equal, and
easye, and the swette seme to be myxed with
vapour: than fyrste to reste, whanne any of
these begynne to chaunge. They monysshe
also to gyue reste and quietnesse vnto that
membre, whiche was lately restored to hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the.
And Hipocrates sayth: The remedye
of the foote is reste. Wherof Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth
<pb facs="tcp:4540:81"/>
that, that which is heled again must
nedes haue rest. For motion (sayth he) cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
flowynges of the superfluous matter,
whiche maye reyse and styre vp inflamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
The worst thynge that can be to hym that
hath akynge knees, is to ryde, sayth Celsus.
He also thynketh it not good for theym that
be gowty. The old men exercised them selfe
also in voyce, that they moughte synge and
also rede more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

any order, but as euery thyng, worthy to be
noted, shuld com to mynd. And therfore let
no man loke for any greatte thynge here, if
there be any that wolde knowe, I haue she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
in what authors what thynges he shall
fynde. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oo here commeth an other to
mynde, he that wyll preserue his helth, must
take hede (saythe Galene) to .ii. thynges
specially, one is, that the meate be agreinge
and mete for hym: an other is, that there
folowe good brookynge, and clensynge of
those superfl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ities, that are lefte of the
meate. It is recyted by Paule, that the olde
men thought it was sufficient to defende and
preser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e helth, if the burden of the bely and
bladder were dayly vnloded well and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4540:81"/>
faulte, accordynge to the portion of the
meate and drinke receyued. Galene as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernynge
the vse of Venus, hathe lefte no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
vntouched, affirmynge that acte to
be an ennemy vnto the helthe of all theym
that are drye of complexion, and specially
of them that are also colde. For Venus
(sayth he) is vnhurtefull onely vnto theym
that be hote and moyste, and be aboundante
of sede. And ageyne he saythe: They that
haue theyr bodies well tempered and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fault, ought not vtterly to absteyn from
Venus, as they that be cold and dry ought.
Also Paule sayth, drye copulations hurteth
all men, and mooste of all if colde be ioyned
to dryeth, soo that they onely, whiche be
hote and moyste, may vse it without ieoper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye.
As labours are profytable vnto helth,
so are also copulations if they be vsed with
mesure. This one thyng ought al to knowe,
that all they that haue had the frenche poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
ought with great care, for loue of their
sinowes to auoyde carnal copulation. Paule
indgeth it well doone to exercyse chyldren,
that through the labour of body and mynd,
they maye be brydeled and restrayned from
the violence of bodyly pleasure. Hipocrates
compareth that act vnto the falling sycknes.
<pb facs="tcp:4540:82"/>
Alexander Magnus was wont to say, that
copulation and slepe were two the greattest
tokens of mortalite.</p>
            <p>¶The holsomes also of the ayre muste be
loked vppon, which is a good post of helth.
That ayre, sayth Paule, whiche is infected
with euyll vapours, puffynge out pestilente
blastes, or is nygh vnto a synke or draught,
or is mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty, or is kepte in a valey, compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about with hilles, hurteth al ages.
And the best ayre is most holsome. For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a temper at body a seperate aire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
sayth he, and a distempred is for hym
that hath a contrary temperature. Sycknes
is nothyng els, sayth Galene, sauyng a mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
without nature. Than he saythe: The
phisitions vnderstande hym to be hole, all
whose membres be accordynge to the cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of nature: and contrary wyse thanne to be
sycke, if any parte go out frome his nature.
It is forbydden by the doctrine of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
that no man drynke streyghte vppon
chafynge. They saye also, that all sodayne
chaunges are daungerous. This is also ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mytted
for trouthe, that contynuall idelnes
is most contrary to good helth. And contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
wyse, Meane exercyse is great aide and
succour. Galen sayth, depe reste of the body
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4540:82"/>
is the greattest euyll that can be for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruyng
of the helth, as moderate labour is
the greatteste good. As perteynyng to slepe,
whan it ought to be taken and howe moche
Paule teacheth abundantly, and also what
commodities folowe, whan it is well taken
in tyme. With noone slepe there is none that
holdeth. For suche as be of a sad nature, or
be troubld with thought and care, the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
ingeth very good to cal for som ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
pastimes and mirth, to fynde out by som
meanes, wherby the harte maye be chered,
and the sadnes of mynde eased. Pensyfenes
sayth Paule, must be dryuen away with the
swetenes of soundes.</p>
            <p>¶He that is in good helthe (sayth Celsus)
and at his owne libertie, nedeth to care no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for medicines nor oyntmentes. Whiche
thynge as I do allowe, and wolde not them
that be of good lykyng and helth to be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
greatly to any maner rule of lyuynge: soo
thynke I it nedefull for them, that haue ben
sycke, or haue syckely bodyes, or do folowe
suche kynde of lyuynge, that they canne not
wel defend the bodyly helth, to haue a rule
of lyuyng, to order them selfe by. For Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene
monysheth, that a lawe and rule of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge
is in no wyse superfluous. For diete,
<pb facs="tcp:4540:83"/>
sayth he, is a verye medicine.</p>
            <p>¶These thynges that I haue here wryten,
moste noble prince, I repute mooste profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to this pourpose, both by myne owne
and others experience, and also by the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge
of theym that were hyghly lerned.
The whiche thynges I haue wrytten vnto
your excellence, not bycause ye shulde youre
selfe make a profe of them (from the nede
wherof I beseche our sauiour Christ to saue
and kepe your magnificence) but that they
maye be redy, if any of your courte chaunce
to haue nede of them. And of suche thynges
as I haue wryten, ye shall vse the iugement
of Stromer, as I sayde before. For your
other phisition Gregory Coppus hath sene
those thynges alredy, and dyd helpe me in
some of them, but that was incidently, whan
from him I sped me to Moguncia, for busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
that I had there. But if it had so fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that I myghte haue ben in your courte
with him (For than ye were away in Germa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye)
I shuld haue intreated more warely of
all these thynges, and sette forth my booke
more perfectly. But how so euer it be now,
I praye your excellence to take hit welle i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
worthe. And I presente hit vnto you for a
gyfte and token of this newe yere, whiche
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4540:83"/>
I praye god may be lucky and prosperous
vnto you, And as fortunate as your owne
harte wyll desyre, without disdayne or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye
of any persone. Thus I commende me
vnto you, mooste noble, mooste worthye,
most benigne, and excellent prelate,
whom almyghty god long kepe
in good helthe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie.
Amen. Wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
