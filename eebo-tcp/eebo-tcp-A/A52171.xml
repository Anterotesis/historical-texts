            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">Concerning the New Creature, or Regenerate Man; under the six Types foregoing.</head>
            <l>DArk, Ignorant Creatures are we all by Birth,</l>

            <l>By a new Birth, enlightning his blind eyes;</l>
            <l>For when his Pride sinks down, &amp; wrathful Will,</l>
            <l>And so his Mind Ascends the Holy Hill:</l>
            <l>When once the Truth doth shine within his heart,</l>
            <l>Wrath, Pride and Ignorance must all depart:</l>
            <l>For naked came we from our Mothers Womb,</l>
            <l>And naked must return to our last home:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:61720:3"/>Yea, Naked we should live, as Babes new-born,</l>
            <l>Or, like the harmless sheep, clean wash'd &amp; shorn,</l>
            <l>Rob'd of his fleece, he envies not the wearer,</l>
            <l>Nor opens he his mouth against the Shearer.</l>
            <l>Uncloath'd, unarm'd; no Weapon to defend him,</l>
            <l>No Lordly Powers to favour or befriend him.</l>
            <l>Thus on the Cross, Christ Jesus naked hung,</l>
            <l>A Prezident of Life to old and young;</l>
            <l>To shew how Man should alwayes naked stand,</l>
            <l>Under Christ's Cross with open heart and hand;</l>
            <l>Ever Resigned in his Makers sight,</l>
            <l>And nothing claim as his peculiar Right.</l>
            <l>For all Man hath he ows to God alone,</l>
            <l>Nothing but Sin and Death he calls his own!</l>
            <l>O take it deep to heart, ye men of Wit,</l>

            <l>Vnder a Vail, or dark Prophetick Song:</l>
            <l>The Gentiles fulness with that wonderous news,</l>
            <l>The Calling and Conversion of the Jews.</l>
            <l>A promis'd truth, which few or none believes,</l>
            <l>Though for that Day the whole Creation grieves.</l>
            <l>But Time will cut each mystick knot in sunder,</l>
            <l>That God may have the Honour of the Wonder:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:61720:4"/>For then Jew and Gentile both, shall know</l>
            <l>There is a God can bring the Haughty Low.</l>
            <l>Perhaps the sound may rouse some Prince or Peere,</l>
            <l>Now to begin the Worlds Reforming Year,</l>
            <l>To stop the stream of Vice, and turn the Tyde,</l>
            <l>Of Wrath and Lust, Debauchery and Pride;</l>
            <l>And, as the Rising Sun, with Powerful Light</l>
            <l>Dispel the darkness of the Worlds long Night;</l>
            <l>That all the World New-born may speak one Tongue,</l>
            <l>Or no man think or do his Neighbour Wrong:</l>
            <l>For such by right all Mankind ought to be,</l>
            <l>And so make good this following History.</l>

                  <l>For many do Resolve, but few Obey</l>
                  <l>(Like this True Convert) what they think, or say:</l>

                  <l>Are Mans best Thoughts in his vain Gallantry:</l>
                  <l>For all his Resolutions are a Jest,</l>
                  <l>And he a Gallant Hypocrite at best;</l>
                  <l>Like to a Barren Cloud that mounts on high,</l>

                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>The Difference of the two Births, Old, and New.</head>
                     <l>Many Degenerate Gentile Sparks there are,</l>
                     <l>But to find one Regenerate, is Rare;</l>
                     <l>Many High-born, (and that's no News to hear)</l>
                     <l>But one New-born, a Wonder doth appear;</l>
                     <l>Of such a One our News-books never told,</l>
                     <l>Nor yet the <hi>Belgick's Mercury</hi> of old:</l>
                     <l>And therefore marvel not if I supply,</l>
                     <l>The Old Defect with this New History.</l>
                     <l>Two kinds of Birth the Scripture well explains,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Esau</hi> the First, <hi>Jacob</hi> the Last obtains.</l>
                     <l>These Names, two Natures do imply; and so</l>
                     <l>The Last supplants the First, and brings it low.</l>
                     <l>For a New Nature, doth a New Name take,</l>
                     <l>And a New Birth doth a New Christian make;</l>
                     <l>'Till now, this Gallant did Usurp that Name,</l>
                     <l>But his New Birth makes him to be the same.</l>
                     <l>And far more Noble is this Second Birth;</l>
                     <l>For this from Heaven comes, but that from Earth:</l>
                     <l>Yea, this is Born of God, but that of Man,</l>
                     <l>This calls God, Father; That, nor will, nor can.</l>

                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61720:9"/>This Noble Birth transcends each Coat of Arms.</l>
                     <l>All natural Extract, or the Field Alarms:</l>
                     <l>And for this Birth this Youth, himself bereaves</l>
                     <l>Of his First Birth, and its Vain-glory leaves,</l>
                     <l>With all its tinckling Titles of Degrees,</l>
                     <l>To which men bow their heads, and bend their knees.</l>
                     <l>This was the third hard Cross to this poor soul,</l>
                     <l>For all the Powers of Hell this work controul;</l>
                     <l>Old Satan's Kingdom cannot stand one hour,</l>
                     <l>In that poor heart, where Pomp hath lost its power.</l>
                     <l>Nor can Gentility in its Pride agree</l>
                     <l>With Christianity in true sympathie:</l>
                     <l>For these to Princes are as opposite</l>
                     <l>As Light and Darkness, or as Black and White;</l>
                     <l>The <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> don't more different seem,</l>
                     <l>Than Gentleman and Christian in esteem.</l>

                     <l>Hell is their Portion; sin their propertie;</l>

               <l>The face of Christ to all Eternity,</l>
               <l>On this Foundation he must first begin,</l>
               <l>That Conscience gives no Latitude to sin,</l>
               <l>Neither to good nor bad, to Church nor State;</l>
               <l>To high nor low, to Prince nor Potentate.</l>
               <l>Nor Pope nor Priest can give Indulgence to it,</l>
               <l>Nor Lord nor law can tolerate man to doe it:</l>
               <l>For Conscience is a Lord above all Lords,</l>
               <l>A Law above all self-made laws or Swords,</l>
               <l>A Judge Impartial, who cannot dispence</l>
               <l>With any sin of pride or Negligence.</l>

               <l>His will must be a Virgin, not consent,</l>

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61720:74"/>
many positive Fundamental Truths couched, and many doubts and controversies briefly resolved; and if you diligently, and with serious eye do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them, they will be very helpful to you all, and so likewise very acceptable without offence, but if any be offended they will turn to his da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
            <p>The careless, scornful, slight Reader will profit nothing by this Book; who reads here a little and there a little like some News Book, and so flings it aside; in him the Fire is quite gone out, and all his fuel is turn'd to ashes, there is no spark of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version left in him; in vain it is to add the breath of the Bellows, where there is not a spark of fire left to begin withal. But whereever there is a spark of goodness left or lyes hid in any heart, verily it will receive life and light from this truth, and will revive, and grow up into a holy flame, and desire after the Truth more and more: I say this writing will certainly have an influence, and a good effect upon every one that reads it night and morning, with serious meditation.</p>
            <p>Therefore let none be offended at the Truth here written, either high or low, Gentry or Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, learn'd or unlearn'd, Roman Catholick or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, the sound reacheth you all, and you hear it, that Pride and Lust may have a fall; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny high and low will repent thereof, and become the Converts there described; but many will not, till destruction overwhelm them in their sensuality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>Therefore so read, as you may understand what you read distinctly; even to a Conversion visible to all, that all who see your new carriage, new Life, new looks, new habit and conversation, may reod a right Conversion in you, and glorifie God through your example. And be not ashamed of Jesus Christ and his Cross, into which you say you were baptized, and vowed to fight under his Banner, against the vanities and pomps of this world; be not found lyars before him, but make your vow and promise good, in laying down the Pride of your Gentility, and the lust of your sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality, the two Temptations here set before you in this book, for a warning to you all in this last age.</p>

            <list>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:61720:75"/>
               <head>The three Ranks of Christians, as to Christs Cross.</head>
               <item>1. The first Rank I call Cowards or Runaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does in Christianity, and are as yet no Soldiers of Christ, under his Cross and Banner.</item>
               <item>2. The second are the Beginners or new Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Christ, who have begun to fight under his Banner; Listed Soldiers.</item>
               <item>3. The third are called the old Souldiers of Christ: <hi>Veterani,</hi> old standers in the Army, that have fought the good fight under the Cross of Christ, nigh or even to the end.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And in these three Looking-glasses every man and woman may easily discern in which of the 3 Ranks they are found.</p>
            <p n="1">☞ 1. By the first therefore understand loose Christendome in general, the formal and verbal Professours of Christianity of Christ, and his dayly Cross; living still in their sensuality, and Pride of Gallantry, Unconverted, turning the back in the Battle against the World, the Flesh, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil, meer Hypocrites as yet, that are ashamed to own the Cross of Christ in self denyall, least they should want a livelyhood, or be laugh'd at for their Conversion. These are call'd Christians <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum dici,</hi> not <hi>secundum esse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:61720:75"/>☞ By the second understand that Church of Christ, and those Christians, who are as it were come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Travellers toward <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and their Heavenly rest; but are not yet fully come thither: Notwithstanding they have given up their names to Christ their Captain, and are sworn, listed and inrolled Soldiers, Converted to the real Profession of the truth, and pure life as it is in the Leader Jesus, the Saviour, Guide, and Governour of them, by his word and spirit in the renewing of their Faith and Conscience; and these are Christians <hi>Secundum esse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞ By the third Rank understand that small Church of Christ, few and rare, and hard to be seen; who not only are come out of <hi>Babylon</hi> (in this world) but have travelled quite through from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> even to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> the place of <note n="*" place="bottom">

And thus <note n="*" place="bottom">The Rest from sin.</note> they rest from their sins; from Avarice, Pride, Lust, Ambition, Extortion, Oppression, Drunkenness, Wantonness, and every iniquity; and at their death they rest also from their labours, troubles, <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. 14.15.</note> persecutions, and afflictions.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="bottom">The Rest from their trouble.</note> And these I have typed forth by a similitude of the Magnetick Needle in the Marriners Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, ever Pointing to the North Star, where it Resteth, and no place else through a secret instinct in the inward hidden attractive love point.</p>
            <p>The Portraicture of the Marriners Compass by Sea and Land in the 32 Points thereof: wherein the Needle first touched with the Mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Behold in these 12 Figures a lively Type or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the True Church or Communion of Saints throughout the world at this day; Whose Hearts all pant and point one way; and so are
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61720:77"/>
already in Heaven, where their Conversation is, looking to the true North Star there, Jesus Christ: their hearts all touched with one and the same spirit, though far distant in place from each other, yet there they fix and rest as one full body; all of one mind and one kind.</p>

            <pb n="147" facs="tcp:61720:77"/>
            <head>An Explanation of this Similitude.</head>
            <p>INtentive, and Unanimous Readers, let us (for the Truth sake) contemplate yet a little further this comparison, and see into the Heighth, Depth, Length, and Breadth thereof; for it is worth the knowing, that by the natural Mystery we may learn the Supernatural, and try our selves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
            <p>For verily there is not a greater secret in nature or art, then this of the Compass, if we rightly consider all the properties thereof.</p>
            <p>And, therefore having given you the Pourtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture thereof, I will also here in the next place give you the Description of it, and so proceed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for Instruction sake in the work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</p>
            <p>The Pilots compass is a round box of Wood, hollow and plain: In the Verge of it are set down the 32 Points of the Winds: and in the middle or Center stands a sharp Pins point, whereon the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61720:78"/>
Needle by a hollow Dent becomes Voluble, and turneth round thereon, tumbling and shaking 'till it leaves them all, and fixeth in the North point only, toward the Polar Star. And over it is a plate of Glass or Chrystal, to preserve it from all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent motion by the wind, and to keep it from the Air, dust, or any foulness, least it lose its Magnetick vertue: And so is placed in the Ship near the Helme, as a Directour to the Pilot, how to Steer his course aright from place to place till he come to his rest or wished Harbour.</p>
            <p>But there yet remain two greater wonders; Namely, the Load-stone, or Magnet, and also the Load Star or North-point. The Loadstone is the efficient cause of the Needles Conversion; and the Load-star is as the final cause of its conversion: for there it ends and terminateth in rest: and from both these the Needle receiveth the power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, else it could have none.</p>
            <p>And it must first receive vertue from the Load-stone before it can turn to the Load Star, as I have said before: And then having been touched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and joyned thereto, and as it were gendring together, it attracts to it self a secret love or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the North-Poynt, with eager desire. But why or how, this can be in nature, no wit of man could ever yet find out: for it is <hi>Digitus Dei,</hi> the Finger of God, a wonder in Nature for a lesson to Mankind.</p>
            <p>Now in the next place observe the unparallel'd
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61720:78"/>
properties of these three; The Stone, the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and Star: For these three act as one in this work.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Load stone draws, and attracts the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles Point, figured as you see like a Lilly, and as it were kisseth and embraceth it, and anointeth, or baptizeth it with a secret invisible vertue; and this is the first change.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then the Needle rejoyceth in the vertue thereof, as made Convertible thereby to its place of rest, and this the second change.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Lastly, the Star or Morth point standeth fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cnmoveable to receive the Aspect and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of the Needle towards it in mutual Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and this the third and last change in this great Mystery of nature.</p>
            <p>Further observe, one Load stone (though there be many) can inspire, and new inform a Million of Needles, and no Stone else can do it; Marble, Coral, Agate, Diamond, Ruby, Saphyre, or Pearle, nor all the Stones in <hi>Aarons</hi> Breast-plate, nor in the Royal Crown, nor yet the rare E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixar or Philosophers Stone, can give it the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Conversion to the Heavenly North-Star.</p>
            <p>Neither can a Needle made of any Mettal but firm Steel receive this vertuous Tincture of Love, Gold, Silver, Copper, or Lead are not capable of this hidden vertue, with all their Worldly Glory,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61720:79"/>
and Splendour: they cannot receive a kiss of Love from the Magnet; for they have not a Magnetick Principle in them; nor any Heavenly inclination, nor are they capable of this Communion and Unity, as to point all to one place in the Heavens; Earth is their Center, and there they end in the grave of Corruption.</p>
            <p>But these Love-touched-Brethren stand ever in Communion, though far asunder; the place and object of rest, make them one in nature and in society; inseperable companions in love and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, though differing in locality, remote from each other.</p>

            <head>The Spiritual Application.</head>
            <p>A Little Application will serve to the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reader. The Mystery is written in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Letters, he that runs may read at first sight.</p>
            <p>Behold all of you (young and old, men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) the wonderful power of God in the Creation, in this, and in all his works of wonder: and so let all fall down and worship him, adore, admire, and be converted unto him, who hath made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth: O draw neer unto him (as the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to the Magnet) and he will draw neer to you: Magnifie him and glorifie his Name, that his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, his power, his Love, Fear, and Faith may touch your hearts and anoint them with his secret spirit of Grace in Conversion; that you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all Elect Vessels of Honour in his sight; and so be renewed in soul and body, mind and spirit, ever looking up to Heaven, and panting after your Saviour, who is gone before to prepare a rest for the blessed, that look towards him, above all the Profits, or Pleasures, or Glories of this world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:61720:80"/>For he is in Heaven looking down upon you, and after you, as waiting for you; and I when I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended saith he, will draw up all men after me: Namely, all that are capable to be drawn unto him in real Conversion from this world, and the things thereof: Every Sinner, Swearer, Drunkard, Thief, Whore and Adulterer, Extortioner, and vain glorious, or covetous soul, he waits for to come unto him, to rest in him from sin, to take up his dayly cross, and follow him; for of such little Children is the Kingdom of Heaven; and all that be his already thus do; he knows them, and they him: for they have already received many a kind kiss from him; they are joyned as the Needle and Magnet, mutually together, and receive vertue of his vertue daily, and cannot be drawn from him. their hearts are with him, though their bodies are here below; and thus they all make one Assembly of Saints on Earth, fixed on him in Heaven.</p>
            <p>For by this Needle of pure firm Steel, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Heart of Man; his Soul and Mind: <hi>Mens Humana,</hi> the Humane understanding, mind, &amp; spirit, sanctified, and made Heavenly and Divine. <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 12.19, 20.</note> The Lovers of Gold, and Silver, and Brass, and Pretious Stones, Jewels, and Glories of this World, Titles of Honour, and Gentility, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Sensuality, attain not this Conversion; Those 32 points must all be left, when the Word
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61720:80"/>
of God, and his Spirit, touch the True Mettled Heart, as prepared for the Bosome of Jesus Christ, the True North-star, in whom is their Rest and Peace, through a pure Lile, Faith, and Conscience; and in no other, but him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Readers</hi>; Take it into deep consideration, for it is Truth here told you: Hereby you may see, and know your selves, and your sins; your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or your Damnation. — Much more might here be said, but I bid you all farewel, and wish you may live well, and so dye well; which you cannot do, except you first bid the World farewel, and dye to that, whilst here you live. The whole Compass of this Earth through all its round Circle of 32 points must be left for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-sake, in all its Longitudes, and Latitudes, and Degrees thereof: All must be left for one Pearl, one only Treasure, for which the Merchant, or Mariner, sold all he had, to purchase it: And where the Treasure is, there will the Heart be, whether in Heaven, or in Earth: But on Earth the Needle (the Heart, or Mind of Man) hath no rest, it is a Pilgrim there, and travelleth to its Resting-place above all Earthly Joys, State and Delight; which Resting-place is Invisible: it is a Misterie above Nature; the Natural minded, unconverted Man can have no propensity, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to it: the Heavenly converted Soul seeks, and finds it, and is fixed in it; as the

Needle to the North-point, its proper place of Rest. For, after all, Fixation crowns the work: The Needle would be a cast away, were it not both Toucht, and Fixt: For otherwise it could give no Direction, no true Instruction; nor be of any use &amp; service for its maker or its master: but being Fixed after long Trembling and Quaking, and seeking Rest, it secretly and silently rejoyceth with an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah to its Creator: Rejoycing that it is Fixt to-towards him; as all true Saints do, and ever did.</p>
            <p>Therefore said <hi>David,</hi> that sweet Singer of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> in the midst of all his Troubles, and Tryals; My Heart is fixed, O God my Heart is fixed, I will sing, and give praise. <hi>Awake my Harp, &amp;c. Psal.</hi> 50.7. And again, <hi>Psal.</hi> 59.16. <hi>I will sing of thy Power, I will sing a loud of thy mercy, early in the morning; unto thee, O my strength will I sing: For God is my Defence,</hi> saith he, <hi>and the God of my mercy.</hi> In him my Heart is fixed, He is the God of my salvation and deliverance, the God that giveth me Life, Strength, Health, Food and Raiment; The God who hath anointed me with the Spirit of Grace, and with the inward light of his Countenance; who hath pardoned my sin, and redeemed my Feet from Death: Who hath given me a New Heart, to love his Commandments, And his Law is sweet to my Lips as the Honey and the Honey-comb, more delightsome than my dayly-food; yea, than all the Glories of my Kingly-crown

               </gap>n him my heart resteth, to him will I sing and give praise.</p>
            <p>But the Needle (the Heart or mind of Man) cannot come to this place of Rest, and Perfection, till it first be Baptized &amp; Annointed (like the Heart of <hi>David</hi>) by the Holy Ghost. The Heart must become a Child in its Humility, taken up into Christs Arms and blest. For the word of God; namely, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles, bring the Heart as a New-born Infant unto Christ, inwardly in Spirit, that like the Needle touched with the Load-stone, it may be made Partaker of this Heavenly-Nature, and so be made like unto him, conformed to his Image (lost in the first <hi>Adam,</hi>) &amp; then it is inabled to stand fixed, and at Rest, in the midst of all this worlds Tryals and Temptations, as converted unto him, who is the Rest and resting-place to all that be His.</p>
            <p>Therefore great need is there to all mankind of this Conversion; of this outward and inward unction, this divine Metamorphosis or change of the Mind, this New-birth, for without it none can make war with the Devil, The world, and the flesh; none can become Old Souldiers of Christ: Or Conquerours over Sin, Hell and Death, without it; for this is the one thing necessary to everlasting Joy, Rest, and Perfection here, and for evermore. For it is the Saints Jewel, their white-stone, by which all are Purified, Sanctified, and Justified to all eternity: Yea this is the sure infallible mark

of the True Church on Earth, the Lilley-hearted Church, the Lillies of the Vallies, the Lillies and Roses in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Garden, here Typed forth by this lively similitude of the little Needle.</p>
            <p>Loe Readers, if all this be true, if the case thus stands, before the Throne of Jesus Christ, where is then all Pride, Envy, Dispute, Wars, Jars and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention about Religions? All Religions, and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Institutions, Signs, Services and Sacrament must be subordinate, and stoop to this one things necessary; this Place of Rest and Fixation; which is an humble clean Heart directed to God and Goodness, in Jesus Christ alone. And then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Sensuality and Gentility, Riches and Honour for this one treasure, this essential Principal of Rest and everlasting Happiness.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the similitude, omitting all Curiosity of discourse concerning Magnetick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in general, as likewise the variation of the Needle, on this, and that side the Aequator; with all other abstrusities in this matter; And only wish after all, that my writing here might beeome mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick to my beloved Readers, and might attract some at the least to true Love of the Saints Jewel here described, and so become members of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Lillie Church, with their Lillie-pointed Hearts, touched with the Load-stone of divine Love and Grace.</p>
            <p>And thus much of-this Book, written occasionly from the sight of that Divine Poem aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
