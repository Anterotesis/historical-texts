         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

laſt compelled to fight (as you ſhall here anon) or elſe
for ought I know, they muſt have ſtarv'd in their quarters,
beginning to riſe and oppoſe them in what parts ſoever they
came, but of this enough, the manner of the Fight was thus.
Lieut. Gen. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> having left 2 Regiments of Horſe
and Foot to ſecure and block the caſtle of Scarborough
and Pomfract, (and underſtanding that the Scots had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
Lancaſhire, and began to ſeek freſh quarter, he tooke
with him the new raiſed forces of Northampton ſhire, Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter-ſhire
and York-ſhire, and ſo joyned with Maj. Gen.
<hi>Lambert,</hi> and their forces being united, they marched in a
body towards the Scottiſh quarters, and ſent out parties to
rouſe the ſtragling, plundering Scots, and force them from
their Head quarters. The Scottiſh Straglers cared little
for fighting, but ſtill made way before our forces, and
gathered towards their Head quarters.</p>
            <p>Our Forces thus chaſing them, gave a ſtrong alarum to
the whole Scottiſh Army, who when they ſaw there was
no remedy, began to make preparation for a ſudden en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.
Our forces very reſolutely marcht towards
them, with an intent to fight them, or force them to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat</p>
            <p>The Scottiſh Forces perceiving the gallant reſolution
and intention of our ſoldiers, and ſeeing they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to a preſent engagement, ſeemed very willing
and deſirous to try one bout before they returned; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they immediately drew all their forces, both foot and
horſe into Batalia, and made choiſe of their ground near
a Town in Lancaſhire, called Preſton, ſome 12 miles
from the City of Lancaſter; where finding a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
piece of ground for their purpoſe, both Armies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

The Scots being firſt deawne up, got the wind and the

be diſcouraged, but reſolved to fight, though with ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
both Armies faced each other, we being about
12 or 13 thouſand, and the Scots above 20 thouſand; parties
were drawn out on both ſides, who met together and fought,
in the mean time both Armies prepared themſelves for a
charge, and our party overcame the Scots parties, this put
us in ſome hopes of victory, we receiving it for a good
Omen: then freſh parties were drawn out, and fought again,
and at the laſt the whole bodyes drew up to the charge, both
parties at the firſt engaged couragiouſly, and after ſome
diſpute, our Infantry being the left Wing, was like to have
been worſted, and being overpowred by their numbers,
were forced to give ground a little, but yet maintained it
with great courage.</p>
            <p>While this diſpute laſted, our right Wing worſted the
Scots, and quite defeated their Cavalry, for after the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
horſe had ſtood to it a charge or two, and finding ſuch
not ſervice, began to retreat, our horſe followed them, and
with their ſhot ſo galled them, that they forced them to
run, our forces perſued them as farre as they could, and
not be endangered by the <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cottiſh foot. In this perſuit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were ſlain, and divers taken priſoners. Then our horſe
retreated, and came in very good time to relieve our left
Wing, which was in great danger of being defeated; when
they came, they found them to have loſt ſome of their
ground, but by the comming in of our horſe they were
much comforted and encouraged, they having endured two
hours of very hot ſervice, the Canons playing often on both
ſides; then our horſe began to charge the Scottiſh Infantry,
who began to be greatly diſheartened by ſeeing their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry
thus defeated, and a great part of our Chavalry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
