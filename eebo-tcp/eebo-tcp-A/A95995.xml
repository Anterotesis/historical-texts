         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His our Master (the undoubted
Prince of all <hi>Heroick</hi> Writers,
whether <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi>) had,
in the compiling of his excellent
Aenëis, a double deſign; the one
was (in the general) to repreſent <hi>heroical</hi> virtue
in the perſon of his moſt accompliſh'd <hi>Aeneas;</hi>
which he hath performed with that acute <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
diſcreet <hi>choice,</hi> and conſtant <hi>decorum,</hi>
that not only thoſe of the following ages, (when
the teeth of envy bite no more) but even thoſe of
his own time and profeſsion (in whom emulation
might have begotten detraction) did, with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
conſent, give him the precedence, and contented
<pb facs="tcp:113289:5"/>
themſelves only<note n="*" place="margin">Stat. Theb. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Longè ſequi, &amp; veſtigia a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorare;
to follow him at a diſtance, and
to worſhip his footſteps.</hi> The other was (in
particular) to celebrate the Name and Family of
the Emperor <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> in extolling his <hi>Aeneas,</hi>
from whom that <hi>Caeſar,</hi> by the Mothers ſide, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
his Pedegree; that <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who, as he
was a favourer of the Muſes, ſo was he favour'd
by thoſe who were converſant with the Muſes, and
eſpecially by the incomparable <hi>Virgil,</hi> in whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
writings he hath obtained ſuch a monument,
<q>
                  <l>—<note n="*" place="margin">Ovid. Met.</note> quod nec <hi>Jovis</hi> ira, nec
ignes,</l>
                  <l>Nec poterit ferrum, vel edax abolere
vetuſtas.</l>
               </q>
A <hi>Memento</hi> to Princes to cheriſh men of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and parts, from whoſe pens they may rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expect a more laſting and commendable fame,
then from all their trophies and triumphs whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>And although our moſt excellent Author never
compoſed any thing but what ſmelt of the Lamp,
and what diſcovered as much the exactneſs of his
<pb facs="tcp:113289:5"/>
judgement as the variety of his reading, yet the
<hi>ſecond, fourth,</hi> and <hi>ſixth</hi> books of his <hi>Aeneis</hi>
are by the learned preferred to the reſt of his ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
productions, as having been (as <hi>Donatus</hi>
affirms in his life) reviſed and corrected by his
own judicious pen, and vouchſaf'd the <hi>imperial</hi>
ear of his great Patron <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> before whom
in an honorable Aſſembly he, with high applauſe,
recited the ſame. The firſt of theſe (which contains
the deſtruction of <hi>Troy</hi>) hath been ſo happy as to
fall into the hands of a Tranſlator inferiour only to
the Author himſelf; I need not add the Gentlemans
name, his own worth rendring him ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous.
The fourth (whoſe ſubject is the paſsion
of <hi>Dido</hi> for <hi>Aeneas)</hi> hath been equally bleſt, as
having been made ſpeak Engliſh by the united Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of two Gentlemen no leſs eminent then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
I wiſh that the whole <hi>Aenëis</hi> had learn'd our

            <p>But ſince the long and pertinacious ſilence of
thoſe Gentlemen, is a ſufficient aſſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ance to me,
that they intend to wade no further in their begun
undertaking, I have (as ill-fitted as I am) ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
upon the traduction of the ſixth of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis,</hi>
a book as farre tranſcending whatſoever our
<pb facs="tcp:113289:6"/>
Maſter wrote, as my ſelf (his Interpreter) am
inferiour to thoſe deſerving perſons I have now
mentioned; a book which (as <hi>Servius</hi> teſtifies) is
<hi>ſo replete with ſublime ſpeculations, that
divers learned men of former times judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it worth their pains to write large
Commentations upon particular parts and
paſſages thereof.</hi> Neither will we here omit
the cenſure of the judicious <hi>Naſimboenus,</hi> ſince
it is a truth tending ſo much to the honour of our
accompliſh'd Author: his words run thus; <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teponendus
eſt hic liber caeteris ſine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſiâ,
in quo ſplendor, &amp;c. This book
of</hi> Virgil <hi>is more excellent then any of his
writings, as wherein the very</hi> Quinteſſence
<hi>of Learning and Knowledge doth moſt
wonderfully appear: if in the reſt he ſhew
himſelf copious and grave in his expreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in this he is admirable. Nor ſeven</hi>
Homers, <hi>or all</hi> Greece <hi>beſide, ſhould they
ſummon their whole ſtrength of wit and
learning together, were able to match this
ſixth book of the</hi> Aenëis. Thus farre that
learned <hi>Critick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What can be ſaid more? I am ſure there is more
<pb facs="tcp:113289:6"/>
then enough, to have diſcourag'd me, not only from
the publiſhing of what I have undertaken, but even
from the undertaking of what I have publiſhed.
The more excellent a work is in the <hi>Original,</hi> the
more difficulty it ſtill gives to the <hi>Tranſlator.</hi>
But ſince I have ventur'd upon it, although the
charge of a raſh undertaker may (haply) be made
good againſt me, yet my weak performance herein
may in ſome meaſure be excuſed, becauſe (as I have
ſaid) the work in it ſelf is ſo inimitable.</p>
            <p>However, Reader, I hope that although this il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
Writer appear not in his native glory and
ſplendour, through that glimmering and imperfect
light we have lent him, yet there may be ſome weak
raies and reflexions of him, by which thou mayeſt
diſcern that it is <hi>Virgils:</hi> and that although we
cannot ſay, as himſelf did elſewhere:

skill in wraſtling, an exerciſe in thoſe times in great requeſt:

Sect. 3. When I was at <hi>Cumae</hi> in Campania (<hi>ſayes that holy
Father</hi>) about ſix miles from <hi>Baiae,</hi> I viewed diligently and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
a certain place there, wherein ſtood a large and ſpacious
Chappel or Oratory, which was hewn out of the main rock, being
all but one ſtone; an admirable and ſtrange piece of workmanſhip
it was; in which Oratory (as the inhabitants made report to me,
and they had it by ancient tradition from their fathers) <hi>Sibylla</hi>
gave forth her Oracles. In the midſt of the Oratory they ſhewed
me three hallowed places, hewn alſo out of the ſame rock, in which
(as they related) ſhe uſed to bathe and waſh her ſelf; which done
ſhe caſt her mantle about her, and ſo retired her ſelf into the inmoſt
Cell, and Reveſtry of that Chappel. This, as the former, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
cut out of the main rock. There, when ſhe had compoſed her ſelf
upon a high advanced ſeat, ſhe uttered and gave forth Oracles.

King <hi>Tarquin,</hi> ſirnamed the <hi>Proud,</hi> offered him nine books in

the ſame price for the remaining ſix; whereat <hi>Tarquin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
that the old woman was mad or doated, began to be
out of patience. Then ſhe having condemned three more to
the ſame flames, asked him, if he would yet give what ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
for the three which were left? The King moved at
the conſtancy of this ſtrange <hi>Gueſt,</hi> and adviſed thereunto by

Nay the <hi>Indians</hi> did uſe to burn the beſt beloved of the Wives

and annoint the ſame with oyl, that if there were any

warm applications, warmth being propitious to Nature, and
the cauſe of life as well as the effect. This ſtory is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

a man of <hi>Conſular</hi> dignity (after all Ceremonies previous

being laid upon the <hi>Pyre,</hi> no ſooner felt the warmth of
the aſcending flames, but that reviving, he raiſed himſelf up;

how they could poſſibly ſeparate the aſhes of the dead from
thoſe of the <hi>Pyre,</hi> and from ſuch things as were burnt with the
Corps. <hi>Natalis Comes</hi> is of opinion that the Corps was laid in
a ſtone Cheſt, and burned within the ſame, which he confirms
out of <hi>Theophraſtus. De la Cerda</hi> out of <hi>Pliny</hi> ſayes that the
Corps was wrapped up in a ſort of linnen, by the <hi>Latins</hi> called
<hi>linum vivum,</hi> by the <hi>Greeks Asbeſtînum,</hi> over which the flames
could not in the leaſt prevail: we will give you the place and
words of that learned<note n="*" place="margin">Pliny.</note> Author <hi>l. 19. c. 1. Inventum jam eſt
etiam linum, quod ignibus non abſumeretur; vivum id vocant, &amp;c.
There is now in our dayes found out a certain ſort of flax called</hi>
vivum, i. e. <hi>living (becauſe it lives as it were in, and is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
by fire) I have ſeen napkins made thereof, red-hot in the
flame, by which they are purged and cleanſed better then by water.
Hence the bodyes of Kings being wrapt therein, were preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
unmixt from the other aſhes. It growes in the deſarts of</hi> India,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113289:41"/>
                  <hi>in places ſcorched with the Sun, amongſt Adders and Serpents,
and where there falls no rain: he ſayes that it doth,</hi> aſſueſcere
vivere ardendo, <hi>by growing in a hot and ſun-burnt ſoyl, contract
(as it were) an habit of reſiſting the flames. It is rare to be found,
and very hard to be woven or ſpun, by reaſon of its ſhortneſſe.</hi>
Thus farre <hi>Pliny.</hi> But this is a thing loſt long ſince: See <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerol.
tit. 4. de reb. perditis.</hi> Not unlike to this is that <hi>linum
Creticum</hi> mentioned by <hi>Strabo,</hi> which hath the ſame property
of reſiſting the fire: but this was rather a ſtone then linnen;
for it was made of a certain ſtone which they beat ſo long with
hammers, till all the terrene or earthy matter was beaten out
of it, and there remained nothing but certain threads or ſtrings,
which being dreſs'd and comb'd made a very fine ſort of linnen.
The like is made of a ſtone found in the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

tit.</hi> 4. And haply both theſe were well known to the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi>
and made uſe of by them. But although we cannot po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
affirm how it was done, we may certainly conclude that
they had a way, and were very carefull therein, to ſeparate the
remains of the Dead from mingling with other aſhes. The
aſhes thus extinguiſhed, and bathed with wine, were put into

Mr. <hi>Sandys,</hi> who had entred the ſame, writes thus of it: <hi>On the

                  <hi>Hecate</hi> was the Daughter of <hi>Perſes</hi> King of <hi>Taurica,</hi> and
Wife of <hi>Aeeta,</hi> a neighbouring Prince, and King of <hi>Colchis;</hi>
Mother to <hi>Circe</hi> and <hi>Medêa,</hi> worthy ſhoots of ſuch a ſtock:
She (as were her Daughters) was a famous Sorcereſſe; a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſo tranſcendently cruel, that when at hunting ſhe could
finde no other game, ſhe would with her lance or ſword kill
ſome of her Attendants. She uſed to ſacrifice all ſtrangers,
whoſe evill ſtarres had unfortunately guided them to thoſe
parts: laſtly, having poyſoned her Father, ſhe uſurped his
Throne. For which rare endowments and goodly merits ſhe
was deified, invoked and ſacrificed to by thoſe of her own
damnable profeſſion. Thus have I ſhewed you <hi>Hecate</hi> in the
true mirrour of <hi>hiſtory;</hi> and now you may behold her through
the <hi>opticks</hi> of <hi>poeſie,</hi> where ſhe appears as foul a Monſter in her
externals, as you have ſeen her in her internals: She was ſaid
to be half a ſurlong tall, which is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

queſtion the propereſt of her ſex: She had three heads,
the right of a <hi>horſe,</hi> the left of a <hi>dog,</hi> and the middle of a <hi>wild
ſow;</hi> from whence the Poets gave her the epithets of <hi>triceps,
triformis,</hi> and <hi>tergemina:</hi> inſtead of hair, ſerpents and vipers
hung hiſſing, wreathing and curling themſelves about her
ſhoulders: She was called <hi>Brimo</hi> from the ugly howling noiſe
ſhe uſed to make. I cannot in particular give a reaſon
why they repreſented her thus; only in generall, becauſe ſhe
was thought to be an infernall Goddeſſe, and Patroneſſe of
Sorcereſſes and Witches, they imagined that they could not
depaint her with too much horrour and terribleneſs. But to
the purpoſe: <hi>Hecate</hi> is a genericall word, applicable to many
particulars; for by it ſometimes we are to underſtand <hi>Luna,</hi>
ſometimes <hi>Diâna,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Proſerpina:</hi> In fine, when
it is applied to <hi>Heaven,</hi> it is taken for <hi>Luna,</hi> when to <hi>Earth</hi>
for <hi>Diâna,</hi> when to <hi>Hell</hi> for <hi>Proſerpine.</hi> So the Sun in heaven

At the increaſe ſhe is ſaid to be in heaven, and to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

who did himſelf ſlay, and offer a black-fleec'd Lamb to the
<hi>Furies,</hi> which is <hi>Nox,</hi> or the Night; and to her Siſter, which
is <hi>Terra,</hi> or the Earth: they may well be ſo neer akin, for
the night is nothing but the interpoſition or ſhadowing of the
earth. To <hi>Proſerpine</hi> (becauſe ſhe is ſaid never to have been
pregnant) he offered a barren Cow: to <hi>Pluto</hi> an entire Bull,
or <hi>Holocauſt,</hi> who becauſe he was deemed (as <hi>Nat. Comes</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves

for here, as you ſee, were <hi>Altars, Holocauſts, Oyl;</hi> the only
difference is, that all infernall ſacrifices ought to be performed
(as we have ſaid) in the night. But for the better elucidation

This Monſter was ſaid to have been ſlain by <hi>Bellephoron</hi> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

proceeded fearfull eruptions of fire; which alſo was frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Lions; the middle part abounded with good herbage,
and was ſtocked with wild Goats: the foot thereof (which was

Snakes and Serpents. Hence <hi>Bellephoron</hi> (who rendred it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable)

Ship was called <hi>Pegaſus,</hi> and from its ſwiftneſs ſaid to be wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
gave birth to this Fable. But if we look upon the <hi>phyſicall</hi>

rivers or torrents, by the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">

being no great diſſonance in the words, which, becauſe they

reach; and Dragons from their Maeanders, or oblique and
ſerpentine courſe; which Monſter <hi>Bellephoron</hi> mounted upon
<hi>Pegaſus</hi> is ſaid to kill, becauſe by the heat and vertue of the
Sun (the true <hi>Bellephoron</hi>) the abundant humor which lent
ſupply to theſe torrents is drunk up and exſiccated. But if you
will conſider it <hi>ethically, Chimaera</hi> ſets before us the life of man,
who in his youth is as an untamed Lion; in his middle age as a
wanton and aſpiring Goat, ſtill ſtriving to climb upon the ſteep
rocks, and dangerous precipices of honour; and in his old age
becomes as ſubtile and crafty as a ſerpent. But becauſe there
never was or could be any ſuch thing in Nature as a <hi>Chimaera,</hi>

Rivers to this Section; they were 5. in number, <hi>Acheron,
Cocytus, Phlegeton, Styx,</hi> and <hi>Lethe,</hi> all mentioned by <hi>Virgil</hi> in

it is a River which flows with grief and trouble; is a River
of <hi>Epirus,</hi> neer the Town of <hi>Pandoſia,</hi> in the Province of the

many ſmaller ſtreams into its channel, poſts along with them

But to come to the <hi>Mythologie; Acheron</hi> taken, as here it is,
for one of the infernall Rivers, was ſaid to be the Son of the
earth, becauſe that <hi>Auri ſacra fames,</hi> that accurſed covering
of riches, which are dug and forced out of the bowels of the
earth, creates very great inquietudes and perturbations of
mind, ſignified by this word <hi>Acheron,</hi> according to the above
given <hi>etymologie</hi> thereof: and becauſe men for the love of
wealth often hazard their ſouls, and paſs the River <hi>Acheron</hi>
into eternall damnation, <hi>Acheron</hi> was ſaid to be thruſt down
into hell for adminiſtring drink to the <hi>Titans</hi> when they fought
againſt <hi>Jupiter:</hi> by this are covertly meant the wicked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
togitations, whereby in aſſiſting and cheriſhing out
ſinnes, his enemies, we fight againſt our great Creator; juſtly
repayed with the worſt of puniſhments, becauſe they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
the beſt of <hi>Entities.</hi> The water thereof is ſaid to be of
a moſt ungratefull and unpleaſant taſte, becauſe the recordati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our paſt actions, and the account we are to give, cannot
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:113289:55"/>
but be very unpleaſant and diſtaſtefull to us. Laſtly, it is the
firſt of all the Rivers which the Deceaſed are to paſs, becauſe
when wicked men are upon the point of death, an <hi>Acheron,</hi> or
grief of mind doth thereupon ſeise them, both in regard of
thoſe dearly beloved pleaſures they leave behind them, and of
thoſe dreaded pains which they expect, as the juſt guerdon of
their former delinquencies. <hi>Acheron</hi> amongſt the Poets is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
taken for Hell it ſelf.</p>

               <p>And this is the vulgar and common interpretation of theſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
<hi>Macrobius l. 1. c. 10. in Somnium Scipionis,</hi> treading
in the ſteps of the more ancient and primitive Philoſophers,
(who were of opinion that Hell was nothing but our very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
wherein our ſouls being included, underwent a naſty, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
and irkſome reſtraint) finds all thoſe things in our ſelves
which fabulous <hi>Antiquity</hi> attributed to Hell, the Region of the
Damned. Hence (according to their aſſertion) he affirms that
<hi>Lethe,</hi> or the River of Oblivion, is nothing elſe but the errors
and miſtakes of the ſoul, forgetting the ſtate, majeſty, and
perfect knowledge wherein it lived before it was confined to
the loathſome Dungeon of the body. That <hi>Phlegeton,</hi> or the
River of fire, is nothing elſe but that preternaturall inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and exorbitant fire of luſt, concupiſcence, anger, and
other untamed affections, which put the ſoul out of that equall
temper which is naturall to it. That <hi>Styx</hi> is whatſoever doth
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:113289:57"/>
ſink the Soul into diſlike and hatred of its own actions: <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cytus</hi>
whatſoever cauſeth tears and grief: <hi>Acheron</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
deprives us of the joy and content of our lives. Hence
they concluded that the ſoul was dead ſo long as it remained in
the body, and that then it recovered its priſtine life and liberty,
when it by death hand emancipated it ſelf from the bonds and
ſervitude of the ſame: <hi>Hi vivunt qui è corporum vinculis evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laverun;

ſuperſtitious <hi>Antiquity</hi> put a piece of money (called by

thoſe troubles of mind, confuſions and diſtractions of thoughts,
which ariſe from the conſideration of having offended a good

we have of his diſpleaſure, and the conſequence thereof, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
proportionate to our delinquencies; ſo by <hi>Charon,</hi>
which (as I have ſaid) ſignifies Joy, we are to underſtand,
that ſatisfaction and acquieſcence which we find in our ſelves
upon the opinion of our innocence, or, that which is next to it,
upon a firm reſolution of amendment of life for the future; all
which joyned with an unfeigned repentance begets in us a
hope of Gods mercy and goodneſs, which creates ſerene
thoughts and a real joy within us, the true <hi>Charon,</hi> which
wafts us over thoſe turbulent ſtreams of our late diſtractions to
the <hi>Elyſian</hi> fields of pacified and reconciled thoughts. Before

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:113289:58"/>
words then the Originall; but (if I may judge) our Author
hath loſt nothing in the traduction:
<q>His eyes (like ſaucers) ſtare, like fire do glow.</q>
                  <hi>Virgil</hi> ſayes of <hi>Charon,</hi> that he did <hi>Corpora ſubvectare cymbâ,</hi>
a meer contradiction; for he ſays anon,
<q>Corpora viva nefas <hi>Stygiâ</hi> vectare carinâ.</q>
We have therefore both mended the ſenſe, and reconciled the
contradiction, whil'ſt we have rendred it thus,</p>
               <q>Wherein his airy fraight he o're doth paſs.</q>
               <p>The Ancients were of opinion that the unburied could not
be paſſed over by <hi>Charon,</hi> but that their ghoſts wandred an
100 years about the banks of <hi>Cocytus;</hi> whence nothing was
more ſolemnly obſerved amongſt them then the interment of
the Dead, which was done either by a real, or an imaginary
ſepulture:<note place="margin">Cenotaphium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> This latter they called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, when the rites of
buriall were obſerved for the dead, when abſent, as if the
Corps had been there preſent, and was thought as effectuall as
to their <hi>transfretation</hi> by <hi>Charon</hi> as the other. Hence <hi>Deipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>
his Ghoſt (as wee ſhall ſee anon) was tranſported, for
whom <hi>Aeneas</hi> had raiſed a <hi>Cenotaphium,</hi> or empty Monument;
which the Poet means alſo when he ſpeaks in the perſon of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes</hi>
concerning the young <hi>Marcellus;</hi>

                     <l>Munere.—</l>
                  </q>
And for this reaſon the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Kings, when they would
expreſs an implacable hatred and revenge againſt their offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and executed Subjects, would not ſuffer their bodies to
be buried, that their puniſhment might ſurvive their lives.
But whereas the Poet ſayes, that the Ghoſts of the unburied
wandring about the banks of <hi>Cocytus,</hi> were excluded for an
100 years from the <hi>Elyſium,</hi> or place of reſt; this is, I ſay,
drawn out of the myſterious doctrine of the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> by
whom the number of 10 was held in great veneration, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:113289:59"/>
termed by them <hi>numerus perfectus &amp; univerſus,</hi> the perfect
and univerſall number, as being the firſt compounded number,
and containing in it all the kinds and differences of number, as
<hi>even, odd,</hi> the <hi>quadrantal, Cube, long</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> which are the
diſtinctions of thoſe Schools. Hence, as if by Nature preferred
to all numbers, we have ten fingers to count upon; and hence
it was the cuſtome of the Ancients, upon any ſolemn promiſe
or contract, to joyn their right hands, becauſe thereby they
did premiſe this number, as an inviolable pledge of their ſincere
and reall intentions: and hence our Author (a great <hi>Platoniſt</hi>)
inſinuates this number of an hundred years, becauſe it is an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall
number ariſing from ten, ten times multiplied; for
ten <hi>Denaries</hi> make a <hi>Centenary:</hi> for the ſame reaſon alſo he
allots a thouſand years for the purgation of ſouls, as we ſhall
ſee anon, a thouſand being an univerſall number alſo; for an
hundred ten times multiplied makes a thouſand; both which
are therefore thought univerſall, becauſe they ariſe from the
multiplication of ten, the firſt univerſall: but if you deſire to
wade further into theſe abſtruſe ſpeculations of numbers. we

by, that there were three moſt noted <hi>Epoch's</hi> or computations
of time amongſt the Ancients, higher then which prophane
Story gives us no light. The firſt was from the expedition of
the <hi>Argonautes</hi> to <hi>Colchis</hi> for the golden Fleece, which (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our learned Country-man, and moſt diligent Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger,
Dr. <hi>Simpſon</hi>) hapned in the fifteenth year of <hi>Gideon,</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:113289:66"/>
of the world 2743. and before our <hi>Saviour</hi> 1260. The ſecond
was from the <hi>Theban</hi> warre, which (as the ſame Author teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies)
fell out in the fifteenth year of <hi>Thola,</hi> Judge of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in
the year of the world 2785. forty two years after the former,
and before our <hi>Saviour</hi> 1218. Laſtly, from the <hi>Trojan</hi> War,
which was undertaken by the <hi>Greeks</hi> in the 19. of Judge <hi>Jair,</hi>
of the world 2812. before Chriſt 1191. Theſe three memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
expeditions adminiſtred matter to the <hi>Heroick</hi> Muſes of
divers famous witts; the geſts of the <hi>Argonauts</hi> were celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>Greek</hi> Muſe of <hi>Apollonius Rhodius,</hi> and by the <hi>Latine</hi>
of <hi>Valerius Flaccus,</hi> two Authors eſteemed by the learned,
though not uſually converſed with in our common Schools:
The <hi>Theban</hi> Warre was ſung by the ſublime <hi>Papinius Statius.</hi>
Laſtly, the <hi>Trojan</hi> was the Theme of the great <hi>Homer,</hi> and
the greater <hi>Virgil,</hi> the two glorious Luminaries of heroick
poeſie, and inexhauſtible treaſuries of all Phioloſophy &amp; humane
literature. But pardon this digreſſion, and we ſhall return.
From the <hi>Grecian</hi> Worthies the Poet makes a tranſition to the
<hi>Trojan,</hi> where he makes the interview betwixt them and <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi>
to be with more then ordinary paſſion. He ſighs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
his Country-men and acquaintance, whilſt they expreſs
very great content in ſeeing a perſon ſo deſerving, and for his
deſerts ſo worthily renowned. The <hi>Trojans'</hi> which <hi>Virgil</hi>
names here were <hi>Glaucus,</hi> ſone of <hi>Antênor,</hi> ſlain by <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non:</hi>
who <hi>Medon</hi> was it is uncertain: <hi>Thenſilocus</hi> was killed
by <hi>Achilles, Il.</hi> 21. who the <hi>Antenoridae</hi> were it is not decided
by Interpreters, as likewiſe who <hi>Polybaetes</hi> was; but for <hi>Idaeus</hi>
he was <hi>Priam</hi>'s Charioter; whence the Poet makes mention
here of his Chariot and Armes. <hi>Aeneas</hi> paſſeth from his
<hi>Trojan</hi> friends to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> his enemies, where our Author
(whoſe deſign it was to magnifie his <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
the <hi>Greeks</hi>) makes them for feare to flye from him in the
lower world, whom they ſo much dreaded in the upper: See,
and learn hereby to obſerve that <hi>decorum</hi> which is required in

               <p>The Poet, with much delight to the Reader,<note place="margin">Deipho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the ſtory of <hi>Deiphobus,</hi> one of <hi>Priams</hi> Sons, who after <hi>Paris</hi>

his death, married his relict, the fair, but to her Husbands the
ever-fatal <hi>Helena. Virgils</hi> narrative of the cruel maſſacring
and diſmembring of <hi>Deiphobus,</hi> agrees with that which <hi>Dictys
Cretenſis</hi> the Hiſtorian gives of it in his fiſt book: There is
nothing of difficulty in this whole relation, we ſhall therefore
paſs it over with a brief note or two. <hi>Aeneas</hi> hearing of the
death of <hi>Deiphobus,</hi> raiſed (according to the cuſtome of thoſe
times) a <hi>Cenotaphium,</hi> or empty Monument for him; which
was not only to expreſs the duty of a friend, but becauſe ſuch
ceremonies were thought efficacious as to the prevention of the
hundred years wandring about the banks of <hi>Cocytus,</hi> as we
have already hinted §. 46. of which the chief and moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
was to call on the dead thrice, which was done by repeating
the word <hi>vale</hi> three times; which were the <hi>verba noviſſima,</hi>
of which we alſo have already ſpoken. The next was to write
the name of the Dead, with ſome brief <hi>Epitaph,</hi> upon the ſtone,
and there to carve his armes as a monument of his profeſſion:
all which are expreſſed here by <hi>Virgil;</hi>

This place hath much perplexed Interpreters; we ſhall paſs by
others, and adhere herein to the expoſition of our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
the learned Mr. <hi>Farnaby;</hi> you muſt therefore know,
that theſe <hi>magicall</hi> Rites were neceſſarily to be finiſhed within
the ſpace of 24 hours: the ſacrifices were begun in the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
about ſun-riſing they begun their journey, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:113289:67"/>
was ſpent in paſſing the River <hi>Styx,</hi> in ſurveying the
Regions of Hell, and in diſcourſing with <hi>Dido</hi> and <hi>Deiphobus;</hi>
and now it was ſuppoſed to be paſt noon: How then <hi>Virgil</hi>
ſhould make mention of <hi>Aurôra,</hi> or the morning, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
at the appearing of the ſun, or ſay that the morning
had paſſed the <hi>Meridian,</hi> there is that <hi>nodus &amp; crux interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
which is thus untied; by <hi>Aurôra</hi> here we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Sun, becauſe <hi>Virgil</hi> puts four horſes in her Chariot,
whereas both <hi>Aurôra</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> the Morning and the Noon,
are by the Poets allowed no more then two; which indeed is
<hi>Donat</hi>'s interpretation, <hi>Aurôra cum quadrigis ſolem ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat;</hi>
ſo that the meaning of <hi>Sibylla</hi>'s ſpeech is this: The Sun
hath paſſed the <hi>Meridîan,</hi> and is now declining towards the
Weſt, the night draws on; let us therefore haſten that we may
employ our remaining hours with <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> the chief end of
our preſent undertaking. Thus Mr. <hi>Farnaby:</hi> See <hi>Servius,

ſayes, that <hi>Virgil</hi> means by number that ſet time which is allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

after the expiration of 10, an 100, or a 1000 years,
according as the ſoul to be purged was more or leſſe ſtained;
ſo that the ſenſe of <hi>Deiphobus</hi> his words is this, <hi>Be not angry,
I will depart to finiſh in darkneſs, or thoſe places of darkneſs, that

                  <hi>Othus</hi> and <hi>Ephialte,</hi> twins, the

both, endeavour'd to ſcale the heavens, and to force <hi>Jupiter</hi>

for this reaſon alſo he was ſaid to cover nine acres, becauſe <hi>luſt</hi>
does <hi>latè patére,</hi> is very extenſive, unbridled and ranging.
But moſt worthily is <hi>Tityus</hi> puniſhed in his <hi>liver,</hi> as the ſeat of
<hi>luſt.</hi> The divine juſtice is oftentimes ſo preciſe and notorious
as to afflict the very partts which have offended. Thus the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

hand which <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſtretched out againſt the man of God,

               <p>The fifth was <hi>Pirithous,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pirithous.</note> who was therefore damned becauſe
he attempted <hi>Proſerpine,</hi> as we have already ſaid: The ſixth
was <hi>Ixion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ixîon.</note> Father of <hi>Pirithous,</hi> and King of the <hi>Lapithae,</hi> who
for the attempt upon <hi>June</hi> was puniſhed in the ſame manner.
The ſtory of <hi>Ixion</hi> in ſhort is this: <hi>Ixion</hi> (King of the <hi>Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thae,</hi>
a barbarous people of <hi>Theſſalie,</hi> and ſonne of <hi>Phlegyas</hi>)
having treacherouſly ſlain his Wifes Father <hi>Deioneus,</hi> and for
that fact, and other miſdemeanours dethroned, and expelled
his Kingdome by his own Subjects, was by <hi>Jupiter</hi> (pitying
his diſconſolate and ſad condition) received into heaven, and
made a <hi>Privado</hi> to the King of the Gods. But (as <hi>Favorites</hi>
often doe) abuſing his Princes friendſhip, he endeavoured to
ſtain <hi>Jupiters</hi> bed, and to that end made great Court to <hi>Juno,</hi>
who (as naturally honeſt, as ſhe was a curſt Shrew and ugly)
diſcovered it to her Husband: he (hardly crediting that a
perſon ſo obliged could prove ſo ungratefull) would not at
firſt entertain any prejudiciall opinion againſt his friend, unleſs
he had ſome more evincing evidence: wherefore transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a cloud into the ſhape of <hi>Juno</hi> (now by compact conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting)
he by this experiment found out the falſhood of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
<hi>Adulterer,</hi> who for his deſired Miſtreſs embraced a
cloud: and indeed that contentation and ſatisfaction which the
unchaſt promiſe themſelves in their <hi>illicit</hi> and beaſtly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
proves but a cloud, a meer nothing; neither anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the pleaſure expected, or countervailing the ſin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
<hi>turpis eſt &amp; brevis in coitu voluptas.</hi> For this fact <hi>Ixion</hi>
was caſt out of heaven, who not ceaſing to boaſt of the affront
he had put upon <hi>Jupiter,</hi> was for this ſecond piece of inſolence
thruſt into Hell, where he was ſaid to be tied to an ever-tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
wheel; though <hi>Maro</hi> hath invented another kind of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
But the Hiſtory which gave riſe to this tale is this;
<hi>Ixion</hi> (baniſhed by his own Subjects) fled to a certain neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
King (for every King was anciently by his <hi>Paraſites</hi> ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Jupiter</hi>) where he was courteouſly entertained by that
Prince: but endeavouring to corrupt the Queen, was by her
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:113289:72"/>
diſcovered to her Husband, who purpoſely put a trick upon
him, by deceiving him with a ſervant called <hi>Nephele,</hi> which
ſignifies a cloud; after which being expelled the Court, he
was ſaid to wander up and down as unquiet and reſtleſs in
mind as one who is turned on a wheel is in body. This Fable
is invented againſt the <hi>ungratefull</hi> and <hi>treacherous,</hi> who repay
kindneſs and deſert with injury and falſhood, with which no
puniſhment but that of Hell can bear proportion. As for the
<hi>Lapithae,</hi>

ſtone, &amp;c. it is to ſet before us the life of a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> which
though in ſhew glorious and ſplendid, yet in reality is very
miſerable and ſad, being as obnoxious to inquietudes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances
of mind, as it is to perſonall hazards and dangers;
as is manifeſted by the Story of <hi>Democles,</hi>

&amp; made him deſire to be diſrob'd, and diveſted of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

anxiety: See <hi>Val. Maxim.</hi> and <hi>Tully l. 5. Tuſc. quaeſt:</hi> and

placing ſuch as are found guilty of theſe or the like crimes in

whom by the Law of Nature they are tied to proſecute with all
kindneſſes and good offices; therefore if hatred be thus ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<hi>fratricide,</hi> is much more deteſtable. Secondly, thoſe who have
lifted up their hands againſt, or ſtruck their Parents, whom by

much more is <hi>Parricide</hi> or <hi>Patricide;</hi> for which the
Ancients (imagining that no man could be ſo proſtitutely
wicked as to be guilty of ſo enormous a crime) appointed no
puniſhment: the after-times (leſs innocent) puniſhed the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide</hi>
in this manner; they ſowed him up in a Sack with a <hi>Dog,</hi>
a <hi>Cock,</hi> a <hi>Viper</hi> &amp; an <hi>Ape,</hi> and ſo caſt him into the ſea. <hi>Pompey</hi>
was Author of this law, which was therefore called <hi>lex Pompeia
de parricidiis: Inſt. tit de publicis Judiciis</hi> §. 5. one <hi>L. Oſtius</hi>
(as <hi>Mynſinger</hi> obſerves upon that place) was the firſt who was
found guilty of, and ſuffered for this abominable crime. The
third were ſuch <hi>Patrons</hi> as had cheated, abuſed, or deſerted their
Clients. It was a Cuſtome amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> for the poorer
ſort, which were called <hi>Plebei,</hi> to make choice of ſome one of the
richer, which were termed <hi>Patricii,</hi> to be their protectors in
their lives and fortunes, to defend and reſcue them from the
unjuſt oppreſſions and perſecutions of their more powerfull
adverſaries; and theſe were called <hi>Patroni;</hi> for which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
or patronage the others (called <hi>Clientes</hi>) were bound
to return all obſervance and reſpect, to credit them with their
attendance in publick Aſſemblies, to disburſe out of their own
purſes toward the beſtowing of their Daughters, the paying
of publick <hi>Mulcts,</hi> the giving of <hi>Largeſſes</hi> in ſuing for Offices,
&amp;c. Neither was it lawfull for either of them, to inform, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
to give their voices, or to ſide with adverſaries one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
another without the guilt of treaſon, for which they were
<hi>Diis inferis devoti,</hi> curſed to Hell, and the Law gave liberty for
any man to kill them: ſo ſacred and inviolable a thing was
faith amongſt the Ancients; nay, ſo great was the reciprocall
bond and tie of the Patron towards the Client, that (as <hi>A. Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
teſtifies <hi>l. 20. c.</hi> 1.) they preferred their Client to the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of their relations, and did defend them though it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their own Brother. The fourth were the Covetous,
who preferring their filthy, ſordid, and illegal gain to all other
reſpects whatſoever, were ſo far from making others ſharers
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:113289:73"/>
with them in their great wealth and riches, that they denied
that ſupport and aſſiſtance (which by all Laws both natural
and civil they were oblig'd unto) to their neareſt and deareſt
relations. The fift were adulterous perſons, ſuch (ſayes he)
as have been ſlain in that filthy and unlawfull act; for by the
Law the Husband might kill the Adulterer and his Wife, if he
took them together. Laſtly, he puts all Rebels in this dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Liſt, who take up armes againſt their natural Prince, their
politick Father, and tear out the bowels of their native ſoyl,
their deareſt Mother: ſuch arms the Poet there full juſtly calls
<hi>impia,</hi> and as juſtly damns them who take them up, to <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarus,</hi>

10. <hi>c.</hi> 16. for he is reckoned by our Author a little above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
thoſe who both deſcended to, and returned from Hell;
and therefore how can it be ſaid that he ſat here for ever? The
learned <hi>De la Cerda</hi> ſalves it thus: <hi>Virgil</hi> ſpeaks here of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus,</hi>
not when he deſcended alive into Hell to raviſh <hi>Proſerpine,</hi>
but of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> who after his death was ſaid to ſit for ever upon
a hot burning ſtone: <hi>Cael. Rhodig. l. 4. c.</hi> 8. Although I ſee
no reaſon why <hi>Theſeus</hi> ſhould be condemned to ſo cruel a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who for his heroick deeds deſerved ſo well of mankind,
that after his death he was thought worthy of divine honours,
of altars and Sacrifices, as you may read in his life written by
<hi>Plutarch;</hi> wherefore ſome read it <hi>Thereus,</hi> as <hi>Meyênus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.
But for <hi>Phlegyas,</hi> he was ſaid to be the ſonne of <hi>Mars,</hi>
King of the <hi>Lapithae,</hi> Father of <hi>Ixîon,</hi> and the Nymph <hi>Corônis,</hi>
who being raviſhed by <hi>Apollo,</hi> he in revenge fired that Gods
Temple at <hi>Delphi,</hi> for which impiety he was ſlain by <hi>Apollo,</hi>
and thruſt into Hell. He was certainly a very wicked Tyrant,
and therefore worthily damned: his own guilt he openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,
whilſt he bids others by his example beware of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the like offences of injuſtice againſt men, and impiety

Secondly, of thoſe who having the <hi>legiſlative</hi> power, have
both made &amp; abrogated Laws for mony: in the Latin the Poet
alludes to the <hi>Roman</hi> Cuſtome, who when they had enacted a
Law, uſed to engrave the ſame in brazen Tables, and then to
affixe them to a pillar in ſome publick place, there to be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

who had been guilty of inceſt, a filthineſs which nature abhors.
<hi>Donatus</hi> (whom <hi>Servius</hi> for this reprehends) ſayes that the

ſee Hell moſt naturally depainted by the excellent pencill of

invented on purpoſe, to the end that thoſe-whom humane

clear and gentle ſtreams, pleaſant fruits, harmonious Muſick,

which the faithfull expect hereafter) yet were ſuch as they
thought would beſt ſuit with vulgar capacities, and be moſt

here the Poet proceeding after the ſame method he uſed in his

who were Inhabitants of theſe bleſſed Manſions, and thoſe for

the Sea: See <hi>Plin. l. 3. c.</hi> 16. It is ſeigned by the Poet to be
an <hi>Elyſian</hi> River, becauſe (as <hi>Dela Cerda</hi> and our <hi>Farnaby</hi>
affirm out of <hi>Gerop. Origin l.</hi> 9.) a great part of this River is
ſwallowed up in the earth, and never breaks forth again;
though herein that Author agrees not with <hi>Plinie,</hi> who ſayes
indeed that it does hide it ſelf in a paſſage under ground, but
riſeth again in a place not far diſtant, <hi>viz. in agro Forovibienſt:</hi>
others make this an infernal River, in regard of the courſe it
runs; for riſing out of <hi>Veſulus,</hi> which is near the <hi>Liguſtick</hi>
Sea, called <hi>Mare inferum,</hi> it directs its courſe to the <hi>Adriatick,</hi>
which was known by the name of <hi>Mare ſuperum. Servius</hi>
ſeems to be of opinion that <hi>Eridanus</hi> is put here <hi>pro quolibet
fluvio,</hi> a proper name for an appellative, which is frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Poets; as <hi>pocula Achelcia, pro fluvialia,</hi> and <hi>Adria</hi>
for any ſea. Though for my part I am apt to believe, that it
is for no other reaſon mentioned here by <hi>Virgil,</hi> but for that
he had a mind to celebrate a River not only in it ſelf ſo famous,
and hence by himſelf elſe-where ſtyled <hi>Fluviorum rex Erida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi>
but alſo becauſe it was not far diſtant from his native

                  <hi>Herod,</hi> it ſeems, was a <hi>Pythagorean</hi> in this alſo, whilſt he ſaid

wade too farre in theſe ſpeculations, we ſhall therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the next head, which is concerning the creation of
things.</p>
               <p>The Poets ſenſe and meaning here is briefly this, that there
is a certain ſpirit or ſoul which doth inform,<note place="margin">The Creation of things.</note> actuate, complete,
cheriſh, and ſuſtain all Beings, whether <hi>elementary, viz.</hi> the
<hi>Fire, Air</hi> (comprehended in the word <hi>Coelum,</hi> or the heaven)
<hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water (periphraſtically</hi> expreſſed in the words <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos
liquentes,</hi> the liquid or watrie plains) or <hi>celeſtial,</hi> exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> as the two moſt glorious, operative
and powerfull Planets in generation. <hi>Aſtra Titania,</hi> put here
by an <hi>Enallage,</hi> for <hi>Aſtrum Titanium,</hi> ſignifies the Sun, from
<hi>Titan,</hi> who was ſo skilfull an <hi>Aſtrologue,</hi> that he was feigned
to be Brother to the Sun; as <hi>Cael. Rhodig.</hi> obſerves out of
<hi>Pauſan. in Corinthiacis, lect. antiq. l. 24. c.</hi> 17. and <hi>Titan</hi> is
often taken for the Sun it ſelf: hence <hi>Aſtrum Titanium</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a circumlocution of <hi>Titan</hi> or the Sun. But to proceed;
from the operation of this ſoul or ſpirit, not only ſimple bodies,
as the <hi>Elements</hi> and <hi>Heavens,</hi> took their being, and are by the
propitious influx thereof preſerved therein; but mixt bodies
alſo, as he inſtances in <hi>men, beaſts, birds</hi> and <hi>fiſhes.</hi> The ſum
of all is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is a certain ſpirit or ſoul, to whoſe
operations and powerfull inſinuations the world and all therein
contained owes both its <hi>exiſtence</hi> and <hi>ſubſiſtence.</hi> If we by the
ſpirit or ſoul here mentioned underſtand God himſelf, or his
<hi>omnipotent</hi> Spirit, and the powerfull <hi>emanations</hi> thereof, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more conſonant, not only to reaſon, but alſo to the
<hi>analogie</hi> of the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> then the aſſertion of our Poet:
For God is truly that Spirit, which being preſent every where,
is without extenſion of it ſelf diffuſed through all things, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:113289:79"/>
doth <hi>intus alere,</hi> cheriſh and ſuſtain all things. This is that
ſoul which actuates the vaſt Machine of this world, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds,
preſerves, and governs the great fabrick of the Univerſe,
which otherwiſe would fall into diſorder, confuſion, and into
that primitive <hi>Chaos</hi> out of which it was at firſt educed, for
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>In him we live, move, and have
our being.</hi> If we give tbis interpretation to the Poet, theſe few
verſes ſeem to be an <hi>epitome,</hi> or brief comprehenſion of the
firſt chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> touching the Creation; for as <hi>Moſes</hi>
ſayes there; <hi>In principio Deus creavit coelum &amp; terram;</hi> ſo
<hi>Virgil</hi> here, <hi>Principio coelum &amp; terras, &amp;c. Spiritus intus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit:</hi>
and whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayes, that <hi>Spiritus Dei movebat, vel
incubabat ſupra faciem aquarum,</hi> that the Spirit of God did
move or brood upon the face of the waters; ſo <hi>Virgil</hi> here
tels us of a <hi>Spiritus,</hi> or <hi>Mens,</hi> which <hi>magno ſe corpore miſcet:</hi>
as mention is made there of the Creation of thoſe two great
<hi>Luminaries,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Moon;</hi> the like is here alſo. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as the Creation of <hi>Beaſts, Birds, Fiſh,</hi> and then of <hi>Man,</hi> is
there ſpecified, ſo <hi>Virgil</hi> ſayes here,

But others (and with them I am apt to concurre) are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>Virgil</hi> here ſpeaks according to the mind and ſenſe of
his Maſter <hi>Plato</hi> (who followed <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras</hi>
herein, the firſt founders and fautors of the <hi>Academick</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy)
as he did in his opinion concerning the <hi>tranſmigration</hi>
of ſouls. <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> and elſewhere (as <hi>Wendilinus</hi>
cites him, <hi>Phyſ. contempl. ſect. 2. c.</hi> 6.) endeavours to prove,
that this World or Univerſe is informed by a ſoul diſtinct from
the World it ſelf, which doing the office which other ſouls doe
in the particular beings they inform, doth preſerve, move and
govern this <hi>All,</hi> and all its parts, making the world hereby an
<hi>Animal,</hi> rul'd and govern'd by its own peculiar ſoul: nor is
God meant hereby, but ſome other <hi>entity,</hi> different from that
<hi>ens entium,</hi> and by them ſtyled <hi>Anima, vel Spiritus Mundi.</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:113289:80"/>
But this is throughly winnowed and refuted by the learned
<hi>Wendilinus</hi> in the place above mentioned, and the arguments
of its aſſertors fully anſwered; to whom for more ample ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

That the ſoul conſiſts of <hi>fire,</hi> was the opinion of <hi>Hipparchus;</hi>
that of <hi>air,</hi> of <hi>Anaximenes;</hi> that of both, of <hi>Boethos,</hi> and our

Doubtleſs <hi>Virgil</hi> herein concurred with <hi>Homer</hi> in his opinion:
And from hence the <hi>Stoicks</hi> opin'd, that the ſoul as ſoon as
freed from the body, preſently took its flight to the <hi>Concave</hi>
of the Moon, the place or region of the element of fire. But
of theſe dreams more then enough: let us now return to our
Author. <hi>Virgil</hi> from theſe premiſſes inferres, that the Soul
is of an active, piercing, and ſubtile nature, as are the principles
whereof it conſiſts, that it is of it ſelf free from all paſſions and
perturbations,
<q>—quantum non noxia corpora tardant.</q>
Unleſs by the commixtion and conjunction with the body it
abate of its naturall vigour, and become, as that is, heavy and
droſſie. All ſouls are equally <hi>intelligent,</hi> and alike <hi>impaſſionate;</hi>
But, according to the variety of complexions, the abundance
of humors, the pureneſs of the <hi>ſpirits,</hi> the diſpoſition of the
<hi>organs,</hi> eſpecially of the brain, they are more intenſe or remiſs.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:113289:81"/>
Hence the Poet ſayes, that as to the <hi>intellectual</hi> part thereof it
becomes heavy, dull and inapprehenſive, ſo to the <hi>appetitive</hi>
or will, it becomes ſubject to ſundry irregularities and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
which he ſpecifies here in four, whereof two have for
their object an <hi>Evil,</hi> and two a <hi>Good:</hi> The firſt is <hi>Fear,</hi> which
is <hi>a paſſion of the ſoul touching a future evil,</hi> as <hi>Grief.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is <hi>touching an evil preſent, and now upon us.</hi> The third is
<hi>Deſire,</hi> or <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi> which is a <hi>paſſion of the ſoul about a
good abſent,</hi> as <hi>Joy.</hi> The fourth is <hi>about a good preſent, and in
fruition,</hi> or the <hi>acquieſcence of the Soul in the poſſeſſion of its
deſired object.</hi> Three of theſe, <hi>viz. Deſire, Joy</hi> and <hi>Grief,</hi>
are placed in the <hi>Concupiſcible Appetite,</hi> and one, <hi>viz. Fear,</hi>
in the <hi>iraſcible.</hi> He inferres further, that the ſoul is not
only ſubject to error and paſſion, whilſt united to the body,
but that it doth abſolutely for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> its own nature, nor is at all
ſenſible of its originall, which is of <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>air;</hi> which he means
here whilſt he ſaies—<hi>nec auras reſpiciunt;</hi> the body is therefore
called by him <hi>animae carcer,</hi> the priſon of the ſoul; reflecting
haply upon that of <hi>Plato,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the body is the ſouls
grave or ſepulchre: For as thoſe who are ſhut up in a dark

<hi>incarcerated</hi> in the body is utterly blinded, nor can <hi>auras reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi>
have the free proſpect of the <hi>air</hi> whereof it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
               <p>The Poet here occurres to a tacite objection: the ſoul (it is

much of that pollution which it contracted whilſt it was <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd</hi>

imaginary <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which as neceſſarily previous to that
<hi>Tranſmigration,</hi> we have already diſcourſed of, he makes of
three ſorts, either by <hi>ventilation,</hi> by <hi>air, purgation</hi> by <hi>fire,</hi> or

was therefore made of oak, becauſe anciently, before the uſe
of corn, acorns, the fruit of that tree, was the ſuſtenance and

a perſon fam'd for his juſtice and religion, was by the general

(when placed in the regal Throne) having made peace
with all his neighbours, applied himſelf ſolely to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Lawes, Manners and Diſcipline both Civil and
Religious, introducing all Rites and Ceremonies into their
Church; whence he is here ſaid to be, <hi>ramis inſignis Olivae,</hi>

taught them to govern by religion and juſtice that Empire which
they had atchieved by injury and force.</hi> Hence the very names

the contemptible, but ſecure, nickname of <hi>Brutus,</hi> or
the <hi>Brute:</hi> And in all appearance he continued ſuch, till a
fair opportunity incouraged him to lay aſide the fool coat,
and to appear in the more becomming dreſs of a man of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and courage: For he was the firſt, who having reſcued
the oppreſſed people from the impotent rule of the <hi>Tarquins,</hi>
changed the form of government from a <hi>Monarchy</hi> to a <hi>State,</hi>
from <hi>Regal</hi> to <hi>Conſular;</hi> and was the firſt, who (together with
his Collegue <hi>Collatinus</hi>) was inveſted in this new Magiſtracy;
which was <hi>annual,</hi> and to be adminiſtred by two, on purpoſe
to defeat and diſappoint thoſe advantages, which a ſingle and

from the care they took of the common good; (as <hi>Cicero</hi> will
have it) or (as <hi>Varro) quòd conſulere populum, &amp; Senatum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berent,</hi>
becauſe they ought to adviſe with the Senate and the
People in all affairs and deſigns. This office (as annual, and
in the perſon of two) differed only from the Kingly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
otherwiſe they had the ſame enſigns and marks of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
which the Kings had; for they had their twelve
<hi>Lictors</hi> carrying the <hi>Faſces,</hi> or bundle of rods before them,
with the <hi>Secures,</hi> or Axes, as before the late Kings: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Virgil</hi> calls them here, <hi>faſces receptos, viz. à regibus,</hi> the
Faſces or ſoveraign power wreſted out of the hands of the
Kings. But to proceed; and I hope that the Reader will not

therefore (the principal vindicator of the peoples liberty)
knowing that there was as much virtue required in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he had got, as in the primarie acquiſition, endeavours
by all means poſſible to confirm and knit the as-yet-feeble
joynts of his infant <hi>Republick:</hi> and to this end in the firſt place
he cauſeth the people to ingage themſelves by oath againſt the

                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:113289:89"/>
he did not only pronounce ſentence upon his own ſonnes,
<hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius,</hi> with others of the Nobility neerly allied

overſeer and exactor of their puniſhment; <hi>&amp; qui ſpectator erat

Thirdly, he cauſed all the eſtate, both real and perſonal of the
ejected Family, to be diſſipated and divided amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
knowing full well, that thoſe who had ſwallowed ſuch fair
morſels, would be very hardly perſwaded to regorge them.

and in this battel fell their great <hi>Brutus;</hi> but moſt remarkably;
<hi>Aruns</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> who commanded the enemies

he alſo commanded, crying, <hi>Dii regum ultores adeſte, ye Gods,
avengers of Kings, be preſent and aſſiſt me,</hi> ſet ſpurs to his horſe
and ran furiouſly upon <hi>Brutus,</hi> who as gallantly received his

ſances, and fell down dead together. But after a long conteſt
between the two Armies, and the loſs of 13000. men on each

for that liberty in it ſelf was ſo ſweet and inviting, that unleſſe
Kings did defend their crowns as vigorouſly as the people ſought

would be no diſtinction of degrees remaining in Cities or Common-wealths:

Theſe arguments, and the conſideration of his own caſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<hi>Porſena</hi> in <hi>Tarquins</hi> quarrel; but after a vigorous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and almoſt a victory, there was a ſudden pacification

quite left out in the agreement, who (as reſtleſs as he was

by the intervention of <hi>Mamilius Tuſculanus</hi> (a perſon of

proſperity had married his Daughter) ſtirres up all the people

ſuſpected and dreaded by all their neighbours; but after a
long, doubtfull, and bloody fight, the victory remained ſtill
with the <hi>Romans;</hi> wherefore <hi>Tarquinius</hi> (having loſt both his
ſons in the warres, now grown old, and deſtitute of friends)
gave over all further hopes of recovering his right, and retired

was this: The General of the wavering and declining Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

hands (which were hidden under his Robe) out at his

I pray ye, I worſhip ye, I ask and require ye to give ſucceſſe
to the</hi> Roman <hi>forces and army, and to purſue the enemies of the</hi>

with the legions and auxiliaries of the enemy to the infernal Gods
and Mother</hi> Tellus, <hi>for the State, Army, Legions; and Auxiliares

his Robe with a <hi>Cinctus Gabinus,</hi> ſuch a girdle as the <hi>Gabii</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and mounting his horſe with his ſword drawn, ruſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

they bore away with them all the evil fortune which was like

then for that he appeared to him to be leſſe vigorous than
what became the <hi>Manlian</hi> name, he in a manner caſt off,

from the danger of all blows; and lying like a ſmall veſſel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a high carv'd ſhip, wounded him with often repeated
thruſts in the bottom of his belly, till at laſt he fell dead at his
feet. Nor did he offer any violence to the proſtrate body, but
onely taking off the gold chain, which he wore about his neck,
put it (all bloody as it was) about his own: whence from
<hi>Torques,</hi> by which the <hi>Latines</hi> underſtand a chain, He, and
his poſterity after him, were called <hi>Torquati.</hi> Thus <hi>Livie</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
this ſignal Duel. <hi>Q. Claudius Quadrigarius</hi> (a far more
ancient Author) differs in many particulars from this narrative,
as you may read him cited by a <hi>A. Gellius l. 9. c.</hi> 13. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of this fight was ſo conſiderable, that the <hi>Gaulick</hi> Army,
utterly diſmay'd at the worſting of their Champion, diſlodged
the next night; and making a ſudden and diſorderly retreat,
left their Camp, with much ſpoil and booty behind them.
There is a third particular recorded in Hiſtory touching this
<hi>Manlius,</hi> and ſuch an one as never in my reading occurred in
any prophane Story. Twenty two years after this exploit,
<hi>viz. an urb. 415. Torquatus</hi> was choſen <hi>Conſul</hi> with <hi>P. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius
Mus.</hi> Both the <hi>Conſuls</hi> were in the field with a very
powerfull Army ready to ingage the <hi>Latines,</hi> an enemy very
conſiderable in regard of their numbers, force, armes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
in all which they equalled the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that it was thought requiſite to revive the ancient
diſcipline of warre; to which end divers orders were iſſued
forth; amongſt the reſt it was proclaimed, that no perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhould, upon pain of death, fight the enemy without
ſpecial command from the Generals. It hapned that <hi>T. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:113289:93"/>
Sonne to the <hi>Conſul,</hi> being ſent abroad with a ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

quarter where the <hi>Tuſculan</hi> horſe lay encamped, under the

valour and skill in horſemanſhip. He eſpying, and knowing
the <hi>Conſuls</hi> Sonne, called out to him, and in reprochfull terms
challenged him to the Combat: young <hi>Manlius</hi> as readily
accepts the invitation; and both ſetting ſpurres to their horſe,
ran furiouſly at each other; but in the encounter the <hi>Roman</hi>
ſlew the <hi>Latine,</hi> and gathering up the ſpoils of the ſlain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with his Troop in a triumphant manner to the Tent of
his Father, the <hi>Conſul,</hi> where entring, he ſalutes him in this
manner; <hi>That all may know, Sir, that I am the Sonne of ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

heard, he preſently turned away from his Son (who expected a
more cheerful reception) and commanded a Councel of war by
ſound of trumpet forthwith to be aſſembled. The Councel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
met, he thus began; the words are <hi>Livies: Since thou,</hi> T.
Manlius, <hi>regarding neither the Conſuls Command, nor the reſpect
due to thy Parent, haſt (againſt our expreſs order) ingaged with
the enemy, and as much as in thee lay overthrown that military
diſcipline upon which the</hi> Roman <hi>State hath to this day ſtood and

forget the intereſt of the Common-wealth, or my ſelf, and
mine own relations; I will rather ſuffer in thy puniſhment, then
that the Common-wealth ſhould be in the leaſt prejudiced by thy
miſdemeanor: we ſhall both of us be a ſad, but a wholſome preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the ages to come. Truly both that ingenite affection which
I have for thee as my child, together with this</hi> ſpecimen <hi>of worth
and gallantry which thou haſt now given, move me not a little:
But ſince the</hi> Conſular <hi>authority is either to be eſtabliſhed by thy

even thou thy ſelf (if thou haſt any of my blood running in thy
veins) wilt not refuſe to reſtore by thy</hi> punition <hi>that military diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
which by thy</hi> default <hi>thou haſt deſtroyed. Goe Lictor, do
thy office.</hi> The ſentence was no ſooner pronounced then it
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:113289:94"/>
was put in execution, and a gallant, but unfortunate ſonne,
by a ſevere, but wiſe, Fathers command, brought to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
end, being to the great terrour and grief of the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
publickly beheaded. This action might adminiſter copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
matter for a declamation: much might be ſaid for, much
againſt it; however it argued a greatneſs of ſoul in the Father
not to be expreſſed: the effect of it was the eſtabliſhing of the

high and often-repeated his commands and dignities, that he
did not only eclipſe thoſe (otherwiſe deſerving men) of his

the <hi>Aequi</hi> and the <hi>Volſci,</hi> he was the firſt who advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

the ſpear, which was broke in the wound, charged couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
on, and by his example ſo animated his own party, and
diſheartned the enemy, that the victory was chiefly due to his
undaunted valour and forwardneſs. And this was the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of his advancement, and that firſt ſtep by which he
climb'd that high ſcale of his following preferments. For he
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:113289:94"/>

years, as <hi>Sextus Rufus</hi> computes it. And this is the reaſon
why <hi>Camillus</hi> (who had been preferred to all dignities in the

Such (I ſay) was the face of things in the <hi>Roman</hi> State, when
theſe two Grandees, <hi>viz. Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> (the ſouls now
appearing before <hi>Anchiſes</hi>) puſh'd on by ambition and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
involved their native ſoil in moſt bloody warres. <hi>Caeſar</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:113289:96"/>
could brook no ſuperior, <hi>Pompey</hi> no equall: <hi>Caeſar</hi> pretended
a righting himſelf againſt the Senate, and a party there who
oppoſed his (as he thought) but reaſonable requeſt, in ſuing
for the <hi>Conſulſhip; Pompey</hi> pretended the <hi>Senates</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths
cauſe, which indeed carried more plauſibleneſs
with it, though it is more then probable that the <hi>Publick</hi>
was the leaſt thing intended by either of the Captains; and
that whoſoever had been victorious, that had fared alike.
<hi>Pompey</hi> having in deſigne (had he ſucceeded) to have done
what <hi>Caeſar</hi> did: But whatſoever their ſecret aims were, the
cauſe of both parties arming themſelves was certainly this;
<hi>Caeſar</hi> (having done moſt eminent ſervice for the State in
<hi>France, Britanny,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi>) required, that (though abſent)
he might at the next election of <hi>Conſuls</hi> be choſen; a requeſt
(conſidering his merit) not in the leaſt unreaſonable: this was
once aſſented to, <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf appearing for it: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
(upon ſome ſuſpicions and jealouſies) revoked, and <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
commanded to quit his Army, and as a private man to come
in perſon, and to preferre his Suit; which if he refuſed to doe,
he was forthwith to be proclaimed an enemy to the State, and
to be proceeded againſt as a Traitor. Their drift being only
to deveſt him of his power, and then to call him to an account
for many things they had to alledge againſt him. But <hi>Caeſar</hi>
perceiving the deſign of his enemies (amongſt which <hi>Pompey</hi>
now openly declared himſelf) did not only not quit his Army,
but advancing toward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Rome,</hi> filled all places where he came
with terrour and <hi>conſternation;</hi> inſomuch that the <hi>Conſuls</hi>
with the <hi>Senators,</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> their General, leaving the City
to <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s mercy, fled into the furtheſt part of <hi>Italy,</hi> where
thinking themſelves as inſecure, they from <hi>Brundiſium</hi> paſſed
into <hi>Epirus: Caeſar</hi> by this means remaining abſolute Maſter
of all <hi>Italy.</hi> Then returning to <hi>Rome,</hi> He, with <hi>P. Servilius
Iſauricus,</hi> was the ſecond time made <hi>Conſul, an. urb.</hi> 706.
Having ordered things to his mind in the City, and inriched
himſelf by the direption of the publick treaſury, he went into
<hi>Spain,</hi> where having ſubdued <hi>Pompeys</hi> Lieutenants there, and
ſecured that Province, he returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:113289:96"/>
he marched with his Army to <hi>Brundiſium,</hi> and thence about
the Nones of <hi>January</hi> this very year 706. he tranſported his
Legions to <hi>Oricum,</hi> the moſt convenient Port of <hi>Epirus;</hi> and
about the twentieth of <hi>July</hi> following fought with, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
routed <hi>Pompey,</hi> near the City of <hi>Pharſalus,</hi> ſeated upon the
River <hi>Enipeus,</hi> in <hi>Theſſalie;</hi> whence the plains adjoyning
(where this fatal quarrel was diſputed) were called the <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalian</hi>
fields. The effect of this victory, with the following
ſucceſſes in <hi>Aegypt, Africa</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> was the change of the
government from a State to a Monarchy, begun in <hi>J. Caeſar,</hi>

know that the <hi>Achaeans</hi> (then the moſt potent people of <hi>Pelopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus,</hi>
and Lords of the better part of that Iſland) picking a
quarrel with the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> with deſign to ſubdue them,
made incurſions into their Country: whereupon the injured

                  <hi>Spartans</hi> make their applications to the Senate and people of
<hi>Rome,</hi> under whoſe protection they were: a welcome meſſage
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who deſired but a fair pretence to make warre
upon the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> now the only powerfull and unſubdued
people of all <hi>Greece:</hi> wherefore they forthwith diſpatch their
Embaſſadours, with commiſſion to take cognizance of, and
to decide the difference betwixt theſe two States. But the
<hi>Achaeans</hi> did not only not give ear to any thing tending to a
pacification, but offered new injuries to the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi>
and (againſt the Law of Nations) many indignities to the
Commiſſioners themſelves, even to the throwing their ordure
upon them as they paſſed the ſtreets: For which affronts war
is denounced againſt them, and an Army under the Command
of <hi>L. Mummius</hi> appears at the very entrance of the <hi>Iſthmus;</hi>
where a battel was fought betwixt them and the <hi>Romans,</hi> who
obtaining a ſignal victory, marched directly to <hi>Corinth</hi> (not
farre diſtant from the place of battel) which they eaſily
took, raz'd, and burnt, and (having put all the men to the
ſword) ſold the women and children for ſlaves. <hi>Corinth</hi> was

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:113289:98"/>
made that with <hi>Greece</hi> a Province to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: the
reaſons of <hi>De la Cerda</hi> (who labours earneſtly to make good
his aſſertion in juſtification of <hi>Virgil</hi> againſt the calumnie of
<hi>Heginus,</hi> as he terms it) are but at the beſt but conjectures;
there is nothing poſitively proved out of good Authors. But
I deſire him to ſhew me where he finds, firſt that <hi>Aemilius</hi>
had any thing to doe with <hi>Peleponeſus,</hi> or that after his victory
over <hi>Perſeus</hi> he made warre upon the <hi>Peloponeſians. Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
(who writes his life, and with whom all thoſe who ſpeak
of thoſe times agree) makes no mention of any ſuch thing;
which had been a particular not to be omitted, had it been ſo.
But after the <hi>Macedonian</hi> victory, and the ſettlement of affairs
there, brings him home through <hi>Epirus</hi> into <hi>Italy.</hi> Beſide,
the <hi>Macedonian</hi> warre and the <hi>Achaean</hi> were different, both in
reſpect of time (that being <hi>an. urb.</hi> 586. and this 608. twenty
two years after) and of the Generals, <hi>Aemilius</hi> commanding
in that, and <hi>Mummius</hi> in this. Secondly, to derive <hi>Perſeus</hi>
from <hi>Achilles,</hi> is an aſſertion as little ſupported by Hiſtory as
the former. It is probable, that had it been ſo either really, or
had he had the vanity to have aſſumed it to himſelf, Hiſtorians
would not have omitted it, eſpecially the <hi>Roman,</hi> whoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
(they being victorious) would have been the greater, the
more illuſtrious the perſon had been whom they ſubdued. By
the Mother-ſide (which is the ſurer) I am certain that he was
farre enough from touching <hi>Achilles</hi> in blood: For (as <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

called <hi>Gnathaenia,</hi> on whom King <hi>Philip</hi>'s Father begot
him. As for his alliance by the Fathers ſide, the firſt of this
race was <hi>Antigonus,</hi> one of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Captains, in whoſe
time there is little or nothing ſaid of him; who had he been of
that illuſtrious extraction, would doubtleſs therefore have been
more notable, ſince he was a perſon otherwiſe very deſerving,
and a great Souldier, as in the following warres after <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>
death he made appear. But, what is moſt evincing, is,
that <hi>Plutarch</hi> (a moſt diligent writer) who wrote the life of
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> this mans Sonne, makes no mention of his deſcent
from <hi>Achilles,</hi> but only that he was the Sonne of <hi>Antigonus,</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:113289:98"/>
and no more; ſo that it is true that <hi>Perſeus</hi> was born of a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſtem, but the original of his Family was but a private perſon,
<hi>viz. Antigonus,</hi> who with his Sonne <hi>Demetrius</hi> called himſelf
King, after the defeat of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> in the naval fight at <hi>Salami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
ſome ſeventeen years after <hi>Alexanders</hi> death. <hi>Demetrius</hi>
was the firſt of this line, who was King of <hi>Macedon:</hi> Second,
<hi>Antigonus Gonâtas</hi> his Sonne: Third, <hi>Demetrius</hi> the ſecond:

the family and perſon of <hi>L. Mummius,</hi> who was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

as was the firſt of his name or family who came to be advanced
to the <hi>Conſular</hi> dignity, or any <hi>Curule</hi> Magiſtracie. By the way
we may obſerve, that amongſt other diſtinctions of degrees,
the <hi>Romans</hi> were divided into <hi>Nobiles,</hi> or Nobles, who were
ſuch as had the <hi>Images</hi> of their Anceſtors; into <hi>Novos,</hi> or New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

who had neither <hi>Images</hi> of themſelves, or of their
Predeceſſors. Now none could have the right of <hi>Images</hi> (which
is equivalent with that of bearing Arms with us) but thoſe to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:113289:99"/>
whom the right of riding in a <hi>Curule</hi> Chair belonged, which
was an Ivory Chair, and called <hi>Sella Curulis,</hi> or <hi>Currulis,</hi> from
<hi>Currus,</hi> or the Chariot wherein it was carried for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate

<hi>A. Gell. l. 3. c.</hi> 18. Thus <hi>Magiſtratus major</hi> and <hi>Curulis</hi> is all

honorable office in the Common-wealth, but of thoſe whom

but of ſome other City, which living according to their own
Lawes, and governed by their own Magiſtrates, had yet the
title of <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens: Such were the <hi>Fundani, Formiani,
Cumani, Tuſculani,</hi> our <hi>Cato</hi>'s Countrymen; and the <hi>Arpinâ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
Tullies,</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> their Compatriots. They were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Municipes, à munere capiendo,</hi> becauſe they had the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that which the <hi>Romans</hi> call <hi>Munus honorarium, i. e</hi>
the honour to ſerve as Citizens in the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, and not

theſe priviledges were indulged were called <hi>Municipia.</hi> In
proceſs of time the <hi>Romans</hi> inlarged the Charters of ſome of
theſe <hi>Municipal</hi> Towns, and for ſome great ſervice done, gave
them the full priviledge of <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, making them capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of giving their voices in the election of Magiſtrates, and of
being themſelves choſen into office. But then (according to
<hi>Stadius ibid.</hi>) they were totally deveſted of their own Lawes,
and became ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſtitutions. In concluſion,
all <hi>Italy</hi> (after the <hi>Marſick</hi> or <hi>Social</hi> Warre, which hapned

a <hi>Municipal</hi> Town of <hi>Latium,</hi> ſome fifteen miles diſtant from

Village known by the name of <hi>Freſcata.</hi> He was the
Sonne of <hi>M. Porcius;</hi> and ſirnamed <hi>Cato,</hi> from his wiſedome,
ſagacity and experience; from the <hi>Latine</hi> word <hi>Catus,</hi> which
the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">

whereas his originall <hi>agnomination</hi> was <hi>Priſcus, M. Portius
Priſcus.</hi> He was brought firſt to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Val. Flaccus,</hi> who
diſcerning more then ordinary endowments in him, judged
that he might in time become a fitting inſtrument to ſerve his
Country. He made himſelf firſt known by his eloquence in
pleading Cauſes; and doubtleſs he was the ableſt Orator of his
time. But thinking this kind of life too lazie and inactive, he
caſt off his Gown, and girt on his Sword, and leaving the City
for the Camp, ſerv'd firſt as a <hi>Tribune</hi> or Colonel; then when
<hi>Scipio</hi> went upon his <hi>African</hi> expedition, he went along with
him as <hi>Quaeſtor,</hi> or Treaſurer to the Army: Afterward, being
<hi>Praetor,</hi> he reduced <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Conſul, Celtiberia</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi>
for which he triumphed. After this, deſiring to ſerve his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in any condition, he accompanied <hi>M. Acilius Glabrio,</hi> as
private Colonel in the Warre againſt <hi>Antiochus,</hi> where he did
eminent ſervice. He was at laſt choſen <hi>Cenſor</hi> with his friend
<hi>Val. Flaccus,</hi> who had been alſo his Collegue in his <hi>Conſulſhip;</hi>
and (although much oppoſed by divers great ones, who ſtood
in competition with him) yet he carried it in the election. He
behaved himſelf ſo remarkably ſtout, and incorruptibly honeſt
in his Office, that by way of eminence he got himſelf the name
of the <hi>Cenſor.</hi> And theſe are the publick employments which
he run through: In general, he was a very ſevere man in his
life and converſation, an enemy to exceſs and luxury; very juſt
and upright; a great lover of the Publick weal, to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereof he bent his whole ſtudies and endeavours. He
was noted indeed to be a perſon of too free and biting a
tongue, of too ſowr &amp; ſevere a complexion, ſome ſay litigious
and quarrelſome; little ſuitable to the corrupt age wherein he
lived: all which was yet thought to proceed from the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of his own innocencie, and from a mind altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
with thoſe imputations which he reprehended in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:113289:100"/>
as for his intellectuals, he was a man of very able parts,
quick, witty, apprehenſive, eloquent, fitted for any either
publick or private employment! See the ample character <hi>Livie</hi>
gives of him <hi>l. 39. In hoc viro tanta vis animi, &amp;c.</hi> He wrote
much, and upon various ſubjects, eſpecially in Oratory, though
by the injury of time we are deprived of thoſe his Monuments.
He had two Wives, his firſt was of a noble Family, by whom
he had <hi>M. Cato,</hi> who married <hi>Tertia, Paulus Aemilius</hi> his
Daughter, a right Gallant, and deſerving perſon: He died
when he was choſen <hi>Praetor,</hi> before he was inveſted in his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
He begot <hi>M. Cato,</hi> who was <hi>Conſul</hi> with <hi>Q. Martius
Rex. an. urb.</hi> 637. and <hi>C. Cato, Conſul</hi> with <hi>M. Acilius Balbus,
an. urb. 640. Marcus,</hi> the elder of theſe, left another <hi>Marcus,</hi>
who being <hi>Praetor</hi> died in <hi>France:</hi> &amp; this is what we can gather
concerning <hi>Cato</hi>'s poſterity by his firſt Wife: See <hi>A. Gell. l.</hi> 13.
<hi>c.</hi> 18. He took for his ſecond choice the Daughter of <hi>Salonius,</hi>
his Client, a woman of mean birth, on whom he begot when
he was 80. years of age <hi>Cato Salonianus;</hi> who left two Sons,
<hi>M.</hi> and <hi>L. Cato:</hi> the firſt died whilſt he ſued to be <hi>Praetor,</hi> the

<hi>Quaeſtor</hi> or Treaſurer to <hi>C. Mancinus</hi> in the <hi>Numantine</hi> War,
and after his return to <hi>Rome</hi> was made <hi>Tribune</hi> of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
in which office, whether out of an innate hatred to the
Nobility, or out of a turbulent and ſeditious ſpirit of his own,
I cannot ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he cauſed a dangerous ſedition, and made ſuch
a ſchiſm or rent betwixt the <hi>Patricians</hi> and the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> as
could not without a Civil Warte have been pieced and cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
again, had not a ſudden and violent death intercepted him.
And here we may obſerve with <hi>Florus l. 3. c.</hi> 13. how that the
<hi>Tribunician</hi> power (which was at firſt intended for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
bulwark againſt the incroachments of the Nobility) did
its ſelf by degrees degenerate into the greateſt exorbitancie
and tyranny that could be, whilſt under that ſpecious and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
pretence of aſſerting the peoples liberty, thoſe popular
Magiſtrates did drive on their own ſiniſter and ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes;
and filling all things with faction and ſedition, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
the end for which they were at the firſt ordained, that
is, did deſtroy the peoples liberty, which they over-eagerly
pretended to patronize, and ſlacken the very nerves and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:113289:103"/>
of all civil polity, by their contentious bandings againſt
the Senate. But to proceed: <hi>Tib. Gracchus</hi> (partly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
the <hi>Nobility,</hi> but principally to ſhake the frame, and to
ſubvert the fundamentals of the preſent power, that he might
upon the ruines thereof raiſe the ſuperſtructure of his own
greatneſs) made it his buſineſs to cajole and flatter the people,
which (by virtue of his office) he did either by reviving old
antiquated Laws, or enacting new; all which tended to the
diminution and weakning of the <hi>Patricians,</hi> either in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
fortunes, or in their power and publick employments;
which pleaſed the Common people, who naturally hate their
Betters, and fool'd them into a belief that every one of them
ſhould come to ſhare the eſtates and dignities of the ruin'd <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi>
little imagining that they were to be uſed but as brute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
&amp; neceſſary tools, which were to be caſt aſide when
the work was done: Wherefore reſolved to proſecute the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi>
and haply ſecretly intending, if things hapned right, to
change the form of government, he firſt preferred the Laws
called <hi>Agrariae,</hi> by which he deprived them of their eſtates;
and thoſe called <hi>Judiciariae,</hi> by which he clipped the wings of
their power. By the firſt it was formerly enacted, That all
lands belonging to the Commonwealth (which were called the
publick lands, and were the acceſſions of ſome new Conqueſt)
ſhould at eaſie rates be rented out to the poorer ſort: theſe,
as Lives were lapſ'd, or as Leaſes determined, the <hi>Patricians</hi>
got into their hands, the Commons being by degrees utterly
deveſted of their ancient poſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ions. This cauſed g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and many offers were made in vain by ſome <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes</hi>
to reform this abuſe, and to reduce things to their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
wont and manner; but none proceeded ſo farre herein as
<hi>Tib. Gracchus,</hi> who cauſed the Law to paſs: and ſo it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
by the Commons, That the publick Lands ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the wealthier, and reinveſted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as formerly, in the
poor <hi>Plebeians.</hi> And this had the face and ſhew of equity,
but it was but a face and ſhew; for <hi>Gracchus</hi> did it not ſo much
to doe right to the people, as to ſpite the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and to
prepare the way for ſome further and more dangerous deſigne.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:113289:103"/>
After this had paſſed, he preferred his <hi>Judiciary</hi> Laws, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he took the power of <hi>Judicature</hi> from the <hi>Senate,</hi> to whom
it only belonged, and transferred it to the <hi>Equites</hi> or Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
the intermediate degree betwixt the <hi>Patricians</hi> and the
<hi>Plebeians:</hi> therein ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill flattering the people, who looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themſelves as honoured, and much ſtrengthened herein, the
power of <hi>Judicature</hi> being (by falling a degree lower) come
a ſtep nearer to themſelves. But whilſt <hi>Graechus</hi> was trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing
in his ſucceſſes in the <hi>Capitol</hi> (where he held his popular
conventions) the Senators (who were reduced to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
that they muſt ſuffer the ſeditious Tribune either
to ruine them, and with them the Commonwealth, or make
a vigorous attempt to reskue both from imiment danger) led
by <hi>Scipio Nasîca</hi> (Grandſon to that <hi>Nasîca</hi> who was called
<hi>vir optimus,</hi> the beſt of men) and ſeconded by a good ſtrong
party of friends, repairing to the <hi>Capitol,</hi> ſet upon <hi>Gracchus,</hi>
and diſſipating his party, ſlew him; and by his death put a ſtop
to thoſe deſperate innovations which he under colourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
had in deſign. But they did but put a ſtop to them; for
his Brother <hi>Caius,</hi> who was choſen <hi>Tribune</hi> ten years after, did
not only inſiſt in his Brothers footſteps, reviving thoſe Lawes
which he had preferred, but, as <hi>Paterculus</hi> affirms, <hi>longè ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jora
&amp; atrociora repetens, nihil immotum, nihil tranquillum, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil
quietum in eodem ſtatu relinquebat; attempting greater and
more horrible things, left nothing reſting in the ſame ſtate and
condition it was, and ought to be.</hi> But as he did purſue the ſame
pernicious projects, ſo did the ſame fate in the ſame place pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
him; for being forc'd out of the <hi>Capitol,</hi> where he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
himſelf, and hotly purſued by his enemies, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Servant (by ſome called <hi>Philocrates,</hi> by others <hi>Euporus</hi>)
to kill him; which he did, and afterward ſlaying himſelf, fell
down dead upon his Maſters body; a notable example of the
love and fidelity of a ſervant: <hi>Val. Max. l. 6. c. 8. Hunc</hi> Tib.

they aſpired to:</hi> As <hi>Patercules</hi> handſomely concludes. The
bodies of the ſlain Brethren (ſo hainous had their demerits
been in the eſteem of their implacable enemies) were denied
the laſt honour of ſepulture, and thrown into the River <hi>Tiber.</hi>
We muſt not here omit a particular inſtanced by all Authors,
to ſhew the unworthy return of a falſe friend, and the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
temptation of gold. <hi>L. Opimius</hi> the Conſul made a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
That whoſoever ſhould bring the head of <hi>C. Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
ſhould have the weight of it in gold: <hi>Septimuleius,</hi> his
intimate familiar, and much indeared friend, became the ready
Executioner of the Conſuls command, and brought <hi>Gracchus</hi>
his head in a triumphing manner fixed upon a ſpear; which by
the deceit of this covetous wretch (who had taken out his
brains, and poured molten lead into his skull) weighed ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen

died both in the bed of honour, and were ſlain in fight:
they were both of them very valiant men, and experienced

of this §. from <hi>Publius</hi> the younger came <hi>Pub. Scipio Africa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and <hi>L. Scipio Aſiaticus,</hi> with their Deſcendants. Of theſe
two we ſhall note what was moſt remarkable in their lives:
<hi>Publius</hi> ſerved his <hi>tyrocinium,</hi> or was firſt entred in the warres
under his Father at the battel of <hi>Ticînus:</hi> three years after he
commanded a Regiment of Foot at the battel of <hi>Cannae:</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, at the age of 24. he was ſent as <hi>Proconſul</hi> to manage
the warres of <hi>Spain,</hi> which in few years he totally reduced.
Some years after his return to <hi>Rome</hi> he was choſen Conſul with
<hi>P. Licinius Craſſus,</hi> the fifteenth year of the ſecond <hi>Punick</hi>
warre. When his <hi>Conſulate</hi> was expired the <hi>African</hi> warre

year of that warre, by giving an irrecuperable over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:113289:105"/>
to <hi>Annibal</hi> at the fatal battel of <hi>Nadagara:</hi> For this
victory he obtained a moſt glorious triumph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the title of
<hi>Africanus.</hi> He was a ſecond time Conſul with <hi>Tib. Smpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
Longus, an. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. C.</hi> 560. He was twice <hi>Cenſor,</hi> and three
times <hi>Prince,</hi> or <hi>L. Preſident</hi> of the <hi>Senate.</hi> In fine, he (as he

take the true proſpect of the largeneſs of the ſoul of this moſt

and paſſages of his life, which do more perfectly pourtraict him
then generals can poſſibly doe. At the battel of <hi>Ticînus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the reſt to follow him) left the Councel, and with his drawn
ſword ruſhing in amongſt the intended fugitives, made them
ſwear that they would not forſake their Country. See this
Story in <hi>Livie. l.</hi> 22. with the form of the oath: Thus (as <hi>Val.

revocavit: He did not only himſelf give a moſt ample teſtimony

that he would goe in perſon as his Brothers Lieutenant-General,
provided that the Senate would declare in favour of
him; which was forthwith done; and the war againſt <hi>Antiochus</hi>
(for the reſpect the Fathers bore to <hi>Publius</hi>) committed to
<hi>Lucius:</hi> The effect of it was the memorable field ſought and

he who by his Conqueſts had both inlarged and inriched the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, ſcorned to be compelled to give any farther
account then what himſelf thought fit. Theſe two examples
are alledged by Authors, as teſtimonies of the greatneſs and
exſuperancie of his ſpirit, which ſcorned to anſwer petty cavils
otherwiſe then by ſlighting them. The ſame <hi>A. Gellius. l.</hi> 7.
<hi>c.</hi> 1. as alſo <hi>Val. Max. l. 3. c.</hi> 7. tell another Story, which
ſpeaks the great confidence he had of himſelf, and aſſurance of
ſucceſſe in his deſigns; both which proceeded out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs
of his own worth, and the great experience he had
above other men in military affairs. He had laid ſiege to a
ſtrong Town in <hi>Spain,</hi> called <hi>Badia,</hi> and ſo well furniſhed
with all warlike proviſion, that there was but ſmall hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
it; yet when he ſat in judgement, as the cuſtome was,
and when, at the breaking up of the Court, the Crier asked
him when and where he would hold another Court, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
three dayes hence I will keep Court in the Caſtle of
<hi>Badia;</hi> which he (having taken the Town within the time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all expectation) performed. The like confidence of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
he ſhewed, when having taken ſome Spies or Scouts of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals,</hi>
a little before the fatal battel of <hi>Nadagara,</hi> he did not
truſs them up (as they both deſerved, and expected) but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
an Officer to carry them through the whole Camp,
and to ſhew them whatſoever could be ſeen; which done, he
ſent them away with rewards, and bid them tell their <hi>General</hi>
in what poſture the <hi>Romans</hi> lay incamped. This his bravery
and confidence did ſo abate the ſpirits of <hi>Annibal,</hi> that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
by a perſonal conference to procure peace; but in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:113289:107"/>
vain: See <hi>Liv. l. 30. Val. Max. l. 3. c.</hi> 7. This great Captain
left two wholeſome cautions to military men; the one was,
that <hi>no General ought to ſay,</hi> Non putaram, <hi>I thought not of it,
becauſe in warre (where an error once committed can no way be
rectified) all things ought to be well weighed and conſidered of
before hand:</hi> The ſecond was, that <hi>the enemy ought not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
unleſs a viſible advantage invite, or an invincible neceſſity
compel us thereunto; for to let ſlip a fair opportunity is madneſſe,
and not to fight when there is no other way to eſcape, is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
piece of cowardize: Val. Max. l. 7. c.</hi> 2. yet, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the unqueſtionable merit of this worthy Patriot, his own
Country (of which he had deſerved ſo highly) proved ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to him, the uſuall practiſe of ſordid Common-wealths, and
(through the unceſſant vexations of the Tribunes) forced him
to goe into voluntary exile, and to retire to a Country-houſe
of his near <hi>Linternum,</hi> a poor ſea-Town in <hi>Campania,</hi> betwixt
<hi>Baiae</hi> and <hi>Cumae,</hi> called now (according to <hi>Leander) Torre
de la Patria;</hi> where free from all publick employment he
ſpent his time in harmleſs Country-ſports and Husbandry,
himſelf (according to the cuſtome of the Ancients) often tilling
the ground. The words he uſed when he left <hi>Rome</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
by <hi>Seneca, epiſt. 86. Nihil (inquit) volo derogare legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,

Paulus,</hi> a perſon of very great eminency in his time, and
of an ancient <hi>Patrician</hi> Family. He gave firſt proof of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
when he ſerved under his Father at the battel wherein
K. <hi>Perſeus</hi> was defeated; where he, with ſome other young
Noble-men, followed the chace ſo long, that he returned not
till mid-night into the Camp to his ſorrowing Father, who
gave him for loſt; but receiv'd with great joy, when he ſaw
him honorably defiled with duſt and blood. After this he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in <hi>Spain</hi> as a Colonel under <hi>Lucullus,</hi> the Grandfather
of him who ſubdued <hi>Mithridates,</hi> where in a ſingle combat
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:113289:108"/>
he ſlew a <hi>Barbarian</hi> of a vaſt and Gigantick proportion, who
defied the <hi>Roman</hi> Army. There is a miſtake in <hi>Florus l. 2. c.</hi> 17.
who ſayes that <hi>Scipio</hi> wonne then the <hi>Spolia opima:</hi> but this
could not be, becauſe they, and no other, are called <hi>Spolia opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
which the General of one Army takes from the ſlain Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the other. At the ſiege of <hi>Intercatia</hi> he was the firſt
who ſcaled the walls, for which he was rewarded with a <hi>mural</hi>
Crown: To be ſhort, he behaved himſelf upon all occaſions
ſo valiantly, that no perſon gained ſo much honour as himſelf
in theſe warres; which being pretty well over, he paſſed into

warre (which begun <hi>an. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. C. 490. Appius Claudius Caudex,</hi>

choſen <hi>Cenſor</hi> with <hi>L. Mummius,</hi> a man of a dull &amp; flegmatick
complexion, which made him in the open Senate to ſay, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam
mihi collegam dediſſetis, vel non dediſſetis; Would you had
given me a Collegue, or not given me one, i. e.</hi> one more active,
or none at all: <hi>Val. Max. l. 6. c.</hi> 4. After this he was choſen
<hi>Conſul</hi> the ſecond time with <hi>C. Fulvius Flaccus, an. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. C.</hi>
620. wherein the warre againſt <hi>Numantia</hi> was committed to
him. <hi>Numantia</hi> was a City of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſituated upon the River
<hi>Durius:</hi> This had holden warre with the <hi>Romans</hi> fourteen
years, and (being furniſhed but with a Garriſon of 4000) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
ſix <hi>Conſuls</hi> with their Armies, when <hi>Scipio</hi> ſet down
before it, neither could he; notwithſtanding his great conduct
and extraordinary valour, reduce it in leſſe then 15. moneths;
and then indeed he did rather ſtarve them out, then by force
ſubdue them. Hiſtory mentions not a more memorable ſiege
then this of <hi>Numantia;</hi> for (according to <hi>Florus</hi>) it having
neither wall nor bulwark, and being but only ſituated upon a
little riſing hill by the River <hi>Durius,</hi> with no more then four
thouſand <hi>Geltiberians,</hi> it ſuſtained fourteen years ſiege againſt
an Army of forty thouſand; but being at laſt totally razed, it
gave <hi>Scipio</hi> both the honour of a ſecond triumph, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:113289:109"/>
of the ſirname of <hi>Numantînus</hi> to that of <hi>Africanus.</hi>
Four years after all theſe glorious exploits, in the fifty ſixth
year of his age, this incomparable man was found dead in his
bed; neither was it certainly known how he came to his end.
He was a great oppoſer of the proceedings of the <hi>Gracchi:</hi>
hence ſome ſuppoſe that his Wife <hi>Sempronia</hi> (who was their
Siſter) in favour of them gave him poyſon, <hi>Liv. epit.</hi> 56. but
how he came to his end it is as uncertain, as it is certain that
there was no revenge taken againſt his Murderers, or inquiry
made into the fact: <hi>Val. Max. l. 3. c. 5. Plut. in Gracch. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terc.
l.</hi> 2. Thus died <hi>Scipio</hi> ingloriouſly, and unrevenged by
his own people, who had lived ſo gloriouſly, and ſo often aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his own people upon their enemies. He was doubtleſs the
beſt accompliſh'd Gentleman of his time: nor was he only a
lover of Souldiers and the warres, but alſo of learned men and
the Muſes; for <hi>Polybius</hi> the Hiſtorian, and <hi>Panaetius</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher

               <p>We now come to <hi>Serranus,</hi> who was of the Family of the

                  <note place="margin">Serranus.</note> which was divided (according to <hi>Anton. Auguſtinus</hi>)

ſuch a luſtre upon the <hi>Atilian</hi> name as did <hi>M. Atilius Regulus,</hi>
and <hi>C. Atilius Serranns.</hi> The firſt is noted for his valour,
conſtancie, his love to his Counrry, and ſtrict obſerving of his
word; of all which this one example is a ſufficient evidence:
For having done great ſervice againſt the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi>
in the time of the firſt <hi>Punick</hi> warre, his Army was at laſt
defeated, and himſelf taken priſoner by the enemy; with
whom having for ſome years remained a miſerable captive, he
was at laſt ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> either to procure a peace betwixt the
two Nations, or the freedome of all the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
for all which he alone was offered in exchange; and in
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:113289:111"/>
caſe that neither could be effected, he was bound by oath to
render himſelf a priſoner again: as for the peace, it was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rejected; but when they came to the debate concerning
the rendition of the Captives, and <hi>Atilius</hi> his opinion was the
firſt asked in the <hi>Senate,</hi> he openly declared that it was unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
that ſo many ſtout young men ſhould be exchanged
for one poor old man, who by reaſon of his years was now no
longer able to ſerve his Country; and accordingly it paſſed
in the negative, that the priſoners ſhould not be exchanged;
and <hi>Regulus</hi> (notwithſtanding the intreaties and prayers of his
friends to the contrary) returned according to his promiſe to
an enemy from whom he expected all barbarous treatment
imaginable, as indeed he found: for ſome ſay that they put
him naked into a barrel ſtuck thick with ſharp-pointed nails,
and ſo rowled him about til he died: Others, that he was caſt
into a dark dungeon, and (having been kept there for ſome
time) brought forth, and forced to ſtare in the ſun till he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
blind; and that he might not wink with his eyes, they
plucked his eye-lids aſunder, and with a needle and thread
ſtitched them up: after this they kept him from ſleep and food,
till at laſt for want of both, he (having ſuffered with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
the utmoſt of his enemies cruelty) ended his life and
miſery together. This Story you may read in <hi>Livie l. 18. Val.

ancient,<note place="margin">The Fabii.</note> and moſt honorable of all <hi>Rome:</hi> they were branched
into ſix ſeveral Houſes, whereof three were more noted, and
occurre more frequently in Hiſtory, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Vibulani,</hi> the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſti,</hi>
and the <hi>Maximi;</hi> the other three, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Dorſones,
Pictores,</hi> and <hi>Buteones,</hi> were not of that fame and celebrity
with the former. That may be ſaid of this one Name and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
which I never read of any, that there were 307 of them
living at the ſame time, and that not in a large tract, or ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
continent, but within the Walls and Precincts of one and
the ſame City. I ſhall briefly give you the hiſtory and fate of
theſe worthy Kinſmen. The people of <hi>Veii</hi> were inceſſant ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tezers then enemies of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> making rather
predatory incurſions into their territories, then waging a juſt
warre againſt them. This one Family of the <hi>Fabii</hi> undertook
(upon their own charge) this warre: One of the <hi>Conſuls, viz.
Caeſo Fabius,</hi> being of that Family, commanded this ſmall, but
gallant army: they were 306. all <hi>Patricians</hi> or noble men, all
of a blood, and (according to <hi>Livy) quorum neminem ducem
ſporneret egregius quibuſlibet temporibus Senâtus: Such as the
wiſeſt Councell would not refuſe the worſt of them in never ſo
dangerous times for a General.</hi> They fortified themſelves upon
the River <hi>Cremera,</hi> where iſſuing out of their Garriſon, they
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:113289:112"/>
often worſted the enemy; who (ſeeing they could not by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
force prevail) had recourſe to art, and drawing them into
a place convenient for an ambuſcade, invironed them, and
with numbers ſo over-powred them, that (after a ſharp con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
and extraordinary valour ſhewed on the <hi>Roman</hi> ſide)
they were all to one man ſlain. This Story you may read in
<hi>Livie l. 2. Eutrop. l. 1. auct. de vir. illuſt. Flor. l. 1. c. 12. &amp;c.</hi>
This happened <hi>An. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. C.</hi> 275. in the <hi>Conſulſhips</hi> of <hi>Caeſo Fabius</hi>
and <hi>T. Virginius.</hi> Thus had this noble Family been quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,
had not one (who by reaſon of his tender years was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for the warres) remained at home: and this man propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the <hi>Fabian</hi> name down to this <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> who by
his wiſe delayes blunted the edge, and broke the very point of
<hi>Annibals</hi> impetuous fury: and this is the man whom <hi>Virgil</hi>
celebrates here. The firſt of the <hi>Fabii,</hi> who had the <hi>agnomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of <hi>Maximus</hi> given him, was <hi>Q. Fabius Rullianus,</hi> a
perſon of very great repute and worth, as who had been five
times <hi>Conſul,</hi> twice <hi>Dictator,</hi> triumphed thrice, once <hi>Cenſor;</hi>
and although he deſerved the name of <hi>Maximus</hi> from his
Martial atchievments, as having been the ableſt and moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Chieftain of his time, yet this honorable ſirname was
beſtowed upon him, for that he in his <hi>Cenſorſhip</hi> united the
City, which was divided into two factions, into that of the
<hi>plebs,</hi> or meaner ſort, and into that of the more able and ſober
of the Citizens. Hence aroſe a great confuſion and diſturbance
in their <hi>Comitia</hi> or elections, the rabble carrying it by reaſon
of their numbers againſt the better; and ſo, many times choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
men of inferiour condition into offices and commands,
contrary to the good liking of the other, and much to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
of the Majeſty and Grandeur of the <hi>Roman</hi> State.
This <hi>Fabius</hi> remedied, by reducing the Common-people (which
till then were undiſtinguiſhed) into four Tribes or Claſſes,
which he called <hi>Tribus urbanae;</hi> as you may read in <hi>Livie l.</hi> 91.
This is that <hi>Fabius</hi> whom (being Maſter of the horſe to the
Dictator <hi>Papyrius Curſon) Papyrius</hi> would have put to death
for fighting the enemy in his abſence, and againſt his expreſs
order, although he obtained a ſignal victory; but that the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:113289:113"/>
people interpoſing procured his pardon. <hi>Livie</hi> in his ninth
book gives an ample relation of this Story. His ſonne was <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius
Maximus Gurges,</hi> who having been thrice <hi>Conſul,</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
twice, <hi>Cenſor,</hi> and four times choſen <hi>L. Preſident</hi> of
the Senate, ſeemed by his often-repeated honours not to come
at all ſhort of his Fathers virtues: And this was (according to
<hi>Livie</hi>) Father to our preſent <hi>Fabius Maximus;</hi> from his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
and wary way of proceeding, termed by his Detractors
<hi>Cunctator,</hi> or the <hi>Delayer;</hi> and <hi>Verrucoſſus,</hi> from a wart (which
the Latines call <hi>verrûca</hi>) growing upon his lip. He was alſo
called <hi>Ovicula,</hi> the little Sheep, or Lamb, from the gentleneſs
of his nature. He was twice <hi>Conſul,</hi> triumphed twice, <hi>Dictâ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
twice, as often <hi>Preſident</hi> of the Senate, <hi>Pontifex</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur:</hi>
and what is more then all, the Conſervator of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
people in the ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> warre, which he chiefly effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by his wiſe delayes, and conſtant patience; proceeding
herein contrary to the manner of all former Generals, who by
their precipitancie had often hazarded the ſafety of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
and loſt both themſelves and many great Armies;
of whom <hi>Ennius</hi> thus, whence <hi>Virgil</hi> borrows the firſt verſe:

the behaviour of <hi>Fabius</hi> therein, I ſhall rather referre the
Reader to thoſe Authors, then inlarge upon a Story ſo well
known; we ſhall only add ſome few particulars concerning
this right worthy perſon not to be pretermitted, which ſpeak
the wiſdome, prudence, valour, juſtice and goodneſs of this
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:113289:113"/>
noble <hi>Roman:</hi> Being <hi>Dictator</hi> he choſe <hi>L. Minutius</hi> to be
Maſter of his horſe, a raſh and violent man, and of a temper
quite different from that of <hi>Fabius.</hi> He being by a Decree of
the people (a thing never before practiſed) made equal in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to the <hi>Dictator</hi> (now in diſgrace with the vulgar for
his dilatory manner of proceeding) preſently thought to doe
ſomething by ingaging <hi>Annibal</hi> as ſoon as he could; which the
crafty enemy perceiving, he ſoon preſented him with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
but withall drew him into an ambuſcade, where he
and his Army had periſhed had not <hi>Fabius</hi> aſſiſted him, and
reſcued both from the preſent danger. This <hi>Minutius</hi> was
<hi>Fabius</hi> his bitter enemy, and (by his ſuggeſtions and crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
againſt him, as a ſlow and timerous man on the one ſide,
and by magnifying &amp; extolling himſelf, &amp; boaſting what great
feats he would do on the other) had wound himſelf into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the undiſcerning people, and leſſened the credit and
reputation of a far better man then himſelf. Notwithſtanding
this <hi>Fabius</hi> would not take his private revenge of his adverſary,
when the publick thereby would have been the greateſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.
But <hi>Fabius</hi> by this means did not only conquer <hi>Annibal,</hi>
the common Foe, but ſubdue <hi>Minutius</hi> his ſecret enemy, who
from thenceforth acknowledging his fault, ſaluted <hi>Fabius</hi> by
the name of Father: <hi>Liv. l.</hi> 22. and <hi>Plut. in Fab. Fabius</hi> had
a Souldier in his Camp, a <hi>Marſian</hi> born, a right valiant and
gallant man; he (upon diſcontent, becauſe not rewarded, as
he thought, according to his merit) practiſed with ſome others
to run over to <hi>Annibal,</hi> where they expected to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with greater reſpect. This being diſcovered to <hi>Fabius,</hi> he
ſent for the <hi>Marſian,</hi> who expected nothing but death, which
according to the Laws of Warre he indeed deſerved; but the
Conſul receiving him courteouſly, did not in the leaſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to him of what he had heard, but commending him for his
former good ſervices, told him, that if he were not rewarded
according to his merit it was his own fault, who applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to inferiour Captains, never had made his addreſſes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
his General; and with that gave him a good horſe, and
other rewards: This did ſo incourage the <hi>Marſian,</hi> that for

the future he became very faithfull and ſerviceable to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
He had another Souldier who was accuſed for going of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
out of the Camp, and quitting his colours without leave;
which he perſiſted to doe, although often reprehended by his
Officer. <hi>Fabius</hi> asked the Captain, who accuſed him, what
manner of man he was, and whether he had any thing of
worth in him; he told him that he was a very ſtout man, and
had done very great ſervice; wherefore <hi>Fabius</hi> making inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
into the buſineſs, found that the Souldier had a Miſtreſs, for
whoſe ſake he had ſo often tranſgreſſed: Her <hi>Fabius</hi> cauſed
to be fetched, and privily hidden in his Tent; then ſending
for the Souldier, he told him what he had heard of him, how
he had offended againſt the Lawes of Armes, and againſt the
<hi>Roman</hi> Military diſcipline, and for that deſerved to be ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
puniſhed; but withall how he underſtood that he was a
valiant man, and had done good ſervice; and therefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he would not at preſent proceed againſt him according
to the extremity and rigour of the Law, yet he would commit
him to the cuſtody of one who ſhould be accountable for him.
The Souldier hereupon being not a little abaſhed, <hi>Fabius</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
forth the Maid whom the Souldier loved, and gave him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her hands, telling him, that now he ſhould know whether
love, or ſome other ill deſign, cauſed him ſo often to goe out
of the Camp. The Souldier never offended more after this,
but became very orderly and diligent. Theſe two Stories you
may read in <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his life. To ſhew that he was a ſtrict
obſerver of his word, he agreed with <hi>Annibal</hi> about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of Priſoners, and ſent to the Senate for a certain
ſumme of money to pay their ranſome: the Senate looking
upon the agreement as diſhonorable and diſadvantagious, as
alſo for that they were altogether diſſatisfied with his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
refuſed to ratifie the articles, or to furniſh him with
the ſumme required: wherefore <hi>Fabius</hi> (that he might make
good his promiſe, and give a teſtimony of his tenderneſs and
affection to his Countrymen, now miſerable Captives) raiſed
the ſumme by ſelling part of his own lands. His Sonne <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
was choſen Conſul with <hi>Tib. Sempronius Gracchus,</hi> the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:113289:114"/>
ſixth year of the ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> warre. <hi>Fabius</hi> (who ſerved
under him as his Lieutenant) came to him to the Camp at <hi>Sueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula,</hi>
where his Son went with his <hi>Lictors</hi> before him to meet
him: The Lictors out of reſpect to the Conſuls Father, did
not (according to the cuſtome) command him to alight, but
let him paſs on on horſe-back, till he came to the very laſt of
thoſe officers, whom young <hi>Fabius</hi> commanding to doe his
duty, he forthwith commanded the old man to alight from his
horſe, which he very readily did, ſaying, <hi>experiri volui, fili,
ſatin ſcires te conſulem eſſe; I intended, my ſonne, to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you knew that you were Conſul: Liv. l. 24. Plut. in Fab.</hi>
in which words he embraced him, telling him that thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
relations of Father and Sonne muſt give place to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
which is due to the perſon of a publick Miniſter. And
ſuch was <hi>Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucoſſus:</hi> But this
<hi>Quintus</hi> died before his Father, who adopted into the place
of his deceaſed Sonne the eldeſt Sonne of <hi>Aemilius Paulus,</hi>
and Brother to <hi>Scipio Aemilianus,</hi> who from thence was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Q. Fabius Maximus Aemilianus:</hi> He was Conſul with

affectation of <hi>prolixity,</hi> or induſtrious inſerting of ſuch diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
as might have been better omitted then inſiſted upon,
but to the great variety of learning of all ſorts wherewith this
Poem is richly adorned; which ſufficiently teſtifies the vaſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:113289:115"/>
and knowledge of the Author, and which hath neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
led us to conſult with divers good writers, and (whileſt
we have endeavoured to illuſtrate this excellent piece) diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to us the whole body of <hi>humane literature,</hi> whereof theſe
annotations may ſerve as a Summarie or generall view; and
will, I hope (according to the latitude and extent of this kind
of learning) both <hi>prodeſſe</hi> and <hi>delectare,</hi> be both delightfull and
profitable to the Reader. But to proceed; the <hi>Claudian</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
deſcended originally from the <hi>Sabines,</hi> was of two ſorts;
the one was of the <hi>Patricians,</hi> the other of the <hi>Plebeians:</hi> The
firſt were diſtinguiſhed into the <hi>Regillenſes,</hi> the <hi>Pulchri,</hi> the
<hi>Centhones,</hi> and the <hi>Nerones.</hi> The <hi>Marcelli</hi> (ſo called from
their Martial inclinations, <hi>Marcellus</hi> being a diminutive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from <hi>Mars</hi>) were indeed <hi>Plebeians,</hi> but men of great
worth and eſteem in their time. There were nine of this name
who arrived to the higheſt preferments <hi>Rome</hi> could advance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Citizen to. The firſt of this Family who was honored with
the <hi>Conſular</hi> dignity, was <hi>M. Marcellus,</hi> who was <hi>Conſul</hi> with
<hi>C. Valerius Flaccus, An. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. C.</hi> 422. The third from him was
this famous <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who was the firſt who overthrew <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
after the battel of <hi>Cannae:</hi> he from his inceſſant deſire of
fighting, and engaging the enemy, was called the <hi>ſword</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> (with whom he was Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
from the defenſive poſture whereon he ſtill uſed to lie, the
<hi>Shield</hi> or <hi>Buckler:</hi> He was five times <hi>Conſul;</hi> firſt before the
ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> warre, with <hi>Cn. Scipio Calvus, An. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. C.</hi> 532.
when the <hi>Galli Inſubres,</hi> thoſe <hi>Gauls</hi> (which inhabited about
<hi>Millan</hi> in <hi>Lumbardie,</hi> aſſiſted by the <hi>Geſſatae,</hi> which were
<hi>Gauls</hi> alſo, but living about the River <hi>Rhodanus,</hi> on the other
ſide the <hi>Alps</hi>) made warre upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> and had then
laid ſiege to <hi>Claſtidium,</hi> a Garriſon belonging to the <hi>Romans.
Marcellus</hi> leaving his Collegue with the greateſt part of the
Army before <hi>Aſſerrae<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> a Town of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> marched with an
inconſiderable party to raiſe the ſiege before <hi>Claſtidium;</hi> which
the <hi>Gauls</hi> having intelligence of, drew off with 1000 horſe and
foot to meet the <hi>Conſul;</hi> and being certified of the paucity of
his forces, in their thoughts anticipated an eaſie victory. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:113289:115"/>
marched in the head of his men, and <hi>Bridomârus,</hi> or <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domârus,</hi>
the <hi>Gaulick</hi> General, in the head of his alſo; whom
the <hi>Roman</hi> eſpying, and by his richly-gilt armour conceiving
to be Commander in chief, ſetting ſpurs to his horſe, furiouſly
charged, and piercing with his ſpear, ſlew in the view of the
two armies; and ſo diſarming him, was the third after <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
who wonne the <hi>Spolia opima,</hi> which we have rendred <hi>royal
ſpoils:</hi> they were called <hi>opima,</hi> either <hi>ab. opibus,</hi> from the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of them, as <hi>Varro</hi> conjectures; or <hi>ab opere,</hi> becauſe it was
a work or deed extraordinary to winne them, according to
<hi>Plutarch;</hi> or for that <hi>Opimum</hi> was all one with <hi>Amplum:
Livie</hi> defines them to be <hi>ſpolia quae Dux Duci detraxit, Liv.
l.</hi> 4. thoſe ſpoils or armes which one General hath taken from
another, whom he hath ſlain with his own hand. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
hiſtory makes mention but of three who ever wan theſe
ſpoils, <hi>viz. Romulus,</hi> who ſlew <hi>Acron</hi> King of the <hi>Caeninenſes:
Liv. l. 1. Plut. in Romul. Flor. l. 1. c.</hi> 1. and <hi>Aul. Cornelius
Coſſus</hi> (of whom §. 91.) who ſlew <hi>Lars Tolumnius;</hi> and
laſtly, this <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who alſo ſlew <hi>Britomârus</hi> King of the
<hi>Gauls;</hi> for that is a manifeſt error in <hi>Florus l. 2. c.</hi> 17. as we
have noted §. 93. where he makes <hi>Scipio Aemilianus</hi> to win
the <hi>ſpolia opima,</hi> by killing a <hi>Spaniard</hi> who challenged him; for
neither of theſe Duelliſts were Commanders in chief: <hi>Scipio</hi>
was then but a Colonel of foot under <hi>Lucullus;</hi> and what the
<hi>Barbarian</hi> was it is not concluded, either by <hi>Livie, Val. Max.</hi>
or <hi>Aur. Victor.</hi> who all make mention of this duel; only <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
(who is ſingular herein) ſayes that he was a King. <hi>Val.
Maximus c. de Fortitudine,</hi> more conſonantly to truth, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
not <hi>Scipio</hi> amongſt thoſe three who wonne the <hi>ſpolia opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
but amongſt thoſe famous <hi>Romans,</hi> who being challenged
ſlew the challenger; and theſe were <hi>T. Manlius Torquatus</hi>
(of whom §. 86.) <hi>M. Valerius Corvinus,</hi> and this <hi>Scipio Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milianus.</hi>
The ſpoils thus wonne were carried in triumph by
the Victor (the manner you may read in <hi>Livie l.</hi> 1. and in
<hi>Plut.</hi> in the life of <hi>Marcellus</hi>) and dedicated to <hi>Jupiter Fere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi>
ſo called from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>feretrum,</hi> by which they ſignifie the Bier or engine upon which
they carried the ſpoils: theſe as a perpetual monument they
hung up in <hi>Jupiter Feretrius</hi> his Temple, built by <hi>Romulus,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
and beautified by <hi>Auguſtus: Liv. l. 4. Numa</hi> to this
Law of <hi>Romulus</hi> (who ordained that the <hi>ſpolia opima</hi> ſhould
be conſecrated to <hi>Jupiter</hi>) added, that in caſe any one wonne
them thrice (which was never known) that then the firſt ſhould
be offered to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the ſecond to <hi>Mars,</hi> and the third to
<hi>Romulus.</hi> Hence we may eaſily gather the ſenſe of this verſe,
which hath ſo much puzled Interpreters;

                  </q>
Mr. <hi>Ogylby</hi> renders it thus.
<q>Shall thrice to <hi>Romulus</hi> dedicate their arms:</q>
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>ſpolia opima,</hi> againſt both the Law of <hi>Romulus,</hi> who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
that the ſpoils ſhould be dedicated to <hi>Jupiter</hi> only; and
againſt the teſtimony of hiſtory, for <hi>Marcellus</hi> himſelf did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
the ſpoils to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and not to <hi>Romulus,</hi> as you may
read in his life. Neither is this the only miſtake in Mr. <hi>Ogylby;</hi>
for he ſayes that <hi>Marcellus</hi> ſhall not only dedicate theſe arms
to <hi>Romulus,</hi> but that he ſhall dedicate them thrice, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſhall
thrice winne the <hi>Spolia opima:</hi> But where does he read that
<hi>Marcellus</hi> wonne them thrice? they were never won during
all the victories and triumphs of the long-liv'd <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
but thrice, and that by three ſeverall perſons, after the long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition
of a long interval of time: therefore theſe words of
the Poet are to be thus expounded; <hi>ſuſpendet,</hi> he ſhall hang up,
not dedicate, <hi>tertia arma capta,</hi> the third ſpoils taken from
the enemy, <hi>patri Quirino,</hi> to <hi>Romulus, i. e.</hi> near the arms of
<hi>Romulus,</hi> in the ſame Temple where <hi>Romulus</hi> hung up his.
We have therefore here, as we have done elſewhere in
caſe of the like obſcurity, paraphraſtically rendred this verſe,
chooſing rather by multiplying of words to give the true ſenſe
of the Author, then by being to preciſe and thrifty therein, to

                  <hi>Virgil</hi> borrows the conceipt of the two gates or out-lets of
Dreams, out of <hi>Homer, Odyſſ.</hi> 19. There are two gates of ſleep
(ſayes he) the one of <hi>Horn,</hi> from whence reall dreams (ſuch as
are made good, and ſeconded in the event) doe proceed; the
other of <hi>Ivory,</hi> out of which iſſue ſuch as are falſe, and never
come to paſs; and out of this gate <hi>Aeneas</hi> was let by <hi>Anchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi>
obſcurely hinting hereby, that this whole diſcourſe of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi>
his deſcent into Hell, with this ample deſcription thereof,
are even as true as thoſe dreams which proceed out of the ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

which conceit is thus given by Interpreters: The <hi>Horn</hi> gate
repreſents the <hi>eye,</hi> or <hi>organ</hi> of ſight, in relation to that tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle
they call <hi>Cornea,</hi> and by a <hi>Synechdoche</hi> is taken for the
whole eye; the <hi>Ivory</hi> the <hi>teeth,</hi> one of the nine inſtruments
of ſpeech, which in regard of their whiteneſs are like to Ivory,
and are by the ſame figure taken for the ſpeech in general;
therefore, as what the ſight really preſents to us is alwayes true,
and as what we receive from hear-ſay and report is often-times
falſe; ſo thoſe dreams which iſſue out of the <hi>Horn</hi> gate prove
true, and thoſe which come out of the <hi>Ivory</hi> one deceitfull;
and by conſequence this whole diſcourſe is to be looked upon
as a meer fiction, deception, and a fallacious dream.</p>

Trade, together with the forfeiture and loſs of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

dear to us then all theſe) the apparent hazard of the
Goſpel, through the prodigious growth of Blaſphemies,
Hereſies and Schiſm; all which owe their birth to the
inſtability of our Governors, and the unſettlement of
Government: Laſtly, how in all theſe an univerſal ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
threateneth us, and will (if not timely prevented)
doubtleſs overwhelm us; We thought it our bounden
duties, both to our Religion as Chriſtians, to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

friends, to repreſent and publiſh to the world our juſt

               <p>Wherefore having the leading Examples of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned

that is, that the old ſecluded Members, ſo many of them

that there may be a free Election of others to ſupply
the places of thoſe who are dead, without any Oath, or
Engagement previous to their Entrance:<note n="*" place="margin">This clauſe, according to the then ſtate of things was inſerted, out of a ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, that by their means a <hi>legal Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples true <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative,</hi> would in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time be aſſembled.</note> Theſe we

               <head>The VINDICATION of the Kentiſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
or a NARRATIVE of the
meeting of ſome Gentlement, Miniſters and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
at the Town-Hall in Canterbury, Jan.
24. Penned by the Author, when he was forced
to retire himſelf, and by him cauſed to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</head>
               <p>UNderſtanding that the late procedure of ſome
of the principal Gentlemen and Citizens, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the City of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath been
repreſented above as a malignant deſign tending to tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
and ſedition, we thought fit to publiſh to the
World a brief <hi>Narrative</hi> of the ſame, together with
the <hi>Declaration</hi> it ſelf; that both the one and the other
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:113289:120"/>
being cleared from the malicious aſperſions and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
of our Adverſaries, the whole world may judg
betwixt them and us, and ſo give ſentence according
to the merit of the Cauſe: wherefore ſome peaceable
and wel-minded Gentlemen, together with ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
and ſober Miniſters, perceiving the people gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
bent for a Free Parliament (as in the precedent
Declaration is expreſſed) and hearing that the Cities
of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Exeter</hi> had lately declared for the ſame,
thought it neither unmeet to follow ſo leading preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
nor unſeaſonable to joyn their votes with the
general deſires of the whole Nation: to which end it
was reſolved to preſent this foregoing Draught to the
common <hi>Burghmoot,</hi> and to deſire their concurrence
therein. Thus in an orderly manner, without tumult
or noiſe, without arms in their hands or thoughts, and
without threats or anger in their looks, divers Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Miniſters and Citizens went to the Town-Hall
on <hi>Jan.</hi> 24. 1659. the Mayor, Aldermen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Councel
then ſitting, and preſented the <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
by the hands of Mr. <hi>John Boys</hi> at the door; deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that after a ſerious peruſal thereof, they would be
pleaſed to joyn with them in a buſineſs which they
judged agreeable not only to the ſenſe of that Court,
but alſo to that of the whole County and Nation. But
when it was mov'd that it ſhould be put to the vote
whether the Paper ſhould be read or not, ſome of the
Bench proteſted againſt it, although they knew nothing
of its contents: and in concluſion (having a long time
rather wrangled then debated) the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> (being but
ſeven of twenty four) quitted the Court, not leaving
enough to make a <hi>Burghmoot Quorum:</hi> whereupon the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:113289:121"/>
Gentlemen (who, though rudely treated, had quietly
attended) withdrew <hi>Re infectâ,</hi> and returned home
with as little tumult as at firſt they came. Thus was
there nothing done to diſturb or ſurpriſe the Court,
nothing to raiſe a tumult, nothing to cauſe a ſecond
<hi>Kentiſh</hi> inſurrection, as our Adverſaries give it out:
No, the deſigne was not Arms, but Peace; not tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult,
but ſettlement; not to ſurpriſe and diſturb the
Court, but to deſire an <hi>amicable</hi> and friendly correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with the ſame, to the end that the intended De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
might be made the more authentick by the
formal intervention and aſſent in open Court, of the
Magiſtracy of ſo conſiderable a Corporation; and that
the Declarers themſelves might not be thought to tread
in any oblique paths, or to proceed after a clandeſtine
manner. But being diſappointed (as you ſee) herein,
it was thought fit to ſtrengthen and confirm our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</hi>
and to make good the title it bears, by private
ſubſcriptions, as well through the whole County as
this City; wherein we had in few dayes proceeded ſo
farre, that ſome thouſands of hands were then colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
when divers Gentlemen (from the ſlie inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and falſe repreſentations of our <hi>Adverſaries</hi>)
were ſecured in ſeverall Priſons,<note place="margin">The Author, though dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſearchd for, made his eſcape.</note> to the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a wel-begun, and a wel-meant undertaking.
Neither can the Gentlemen underſtand wherein they
have offended, or how they ſhould merit impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſince there was no order or prohibition to the
contrary. Although they conceive, that, had they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
therein notwithſtanding, they had not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed
any known Laws of the Land, it being the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
undoubted birth-right modeſtly to repreſent
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:113289:121"/>
their grievances by way of <hi>Petition;</hi> and, as the caſe
now ſtands, not unlawfull to doe the ſame by way of
<hi>Remonſtrance</hi> or <hi>Declaration.</hi> Wherefore leſt (through
our ſilence, and the preſent ſuppreſſion of our Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
the Aſperſions of our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> might be
thought deſervedly caſt upon us, we thought fit to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
the ſame, together with this <hi>Narrative;</hi> deeming,
that as we have done nothing herein worthy the preſent
ſeverity, ſo the impartial Reader will in his private
judgement abſolve us from all guilt or demerit. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall we anſwer our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> by way of <hi>recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;</hi>
nor (although we can by undoubted teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
ſufficiently prove it) ſay, that the ſame men,
who now appear ſo zealous Aſſertors of the <hi>Purlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
intereſt and proceedings, did as eagerly joyn with
the Army, crying them up as much (as with whom
they would live and die) as they decryed this preſent
Power, in its late interruption, as inconſiſtent with the

might ſerve to invalidate their teſtimonie, we ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
