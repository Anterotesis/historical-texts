            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

none of these the very <hi>vt:</hi> nor we <hi>deliuered,

all these suspend still, no perfect period, till

This to be our first point.</p>
               <p>The Noble Armie of Martyrs, it was all

we should doe our <hi>seruice.</hi> It is not

the present, (and I would it were the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent)
I doubt, for a great part, it is yet to
come.</p>
               <p>And the reason, why He will haue it so

grow out of His fauours, our duety, out of

the Euangelicall <hi>seruice.</hi> If He haue

then. But, that, is the Legall, for feare. And
that sometimes he hath, but likes it not; He
would haue it, out of loue, out of the sense
of His goodnesse, haue our hearts broken,

Yet are they euer thus parted, here, and

                     <hi>Our seruice</hi> in his holy things.</note>

<hi>serue</hi> we <hi>Him,</hi> in our <hi>holinesse</hi> there? I will
begin, and take vp the same complaint,
that the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> doeth. First,
<hi>Mensa Domini despecta est:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>The Table of the
Lord is not regarded.</hi> That Sacrament, that
euer hath bene compted, of all Holies the
most holy, the highest and most solemne
<hi>seruice</hi> of God; (where are deliuered to vs,
the holy Symbols, the precious memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
of our greatest <hi>Deliuery</hi> of all:) why, of
all others they speed worst. How are they
in many places, denied any reuerence at all,
euen that which Prayer, which other parts
haue? No <hi>seruice</hi> then: No seruants there:
but bidden guests, haile fellowes, homely
and familiar, as one neighbour with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
And, not onely, <hi>de facto</hi> none they
haue: but, <hi>de iure,</hi> it is holden, none they
ought to haue. And that, so holden, as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then they shall haue any, some wil suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for it, or rather, for their owne proud
follie, in refusing it. What time they <hi>take
the cup of saluation,</hi> they will not <hi>inuocate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 116. 13.</note>
at least not be <hi>in specie inuocantis:</hi> as the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:284:19"/>
King the Prophet would. What time they
receiue the <hi>cup of blessing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 16.</note> they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it as a blessing, as children receiue it
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their parents, and their children from
them. Both which, <hi>inuocation, and receiuing
a blessing,</hi> were neuer done, but <hi>de geniculis.</hi>
What shal the rest looke for, if thus we <hi>serue
Him,</hi> when wee are at the holiest?</p>
               <p>Shall wee now come to <hi>seruice</hi> indeede?<note place="margin">Our seruice of God in the <hi>seruice,</hi> that is, <hi>in prayer.</hi>

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the word here in my Text. It is no
new thing, for one <hi>species,</hi> to carie away the
name of the <hi>genus</hi> from the rest, as in this:
For though there bee other parts of Gods
<hi>seruice:</hi> yet Prayer hath borne away the
name of <hi>seruice,</hi> from them all. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the
Hebrewes call their Common Prayer, and
that is, <hi>seruice.</hi> And the Greekes, theirs,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and that is so, too. And wee, when
we say, At Seruice time, and the Seruice
booke, and refuse to be present at Diuine
seruice, meane so likewise. And, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
seemes to goe before vs, and direct vs
so to doe. For His <hi>house,</hi> He hath named <hi>the
House of Prayer.</hi> (Obseruing the Rule,<note place="margin">Esa. 56. 7.</note> to
giue it the denomination, from that which
is the chiefest <hi>seruice</hi> in it.) As indeede,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:284:19"/>
when all is done, deuotion is the proper,
and most kindly worke of <hi>holinesse:</hi> and,
in that <hi>serue</hi> we God, if euer wee <hi>serue</hi> him.
Now, in what honour, this part of <hi>holinesse</hi>
is; what accompt we make of this <hi>seruice,</hi>
doe but tell the number of them that bee
heere at it, and ye shall neede no other cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate,
that in His <hi>seruice</hi> we <hi>serue Him</hi> but
slenderly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou hast magnified thy Name,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 138. 2. On seruice of God <hi>in the Word.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and thy
Word aboue all things,</hi> saith the Psalme. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
inuocation then of His Name; let vs see
how wee <hi>serue</hi> His word; that part of His
<hi>seruice,</hi> which in this Age, (I might say, in
the error of this Age) caries away all. For,
what is it to <hi>serue God in holines?</hi> why, to go
to a Sermon: All our holiday <hi>holinesse,</hi> yea,
and our working day too, both are come
to this, to heare (nay, I dare not say that, I
cannot prooue it) but, to be at a Sermon.</p>
               <p>The Word is <hi>holy</hi> (I know) and, I wish
it all the honour that may bee: but, God
forbid, wee should thinke, that <hi>in hoc vno,
sunt omnia.</hi> All our <hi>holinesse,</hi> is in hearing:
All our <hi>Seruice,</hi> eare-seruice: that were in
effect, as much as to say, all the body were
<hi>an eare.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 17.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:284:20"/>
An error it is, to shut vp his <hi>seruice</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any one part, which is diffused through
all. Another, so to do, into this one. It is
well knowen that, all the time of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
Church, the Sermon was euer
done, before the <hi>seruice</hi> begun. And that,
to the Sermon. Heathen men, Infidels,
and Iewes, Heretickes, Schismatikes, <hi>Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumeni,
Catechumeni, Poenitentes, Competentes,
Audientes,</hi> all these, all sorts of people were
admitted: But, when they went to seruice,
when the <hi>Liturgie</hi> began, all these were voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
not one of them suffered to stay. It
were strange, that, that should be the only,
or the chiefe seruice of God, whereat, they
which were held no seruants of God, no
part of the Church, might and did remaine
no lesse freely, then they that were.</p>
               <p>But euen, this holy Word (wherein all
our <hi>holinesse</hi> is) how <hi>serue</hi> wee Him, in it?
Nay, we <hi>serue</hi> him not, we take the greatest
libertie there, of all other. We come to it,
if wee will: wee goe our wayes, when wee
will: stay no longer, then we will: and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
to it, while we will: and sleepe out, or
turne vs and talke out, or sit still, and let
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:284:20"/>
our mindes roue (the rest) whither they
will: take stitch at a phrase, or word, and
censure it, how we wil. So the word serues
vs to make vs sport: we serue not it. At this
part of our <hi>seruice in holinesse,</hi> we demeane
our selues with such libertie (nay licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
rather) that holy it may be, but sure
<hi>seruice</hi> it is not, nothing like. And truely, it
is a notable Stratageme of Sathan, to
shrinke vp all our <hi>holinesse,</hi> into one part:
and into that one, where wee may bee or
not be: Being, heare or not heare: Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
mind or not minde: Minding, either
remember or forget: Giue no account to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
what wee doe or not doe; Only, stay
out the houre (if that) and then goe our
way: many of vs, as wise as we came: But
all (in a manner) hearing (as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth)
a Sermon preached,<note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 32.</note> no otherwise
then wee doe a <hi>ballad sung:</hi> and doe euen
no more of the one, then we doe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Eye-seruice God likes not (I am sure)
no more (should I thinke) doth Hee eare-seruice.
<hi>Speake on Lord,</hi>

be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with such seruice? Yet this is all:

not, wee <hi>serue Him</hi> not at all.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Our seruice in holinesse out of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation.</note> is not in

whatsoeuer a man else may make sure, he

God and his Law: and pierces deeper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the outward act, euen to the inward

if it reach not; Man wee may, (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps)

               <p>But euen according to mans Law,<note place="margin">Our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes too much worke.</note> our

Philosopher giues a rule, when a people is
iust or righteous, according to mans law:
(Gods hee knew not) and that is, when iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
wants worke, hath little to doe. By
which rule, ours is in no very good case:
Men are so full of suits, so many causes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
before euery seate of iustice: Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
so much to doe: and all, to repaire
the wrongs of our vnrighteous courses,
while each one seekes rather, to ouer-rule
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:284:23"/>
men by wrong, then to <hi>serue</hi> God by
right.</p>
               <p>And, this were not so euill, if all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice
were below:<note place="margin">The Seats of righteousnes faultie.</note> if the Seates which are
set to doe iustice and <hi>righteousnes,</hi> were
themselues right. For, fares it not euen
with them,<note place="margin">Hos. 5. 10.</note> as the Prophet <hi>Hosee</hi> saith, <hi>The
Princes of Israel are as they that remooue the

their owne border, and to set their meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones
within the others ground? A full
vnnaturall thing in a body, that one arme
should neuer thinke it selfe strong enough,
vntill it had cleane shrunke vp the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes
of the other. But I stay. These
things, being amended, wee shall bee so
much the more in a forwardnesse, to <hi>serue</hi>
God, both <hi>in holines and righteousnes:</hi> And
so, for the matter of our <hi>seruice,</hi> keepe our

were afraid, to seeme to <hi>feare</hi> God. But,
this is no part of his meaning. <hi>Without feare</hi>
(here) is not <hi>without feare</hi> of Him, (of God)
but, that being now without <hi>feare</hi> of our
<hi>enemies,</hi> we should doe it, the rather. For,
who being in a bodily feare; who hauing
<hi>Pharao</hi> and his host hard at their backes,
could quietly thinke of <hi>seruing God?</hi> That,<note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note>
euen God himselfe,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> did rid his people of
that feare, before euer hee gaue them his
Law, to <hi>serue</hi> Him by. But when mens

they should in all reason then, better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
His <hi>seruice.</hi>

               <p>And, wil we (thinke you) if we be so out
of <hi>feare,</hi> intend it the better? without
doubt, in experience, we finde it contrary.
For, except we be held in feare, wee scarse
<hi>serue Him</hi> at all: how soone we are out of
<hi>feare,</hi> we forget our selues, and our <hi>seruice,</hi>
yea God, and all. True: yet for all that, the
<hi>seruice</hi> so done in feare, is but a dull heauie
<hi>seruice.</hi> It likes him not. God loues <hi>laetus
lubens,</hi> when being at libertie, with a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

               <p>Without This <hi>feare</hi> to <hi>serue Him,</hi> but not

this is not Old Testament onely: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
is as direct, in the New, if wee will
<hi>serue Him</hi> to <hi>please Him,</hi> (and as good not

<hi>serue Him:</hi>

               <p>2 To <hi>serue Him, coram ipso, before Him.
Coram ipso:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">That, <hi>before Him.</hi> Exod. 20. 3.</note> for, <hi>coram me,</hi> is the terme of the

rudely: (we doe it <hi>before Him.)</hi> Helps our
sincerenesse, without hypocrisie, to doe it,

               <p>All things are <hi>before Him:</hi> In nothing
can we get behind <hi>Him,</hi> or where He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

and men, both: Those, we call not, <hi>before

Him,</hi> that is <hi>before</hi> none but <hi>Him.</hi> That is
the heart. <hi>Coram homine,</hi> the <hi>seruice</hi> of the

loue no eye-seruice, neither, if they could
discouer it, but they are faine to take it; the
heart is not <hi>coram ipsis; Coram ipso</hi> it is: Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Him, if the heart be away: for that, of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

               <p>It is a broken <hi>seruice,</hi> if any part, chiefly,
if the chiefe part (the heart) be away. It
would be entire, and with all parts, since all
are <hi>before Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a mock-seruice, as if what serues

               <p>
                  <hi>The mercifull and gracious Lord hath so done

                  <hi>euerlasting remembrance;</hi> all of them. But
some more specially: for some are more

if <hi>quibusdam diebus,</hi> would serue for them:
<hi>Omnibus diebus,</hi> is little ynough, for this. So,
more then gracious: so more then maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous:
so more then both, in this: as the

but our dayes &amp; it, to determine together.</p>
               <p>And for all that,<note place="margin">More The dayes since.</note> though <hi>omnibus diebus,</hi>
all our dayes, and in them all: yet, not in
them all alike. So in all, as, in some, more
then other some, <hi>Suscipiunt magis &amp; minus.</hi>
So then to <hi>serue:</hi> as in our dayes after the
deliuerie, we doe it, more, and better, then
before. And,<note place="margin">And this day, most.</note> vpon the day it selfe (that is, as this day) we do it, most of all.</p>

Wherein, if wee will deale as iust men, wee
must keepe it: and, if deale as wise men, we
will keepe it. For, who knowes, but wee
may (perhaps) stand in need of a <hi>deliuerie</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine?
If we behaue our selues frowardly
in His Couenant, what shall become of vs,

But should hope so the rather, if I could

as sath bene said. Otherwise, the Deuill,
he is our enemie; (that is once) And, if we
had no other, hee is ynough: An vnquiet

he is able to doe mischiefe enough. And
we haue the amends in our hands. <hi>Liberati</hi>
