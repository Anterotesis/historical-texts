            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Caſe of Edmond Prideaux <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
            </head>
            <p>THAT the Borough of <hi>Taunton</hi> is an Antient Borough by Preſcription, and time out of mind hath ſent two Burgeſſes to Sit in Parliament, which have been choſen by the Houſe-keepers thereof not receiving Relief.</p>
            <p>That in purſuance of a Writ under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> a Precept Iſſued from the Sheriff of the County of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> directed to the Mayor of the ſaid Borough for the Election of two Burgeſſes to Serve for the ſaid Borough in this preſent Parliament.</p>
            <p>That after the date of the ſaid Writ, and before the time of Election, ſeveral Briberies, Threats and Promiſes, and other Illegal Practices were uſed to procure Votes for Sir <hi>John Cutler,</hi> and to deter others from Voting for <hi>Edmond Prideaux</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and <hi>John Trenchard</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> particularly ſeveral Notorious Riots being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſaid Borough, thoſe that promiſed to Vote for Sir <hi>John Cutler</hi> were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged without any puniſhment; and ſome that would have Voted for the ſaid Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> and Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> were committed to Goal without Bail or Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, upon a pretended Burglary: whereas it appeared plainly on their Tryal, that no Burglary was committed, but only to keep them from Voting for the ſaid Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> and Mr. <hi>Trenchard;</hi> and they were offered a Diſcharge if they would give their Votes for Sir <hi>John Cutler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>William Turner,</hi> then Mayor of the ſaid Borough, did declare before the ſaid Election, That he was reſolved to Return Sir <hi>John Cutler,</hi> although he had not the Majority of Voices of the Electors.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Mayor combining with the Friends and Agents of Sir <hi>John Cutler,</hi> did Erect a Booth in an unuſual part of the ſaid Borough, where they endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhut out ſuch of the Inhabitants as came to Vote for the ſaid Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> and Mr. <hi>Trenchard,</hi> and admitted many of the Voters for Sir <hi>John Cutler,</hi> who behaved themſelves very rudely and inſolently at the time of Election.</p>
            <p>That the Mayor admitted no Clerk to take the Poll on the behalf of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> and Mr. <hi>Trenchard,</hi> and hath ever ſince denied them a Copy thereof.</p>
            <p>That the better to colour their intended deſign, ſeveral Strangers were brought in by the Friends and Agents of the ſaid Sir <hi>John Cutler</hi> in a tumultuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; whereupon the ſaid Mayor did ſhut up the Poll, and refuſed to take the Names of ſuch as were ready to Vote for the ſaid Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> and Mr. <hi>Trenchard;</hi> 231 of which were afterwards Polled for the ſaid Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> and Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> in the preſence of Five Members of this Honourable Houſe.</p>
            <p>That notwithſtanding all the ſaid Practices, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> had about Fifty more Voices on the Poll than the ſaid Sir <hi>John Cutler;</hi> but the ſaid Mayor nevertheleſs did unjuſtly Return Sir <hi>John Cutler,</hi> together with the ſaid Mr. <hi>Trenchard,</hi> although the ſaid Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> and Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> were duly Elected Burgeſſes of the ſaid Borough.</p>
