            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is evident from many notable paſſages of Scripture, that God himſelf hath given a kind of Superintendency or power of Regulation unto the Law of Nature, the dictates and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof, over Inſtitutions, and Ceremonial Commands, and the obſervations of theſe, (even as he hath given a like power unto ſome Inſtitutions over others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 5.) ſo that when and whileſt the obſervation of an Inſtitution or Ceremony cannot take place, or be practiſed, without treſpaſſing upon ſome branch or other of the ſaid Law of Nature, then and ſo long, the ſaid obſervation is to give place: nor is the Law of God requiring it, in ſuch a caſe,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:166777:4"/>
broken, or diſparaged in the leaſt. <hi>Have ye not read</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to the <hi>Phaersſees) what David did when he was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, and they that were with him, How he entered into the Houſe of God, and did eat the ſhewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat</hi> [viz. in ordinary caſes,] <hi>neither for them which were with him, but for the Prieſts only,</hi> Mat. 12. 3, 4. And ſoon after: <hi>But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltleſs: For the Son of man</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">By <hi>Son of man</hi> here, is not meant Chriſt (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,) but any perſon of mankind. See <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> upon the place, who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent account of this Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                  <hi>is Lord even of the Sabbath day.</hi> Again, a few verſes after: <hi>What man ſhall there be among you, that ſhall have one ſheep, and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better then a ſheep?</hi> Elſewhere: <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereſt that thy Brother hath ought againſt thee, Leave there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way: firſt be reconciled to thy Brother, and then offer thy gift,</hi> Mat. 5. 23, 24. [Our Brethren, in ſtead of reconciling themſelves to their Brethren, fall out with them, and then go and offer their gift of Dipping.] From the ſame lips in another place this dew of Heaven falleth: <hi>The Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath,</hi> Mark 2. 27. Circumciſion was a great Inſtitution of God, and obedience unto it moſt ſtrictly and ſolemnly commanded: Yet they to whom it was particularly commanded, omitted the obſervation and practiſe of it for forty years together; and this without any other warrant, diſpenſation, relaxation, or permiſſion from God, but only that which by the Light and Law of Nature he granted unto them, and yet are blameleſs. And yet it may be worthy conſideration, that the inconvenience in Nature, I mean the degree of ſmart, pain, trouble, or danger in any kind, the prevention and avoyding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they judged (and truly) a ſufficient diſpenſation from God for a forbearance of Circumciſion during their travel, was not ſo great or threatening, but that in probability they might have endured it, without the loſs of any of their lives. The <hi>Jews</hi> of later times, though rigid enough in their Doctrine concerning the obſervation of their Sabbath, yet have this maxim, <hi>Periculum vitae pellit Sabbatum,</hi> Peril of life drives away the Sabbath. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it is no where to be found in Scripture, that God giveth any ſuperintendency unto Inſtitutions or Ceremonial Obſervations over the Moral Law, or Authority to over-rule the dictates or any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:166777:4"/>
the principles of the Law of Nature, or to exempt any man from the performance of any duty required hereby. How much leſs will he juſtifie any man, in pleading the neceſſity of ſubmitting to ſuch a Ceremony, which, or at leaſt the neceſſity whereof, more probably is of humane, then divine Inſtitution, by way of bar to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch duties, which the Moral Law, yea the Law of Nature it ſelf, requireth? Therefore inexcuſeable altogether are ſuch perſons, both in the ſight of God, and men, who pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſobliged from the performance of ſuch promiſes, which they have ſolemnly made unto their Brethren, by a neceſſary of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting to an external Rite or Ceremony: how much more, when the obſervation of this Rite or Ceremony, is, and always hath been, by all the judicious, learned and faithful ſervants of God in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world (a very few, and theſe upon no accompt, very conſiderable, excepted) adjudged no ways neceſſary by vertue of any Precept, or Command of God? God (doubtleſs) by the Law of Nature, and of love to their Brethren, requireth of ſuch men a forbearance of their Ceremony (though ſuppoſed of Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution) for the peace, comfort, ſpiritual accommodation and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Brethren, rather then the practiſe of it to their offence, trouble, and diſtraction, yea to the danger of the precious Souls of many weak ones, who are emboldened by their example, having no ſufficient ground in themſelves for ſuch a practiſe, to condemn themſelves in allowing and practiſing the ſame Ceremony. For, as our Saviour of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> ſo ſay I of Baptiſm: Baptiſm was made for man, and not man for Baptiſm. Baptiſm was made, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, for man, <hi>[i. e.</hi> for mans benefit, comfort, and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and conſequently, is only to be uſed and adminiſtred in order hereunto, and ſo not to his diſturbance, danger, or diſtraction,] not man for Baptiſm, <hi>[i. e.</hi> man was not made or created by God for any ſuch end as this, that Baptiſm by his trouble, ſorrow, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation or danger ſhould be magnified or exalted in the world.] And why it ſhould not ſavour of as much Chriſtianity, and be of equal acceptance with God, for the peace of the Churches and ſervants of God in theſe days, to lay aſleep a living Ordinance for a time, as it did in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to awaken a dead Ordinance (I mean Circumciſion) upon the ſame account in his days, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not.</p>

               <p>The Churches and Societies of the Saints, which are not actually and externally baptized with that figure or kind of Baptiſm ſo much contended for, yet, ſuppoſing this very Baptiſm to be the only Baptiſmal Ordinance of Chriſt, and that it is his Will that they ſhould be baptized with it, they are, according to the rule and ſtandard of divine Eſtimate and Acceptance, baptized therewith, as well as thoſe perſons themſelves, who ſo impotently pleaſe themſelves in their ſubjection to the letter of it. The Standard, or ſtanding Rule of Divine Eſtimate, is this: <hi>If there be firſt a willing mind, a man is accepted according to that he hath,</hi> (ſo it were better rendered, though the difference be not material,) <hi>and not according to that he hath not, 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 12.

So then if the Members of unbaptized Churches (ſo called) have a <hi>willing mind,</hi> are prepared and large-hearted to ſubmit unto all and every the Ordinances of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and conſequently, unto New-Baptiſm it ſelf, (ſuppoſing this to be one of that retinue,) but only want the opportunity of light and conviction ſo to judg &amp; conceive of it, they are accepted with God, and eſteemed by him, (and ought they not then to be ſo with men?) as perſons baptized with that very Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. Yea the truth is, that if the unbaptized Churches ſin, or be blame-worthy, for not being actually baptized after the manner of the Brethren of New-Baptiſm, theſe perſons themſelves are in a great degree acceſſary unto ſuch their ſin, partly by adminiſtring unto them only weak and inſufficient grounds for their conviction, partly alſo (and more eſpecially) by cauſing, through their pride, frowardneſs, inſolency and diſdainfulneſs of ſpirit, together with many other ſtrains of moſt unchriſtian behaviour towards them, that ſacrifice of the Lord (if ſuch it be) to be abhorred. Beſides, I am all thoughts made, that the far greater part of thoſe, who have been prevailed with to accept of a dip for Baptiſm, neither have, nor ever had, either that love unto, nor ſacred and reverent eſteem of, all the Ordinances of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which thouſands of thoſe have, whom God hath not yet ſo perſwaded. So then they who

refuſe Communion with ſuch Saints, who have not been actually baptized with their Baptiſm, upon this pretence only, that they have not been thus baptized, reject the communion of thoſe, whom God reputeth to have been baptized with that very Baptiſm, for the want of which ſuch men reject them, (always ſuppoſed, as hath been ſaid, that the Dipping-Baptiſm is the ſole Baptiſm.

The reaſon, why God would have no <hi>deſpiſing</hi> of weak <hi>Chriſtians</hi> on the one hand, nor <hi>judging</hi> of thoſe that were ſtrong on the other, is delivered by the Apoſtle in theſe words, [verſ. 3.] <hi>For God hath accepted him; i. e.</hi> as well the weak, as the ſtrong; and again, the ſtrong as well as the weak, (the reaſon equally rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to both the preceding clauſes in the verſe;) clearly avouching Gods <hi>accepting</hi> of perſons, when diſcovered, or acknowledged by men, for an obliging ground upon theſe, not to <hi>deſpiſe</hi> them, or [which is by the Apoſtle interpreted as the ſame] to reject them from their communion.

Nor, 2. Can it be any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> mans queſtion, but that Chriſtian offices of love, as the edifying, comforting, admoniſhing, counſelling, watching over Brethren, ſupporting thoſe that are weak, refreſhing the bowels of thoſe that ſtand in need, with other ſervices belonging either to Elders, or Members of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Congregations, are things very lawful to be done, yea and more then lawful, eſpecially when they have been promiſed. Therefore unleſs men, who have promiſed ſuch things as theſe, can ſhew as fair, as full, as expreſs a diſcharge from God, from the performance of them, as that Command of his is, which he hath layed upon them for their performance, they are to be looked upon as promiſe-breakers (and this of one of the worſt and moſt horrid kinds) if they ſhall refuſe, or neglect, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them.

Again, where Churches, or perſons, <hi>know</hi> but <hi>in part,</hi> it cannot be expected they ſhould prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe <hi>in whole,</hi> or in full. He is a good Chriſtian, who practiſeth and walketh up to his light, though he doth not walk above it, yea although his light be ſomewhat low, and mixt with much dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And though an erring or miſtaking Conſcience, will not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply or totally juſtifie a concurring practiſe, yet will it juſtifie it comparatively; it being better to follow the dictate or light of a miſ-guided or miſ-taught Conſcience, then to rebel againſt it. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſad were the caſe of thoſe ſacrilegious Church-breakers, who out of Conſcience (I judg no worſe of many of them) prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe this enormity. Now then they who give ſentence againſt a Church, or people, as unclean for communion, only becauſe they do not practiſe Baptiſmal Dipping, muſt ground the equity of ſuch a ſentence, either, 1. Upon their non-conviction of the neceſſity of ſuch a practiſe; or, 2. Upon the non-practiſe it ſelf, which they muſt ſuppoſe, either to be concurrent with, or repugnant unto, the light of their Judgments and Conſciences. If the former of theſe, the ignorance or non-conviction of a Church, or people, of the neceſſity of Dipping, be pretended for a ground of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence we ſpeak of, to juſtifie this pretence, it muſt be proved, that every miſtake or diſſatisfaction in Judgment, in any controverſal Point whatſoever of like difficulty or diſputeableneſs with that about the neceſſity of Dipping, rendereth a Church or people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:166777:9"/>
for Communion. But I look to ſee <hi>Jeſus Chriſt as he is,</hi> long before this be proved. 2. If the ground of the ſaid ſentence be the latter, <hi>the non-practiſe of dipping,</hi> then, in caſe it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that this <hi>non-practiſe</hi> be a matter of conſcience in the Church or people we ſpeake of, and confirm to their judgments, they are adjudged unclean for not defiling, or not ſinning againſt, their conſcience. But far be it from us to ſuſpect our Brethren in the Faith, of ſuch a judgment as this. If it be ſuppoſed to be contrary to their judgment, and that in refuſing to practiſe Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal dipping, they go againſt their conſciences, then are the Suppoſers <hi>judgers of evil thoughts,</hi> ſuppoſing that which they cannot prove, indeed have no ground or reaſon at all to ſuſpect, but ground in abundance to conclude the contrary. So that they can upon no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or reaſonable ground pronounce any ſuch hard ſentence againſt their non dipping Brethren, as of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Church Communion. And if they would but pleaſe plainly and clearly to declare, wherein they place the high deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the unpardonable crime of non-dipping, whileſt men remain diſſatisfied, either touching the lawfulneſs, or neceſſity of the practiſe, I verily beleeve they would ſoon be aſhamed of their notion, and out of hand pull down all they have built upon it.</p>

And why the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> children before the eight day, ſhould not be judged members of that church, as well as after, I underſtand not. Therefore without all controverſie Baptiſm is no builder of Churches, although, as ſome men now ſet it on work, it is a puller of them down. Nor doth it at all ſavour of Goſpel diſpenſation, that God ſhould build his ſpiritual Temple upon Foundations made of a <hi>carnal ceremony,</hi> or that he ſhould deny that poor and mean priviledg (comparatively) of Church-memberſhip, unto that Grace (I mean, Faith) unto which he hath vouchſafed that High and Heavenly prerogative, the making of men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com the Sons of God.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:166777:13"/>
cannot reaſonably be judged more neceſſary to any mans regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar admiſſion into Church-fellowſhip, then thoſe other things. Now Baptiſm is no where repreſented in the Scriptures as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending any man, either unto God, or men, nor as any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable teſtimony of any mans Faith, vaſt multitudes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple having been baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> yea and by Chriſt himſelf or his Diſciples, whereas there were very few true beleevers amongſt them <hi>(Mat. 3. 5.

But that Baptiſm amongſt us, which our Brethren very inconſiderately and <hi>invita veritate,</hi> vote to be a <hi>nullity,</hi> is as efficacious, as operative, in reſpect of all the main ends of Baptiſm (the Baptiſm I mean intended by <hi>Chriſt)</hi> as theirs is, or can be; yea in reſpect of ſome of theſe ends, if not all, it hath the preheminency. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. It doth as ſolemnly, with as much authority and power, with as expreſs a ſignification to the underſtandings and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the world about us, teſtifie and declare us the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diſciples and followers of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as that Baptiſm prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by them can do. Nay in this (which is one of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ends of Baptiſm) it is of the two more efficacious then theirs. For their Baptiſm is (comparatively) a kind of <hi>Barbarian</hi> to the world: nor do the generality of men interpret or look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, as any thing more ſignificative, or aſſertive, of their own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Name and Faith of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> then our Baptiſm; which was alſo theirs, untill they renounced it, by ſubſtituting another in the place of it. Yea the ſence of the world, and of the generality of perſons, amongſt whom they live, is ſo far from being either, that by their Infant-Baptiſm they ſtood inſufficiently declared the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Diſciples of Chriſt, or that by their new Baptiſm they make any materiall addition unto that their Declaration, that it inclines rather to this, <hi>viz.</hi> That they betake themſelves to a Re-baptiſm, more to diſobliege themſelves from what their Infant-Baptiſm ingaged them unto, then to ſtrengthen or make valid that ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which, at leaſt as they apprehend, cannot receive any addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtrength or validitie by any further Baptiſm, but they are jealous that it may be diſinabled, or at leaſt diſadvantaged, by ſuch an after-Baptiſm. Of which apprehenſion I wiſh they had not, and yet much more, that they may not in time have, too juſt a ground. But however, nothing can be more evident, then that that Baptiſm is moſt ſerviceable and efficacious to teſtifie or demonſtrate a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, man or woman, to be a profeſſor of, and to own, the Name and Faith of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> in the ſight of the world, whoſe ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and import in this behalf is beſt known unto the world. If ſo, then is our Baptiſm, as valid, as efficacious, in reſpect of this great end of Baptiſm, as our Brethrens new Baptiſm can be; and conſequently, is far from being a <hi>nullity.</hi>

2. Our Baptiſm is altogether as operative, as bearing, as ingaging upon our judgments and Conſciences, to become the reall, loyall, and true Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, as theirs can be upon theirs, or could be upon ours, ſhould we come under it. For out of the ſence and conſcience we have that we have been Baptized, and ſtill own and ſtand by that our Baptiſm, we expect no other but the ſevereſt judgment and condemnation, which belong to Covenant-breakers with their God, from his hand, if we ſhall be found unfaithfull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this our Baptiſmall ingagement. And certain I am, that our Brethrens new-Baptiſm can have no richer, no fuller, no more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous or potent an influence upon their judgements and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this kind, then ſo. I wiſh that theirs may hold weight with ours in this ballance. If our Baptiſm, whilſt it was theirs alſo, had not the ſame weight of engagement upon their conſciences, which it hath upon ours, have they reaſon to judge us for it, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themſelves? Therefore in reſpect of this great end alſo of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ours is no whit more a nullitie, then theirs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) nor can we, or they (reaſonably, and upon ground) judge that our Baptiſm (as we call Baptiſm) is leſs edifying, ſtrengthening, comforting, to the inner man, then theirs. Our ſouls, through the grace and goodneſs of our good God unto us, have proſpered as much under that Baptiſm which we own, and by means of it (as far as we are able to compute) as we can, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation had with al Oracles that are like to inform us in the point, expect they would, or ſhould have done, under that Baptiſm, whoſe threſhold our Brethren place ſo neer the threſhold of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf. I beleeve there are thouſands yet abiding under our Baptiſm, who would not willingly exchange ſpirituall eſtates with the beſt of thoſe, who to better their eſtates in this kind, have ſought ſecurity under the wing and ſhelter of a new Baptiſm: yea I make very little queſtion, but that if our Brethren of this new Baptiſm (at leaſt many of them) would deal ingeniouſly and freely (and what is this but Chriſtianly?) with us in the point, they would acknowledge and confeſs, that they carried far the greater part of that ſpirituall treaſure, of which they are at preſent poſſeſt, from under that Baptiſm which they forſook, unto that which they have taken in exchange for it. Yea I heartily wiſh for the ſake of ſome of them, whom I know, that their <hi>New</hi> Baptiſm doth not help to diminiſh their <hi>Old</hi> grace. Therefore in reſpect of this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:166777:14"/>
great end alſo and benefit of Baptiſm, the building up of the inner man in Grace and peace, our Baptiſm is no whit behind theirs; but, if experience will be allowed to umpire, much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. I know no other end of Baptiſm but what is eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceable to one of theſe three. <hi>Set them</hi> then <hi>to judg</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in another caſe) <hi>who are leaſt eſteemed in the Church,</hi> whether that Baptiſm be like to be a <hi>nullity,</hi> which acts and performs, and this with authority and power, all the ends, ſervices, purpoſes and intents of Baptiſm; yea and in moſt of them, if not in all, quits it ſelf at a more worthy rate of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and ſucceſs, then that which pretends to the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſole reality and truth.</p>

               <p>It is no where to be found in Scripture, that any Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or imbodied ſociety of Beleevers, was commanded by God, or Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, to be Dipped; nor yet threatened, or reproved by any of them, for the non-practiſe of Dipping. If this be denyed, let the Scriptures, one, or more be produced (for as yet none have been) for the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a Denyal. Is it not then preſumption in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and an aſſuming of an Anti chriſtian power, to impoſe Laws upon <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Societies, which the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> never impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yea and to cenſure and ſcandalize them with the odious and reproachful terms of Anti-chriſtian, and unclean, only for the tranſgreſſions of their own Laws? Nor will it ſerve the turn, to pretend, that it is to be found in Scripture, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular members of Churches or imbodied ſocieties of Saints, are commanded to be dipped, and by conſequence, that Churches, or whole Churches, ought to be ſo likewiſe. For (beſides that this is contrary to the avouched principles of thoſe, who are like thus to pretend, who affirm, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no where reports, or makes, any perſon a member of a Church, but only ſuch who were dipped, before they entred that relation, and conſequently could have no ſuch command impoſed on them, being now members) it followeth not, that becauſe ſome particular members of a body were required to be dipped, therefore the whole body was commanded to be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:166777:15"/>
dipped likewiſe; eſpecially not upon ſuch terms, that unleſs it would be thus wholy, univerſally, and in all its members dipt, it ſhould be unclean in the ſight of God and men, and all communion with it ſinful. Therefore they who impoſe ſuch a Law as this upon <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches, or Societies, and make them heynous tranſgreſſors for the breach of it, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cenſuring them accordingly, are uſurpers of the high Prerogative of God, and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> claiming and exerciſing a Lordſhip over the Faith and conſciences of men.</p>

               <head>CONSIDERATION XVIII.</head>
               <p>Yea I beleeve it is more then the greateſt Oracle of Baptiſmal Dipping under Heaven, will ever be able to prove to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of a conſcience Chriſtianly conſiderate, that there is any precept or command of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Scriptures, whereby it is made ſinful for any perſon whatſoever, not only not to be dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but to be not ſo much as baptized in one form, or other. For firſt, certain it is, that it is no ſin unto any perſon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to be un-dipt, whileſt there is no perſon to be found ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently authorized by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to adminiſter dipping unto him. And however the camel be ſwallowed whole, either by the largneſs of the conſciences, or by the ſcantneſs of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, of our Metropolitan Dippers, yet is it not ſo eaſie for them to juſtifie the authentiqueneſs or validity of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, by which they act (without fear or trembling) the parts of dippers. But of this elſwhere. Secondly, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. which (as far as I underſtand) they make their cheif treaſure to ſupport them in their wars againſt their Brethren, doth at no hand make thoſe tranſgreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, who are not dip-wiſe baptized, no nor yet thoſe who are not baptized, either ſo, or otherwiſe. For firſt, here is no precept, charge, or command given unto any perſon, one or more, but unto the Apoſtles only. <hi>Go ye therefore</hi> [i. e. ye Apoſtles] and <hi>teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. Now as a Law impoſed upon a Magiſtrate for the diſcharge of his office, doth not make a ſubject guilty by his non-performance of it, nay he [the ſubject] ſhould be more guilty, in caſe he ſhould obſerve it: ſo neither doth a charge layd by <hi>Christ</hi> upon
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:166777:15"/>
his Apoſtles in reference to their ſpecial office &amp; miniſtry, oblige any other ſort of men to the obſervation of it <note n="*" place="margin">This commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion cannot be thought to obliege, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Paſtors or Teachers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not to <hi>go and teach all Nations;</hi> but to watch over thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar flocks, over which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeers, Acts 20. 28. 1 Pet. 5. 2.</note> Secondly, in theſe words, <hi>baptizing them,</hi> it cannot reaſonably be conceived that they were injoyned to baptize any perſon, or perſons. againſt their wills, or whether they would, or no. No, nor is it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of eaſie reſolution, what is the Antecedent or Subſtantive to this Relative pronoun, <hi>them;</hi> or whom, or what perſons they are, whom our Saviour here authorizeth his Apoſtles to baptize. Therefore, Thirdly, Here being no command layd upon any perſon to be baptized, or to deſire Baptiſm of the Apoſtles, it clearly follows, that the Apoſtles are here injoyned only to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize ſuch perſons, who ſhall freely and voluntarily require the ſame at their hand. Nor, Fourthly, Can it be proved from theſe words, <hi>teaching them to obſerve all things, whatſoever I have commanded them,</hi> that the Apoſtles did teach Saints, beleevers, or others, to require Baptiſm of them, unleſs it were firſt prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this was one particular of thoſe things, which Chriſt commanded his Apoſtles to teach the Nations to obſerve. But I beleeve there is no day in the year auſpicious for our new Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts to undertake the proof of this. Nor, Fifthly, do we find, that the Apoſtles in the courſe of their miniſtry, did ever <hi>teach</hi> either Church or perſon, to demand, or ſeek Baptiſm at their hand; much leſs threaten them, or charge them with diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto Chriſt for not ſeeking it. Sixthly, in caſe it ſhould be granted, that the Apoſtles by the tenor and vertue of their commiſſion, might, and did, teach Beleevers to obſerve the Law of requiring Baptiſm at their hands, yet it followeth not from hence, that by vertue of this commiſſion they had power alſo given them to make it a ſtanding Law for all Paſtors and teachers to the worlds end, who were to ſucceed them in the preaching the Goſpel, to impoſe the obſervation of the ſame Law upon all Beleevers; conſidering 1. That water-Baptiſm, as appears partly by the expreſs intentions of God about it in the firſt ſetting it on foot in the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 31. partly alſo, in that there is never mention made of any adminiſtration of Baptiſm in any place, but only upon the firſt coming or preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel therein, although there were never ſo many converted to the Faith in the ſame place afterwards (I mean, upon a ſecond publication of the Goſpel in this place) <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:166777:16"/>
41. compared with <hi>Acts.</hi> 4. 4, &amp; 5. 14, &amp; 9. 42, and 19. 3. with verſ. 18. by theſe two conſiderations (I ſay) it fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that water-Baptiſm was never intended by God, but either only or chiefly, for an Introductory or planting Ordinance <hi>i. e.</hi> to attend the Goſpel for a time at its firſt coming unto, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception by a People, Citty, or Nation, until it ſhould get ſome conſiderable rooting, and Intereſt amongſt them, not for a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or ſtanding ordinance in one and the ſame place (whereof good reaſon might be given, but that we are now upon a pin of brevity.) Secondly, That whereſoever, either the work and office of Paſtors and Teachers, or their qualifications are deſcribed, or the Intentions of God in, and about the erections of them in the Church declared, there is not the leaſt mention made either of any charge given them to baptize, nor of any qualifications requiſite in thoſe, who ſhould baptize, nor of any intent of God, or of Chriſt, that they ſhould baptize. See and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 4, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2. <hi>Tit. 1. 7, 8. Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13, 14. Thirdly, When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> directeth <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> to <hi>commit unto Faithful men, the things which he had heard of him among many witneſſes,</hi> the end why he thus direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, is ſignified in theſe words, <hi>who be able to teach others alſo (2 Tim.</hi> 2. 2.) plainly intimating, that what is deriveable from the Apoſtles unto ſtanding Paſtors and Teachers, reſpects cheifly, if not only, their abilities to teach, or preach the Goſpel. Seventhly, Concerning theſe words, <hi>And lo I am with you to the end of the World;</hi> neither do theſe neceſſarily prove, that a miniſteriall or actually <hi>Baptizing</hi> ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the end of the world, at leaſt not in all parts or places in the world, where the miniſtery of the Goſpel ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. For 1. <hi>Jerom</hi> conceiveth that the Apoſtles themſelves are here ſaid to live, and ſo to teach and baptize, <hi>to the end of the world,</hi> viz. in and by, their writings and other labours in the miniſtry: and that the preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with them to the end of the world here promiſed, importeth, 1 his direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtrengthening, and incouraging preſence, whileſt they continued in the body; and 2 his aſſiſting preſence with them in their writings and other labours faithfully performed in the work of the Goſpel, whereby theſe ſhould proſper and bring forth fruit to the end of the world. This is no hard or far fetcht

                  </note> Yet 2. be it granted, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> here promiſeth his preſence, not unto the Apoſtles alone, but to all their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in teaching and baptizing, (though a ſubſtantial proof of this requires more, I fear, then all the abilities of our Brethren of the Dip are able to perform) yet neither will it follow from hence, that they who ſhould ſucceed them in both, ſhould baptize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any other terms then the Apoſtles themſelves did, yea or are recorded in the Scriptures to have done. Now (as we lately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd) it is no where reported of them, or any of them, that they ever Baptized in any place, but onely at, and upon, their firſt bringing of the Name of Chriſt, and the Goſpel thereunto, in caſe it found any competent entertainment and ſettlement there. But, Eightly, (and laſtly) Grant we all that can either reaſonably or unreaſonably be demanded from the words in hand, on the behalf of thoſe, who were, and are, to ſucceed the Apoſtles in the work of the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> Miniſters and Teachers, and that Chriſt promiſeth his preſence with them, as well in Baptizing, as in teaching; yet what preſence of his is here promiſed to private Chriſtians, in their Adminiſtrations of Baptiſme? Surely when they Baptize, Chriſt is not with them in the work; how much leſs when perſons of this character ſhall put forth their hand to touch the Ark of Baptiſm, who are not ſo much as Baptized themſelves? And yet a Baptiſm adminiſtred upon ſuch polluted terms as theſe, is the mother and Foundreſs of all thoſe Baptizmall Adminiſtrations, for which our Brethren ſo importunately magnifie themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.

of their beleeving, for his vindication in holding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them? Yea and why did not thoſe who contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him about his ſaid act of communion, make ſome ſuch objection as this againſt his plea (inſtead of being ſatisfied with it) Why doſt thou tell us of the falling of the Holy Ghoſt upon theſe <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or of their beleeving? What is this to juſtifie thee in going in unto them? Tell us were they baptized, or no? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly both <hi>Peters</hi> ſilence of Baptiſm in his plea, and their ſilence in not inquiring after it for their ſatisfaction, <hi>diviſim</hi> and <hi>conjunctim</hi> prove, that Baptiſm in theſe days was looked upon as no foundation eſſentially requiſite to build Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion upon. For that that communion with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> about which <hi>Peter</hi> was now queſtioned at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> was conſtructively at leaſt ſuch a communion, is evident; 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Peter</hi> for his juſtification therein, pleads the falling of the Holy Ghoſt upon them as a teſtimony from God of their beleeving in Chriſt, which is no proper or neceſſary plea for the juſtification of the lawfulneſs of any other communion. 2. That communion which conſiſted in any kind of eating with men, was by the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were the men that now contended with <hi>Peter</hi> about his communion with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> interpreted as an acknowledging and owning of them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto God, and as perſons in Covenant with him. In which reſpect they judged it unlawful for a <hi>Jew</hi> to ſit at table, and eat meat with an unproſelyted <hi>Gentile,</hi> as appears from <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 30. and ſundry other places. Yea our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf looked upon a regular forbearance of communion in this caſe, as a matter of Religion, and of like nature with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of <hi>ſacrifice, Mat.</hi> 9. 13. compared with ver. 10. 11.</p>
               <p>To pretend that that communion, which <hi>Peter</hi> had with theſe <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was after, not before, their baptizing, is little to the purpoſe. For that their baptizing was meerly accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and irrelative to his communion with them, appears clearly 1. Becauſe he builds his juſtification in it upon quite another foundation (as we have heard) <hi>viz.</hi> the gift of the Holy Ghoſt unto them in teſtimony of their beleeving (which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our Brethren judg inſufficient to juſtifie them in a like communion, unleſs it be eeked out with a baptizing.) 2. Becauſe, they who demanded, and expected (if were to be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:166777:18"/>
had) a plenary ſatisfaction of that act of <hi>Peter</hi> in communicating with them, were fully ſatisfied with the account mentioned, making no queſtion for conſcience ſake about their baptizing. In like manner this very Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> a while before, had admitted <hi>Paul</hi> into their communion, only upon <hi>Barnabas</hi> his <hi>declaring unto them that he had ſeen the Lord in the way, and that he had ſpoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus in the name of Jeſus, (Acts.</hi> 9. 27.) without having heard the leaſt inkling of his baptizing. Yea it may be a queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Barnabas</hi> himſelf knew that he had been baptized: but however if he did know it, it is ſcarce a queſtion, but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now to prepare him a way into communion with this Church, he would have repreſented his Baptiſm, if he had judged the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg hereof neceſſary for this Church, before they could lawfully receive him into their communion. Yea a little before this, <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> at <hi>Damaſcus</hi> had given him the right hand of Chriſtian fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in calling him, Brother, before he was baptized. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Brethrens conceit of ſuch an abſolute neceſſity of Baptiſm in order to Church-fellowſhip, as they dream of, is but an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal dream, without footing or foundation in the Scriptures. How much more is the emphaſis of this their conceit Apocryphal, which beareth, not that Baptiſm ſimply, but Baptiſm according to their model of circumſtances in every circumſtantial punctillo adminiſtred, is of this Soveraign and Sacred neceſſity to qualifie and capacitate for Church-communion? Do they affect to be either more wiſe or more Holy then God?</p>

                  </gap>ring ſpirit of this ſort of men ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly prevailing as they do. There is a ſtrong tide of Report both from <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> that as far as the Intereſt and power, ſo far the inſolency alſo and importune haughtineſs of that generation we ſpeak of, extendeth in both theſe Nations, and that all perſons, of what Integrity or worth ſoever other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, who are not enlightened with their darkneſs about their <hi>dipping,</hi> are troden under foot like unſavory ſalt, and judged unmeet for any place of truſt or power with them, being allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only the preferements of drawing water, and hewing wood. One of this faction or party in <hi>England</hi> (and he no ſmall begger neither) ſpeaking of a Perſon, who, though not of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about the neceſſity of dipping, yet otherwiſe a man (to my knowledg) that had very well deſerved of that way in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reſpects, as well publique, as private, yet ſpeaking (I ſay) of this perſon, he ſaid in the prefence of ſeveral perſons of quality, that <hi>He deſerved to be hanged;</hi> an aphoriſm conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the later ſaying of a preacher of that way about the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who in diſcourſe with a perſon (walking in communion with me) about his judgment, and being (as it ſeems) worſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the skirmiſh, at laſt recovered all the ground he had loſt with this or the like, <hi>Epiphonema;</hi> that ſhe might find her Church at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and the Gallows. Theſe words I regard but as muck, notwithſtanding it may concern others to look after the fire. But ſurely theſe men, when they come into their Kingdom of Authority and power, will execute judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and juſtice without partiality. If ſo, then, He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth to be hanged, muſt expect no better quarter then that of the halter: and if juſtice be adminiſtred without partiality, all that are in the ſame condemnation of Anti-dipping with him, may bear him company in the ſame expection.

Conſcience beareth me witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt, that as I have been cordially and chriſtianly reſpectful and friendly unto theſe men, as far as I have had opportunity to ſerve them, ſo am I ſtill rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to bow down and lick the duſt at the feet even of the meaneſt of them, and of him amongſt them, who ever he be, that is my greateſt enemy, for their ſpiritual, yea or temporal accommodation. Nor do I deny, or doubt, but that as amongſt the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> though <hi>a generation of Vipers</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 3. 7. &amp; 23. 33.</note>, there were ſome who beleeved in <hi>Chriſt</hi>

                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 1. &amp; 7. 50 Act. 15. 5</note>; ſo among thoſe, who have been baptized in their own water, ſome there are baptized into the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and upright in the ſight of God. But the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being <hi>mingled amongst the Heathen,</hi> in time <hi>learned their works</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 105. 36.</note> and the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingale (ſome ſay) by converſing among Sparrows, will forget her native notes, and learn to chirp. Moreover, thoſe things were not in <hi>Hazael</hi>'s heart, whileſt he was yet a Subject, which were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ingendered there, when he came to be King over <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">2 Kin. 8. 12, 13</note>.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is ſcarce any of thoſe worthy Inſtruments, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Calvin, Beza, Bucer, Peter Martyr, Muſculus, Bullinger,</hi> with others of like name and worth (almoſt) without number, whoſe piety, zeal and faithfulneſs in conjunction with their ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar gifts, and abilities of learning, God was pleaſed to honour and uſe in the glorious Work of the Reformation, and in the deſeace and propagation of the reformed Religion unto this day, but in their Writings, Commentaries upon the Scriptures, and others, very frequently and upon all occaſion take up moſt ſad complaints againſt this generation of men, as enemies to the progreſs of the Goſpel, and by their unchriſtian and unworthy carriages, cauſing the good Word of God and the Reformed Religion to be evil ſpoken of, and reproached by the Adverſaries thereof in the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We underſtand by the Records of former times, and our own experience time after time informeth us in part, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the beſt, and moſt conſiderate perſons, who have been for ſome time engaged in that way, after full tryal of it, have forſaken it, as not finding God, or Chriſt, in it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We underſtand by frequent and very credible informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; ſome of us are able to teſtifie as much upon our own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and experience, that in ſome of thier religious Aſſemblies and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:166777:20"/>
Conventions there is no conſiderable preſence of God with them; that there is little taught amongſt them with any evidence or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Spirit, with any Authority and Power; that the Scriptures are very defectively and lamely opened and applyed, ever and anon wreſted to the countenancing and magnifying of their own private conceit and notion about Baptiſm; and that the greateſt part of the time, during theſe Meetings, is ſpent in fruitleſs altercations, and vain janglings. Nor know we any ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that it is much better in thoſe other Congregations of theſe men, which we know not, then it is in thoſe which we know.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Another thing of little leſs diſcouragement unto us then the former, is, that there have been, and ſtill are extant, three or four ſeveral Editions, or man-deviſed modes, of Dipping, every latter pretending to correct the inſufficiency, irregularity, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, of the former. In regard whereof, ſome (we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand) inſtead of being once baptized, have been dipped three or four times over, thus committing that ſin in Baptiſm, which Chriſt prohibits in prayer, the ſin, I mean, of <hi>vain repetitions.</hi> So that in caſe our Conſciences did lead us to a baptiſmal Dipping, yet ſhould we be at a loſs concerning the particular mode or form, which is agreeable to the mind of Chriſt, there being ſo many Competitors for this honour. And for the Mode of the lateſt and neweſt Invention, and which (as we underſtand) is of greateſt eſteem, it is, as far as we are able to conceive by the repreſentation of it made unto ſome of us, ſo contrived, and ſo to be managed, that the Baptiſt, who dippeth according to it, had need be a man of ſtout limbs, and of a very able and active body: otherwiſe the perſon to be baptized, eſpecially if in any degree corpulent or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy, runs a great hazard of meeting with <hi>Chriſts</hi> latter Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm <note n="*" place="margin">Luke 12, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0, Mat, 20. 22 23</note> inſtead of his former. And if this manner of Baptizing were in uſe in the Apoſtles days, it is no great marvel that <hi>Paul,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man little and low of ſtature (as Hiſtory reports him, and himſelf overtures, 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 10, 1, 10.) cared ſo little and ſeldom to adventure upon the work. And yet ſhould we heſitate in our Conſciences much more, where to find a competent perſon amongſt them authorized by God to adminiſter ſuch a kind of Baptiſm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. For we are not yet baptized into the belief of either of theſe Doctrines; either, 1. That a perſon unbaptized, may, without a ſpecial call or warrant from God, like unto that of <hi>John Baptiſt,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:166777:21"/>
Luke</hi> 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. undertake the Adminiſtration; Or, 2. That that was a caſe of neceſſity, wherein either <hi>Nicholas Stork</hi> (with his three Comrades) in <hi>Germany</hi> about the year 1521, or whoever he was that firſt, himſelf being in his own Judgment and Conſcience un-baptized, preſumed to baptize others after that exotique mode in this Nation. Nor are we convinced or clear in our Judgments, that any of thoſe, who have been dipped amongſt us, have been rightly baptized, if it be ſuppoſed that true Baptiſm conſiſts in a total immerſion, or ſubmerſion, by him that baptizeth; becauſe the baptized themſelves are wont to ſubmerge the greater part of their bodies, before the Baptiſt comes at them; and ſo are rather ſe-baptized, then baptized according to what the Scripture ſeems to ſpeak concerning Baptiſm. Beſides, we do not read in the Scriptures of any Baptiſmal Boots, or Baptiſmal Breeches, or of ſhifting garments to avoyd the danger of being baptized, or of encircling women with women after their coming from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſalve their modeſty, with ſome other devices now, or of late in frequent uſe amongſt our new Baptiſts in the way of their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. All theſe things narrowly conſidered, miniſter a ground of vehement ſuſpition unto us, left the whole ſtory of Baptiſmal Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould prove Apocryphal.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Another thing much diſcouraging and diſſwading un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us from the way mentioned, is, that they who have paſſed over the bridg of Anabaptiſm, can find (as it ſeems) no firm ground to ſtand on on the other ſide, but are ever and anon ſhifting their Judgments and their practiſes, running out into ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth opinious, heaping up obſervation upon obſervation: yea their own Churches and Congregations, notwithſtanding their high Purification by Baptiſm, are ſometimes unclean to them; in ſo much that they divide, and ſubdivide, yea and are ready to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide again their diviſions.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Whereas <hi>Antichriſt</hi> himſelf is not more <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> then in claiming and exerciſing ſuch a dominion over the Faith of his Proſelytes and Diſciples, by vertue whereof he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth them to depend only upon Miniſters and Teachers of his own Faith and wicked perſwaſion in matters of Religion, ſeverely prohibiting unto them the hearing of Proteſtant Preachers; we underſtand that the ſame high-impoſing ſpirit domineers more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in the Churches and Congregations which have been dipt;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:166777:21"/>
and that they alſo ſolemnly conjure all their Proſelytes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts not to hear <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſpeaking by any other mouth, then theirs; thus bearing them in hand, as if a voyce from Heaven like unto that, which was heard by the people at <hi>Chriſts</hi> Baptiſm concerning him, had come unto them alſo in reference to themſelves and their Teachers, in this or the like tenor of words: We are the only true Churches and Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt: HEAR <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> Yea there was of late a very great Schiſm made in one of theſe Churches, and the greater part apoſynagoguized by the leſſer, becauſe of the high miſdemeanor of ſome of the Members in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words of eternal life from the mouths of ſuch Miniſters, who follow not them in their way. Such principles and practiſes as theſe we judg to be moſt notoriouſly and emphatically <hi>Anti-chriſtian,</hi> and ſuch wherein (as was ſaid in a like caſe) the very horns and hoofs of the beaſt may be felt and handled. Yea we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but judg them to be of moſt pernicious conſequence to the precious Souls of men, as depriving them of the beſt means and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities which God moſt graciouſly affordeth unto them for their recovery out of all ſuch ſnares, wherein at any time their foot may be taken. This is another grand diſcouragement unto us from that way.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, We obſerve, That (more generally) when men or women have ſuffered themſelves to be intangled with a conceit of that way; eſpecially when they have bowed down their Judgments and Conſciences unto it, they are preſently found in that ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and diſtemper, wherein the Apoſtle perc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ived the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> upon their ſubjection to the yoke of Circumciſion, when he demanded of them, <hi>Who hath bewitched you</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 3 1.</note>? For as theſe were ſo ſtrangely beſotted and diſſenſed with their notion of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and legal Obſervations, that the Apoſtle himſelf <hi>feared</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 4. 11.</note> that he ſhould not be able to deliver them, no not by the cleareſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and demonſtrations of the vanity and danger of their new notion, and practiſe: ſo are the Reaſons, Judgments and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of the perſons we ſpeak of, ſo ſtupified, diſtraught and confounded with the admiration of their Water-work, and their airy conceits about it, that all Reaſon oppoſing it, is a <hi>Barbarian</hi> unto them; common ſence is a myſtery inacceſſible to their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, the light of the noon-day offering to diſcover any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs in their way, is as dark as the darkneſs of mid-night it ſelf:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:166777:22"/>
Men of ſound and ſerious intellectuals are as men that ſpeak unto them in a ſtrange tongue, if they ſpeak any thing againſt their way. They know not valleys from hills, nor hills from valleys, rivers from trees, nor trees from rivers, halfs from wholes, nor wholes from halfs, precepts from promiſes, nor promiſes from precepts, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from ſubſtance, nor ſubſtance from ceremony; every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction that attempts to ſhew them the error of their way, <hi>ipſo facto</hi> becomes a Chaos and confuſion. On the other hand, for the maintenance and defence of their way, the ſhadows of mountains ſeem valiant and armed men; ſtubble and rotten wood, are turned into weapons of ſteel and iron before them; letter becomes ſpirit, face becomes heart, promiſe becomes precept, ceremony becomes ſubſtance, Apoſtles become ordinary men and women, diſputeables become demonſtrations, and peradventures become all Yeas and Amens. In reſpect of theſe marvellous and ſad diſtempers in their fancies and underſtandings, to reaſon with them about their way, or to endeavor their conviction, ſeldom turns to any better account then a beating of the ayr, or then <hi>Diogenes</hi> his begging ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to the Statues of men.</p>
               <p>But Ninethly (and laſtly) The firſt born of all Diſcouragements unto us in this kind, is, that which our eyes dayly ſee, and our ears oft hear, and wherewith our hearts are continually made ſad with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, <hi>viz.</hi> that the generality or far greater part of thoſe, who turn aſide into this way, do, ſome more ſuddenly, others by degrees, impair and decline in their Graces, loſe that ſweetneſs, meekneſs, love, and Chriſtian humility of ſpirit, wherewith they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly adorned, as if they were baptized in <hi>Marah</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 15 23.</note>, or in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Red Sea. Never did we know any that by being dipped added thereby ſo much as an hairs bredth to his ſpiritual ſtature, or that became in any degree either more meek, or more humble, or more patient, or more merciful, or more mortifyed, ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the like; but very many have we known and heard of, who upon ſuch an engagement have made ſhipwrack of much ſpiritual treaſure, wherewith God had bleſſed them under their firſt Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. Many have we known, who went into the water, Lambs, and came out of it Wolves and Tygers: many who went in, Doves, and came out, Serpents; as if they had met with the ſpirit that rules in the ayr under the water, in ſtead of the ſweet Spirit of <hi>Christ.</hi> Yea we have known ſome, who ſoon after their dipping
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:166777:22"/>
have perpetrated and done things ſo unworthy and unſutable to their former <hi>genius,</hi> which if any man had challenged them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their dipping, that they would do after, we have reaſon to judg they would have replied to the challenge, as <hi>Hazael</hi> did to <hi>Eliſha</hi> in ſomewhat a like caſe; <hi>But what is thy ſervant a dog that he ſhould do this great thing? 2 King.</hi> 8. 13. So many ſad ſpectacles and ſtories, wherewith our eyes and ears are fill'd from time to time, eſpecially not being ballanced or counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyſed with any thing deſireable, or of moment, put us into ſome fears, leſt as God, in his juſt, though ſecret judgment, gives Sathan a permiſſion to haunt ſome houſes, and to miſuſe and terrifie thoſe that ſhall lodg in them; ſo he ſhould, for cauſes beſt known to himſelf (though ſomewhat might with good probability be conjectured in this kind) have granted unto this enemy of mankind ſomewhat a like power, over the opinion and practiſe of Rebaptizing, and to tempt thoſe, who ſuffer themſelves to be intangled with them, more dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and prevailingly, then thoſe, who in ſimplicity of heart walk before him in the contrary way. We are not definitive in this; but only crave leave (without offence) to make known our fears. And however, God having multiplied grace, mercy and peace unto us in that way of his worſhip, wherein at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we walk, we judge it no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> prudence to tempt him in another. But whether our Brethren have any juſt cauſe to caſt us out of their communion, for not forſaking a way of experienced peace and ſafety, to walk in a way of ſo much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as that they ſeek to conjure us into, we leave to their own conſciences, and to all conſidering men, to judg and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:166777:23"/>
him to ſpeak of water-Baptiſw; becauſe, 1. Here is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther element expreſly named, wherein this Baptiſm might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, viz. <hi>the Spirit,</hi> whereas there is no mention of water at all. 2. The phraſe of being baptized with the Spirit, or with the Holy Ghoſt (as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, might have been tranſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, as it is in all other places of like conſtruction, as <hi>viz. Mat. 3. 11. Mar. 1. 8. Luk. 3. 16. Ioh. 1, 33. Acts 1. 5, Acts</hi> 11, 16.) is moſt uſual and frequent in the Scriptures (as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral texts now cited ſufficiently declare;) whereas, to be with, or through, the ſpirit, baptized with water, is an uncouth and hard expreſſion, no where found in the Scriptures, nor carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any regular Sence in it. 3. If the <hi>unity</hi> or oneneſs of the <hi>body</hi> here ſpoken of, did, or doth depend upon their baptizing with water, and was cauſed by this, it had been impertinent for the Apoſtle to mention the <hi>unity</hi> of the Spirit, For <hi>we by one Spirit are all,</hi> &amp;c. he ſhould rather have inſiſted upon the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſame-neſs of water Baptiſm (as he doth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 5.) 4. The unity or oneneſs of the body, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, is not ſo much, or ſo proper, an effect of water-Baptiſm, no nor of the oneneſs of this Baptiſm (if it be any effect of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at all) is of the Spirit, by which this body is inſpired, anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, acted, and moved, and the members of it knit together, and kept from diſſolution. 5. Whether all the members of the body were <hi>baptized</hi> with water, or no, is uncertain. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle expreſly profeſſeth that he baptized <hi>[viz.</hi> with water] very few of them; and who elſe ſhould baptize them all, no where appears; whereas that they were all with, or by, <hi>the Spirit bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into the ſame body</hi> [i. e. perſwaded and over-ruled in their judgments and conſciences to imbody themſelves in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Goſpel] is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable. 6, The Spirit is no where ſaid to baptize men with water by or through the Spirit. 7. Though there be no expreſs mention in the verſ either of God, or of Chriſt, who elſewhere (the one, or the other) are ſaid to <hi>baptize with the Spirit,</hi> thoſe who are thus baptived, yet verſe. 6. God is named, and this under the conſideration of his unity, or ſameneſs, as <hi>working all in all: But it is the ſame God that worketh all in all.</hi> And in the next verſe it is ſaid; <hi>But the manifeſtation of the Spirit is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:166777:24"/>
given unto every man,</hi> &amp;c. [meaning, by God, mentioned in the verſe preceding.] Beſides, There is nothing more familiat in the Scriptures, then to expreſs ſuch actions, which are proper unto God, or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> indefinitely, and without the mention of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>All Power is given unto me</hi> [ſaith Chriſt, meaning by God his Father] <hi>in Heaven and in Earth, Matth.</hi> 28. 18. Inſtances of this conſtruction, ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 37. and 25. 29. <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. 12. (beſides many others.) Yea actions appropriate, whether to Angels, or men, are ſometimes thus expreſſed. 8. The reſemblance which the Apoſtle borrowed (in the Verſe next preceding that in hand) from the natural body, ſheweth that the unity or oneneſs of that Church body of which he here ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is not ſuch an oneneſs which accrueth unto it by Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or any external Rite or Ceremony, but by the oneneſs and ſameneſs of that Spirit, by which it is (as it were) inform'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and ſupported in life, and ſpiritual Being. <hi>For as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: ſo is Chriſt;</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that as the natural body, notwithſtanding the plurality and diverſity of its members, yet is, is made, or becometh, one intire body, not by any external or accidental thing befalling, or done unto, every of theſe members reſpectively, but by that ſpirit of life which diffuſeth it ſelf into all and every of theſe members pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, and ſo by means of the oneneſs or ſameneſs of it, cauſeth a joynt coalition and natural conſent in all theſe members to conſtitute and make one and the ſame entire body; ſo is the myſtical or ſpiritual Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> made, and doth become, one and the ſame Body in its kind, notwithſtanding the great number and difference of the perſons, who are the members of it, by means of that Spirit, and his unity and ſameneſs, which communicates himſelf inwardly unto them all, raiſing and begetting in them an holy conſent to love and ſerve, and accommodate one another, much after the ſame manner, as the natural members in that other body do. 9. Nor is it any ways probable, that in that clauſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, tranſlated, <hi>and have been made to drink into one Spirit,</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the ſacramental drinking in the Supper; 1. Becauſe <hi>drinking,</hi> or the ſup, in this Sacrament, is never found mentioned apart, or without mention of the bread in the ſame contexture of Scripture with it. 2. To

ſay that they, who have before this their <hi>drinking,</hi> received the ſame <hi>Spirit,</hi> are made to drink [at the Lords Table] for, into, or unto, the ſame Spirit, is very improper, and not without very much ado, ſo much as truth. 3. Neither are Beleevers any where ſaid, to be made to drink, or to have <hi>drink</hi> given them, at the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in order to their obtaining the ſame <hi>Spirit,</hi> 4. Learned Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors give notice of ſeveral different readings of this clauſe, found in Manuſcripts, and other Copies. In a Manuſcript (ſaith <hi>Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> upon the place) this clauſe is thus read: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>and we all are one Body. Oecumenius</hi> (it ſeems) did read it thus: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> and we all drank, or were cauſed to drink, one potion, or one drinking, for, or unto, one Spirit. Some of the Fathers read the clauſe in their language, <hi>Et omnes unum Spiritum potavimus, i. e.</hi> and we all have drank one Spirit; with which the Syriac alſo accordeth. 5. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the clauſe (if the reading we have be judged authentique) conſtrued with the former, ſeems to be this: We have by the <hi>ſame Spirit,</hi> not only, or ſimply, been <hi>baptized into one</hi> and the ſame <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, [i. e.</hi> received ſuch a proportion, or meaſure of the Spirit given us, which is ſufficient to make us <hi>one Body,]</hi> but we have alſo been <hi>made to drink unto one Spirit, [i. e.</hi> have received of this Spirit of God ſo liberally, ſo plentifully, that we may very well become <hi>one Spirit</hi> hereby amongſt our ſelves, and walk together without either diviſions in judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, or diſtances in our affections.] This conſtruction of the prepoſition, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, might be exemplified from the Scriptures: and however, there is no hardneſs or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſantneſs in it. And this Expoſition of the clauſe, receives countenance from all thoſe paſſages in both Epiſtles, wherein the Apoſtle ſignifies the more then ordinary pourings out of the Spirit in variety of gifts and graces upon theſe <hi>Corinthians.</hi> But, 10. (and laſtly) Suppoſe it ſhould be granted, 1. That the Apoſtle in this Verſe ſpeaks of Water-Baptiſm, 2. That his meaning is, that by this <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> they had been all <hi>baptized into one Body;</hi> Yet, 1. It doth not follow, that this muſt needs be underſtood <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutively,</hi> but <hi>declaratively</hi> only; and that all implyed hereby ſhould be, that by their Baptiſm they did declare, or <hi>ſigno tenus</hi> pretend, unto the world, that they were <hi>one Body,</hi> not that they were conſtituted, or really and actually made <hi>one Body,</hi> by their Baptiſm. 2. Both the ſaid particulars admitted, yea and this alſo,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:166777:25"/>
that they were (in a ſence) by Water-Baptiſm <hi>baptized [conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutively] into one Body,</hi> yet will it not follow from all theſe put together, either, 1. But that they might have been, yea and now were, the ſame Body, which they were, by another Conſtitution, and Conſtitutor (one, or more) beſides that of Water-Baptiſm; Or, 2. That no other kind of Water-Baptiſm, but only that by Dipping, would have been every whit as effectual, as that by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to conſtitute or make them one Body. As to the former; Men may be truly ſaid to be juſtified <hi>[i. e.</hi> conſtituted or made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous] by Faith; and yet as truly be ſaid alſo to be juſtified by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yea and by God himſelf, and this with the ſelf ſame Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Yea Children without Faith are juſtified with the ſame Juſtification by God and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> wherewith men Beleevers are juſtified through Faith. In like manner a company of Beleevers, may be ſaid to be conſtituted a Church by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and yet be ſaid to be conſtituted and made this very Church by the Spirit of Chriſt, or by Faith alſo; yea though Baptiſm be wanting, yet may theſe perſons be a Church of a like, as ſound, as worthy a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by means of the other two, the Spirit of Chriſt, and Faith. To the latter; Suppoſe baptizing by ſprinkling, or pouring water on the face, or head, were only the Ordinance of men, and not of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yet by common agreement and conſent about the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and purport of this Ordinance, a general ſubmiſſion unto it by men, might as well and as much, conſtitute them one and the ſame Body, as baptizing by dipping would do. It is true, upon ſuch a ſuppoſition as this, the unity of the Body, ſo far as the ceremony of ſprinkling hath to do in it, is not raiſed, or effected, according to the mind or precept of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but yet thoſe other Conſtitutors of the ſame unity (I mean, the Spirit of God, and Faith) are not defeated in their operations or effects hereby. So that the Body, or Church, we ſpeak of, is a true Body or Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the external Contributor towards the unity of it, be not ſuch as it ought to be. But in this latter part of our Anſwer, we put our ſelves to more trouble then we need, by arguing againſt ſuch thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, which neither can be proved, nor are (indeed) in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves probable. However our Brethren may pleaſe to take notice here from how ready and deſirous we are to give them ſatisfaction in the largeſt meaſure they can deſire it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. (And laſtly) Whereas an unlawfulneſs of communicating

               <p n="1">1. That it is not recorded that the ſpring, or water, wherein the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was baptized, was ſo deep as to reach, or come up to his ankles, when he went (as is ſuppoſed) into it: yet our Brethren build very high, and with confidence (more then enough) upon a far greater depth then ſo in it. Nor is it recorded that any of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> or the greater part of the Members of any of them, were baptized: yet our Brethren would think it unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in us to deny it. But by what Law ſhould our Brethren judg it unreaſonable in us to deny, upon the account of a non-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recorded, what they ſuppoſe to be true; when as they judg it very commendable in themſelves to deny that only upon the ſame account of not being recorded, which we judg to be true? But if we deny them the principle, or priviledg of unreaſonableneſs, their fabrick falls to the ground.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where the Scripture, not only allows, but enjoyneth, the beleeving yoke-fellow in marriage, cohabitation with the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, there it doth <hi>ex ſuper abundanti</hi> both approve and require Church-cohabitation and communion of the baptized with the un-baptized; at leaſt where both parties are really ſanctified by Faith in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and the Baptized have moſt ſolemnly, and in the preſence of God, and before many witneſſes of his Saints, engaged themſelves by promiſe unto the other, to walk with them in all the Ordinances of God and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as they ſhould be at any time revealed and made known unto them. I ſhall not (I ſuppoſe) need to traverſe the compariſon. The Argument <hi>a minore ad majus,</hi> from the leſs probability to the greater, lieth large above ground. If Infidelity, which is ten times worſe then the want of an external Ceremony, yet hath no power to abſolve the beleeving wife for her matrimonial engagement to her Husband; much leſs hath a defect of, or in, an outward Ceremony, in one or more members of a Chriſtian Society, any Commiſſion or Authority from God to diſcharge thoſe, who call themſelves baptized, from thoſe ſacred promiſes or engagements, wherein they have openly and avowingly affianced themſelves to this Society.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Where the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>What God hath joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:166777:26"/>
let no man put aſunder, (Mat.</hi> 19. 6.) he doth more then juſtifie that Communion, which is the ſubject matter of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Debate. For if it was God, that joyned together the perſons who now look upon themſelves, as Baptized, with thoſe who are challenged for unbaptized, in that holy Communion wherein they ſometimes walked together, then it is a plain caſe, that no man (indeed no creature) whatſoever hath any authority or right of power, whatſoever his pretence may be, to diſſolve the band of this Communion between them, except it be given unto him by God. And then this gift or grant from God muſt be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to men, before they ought to own or countenance any man in his act of parting, or putting aſunder what God hath joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And the truth is, that that man, or creature, that ſhall claim a right of power to abrogate or diſanul any act of God, otherwiſe then from God himſelf, maketh himſelf not only equal, but ſuperior in power, unto God. So that all the Queſtion is, whether God may lawfully and with truth be entituled to thoſe tranſactions, by which the reſpective members of a Society or fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of Saints, do at any time imbody themſelves, or become a Church or ſpiritual Corporation. For if it be either granted, or proved, that God is the Author of theſe councels or motions in the hearts of his Saints, as well undipt, as dipped, by which they incorporate or imbody themſelves, it will roundly follow, that men have no power, but that which is uſurped, and ſinfully uſed, to diſſolve, either in whole, or in part, theſe imbodied Societies, or Incorporations. For if God, upon this ſuppoſition, ſhould autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize or licenſe men to make any ſuch diſſolution, he ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt, and inconſiſtent with, himſelf; giving men leave, what he builds up in one day, to pull down the next. For certain it is, that they who ſeparate and rend themſelves off from any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Saints after one, two, or three years walking with them, had the ſame right or power of ſeparating themſelves the very next day or hour after their firſt uniting, unleſs it be ſuppoſed that this Society in the mean time hath enormouſly corrupted it ſelf, or apoſtatized from that Faith, which it profeſſed when the ſaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons firſt joyned themſelves unto it. Now whether God be the Author of thoſe counſels and motions in the hearts of his Saints, whether dipt, or undipt, by the ducture whereof they are led to imbody themſelves (as hath been ſaid,) can be no mans queſtion,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:166777:26"/>
who doth but know and conſider the moſt gracious and bleſſed tendencies, yea and real effects of ſuch Incorporations, when the perſons incorporated do but in any conſiderable degree walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their light, and perform the terms of their engagements, dipping, or not dipping, making no difference in this kind. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding if a thing ſo clear and evident as this ſhould be any mans doubt, demonſtrations and proofs are near at hand; but till they be called for, the Reader (haply) for his eaſe, had rather hear of them, then have them. But,</p>
               <p n="4">4. (And laſtly) To juſtifie the practiſe of perſons dipped in ſeparating and tearing off themſelves from the Societies of Saints undipt, it is not (ſo much as in colour or ſhew) ſufficient to plead, that they find no Example in the Scripture of any ſuch Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but it is abſolutely neceſſary hereunto, that they find and ſhew ſome Example (and this atteſted by the Spirit of God) of ſuch a Separation, as they practiſe. They find no Example in Scripture of any Beleever dipped after they had been dedicated in their Infancy unto the Service of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by ſprinkling, or waſhing; yet they judg themſelves bound to the practiſe. Why may they not as well judg themſelves bound to remain in communion with Societies undipt, although they find no Example in Scripture of a like practiſe? If they practiſe in one caſe without Example, why do they not the like in the other? As for matter of Precept, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to build either the one practiſe, or the other; certainly there is as much (or rather much more) for holding communion with Saints, though undipt, as for dipping, after ſprinkling, or waſhing. And as ſprinkling, or waſhing in Infancy, is no where expreſly or <hi>literâ tenùs</hi> made an exception againſt after Dipping; ſo neither is this dipping made any exception or bar againſt holding commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Saints or Beleevers, though undipt. Yea whereas that Communion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſpeak of is an act or ſervice of love and of mercy, and conſequently one of the great things of the Law, Dipping being only a Ceremony, and ſo anſwering the tything of Mint, Aniſe, and Cummin, certainly if men think themſelves bound in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence not to leave the latter undone, they are much bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and do the former. Therefore they who dip after ſprinkling, in this very practiſe condemn themſelves for breaking Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after Dipping.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>UPon occaſion of the foregoing Conſiderations, and the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment traverſed in them, I judged it not amiſs to ſubjoyn in the cloze of them one Conſideration more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>  which though it doth not ſo particularly relate unto the Argument of the former, yet may it through the bleſſing of God comfort, ſtrengthen, and relieve thee againſt ſuch impreſſions of ſadneſs, wherewith, as well that troubleſom and diſorderly behavior of men there counter-argued, as many other parts of no better, if not of a much worſe import, like to be ſhortly acted upon the ſtage of the world yet ſtanding, are like to fill thy Soul. The Conſideration I mean, is, That the Great Troubler of the World, the Devil, knowing that he hath now but a very ſhort time, is like to arm himſelf with greater wrath then ever, againſt the poor generation of the children of men, the objects of his deadly fury and moſt inveterate indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They who have yet their turns of mortality to take, either in whole, or in part, are like to learn and know more within the ſpace of one year what a <hi>DEVIL</hi> meaneth, then thoſe who have lived before them have done in ſeven. Satan hath but dallied with the world in miſchief and blood hitherto (in compariſon.) The ſcope of time before him wherein to act, was a kind of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon him to remiſſneſs in his work. Now finding and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf cloſe begirt, and pen'd up in ſtraits of time for action, it cannot be expected but that he ſhould dayly break out upon the world like thunder and lightening out of the blackeſt cloud. <hi>Acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rima virtus eſt, quam ultima neceſſitas extundit.</hi> He never rent <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> and tare the poor child <hi>(Luk.</hi> 9.) ſo cruelly, as when he knew that the date of his poſſeſſion was now expired. And however his game by, as well the preſent troubles, perplexities, and confuſions of the world, as the eternal ruine and perdition of the precious Souls of men, (for his <hi>motto</hi> may be, <hi>Tam marte, quàm Mercurio,)</hi> yet when he can purſue and follow both in one and the ſame chaſe, he is in the higheſt extaſie of his delight. His great and deeply beloved deſign is to diſſolve his works in the world, who he knoweth came
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:166777:27"/>
into the world to diſſolve his. And as he knoweth that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s method for the deſtruction of his Kingdom was by kindling a fire of diviſion in the midſt of it, by means whereof, where <hi>five</hi> ſhould <hi>be in an houſe, three</hi> ſhould <hi>be divided againſt two, and two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt three, The father divided againſt the ſon, and the ſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the father, the mother againſt the daughter, and the daughter against the mother</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 12 49, 51, 52, 53.</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in like manner his method, by way of revenge, and, if it were poſſible, to deſtroy the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is, by caſting fire too, a fire of diviſion, into that alſo, whereby the Saints in their families likewiſe ſhould be divided, the husband againſt the wife, and the wife againſt the husband; the father againſt his ſons, and the ſons againſt their father; the maſter againſt his ſervants, and the ſervants againſt their maſter, &amp;c. And though it be true, that the Devil hath in former ages caſt ſundry fires of ſeparation and diviſion into that great body or bulk of the Profeſſors of <hi>Christ</hi> in the world (commonly called, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church) cauſing hereby great troubles and confuſions in this Church, and poſſibly might ſeparate and divide ſome true Saints and Servants of God, from others, partakers of like precious Faith with them, yet did he never (at leaſt ſince the Apoſtles days) attempt the Kingdom of Chriſt ſo compact in it ſelf, and ſo well fortified for its own defence and preſervation, as of late it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us in the Congregational Churches of the Nation, by any fire of diviſion whatſoever like unto that, which is beſt known in the world by the name of, <hi>Anabaptiſm.</hi> By other fires, for the moſt part he either ſeparated the vile from the precious, or the vſe amongſt themſelves, and from the vile; in both which caſes the ſpiritual Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was rather a gainer, then a loſer. But by this fire of <hi>Anabaptiſm</hi> (at leaſt as the greateſt part of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineers, who work with it, do employ it) he ſeparates only the precious from the precious, Saints from Saints, Beleevers from Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers; and makes the one to become as Publicans and Heathens unto the other. By means whereof many ſpiritual temples and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations of the living God, fair and large, and wherein his Soul delighted to dwell, are in imminent danger of being made waſte and deſolate. Alaſs! the fires of Swenkfieldianiſm, Famdiſm, Antinomianiſm, Lutheraniſm, Calviniſm, Super-Ordinanciſm, with the ſparks of Quaking and Ranting, were, and are, but as <hi>ignes lambentes,</hi> fires running up and down and licking only the outſide
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:166777:28"/>
of the houſe, without kindling upon, or burning any the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals, or main timber; whereas the fire of <hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi> is like the fire kindled by God himſelf heretofore in <hi>Zion;</hi> the fierceneſs whereof was ſo ſore, that (as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> lamenteth the caſe) <hi>it devoured the Foundations thereof, Lam.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
            <p>And if we diligently conſider the nature of that deſign, the accompliſhing whereof Sathan projecteth by this fire, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably conceive but that it ſhould be very ſubtil and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating (in its kind) I mean very apt and proper to inſinuate and convey it ſelf into the judgments and conſciences of good men, either leſs knowing, or leſs conſiderate; and yet withall ſo propertied alſo, that perſons who are diligent in the uſe of the touchſtone, and of through judgments, may not feel the leaſt warmth or heat of truth in it. That fire which is to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate between Silver and Silver, between Gold and Gold, had need have ſomewhat more then ordinary fire, in it. And when <hi>Sathans</hi> device and work is to ſever and divide Saints from Saints, true beleevers from true beleevers, imbodied as cloſe and faſt together as the ſcales of <hi>Leviathan,</hi> the fire whereof he muſt make uſe in the operation, muſt be ſome notion, opinion, or apprehenſion, one or more, ſo calculated and conditioned, that in face it may look like a truth of God, and yet in heart be far otherwiſe. For by means of ſuch a compoſition or conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution as this, it is apt to take good people of lighter and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er judgments, and leſs conſiderate, and to leave thoſe of ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and more inquiring: and thus the operation is finiſhed, and the ſeparation wrought. For there is ſcarce any Church or congregation of Beleevers, but is compounded of theſe two ſorts of perſons; ſome who are more credulous, and more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be taken with appearances; others, who are more jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of faces, and who muſt ſee, a ſound bottom, before they approve, or commend tops. Now the Doctrine or opinion (with the concurrent practiſe) imbraced by thoſe, who are beſt known from others by the Name of Anabaptiſts (I intend no reflection in the term, nor any avouchment of the propriety of it, in reference to thoſe meant by it, but meerly deſignation) is of that calculation we ſpeak of: it hath a face or ſhew, both of truth, and Godlineſs; but it hath an heart of error, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs. By means of the former it captivateth one ſort of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:166777:28"/>
men: by means of the latter, it alienateth the judgments and affections of others from it.</p>
            <p>I know not (good Reader) whether thou haſt taken any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice either of the Fourty Queries about Church-communion and Baptiſm (ſome while ſince publiſhed) or of the Anſwer (ſo called) to them, publiſhed more lately. I judg it not worth, either mine, or any other mans pains, to make an Anti-anſwer, or juſt reply. Heaving at a feather is too child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh a poſture for a man. Something may be ſaid in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a fair face, although the heart relating to it be never ſo foul and bad. My Antiqueriſt is a man of parts and worth, in his ſphere: but what the word of God, and evidence of truth make crooked, what parts or abilities of man are able to make ſtreight? I ſhall, upon occaſion of the ſubject diſcourſed in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of theſe papers, here only ſay this (giving in withal a ſmall firſt-fruits of an account for ſuch my belief) that I verily beleeve that there is nothing anſwered to any one of the ſaid Fourty Queries, but what is defective, either in point of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, or of truth, or at leaſt of proof. The grounds of my Faith in this kind, are partly the nature and import of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; partly the tenor and ſubſtance of ſuch of the Anſwers, which I have had time to weigh and conſider.</p>
            <p>For the former; If I ſhould propoſe ſuch a queſtion, the tenor whereof ſhould import, that I verily beleeve the Sun to be up at noon day, or, that the body ought not to be ſacrificed upon the ſervice of the ſhadow, or the rayment belonging to it, or the like; could I expect, or think, that he who ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in Anſwer to ſuch my Queſtions, to overthrow my belief imported in either, could alledg or inſiſt upon any thing, but which of neceſſity muſt be, either impertinent, or untrue (if not both) or if neither, yet uncertain; which in cloſe diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, eſpecially if the degree of uncertainty be any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, amounts to little more, then to that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true.</p>
            <p>For the latter; becauſe I would not be thought to ſeek out my Antigoniſt, where poſſibly he may be more obnoxious, or weak, I ſhall give a brief account of his weakneſs in the beſt of his ſtrength; for I preſume that if he be ſtronger then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any where, it is in the front of his battail, and in his formoſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:166777:29"/>
Anſwers. Therefore let us (in a word) ſee whether the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both of his firſt and ſecond Anſwers, be not leſs either in pertinency (as hath been ſaid) or in Truth (if not in both,) or leaſt in proof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In his Anſwer to the firſt Query, he layeth for one ground hereof, that which is the matter of queſtion between him, and his Queriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Conſtituting of Churches without Baptiſm is a corrupt practiſe;</hi> 2. That <hi>Infant-ſprinkling is a corrupt prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi> alſo. Now what an impertinency is it in arguing, to aſſert that without proof, which is denyed by the adverſe party (and that in the Queſtion it ſelf under debate,) and withall to build the proceſs of the diſpute upon it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. He layeth this for another ground of his Anſwer; that <hi>there was no ſuch practiſe, as either conſtituting of Churches without Baptiſm, or ſprinkling of Infants, on foot in the world, till after all the Books of the Holy Scriptures were finiſhed.</hi> This likewiſe he affirms without all proof, notwithſtanding he well knows that the ſence of his Queriſt ſtands to the contrary. This is of the ſame houſe and lineage of impertinency with the former.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He builds another ſtrein of his Anſwer upon this ground; that <hi>the Queriſt hath diſclaimed communion with the Church of Rome, and the Parochial Churches in England;</hi> and this upon this ground, <hi>becauſe there is no example in Scripture for ſuch Church-Conſtitution, as that of Rome and England is.</hi> Here are more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths then one, un eſs a very improper conſtruction of the phraſe, <hi>diſclaim communion,</hi> contracts the number. For I never <hi>diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed communion</hi> with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> more then I have done with the Church of <hi>Mahomet:</hi> nor had I ever occaſion to do the one, more then the other. But the Grand untruth here is, that I ſhould have diſclaimed communion with theſe Churches, becauſe there is no example in Scripture of ſuch <hi>Church-Conſtitutions</hi> &amp;c. my Anti queriſt is very much miſtaken in this: for I <hi>diſclaim</hi> no action whatſoever upon this account, becauſe there is no example of this action in the Scripture; as neither do I perform any action, ſimply becauſe there is an example of ſuch an action here. But the adequate ground of my <hi>diſclaiming</hi> any action (and ſo of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with any Church whatſoever) is, that I find no ſufficient ground in the Scriptures for my doing it. But I may (and do) find ſufficient grounds in the Scripture for my doing of many
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:166777:29"/>
things, of which I find here no examples. However, upon this miſtaken ground of my diſclaiming communion with theſe two Churches, he goeth on his way merrily, and builds as ſecurely, as he that miſtakes the ſand for a rock.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He advanceth ſuppoſing yet further, that I hold <hi>communion with Churches built upon Infant-Baptiſm.</hi> Surely here is a pair of miſtakes: one, about his own; another, about my practiſe. For, 1. Himſelf diſclaims communion with thoſe Societies of Saints, which here he calls, <hi>Churches,</hi> meerly upon this account, becauſe they are no <hi>Churches.</hi> 2. Whereas he chargeth me with <hi>holding cammunion with Churches built upon Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> the truth is, that I hold no communion with ſuch <hi>Churches;</hi> nor do I know any <hi>Church,</hi> one or other, <hi>built</hi> upon any <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> whether <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> or <hi>Beleever-Baptiſm.</hi> The <hi>Churches</hi> with which I hold communion, are <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ILT upon the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner ſtone, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Neither is it at all pertinent to the buſineſs before him, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Queriſt, or others, that <hi>there is example in abundance in Scripture of Churches of a better Conſtitution,</hi> [he means, then of Churches <hi>built upon Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> ſuch as he ſuppoſeth I hold communion with,] and that this is, <hi>of Saints baptized after they had beleeved.</hi> We do not beleeve that Baptiſm, whenſoever, or howſoever adminiſtred, is any part of, or ingredient into, a Churches conſtitution, more then the Goſpel it ſelf, or the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereof, or the ſervice of the Lords Table. A Church may be of a very ill conſtitution, though all the members of it have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly baptized; and on the contrary of a good and ſound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, though there have been ſome defect or irregularity in their Baptiſm. Baptiſm is extrinſecal to Church-conſtitution, as the waſhing of a mans face or hands is to the conſtitution or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of his natural body.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another miſtaken ground, upon which he builds very high, is, that the Queriſt, and others of his Judgment, <hi>plead the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept oſ circumciſing Infants under the Law, as virtually requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the baptizing of Infants under the Goſpel.</hi> I confeſs if we ſhould plead thus, we ſhould plead much after the rate of thoſe, who plead the unlawfulneſs of Church communion with the Saints, becauſe they jump not in conceit with them in every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:166777:30"/>
about Baptizing. We are far from either ſaying or thinking, that <hi>the precept of circumciſing Infants under the Law, virtually requires the baptizing of them under the Goſpel.</hi> We hold, that had there not been a precept given, in, or under the Goſpel for baptizing, the precept of circumciſing Infants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, could not have juſtified us in our baptizing them under the Goſpel. We do not go about to prove the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (much leſs the neceſſity) of baptizing, from the precept of circumciſing: this is a Grand miſtake in the Antiqueriſt about the ſence of his Adverſaries: but we receiving a precept, from God under the Goſpel for baptizing, without any deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of, or limitation unto, any certain age of the perſons, to be by vertue of this precept baptized, and finding the Councel of God to have pitched upon Infancy, as the moſt meet age for the reception of a former Ordinance of like ſpiritual ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and import with Baptiſm, judg our ſelves bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience rather to be directed to the proper ſubject of Baptiſm by the Councel of God in a caſe of like nature, then to conſult the wiſdoms (or wills rather) of men in the buſineſs. This conſidered,</p>
            <p n="7">7. How, not impertinent only, but importune and unſave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is that inſultation, <hi>If it be not good reaſoning from circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion to Baptiſm, let the Pedobaptiſts bid adieu to their cauſe of Infant Baptiſm, which is built and bottomed thereupon.</hi> Alas, good man! the cauſe of Pedo-baptiſm is not at all built or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed upon any reaſoning from circumciſion to Baptiſm, but upon the good Word of God it ſelf. Neither have we any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or need, <hi>to bid adieu to this cauſe,</hi> although (to pleaſe our friend the Antiqueriſt) we ſhould take our leaves of our reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ſubject of circumciſion to the more appropriate ſubject of Baptiſm. Yea this our good freind himſelf being ſo well acquainted with us, cannot be ignorant, but that we have many other pillars hewn out of the Rock of the Scriptures, whereon we build our cauſe of Pedo-baptiſm, beſides what we argue from the ſubject of circumciſion. Yea himſelf hath of late been hewing and hacking at ſome of them (whereof notice may be taken in due time) but his attempts againſt them have rather proved them to be ſtrong, then any ways weak.</p>
            <p n="8">8. How impertinently weak is that inſulting demand alſo
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:166777:30"/>
(in the proceſs of this anſwer) <hi>And now which of the horns of this Dolemma will the Pedobaptiſts ſuffer themſelves to be gored by?</hi> Here the Anti-queriſt (it ſeems) turns Queriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But if he hath not an happier ſtroke in Anti-queriſm, then in Queriſm, he had better harken unto the Proverb, <hi>Manum de ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulâ,</hi> and leave his paper as white as he found it. The Pedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts need not fear goaring by either of the horns of his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma:</hi> they ſtand ſo ſtaringly wide, that there is roomth enough and enough for ſeaven men to paſs abreſt between them. For firſt, the mans <hi>Dilemma</hi> taketh it for granted, that <hi>uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed perſons were excluded</hi> [ſurely he means, <hi>always,</hi> not ſometimes, or in ſome caſes only; for this would ſink the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too far beneath his cauſe) <hi>from acts of Church Communion, whilſt circumciſion was in force.</hi> Will he ſay that women were circumciſed? or that they were excluded form acts of Church-communion, becauſe they were uncircumciſed? or that all thoſe, who were not circumciſed in the Wilderneſs, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from all acts of Church communion for Forty Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? 2. The ſaid <hi>Dilemma</hi> very weakly ſuppoſeth, that the Author of it, may from the excluſion of uncircumciſed ones under the Law from acts of Church-communion then, as well argue to the excluſion of unbaptized, or unduly baptized ones under the Goſpel, from Church-communion now, as we reaſon from the ſubject of circumciſion, to the ſubject of Baptiſm. I wonder upon what principle or ground in reaſon ſuch a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or conceit as this ſtandeth. For what the <hi>Antiqueriſt</hi> offereth upon this account, is no better then gibbrich or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence unto me. <hi>For</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>the ſame things have the ſame conſequences; and two things alike, belong to the like reaſon and judgment.</hi> He that either can underſtand theſe topiques, or fit them to his caſe, muſt plough with a ſtronger and nimbler heyfer, then mine. That which I ſuppoſe the man would have, is this (but his demand is moſt unreaſonable and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune) that if Baptiſm ſucceeds circumciſion in one thing, it muſt ſucceed it in another; yea in all things. How empty ſuch a conceit as this is both of reaſon, and of truth, hath been ſhewed in the laſt of our foregoing Conſiderations. And however ſome of us upon occaſion ſometimes ſay, that Baptiſm ſucceeds circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion (which is a truth evident enough, and acknowledged
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:166777:31"/>
ſuch, in ſome reſpects, by one of the Great Apoſtles of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-queriſts Faith in the matter of Baptiſm,) yet have we no need of ſuch a ſaying to ſupport our cauſe of Infant Baptiſm. For the analogy or proportion of reaſon, from whence we argue, that infants may be as well the ſubjects of Baptiſm, as of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, may equally ſtand, whether Baptiſm be looked upon as Succeſſor unto circumciſion, or no.</p>
            <p>But if our good Freinds intellectuals be not too far ſpent with the ſtrength of the Inchantment upon him, but that he yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in ſome competent capacity to receive inſtruction, I ſhall here (once for all) give him an account, why, though it were to be granted (which yet it is not, but only with limitation, as was lately ſhewed) that want of circumciſion did exclude from Church-ſhip under the Law, yet this at no hand proveth, that therefore a defect of, or in, Baptiſm, ſhould do the like under the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Church of God being in the Infancy or nonage of it under the Law, the ſtate and condition of it was more ſervile, then now under the Goſpel. <hi>Now I ſay that the heir as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a ſervant, though he be Lord of all;</hi> But <hi>is under Tutors and Governors, until the time appointed of the Father. Even ſo we when we were children, were in bondage under the Elements of the world. But whtn the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law, To redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of Sons</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 4. 1. 2. 3, &amp;c.</note>. In reſpect of this different State of the Church under the Law, and under the Goſpel, the Churh is not to be looked upon as under a like ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of ſubjection to any carnal Ordinance or Ceremony what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, as it was under the Law. Nor are the external Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Goſpel preſſed upon like terms of peremptorineſs and ſeverity, upon the Saints, as thoſe of the Law were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the carnal Church of the <hi>Jews.</hi> If they were, the two ſo different States of the Church mentioned, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. But ſomewhat to this purpoſe we ſpeak in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations; where we declared, that in the Goſpel, no man is threatened for not being Baptized, Baptiſm being here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned or recommended unto men by way of indulgence, and for their ſpiritual benefit and accommodation, not with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention

on Gods part to render the bare omiſſion of it an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of condemnation againſt any man, much after the manner of the Law of the free-wil offering under the Law. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it was ſaid unto <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning circumciſion, <hi>He that is born in thy houſe, and he that is bought with thy mony muſt needs be circumciſed,</hi> It is no where ſaid unto any perſon in the New Teſtament, ye <hi>muſt needs</hi> be baptized; Yea unto the <hi>Eunuch</hi> requiring Baptiſm, <hi>Philip</hi> anſwered, <hi>If thou beleeveſt with thy whole heart, thou</hi> MAYST, not, <hi>thou</hi> MUST [be baptized.] There is an eye of this Evangelical liberty concerning external obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Inſtitution it ſelf of the other Ordinance alſo, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> recordeth it, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 25. 26. This do ye as oft as ye do it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi> Here is no Injunction of the <hi>Quoties,</hi> but a plain intimation of a liberty touching this; only the manner of the <hi>Toties</hi> is ſtrictly preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: which is the direct calculation, or manner of ſanction of the Inſtitution concerning the free-wil offering under the Law. This kind of offering was impoſed upon no man, as of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: only the terms of the oblation of it, when offered, are ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſcribed. See <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. 2, 3, &amp;c. and again, <hi>Levit.</hi> 22. 18. 19. 20, &amp;c. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning Circumciſion, there never was any queſtion among the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor indeed any place or occaſion for a queſtion, either whether it was commanded by God, or no, or whether the practiſe of it was to continue till the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or no; no nor yet concerning the due mode or manner of its adminiſtration. So that whoſoever refuſed to ſubmit to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, during the reign of it, did <hi>ipſo facto</hi> and without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, openly manifeſt, yea profeſs diſobedience to God in an expreſs command. Whereas the Anti-queriſt well knoweth, that amongſt the Saints and ſervants of God themſelves, and perſons as tender conſcienced, of as rich an obediential frame of heart towards God, as himſelf, or the beſt of his late-born perſwaſion, there are many ſcruples, queſtions, and caſes of conſcience about Baptiſm; ſome being unſatisfied whether there be any command of God, or of Chriſt, in the Goſpel, requiring ſubjection of any perſon in theſe days, unto ſuch a thing; others, ohether the mind and pleaſure of God be, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:166777:32"/>
the ordinary and ſtanding adminiſtration of it ſhould be made to Infants, or perſons of mature years; others again, whether the adminiſtration of it may not with as good, or better accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, be made by ſprinkling, or pouring water on the baptized, as by dowzing or dipping (beſides ſeveral others of like nature.) And ſuch queſtions and diſſatisfactions amongſt holy, humble, grave and ſober <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as theſe, undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſhew and prove, that the mind and will of God t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uching theſe particulars, is very ſparingly, obſcurely, and with much ſcantneſs of diſcovery, delivered in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The premiſes conſidered, the caſe muſt needs become plain, why, though it ſhould be granted that circumciſion was made by God a neceſſary condition of Church-ſhip under the Law, yet this no ways proveth, that he hath made Baptiſm, eſpecially in any particular mode of its adminiſtration, a like condition of Church-memberſhip under the Goſpel. If God ſhould have intended Baptiſm (as ſome men count Baptiſm) for a neceſſary requiſite, or ingredient into Churchſhip under the Goſpel, he ſhould have made a Law for the inchurching of his Saints, which would have excluded the far greateſt (yea and beſt) part of them from all part and fellowſhip in that gracious accommodation; and which would have brought in an Heterogeneal generation of vain and looſe perſons, in their ſtead; as now the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs conceit of ſuch a Law doth amongſt us. Nor can any man tolerably imagin, had the precept of God concerning circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion under the Law, been like to have occaſioned as many doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſputations amongſt the beſt of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, as he knew the ſignification of his mind concerning Baptiſm in the Goſpel, would occaſion and raiſe amongſt the beſt of his Saints, that he would ever have regulated Church-fellowſhip amongſt them by circumciſion. Yea,</p>
            <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) the Regulation of Church-communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Levitical Law by circumciſion (upon the terms, and with the limitations formerly ſpecified) is ſo far from being ſo much as a probable argument, that Church-communion ſhould be intended by God to be regulated by Baptiſm under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that it rather evinceth the quite contrary. For as the communion of the Church under the Law, whilſt it [the Church] was yet carnal, and ſervile, in the Infancy or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:166777:32"/>
of it, was regulated by a Rule or Law ſuitable to the ſtate and condition of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> by a Law of a carnal Ordinance; ſo is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to conceive, that the Church under the Goſpel being <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual (1 Pet.</hi> 2. 5.) and of mature growth, the Communion thereof ſhould be regulated by a Law or Rule agreeable to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and ſtate hereof, and which requireth, and conſiſeth in, ſomewhat that is more ſpiritual, and not by Baptiſm, which is a <hi>carnal Ceremony</hi> (ſo acknowledged by the Greateſt Maſters themſelves of the way called <hi>Anabaptiſm)</hi> as well as Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Thus they who have eyes to ſee, and hearts to underſtand, may clearly enough perceive, that however the ſubject of Baptiſm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel may be rationally calculated by the ſubject of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion under the Law; yet the Regulation of Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion by Circumciſion under the Law, can be no ground of eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating Church fellowſhip by Baptiſm under the Goſpel. We have aſſigned Reaſon upon Reaſon of the difference. And thus having felt and handled the two inſulting horns of the late-threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening <hi>Dilemma;</hi> we find them to be made of brown paper. But (to proceed yet a little further with the Anſwerer in his Anſwer to the firſt Query)</p>
            <p n="9">9. Another ground whereon he builds, is, that <hi>the Scripture is every whit as expreſs; for Baptiſm, to precede the enjoyment of Church priviledges, as it is for a voluntary conſenting to Church Order and Government, to precede the ſame enjoyment.</hi> But how impertinently to his Cauſe, and with how little proof, is this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed? Firſt, If by, <hi>Church-priviledges,</hi> he means, all <hi>Church-priviledges,</hi> how can the Scripture be expreſs for Baptiſm to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the enjoyment of them, when as it ſelf is one of theſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; and (doubtleſs according to his ſence) one of the greateſt of them? Is the Scripture expreſs for any thing to precede the enjoyment of it ſelf? If by, <hi>Church-priviledges,</hi> he means, ſome of theſe <hi>priviledges,</hi> when he hath ſpecified which he means, we ſhall conſider further of his aſſertion. But,</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Scripture</hi> may be <hi>expreſs</hi> enough <hi>for Baptiſm to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the enjoyment</hi> he ſpeaks of, <hi>[i. e.</hi> that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> did ſometimes precede this enjoyment, and may precede it ſtill, yea and haply that in ſome caſes it ought to precede it,] and yet be neither <hi>expreſs,</hi> nor virtual or implicit, for the abſolute or univerſal neceſsity of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:166777:33"/>
ſuch a precedure, which is the point wherewith the Query before him pincheth him.</p>
            <p>3. (And laſtly) The Scripture may be as <hi>expreſs</hi> for what he ſaith it is, as for a <hi>voluntary conſenting to Church Order,</hi> &amp;c. and yet be neither expreſs, nor yet virtual or conſequential, for it. For the Truth is, that the Scripture is not expreſs for the ſaid <hi>conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> only ſome of us judg it meet to deſire ſuch a conſent of thoſe, whom we judg otherwiſe meet to admit into Communion with us in Church-priviledges, to prevent ſome grand inconveniences, which it is not pertinent here to ſpecifie; although the ſence of others of us is otherwiſe in the caſe. And,</p>
            <p n="10">10. How impertinent to his Cauſe is this reaſoning: <hi>If one perſon may be admitted upon ſuch terms,</hi> [he means, to Church-priviledges without Baptiſm,] <hi>then why not two? if twe, why not ten, and ſo an hundred, or a thouſand? and conſequently ſuch Goſpel Order layd totally aſide?</hi> If an hundred, or a thouſand, or ten thouſands, ſhould be admitted to Church-priviledges upon a manifeſtation of their Faith (which may be otherways, and to far better ſatisfaction, done, then by a being Baptized) with an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all others, who are able to give no ſuch account of a work of Faith in them, would this be a total laying aſide of Goſpel Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? Good Reader, conſider and judg.</p>
            <p n="11">11. He affirms, that <hi>thoſe Precepts, Exhortations, or Doctrines by which men ſtand enjoyned to obſerve Goſpel Order, do virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prohibit men Baptized communion with unbaptized in Church-fellowſhip, as that which is contrary thereunto.</hi> But at what a diſtance do his Proofs ſtand from his Poſition, as if they were meer ſtrangers to it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. His firſt Proof is built upon a clear miſtake of the word, <hi>Teach, Go and teach All Nations, Mat.</hi> 28. 19. (and indeed upon a miſunderſtanding of the whole Verſe.) For <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to teach, doth not ſignifie <hi>to teach men ſo, as to make them willing to obey the Goſpel,</hi> [which ſence notwithſtanding bears the whole bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of his firſt Proof of the ſaid Poſition:] this ſence of the word was (I beleeve) never heard of from any Author that hath written in the Greek Tongue; and however, cannot be the ſence of it here (as will appear preſently:) but the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, properly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to inſtruct or teach; or (which is the ſame) to do that, which is apt and proper to make a Diſciple, one or more, whether
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:166777:33"/>
any perſon be actually, or by way of event or ſucceſs, made a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple, or no. And that this was the proper and only ſence of the word intended by the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> here, is evident; becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, 1. He muſt be conceived to give a Commiſſion or Charge to men to do that, which was not in their power to do, as <hi>viz.</hi> actually to regenerate, or convert men to the Faith, &amp;c. 2. It would follow, that although the Apoſtles ſhould have taught and preached the Goſpel with never ſo much faithfulneſs, yet they had falſified the Truſt repoſed in them by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and acted ſhort of their Commiſſion, if they did not at all times when they preached, make thoſe, to whom they preached, actual Beleevers. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, how impertinent and inſulſe is that conceit, that an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction to baptize is therefore put by a participle of the preſent tenſe,</hi> Teach all Nations, baptizing them <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to imply, that they were <hi>preſently</hi> to baptize men <hi>upon their being taught.</hi> If this were ſo, all perſons whatſoever, to whom the Goſpel was at any time preached by the Apoſtles, were, upon their bare hearing of it, and whether they beleeved, or blaſphemed, to have been <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> by them. And if there be any ſence at all in theſe words, <hi>as all examples of that nature in the Acts of the Apoſtles do declare,</hi> how loud an untruth is it. There is not ſo much as any one <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> throughout the Acts of the Apoſtles, of a perſon baptized barely or meerly upon his hearing of the Goſpel preached unto him. But how impertinently this piece of Scripture is alledged, either to prove who, or what kind of perſon, is the proper and adequate ſubject of Baptiſm; or a neceſsitie that all beleevers to the Worlds end, ſhould be baptized, or otherwiſe be guilty of Sin, hath been argued in the preceding Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How little truth, or pertinency there is in his ſecond Proof of the aforeſaid Poſition, ſufficiently appears by the examination of the firſt. For though <hi>the Apoſtles did put the ſaid Commiſſion of Chriſt into execution according to his Command, i. e.</hi> did both <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>baptize,</hi> yet it doth not follow from hence, either, 1. That they <hi>baptized</hi> all that they taught, (the contrary hereunto is evident from the Story, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41, 43. and 5. 33. and other places) Therefore the <hi>Teaching</hi> mentioned in their Commiſsion, was not the Rule of their Baptizing. Nor, 2. Doth it follow, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe upon their firſt preaching of the Goſpel in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they baptized thoſe <hi>who gladly received their Word,</hi> and beleeved,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:166777:34"/>
therefore they baptized in like manner all thoſe, or any of thoſe, who were converted to the Faith by their after-preaching in the ſame place. We read of no ſuch thing as this in any place of the <hi>Acts,</hi> or elſewhere (as we formerly obſerved.) Nor did the tenor of their Commiſsion impoſe this upon them. For he that is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and only commanded to Teach, and to Baptize, as he is not hereby commanded to <hi>teach</hi> continually, ſo neither is he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>baptize</hi> always when he teacheth. But whereas he demandeth; <hi>What is more plain then that the Commiſſion of Chriſt to them, was to teach and baptize firſt, and to admit into Church-fellowſhip thereupon, as is viſible in that prime example of theirs,</hi> Acts 2. 41, 42. I anſwer, This is much more plain, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were not commiſsioned in that Commiſsion we ſpeak of, <hi>to admit into Church-fellowſhip,</hi> either upon terms of Baptiſm, or any other, there being not ſo much as the leaſt mention or hint here about admiſsion into Church-fellowſhip. Nor is it ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41, 42. either that the Apoſtles admitted any into Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; or 3. That any were admitted into Church-fellowſhip, much leſs that they were admitted into this fellowſhip, becauſe they had been baptized; But all that is here ſaid (as to the point now in hand) is: <hi>Then they that gladly received his Word, were baptized, and the ſame day</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. <hi>there were added,</hi> or added to [not, <hi>to them,</hi> as our Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt emphaſeth, or, to the Church, but rather, <hi>to the Lord,</hi> as it is, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 24] <hi>about three thouſand Souls.</hi> Neither is the <hi>addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> here ſpoken of, aſcribed to the Apoſtles: it is not ſaid, that they, or any of them, <hi>added</hi> ſo much as one Soul. But if we will entitle him unto the <hi>addition</hi> here ſpoken of, to whom the Holy Ghoſt aſcribeth it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 47. we muſt ſay, that it was made by the Lord; <hi>And the Lord added unto the Church dayly ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> Here, where there is expreſs mention made of <hi>adding to the Church,</hi> there is no mention made of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His third and laſt Proof is as irrelative to his purpoſe, as both the former. For Chriſtians are not ſaid <hi>(Rom.</hi> 65.) to be <hi>planted together in</hi> [it is not, <hi>into,</hi> as our Anti-queriſt takes a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy liberty, both here, and elſewhere more then once or twice, to miſ-cite his Scriptures] <hi>the likeneſs of Chriſts death,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or means, of their Water-Baptiſm; for then it would follow (from the latter clauſe of the Verſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:166777:34"/>
that all who are thus baptized, ſhould be everlaſtingly Partakers of his <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> but we are ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>complanted</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in, through, or by means of, a likeneſs of his death, when we are truly and really mortified, and become dead unto ſin, and to the world: Which is a kind of death holding ſome analogy with, and carrying in it ſome reſemblance of, that death which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffered upon the Croſs. And the Apoſtle informs us, that by ſuch a death as this, we become <hi>planted together with Chriſt, i. e.</hi> intereſted with him in that moſt ſtable, fixed, and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Councel and Purpoſe of God, wherein he hath decreed the immortal Glory and Bleſſedneſs of all thoſe that ſhall obey him. This ſence of the place conſidered, how frivolous and impertinent is this ſupercilious Interrogatory, which he builds upon it? <hi>And may you not therefore as well ſuppoſe trees to grow together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are planted together, as to ſuppoſe Chriſtians to grow together before they are planted together?</hi> Yes ſurely, as well the latter, as the former: but the miſchief of the impertinency is; that Chriſtians may be <hi>planted</hi> together in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by a work of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and ſo grow together, whether they be baptized, or no: and they may be baptized together, and ſo be planted together as far as water can plant them, and yet not grow together; but ſome wither and dye, whileſt others grow and proſper. Or however, ſuch a <hi>plantation</hi> which is by Baptiſm only, is no way, or means, of <hi>growth</hi> unto any man. And yet of the two, it is a broader impertinency, to make this demand, in ſtead of a Proof that a Church cannot ſtand but upon Baptiſm, <hi>And what houſe ſtands without its principles, or is built without a foundation,</hi> only upon occaſion of this admonition of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews; Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Word of the beginning of Christ, let us advance towards perfection;</hi> and his making, not the practiſe, but <hi>the Doctrine,</hi> not of any one <hi>Baptiſm</hi> determinately, but of <hi>Baptiſms</hi> (plurally) a part of the <hi>foundation; i. e.</hi> of the body or ſyſteme of that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which young beginners in the School of <hi>Christ</hi> were wont to learn in the firſt place, as in building a foundation is firſt to be layd in order to a ſuperſtruction. But what is there in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, to prove that one <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> or one kind of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is the foundation of a Church, more then another? or that any kind of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> more then <hi>impoſition of hands?</hi> or that either <hi>impoſition of hands,</hi> or <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in one kind or other, more then <hi>repentance
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:166777:35"/>
from dead works,</hi> or <hi>Faith towards God;</hi> eſpecially conſidering that theſe two are named in the firſt place, as the principal parts of the Foundation he ſpeaks of, and firſt to be layd? Yea ſuppoſing that the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to whom he writes, were a conſtituted Church, and that he had taught them <hi>the Doctrine of Baptiſms</hi> under this Conſtitution, it evidently follows, either that they were a Church before they were baptized, or that they had been baptized before they had been inſtructed in the Doctrine of <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> I beleeve it is much harder for the Anti-queriſt to eſcape <hi>goaring</hi> (as he calls it) by one or other of the <hi>horns</hi> of this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> then we found it to make an eſcape from both the <hi>horns of that Dilemma,</hi> which was prepared by him to do the miſchief.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Concerning the Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. where the Apoſtle ſaith, not as our Anti-queriſt citeth the words ſhorter by the head, that <hi>they were all baptized into one Body;</hi> but, <hi>BY ONE SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT they were all baptized, &amp;c.</hi> this Scripture (I ſay) we argued ſomewhat at large in the laſt of our Conſiderations; and found war in the heart of it againſt Church-conſtitution by Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. And running is no poſture for repetitions. Only whereas my Friend the <hi>Anti-queriſt</hi> challengeth me that ſome while ſince I interpreted this Scripture comportingly with his notion; the truth is, that I do not find ſuch a line in any fragment of the hiſtory of my life extant at preſent in my memory; yet becauſe I dayly find ſo little ſtedfaſtneſs in my memory, as I do, I had rather in the buſineſs truſt my Friend and his memory, then mine own.

But they rather chuſe to be Prieſts of that Order, whoſe Hierourgy or Prieſtly Function mainly ſtands in ſacrificing the body upon the ſervice of the rayment, or the ſubſtance, upon the ſervice of the ſhadow.</p>

For if we may take liberty to caſt away one Law of Goſpel Order, and Worſhip, then why not two, and ſo three, and in the end, all? &amp;c.</hi> For doth he not here ſuppoſe, that ſeparating from Churches, or perſons, unbaptized (though eſteemed in the world, and by all but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his, baptized) is or was, a <hi>Law of Goſpel Order, binding Chriſtians of the firſt age?</hi> Surely this <hi>Law</hi> is written on the back-ſide of ſome of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, where no man did ever read it. And they that <hi>take liberty to caſt away this Law,</hi> are more like to bid <hi>all Goſpel obligations,</hi> welcome, then to bid them <hi>farewel.</hi> Secondly he ſuppoſeth that <hi>thoſe rules, by which the Apoſtles ordered themſelves in their times, were binding to Chriſtians of that age;</hi> which is broadly importune and truth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. For the truth is, that no <hi>rule</hi> whatſoever, by which the <hi>Apoſtles ordered themſelves,</hi> as Apoſtles (and certainly they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:166777:36"/>
               <hi>ordered themſelves</hi> by many ſuch <hi>rules</hi> as theſe) was <hi>binding unto</hi> any other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> of that age, but unto themſelves only. Thirdly (and laſtly) he ſuppoſeth it a grand abſurdity, and tending to a diſſolution of all Goſpel Order, to imagin, that there were any <hi>Goſpel rules binding only to Chriſtians of the firſt age of the Goſpel.</hi> Doth he think, that when <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the <hi>age</hi> he ſpeaks of, <hi>ſold their poſſeſſions, lands, and houſes, and brought the prices of them, and laid them down at the Apoſtles feet,</hi> they did this irregularly, or without <hi>rule?</hi> or without a <hi>rule binding</hi> unto them? If this latter, then it follows, that either <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, or his Apoſtles, preſcribed ſome <hi>rules,</hi> which were not <hi>binding,</hi> no not unto <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of this <hi>firſt age?</hi> Or doth he think that that <hi>rule,</hi> by which thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the caſe ſpecified, is <hi>binding unto us now?</hi> Yet that <hi>Rule</hi> reſpected charity, and ſelf-denial; and ſo in reaſon ſhould be more <hi>binding</hi> unto us now, then <hi>rules</hi> reſpecting only an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rite or ceremony. Again it was a <hi>rule binding</hi> unto thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> he ſpeaks of, that their <hi>women praying or propheſying,</hi> ſhould have their <hi>head covered,</hi> and that men on the contrary ſhould have their heads <hi>uncovered.</hi> Doth he judge this <hi>rule binding</hi> unto us now? Or do all men ſin who <hi>Propheſy [i. e.</hi> joyn with him that preahcheth the Word, in the act of hearing] with their <hi>heads covered?</hi> I beleeve there are many who ſhould ſin much more, if they ſhould Prophecy with their <hi>heads un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;</hi> viz. all thoſe who by reaſon of weakneſs or tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are like to ſuffer in their healths, if they ſhould ſit uncover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for an hour or two together, in a cold place and cold ſeaſon. There is the ſame confideration of a froſty-dipping to perſons that are valetudinary, of a crazy and infirm conſtitution, though it were ſuppoſed that there was a rule <hi>binding Chriſtians</hi> of that age, and of thoſe warm Countries, to dip at all times imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon their beleeving. Inſtance might be given in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other <hi>Goſpel rules,</hi> which were <hi>binding</hi> unto <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the firſt age, at leaſt unto thoſe particular <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to whom they were preſcribed, and yet are not ſo <hi>unto us now.</hi> The rule which preſcribed the <hi>Holy kiſs,</hi> which preſcribed the <hi>ſpeaking in an</hi> unknown <hi>tongue by two, or at the moſt by three, (1 Cor.</hi> 14. 27.) which preſcribed the holding of the peace to him that was ſpeaking in the Church, in caſe any thing were revealed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:166777:36"/>
unto another, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 30.) which preſcribed <hi>abſtaining from meat offered to Idols,</hi> and <hi>from blood, &amp;c.</hi> were <hi>binding</hi> unto thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the firſt age, to whom they were given; but are they all <hi>binding</hi> unto us now? Or in caſe they were all now <hi>bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but one or more of them not ſo apprehended by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now, and upon this account not obſerved by them; doth it follow from hence, that they muſt needs <hi>bid farewell to all Gospel Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations?</hi> If my Anti-queriſt not ſeeing, or minding a Friend of his paſſing by him in the ſtreet, ſhould omit the ſalutations accuſtomed between Friends, doth this tend to the aboliſhing or caſting away all friendly commerce or expreſſions between them otherwiſe? Or in caſe a man gathering his Apples, overlooks one that is more covered with leaves or boughs, then the reſt, and ſo leaveth it ungathered, doth he hereby either diſpoſe, tempt, or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, either himſelf, or others, never to gather Apple more? What frivolous and empty reaſonings are theſe? Let me here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this one thing more. The Apoſtles were not ſo uniform in impoſing Ordinances upon Churches in their days, but that what upon occaſion they impoſed upon one, ſometimes they relaxed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another. They impoſed abſtinence <hi>from meats offered to Idols,</hi> and ſo <hi>from blood,</hi> upon the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſimply and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 29. whereas the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyneth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer abſtinence unto the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> only in the caſe of ſcandal unto weak Brethren, and of encouragement to Idolaters, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8 7, 9, 10. compared with <hi>Chap. 10. 23, 27, 28, &amp;c.</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the latter, he ſeemeth to relax it unto the generality of <hi>Christians</hi> (thoſe haply excepted, to whom it had been enjoyned, together with others lying under the like circumſtantial obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereunto) in that paſſage to <hi>Timothy, 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. where he ſaith, that <hi>every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refuſed, if it be received with thanksgiving;</hi> yea and (which is more conſiderable) maketh it a character of men <hi>giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits, and ſpeaking lyes in hypocriſie,</hi> to <hi>command to abſtain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. Whereas he ſaith, that <hi>it is ſaid in effect</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13, and the <hi>like Scriptures lately quoted</hi> by him, <hi>that all of all ſorts, ranks, and degrees, that were of the Body, were baptized into the Body, &amp;c.</hi> it is indeed ſaid (as we heard) that they were all <hi>by one
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:166777:37"/>
Spirit baptized into one Body.</hi> But how impertinent, yea and voyd of truth is it to aſcribe that unto Water-Baptiſm, which is ſo expreſly attributed by the Apoſtle to a baptizing in, or with, the Spirit? But this Scripture hath been argued more at large.</p>
            <p n="16">16. (And laſtly, for this Anſwer) He ſaith, that <hi>the ſame ground which did ſatisfie Beleevers then</hi> [in the Apoſtles days] <hi>in not joyning in Church fellowſhip with perſons unbaptized, though they did beleeve—will ſerve to ſatisfie baptized Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers now touching the lawfulneſs of the ſame practiſe, which is the will and appointment of Jeſus Chriſt that ſo it ſhould be,</hi> &amp;c. But to how little purpoſe is this ſaid? For, 1. He hath not yet proved (nor I beleeve ever will) that baptized Beleevers in the Apoſtles days did not joyn in Church-fellowſhip with perſons un-baptized, though Beleevers. And how impertinent is it in argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſuppoſe that without proof, which a man knoweth is deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his adverſary? 2. In caſe he had proved, or could prove, ſuch a thing, (I mean, that baptized Beleevers did not joyn in Church-fellowſhip with unbaptized Beleevers,) yet would it not follow from hence, that therefore they did not thus joyn with ſuch upon any ſuch ground as this, <hi>viz. becauſe it was the will and appointment of Ieſus Chriſt that ſo it ſhould be. Chriſtians</hi> in theſe times (as in all other) did, and eſpecially did not, many things, upon other grounds, then this, as <hi>viz</hi> becauſe they have no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, opportunity, or neceſſity to do them. They did not joyn themſelves in a Team with Horſes, or after the manner of Horſes, to draw Carts, or Wains; they did not, at leaſt many of them did not, joyn with Merchants where they lived, in their Adventures by Sea. Did they omit the doing of theſe things (and twenty more like unto them) upon this ground, or motive, becauſe it was <hi>the will and appointment of Ieſus Chriſt that ſo it ſhould be?</hi> How uncouth, ſapleſs, and without ſavor, are ſuch conceits and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as theſe? The baptized Beleevers he ſpeaks of might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly not joyn in Church-fellowſhip with unbaptized Beleevers, only upon this ground; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe no ſuch deſired this fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them. But will <hi>this ground ſerve to ſatisfie baptized Beleevers now touching the lawfulneſs of ſuch a practiſe,</hi> when as there are Beleevers, whom they call unbaptized, who deſire this fellowſhip with them? But it is no great marvel that the Carver, though a good Artiſt, can make no better a <hi>Mercury;</hi> the wood
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:166777:37"/>
he hath to work upon, is not for it. 3. (And laſtly) The non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning of baptized Beleevers in Church-fellowſhip with Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers unbaptized, could it be proved, would <hi>ſerve to ſatisfie bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Beleevers now touching the lawfulneſs of the ſame practiſe.</hi> But not to joyn, and to break off or ſeparate after joyning, are two very different practiſes. That ground which would ſatisfie a beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man or woman for their not joyning in marriagewith an Infidel or Unbeleever; will not ſerve to ſatisfie them touching the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the practiſe of ſeparation from him, or her, after marriage. Therefore my <hi>Anti-queriſt</hi> doth not argue pertinently at this turn neither. He pleads another Cauſe in ſtead of his own.</p>
            <p>For a cloze to what at preſent I reply to his Anſwer given unto my firſt Query, it is very obſervable, that he doth not at all, his long Anſwer throughout, ſo much as touch upon one thing, which the ſaid Query asketh after with as great a deſire of ſatisfaction, as after any thing beſides. The Query thus ſaluteth him: <hi>Whether is there any Precept, or Example, in the Gospel, of any perſon, how duly ſoever baptized, who diſclaimed Chriſtian Communion, either in Church-fellowſhip, or in any the Ordinances of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, with thoſe, whom he judged true Beleevers, upon an account only of their not having been baptized,</hi> ESPECIALLY AFTER SUCH A MANNER, AS HE JUDGED IT NECESSARY FOR THEM TO HAVE BEEN? Theſe laſt words, <hi>eſpecially after ſuch a manner, &amp;c.</hi> which are as emphatical as any other in all the Query, and with which he found his Cauſe harder pinched then with any thing beſides, he prudently diſſembles in his Anſwer, as if they were not. To give a juſt and competent Anſwer to the Query, he ſhould not only have attempted to prove, that there are examples in theGoſpel of baptized perſons, who diſclaimed Church communion with Beleevers upon the only account of their not having been baptized (which indeed he hath attempted, though ſucceſsleſly,) but alſo that they diſclaimed this Communion with them upon the account only of their not having been baptized af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch or ſuch a particular mode, as they judged neceſſary. But ſpeaking neither little nor much to this point, in ſtead of an Anſwer in full to the Query before him, he giveth us an Anſwer that is empty; and which ſpeaketh ſhort to other things, but to that which is moſt material, nothing at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:166777:38"/>
Concerning his Anſwer to the ſecond Query, it is of a like raw <note place="margin">The Anſwer to the ſecond Query, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> ſpinning with the former, and in neither reſpect, either of perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, or of truth, any whit more conſiderable then it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. (To take notice in the beginning of this Anſwer, of the ſame Tergiverſation, which we reſpited to the cloze of the former) He doth his good will to ſay ſomewhat to what he conceived more repliable in the Query; but that which he apprehended (as he had reaſon to do) more intractable, he anſwereth with ſilence, and a prudential ſlip. Yea whereas by tranſcribing ſo much of the <hi>Query,</hi> as he doth, he induceth his Reader to conceive that he preſenteth him with the whole; the truth is, that he wholly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth and keeps out of ſight, that intire clauſe, wherein the Query beareth hardeſt upon him. For theſe words are not extant in his Edition; <hi>Eſpecially in caſe they had been baptized and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly conſecrated by waſhing with water unto the ſervice of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt before.</hi> And as his prudence taught him not to acquaint his Reader that there were any ſuch words in the Query, as theſe, ſo the ſame Guide directed him to undertake ſomewhat elſe, in ſtead of anſwering any thing to the matter contained in them. For had his Anſwer kept way with the demand intended in theſe words, it muſt have proved not ſimply, or only, that the Apoſtles, or <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in their days, denyed Church-communion unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers not baptized, after their beleeving, but unto ſuch Beleevers alſo, who had been ſolemnly conſecrated by waſhing with water unto the ſervice of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> before their beleeving. This he wiſely conſidered was impoſſible for him to do: Therefore he abandoneth it from amongſt his undertakings. In the mean time we are like to have but a lame Anſwer to the Query.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How little ſavor, either of reaſon, or of truth, is there in the very firſt words of this Anſwer! For are they not theſe? <hi>It doth not only appear, that the Apoſtles and other Chriſtians would have declined Church-communion with Beleevers, becauſe not baptized, but it appears that they did do it. For it ſufficiently appears that men and women did beleeve, before they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi> By the way let this be minded; that here alſo he evades and ſlips quire beſides that, which that part of the Query, to which here he pretends an Anſwer, principally demanded. For it is here demanded, not only whether it can be proved, that the Apoſtles, or other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> would have <hi>declined</hi> Church-communion
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:166777:38"/>
with, but further, whether they would have <hi>denied</hi> this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion unto, ſuch perſons, whom they judged true Beleevers, becauſe not baptized. Now the difference between, <hi>declining communion with,</hi> and, <hi>denying communion unto,</hi> is very broad. A man may <hi>decline, i. e.</hi> not do, many things, <hi>[viz.</hi> in caſe he be not requeſted, or deſired to do them] which yet being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, he would not deny to do. The Apoſtles might very poſſibly <hi>decline, i. e.</hi> non-admit unbaptized Beleevers into Church-communion, upon a ſuppoſition that they deſired it not. And yet as poſſibly, nay much more probably, not <hi>deny</hi> this communion unto them, in caſe they had deſired it. But in as much as the Anti-queriſt had not ſo much as in colour what to anſwer to this ſtrein, or touch of the Querie, his prudentials be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended him with this ſtratagem; to leave out thoſe words of the Querie in the tranſcription, wherein this unruly demand was contained. But paſſing by this, how impertinently doth he argue that little which he undertakes, in the words mentioned? For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Suppoſe it ſhould be granted him that the Apoſtles and Chriſtians did decline communion with Beleevers unbaptized, doth it preſently follow, that therefore they declined it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were unbaptized? A man declines ſuch and ſuch meats, which are tender and eaſie of digeſtion: but this prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that their tenderneſs, or eaſineſs of digeſtion is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he declines them. Every quality or property in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is not the reaſon or ground of every thing that is done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, nor yet of the forbearance of every act, that is not acted upon, or about it.</p>
            <p>If my Antiqueriſt demands; But what can reaſonably be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the reaſon or cauſe, why the Apoſtles or others, ſhould decline communion with un-baptized Beleevers, but only their not being baptized; I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That a ſimple <hi>non-admiting</hi> to Communion, can in no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable conſtruction be called, a <hi>declining</hi> of communion, or, of admiting to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion. There be an hundred godly perſons about theCity, whom I do not admit intoChurch communion with me, whoſe communion notwithſtanding I cannot with truth be charged to <hi>decline.</hi> Therefore whilſt my Anti-queriſt only ſhews or proves, that the Apoſtles, or others, did not admit into Church-communion, Beleevers unbaptized, he doth not at all hereby ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie or anſwer theQueſtion propounded: This ſpeaks of <hi>declining</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:166777:39"/>
Communion: he anſwers of not admiting to communion, Here is only a ſtone given, when bread was demanded. Yet,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the queſtion now propounded, I anſwer; The reaſon why the Apoſtles did not admit Beleevers unbaptized into Church-communion (if this either ſhould be granted, or could be proved) is moſt probably this; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe ſuch Beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers deſired it not of them. The Apoſtles were not wont to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit into Church-communion (in that ſence we now ſpeak of admiſſion) any perſon againſt his will, or without his deſire ſignified on ſuch a behalf. If my friendly Antogoniſt here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; but if the primitive Beleevers did not deſire admittance into Church-communion, until they were baptized, why is not this primitive pattern followed now? I anſwer; 1. it is not affirmed, or granted, that they made no ſuch deſire, but only upon ſuppoſition, and for argument ſake. Yet,</p>
            <p>2. The pattern mentioned, is, as far as I underſtand, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally followed in theſe days; no perſon that I know, deſiring Church-communion, but ſuch only, who judg themſelves bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, as the primitive Chriſtians did in their days.</p>
            <p>How untruly he ſaith, that it <hi>appears that the Apoſtles and other Chriſtians did decline Church-communion with Beleevers unbaptized, becauſe unbaptized,</hi> needs no further evidence then the late premiſes. The reaſon which he ſubjoyns, is moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely impertinent. For what though it never ſo <hi>ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears that men and women did beleeve before they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized?</hi> What is there in this to prove, that therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did decline Church-communion with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers unbaptized, becauſe unbaptized. He that can make hand and glove of this reaſon, and that which was to be proved by it, how gladly, were it poſſible, would I exchange underſtandings with him!</p>
            <p>Whereas he demands; <hi>What is a not admiting, leſs, then a refuſing to admit, them to ſuch communion?</hi> I anſwer; that though I cannot tell <hi>what [i. e.</hi> preciſely how much] <hi>leſs it is,</hi> yet this I am certain of (and ſo may any other perſon readily be) that very much <hi>leſs it is.</hi> A non-acting dothnot neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an unwillingneſs to act, but poſſibly a want of an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity only for acting, and ſometimes a want of power. But a <hi>refuſing</hi> to act, always imports a want of will to act.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:166777:39"/>
3. Whereas he turns Queriſt, and demands: <hi>Will it follow, that becauſe theſe external rites, Baptiſm and the like, do not avail unto mens juſtification, when they are obſerved, that therefore they are not neceſſary unto Church-communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer affirmatively, yes, <hi>it will follow,</hi> For if men may be juſtified without Baptiſm; it follows that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and be ſanctified alſo, andconſequently brought into the number of Saints, without it. Now that the will and pleaſure of the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> is, that all Saints without exception, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Baptized or unbaptized, whether convinced of the neceſsity of Baptiſm, orunconvinced, ſhould be <hi>perfected [i. e.</hi> built up to the greateſt meetneſs for their Inheritance in light, that may be] and conſequently admitted into Church-communion, where the beſt means of ſuch an edification are to be found, hath been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently (I truſt) proved in the preceding Conſiderations. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the rite of Circumciſion,</hi> how, and with what limitations it was neceſſary to Church-communion amongſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> as likewiſe how different the Conſideration of circumciſion, and Baptiſm, is, about the Regulation of Church-communion, hath been argued at large already.</p>
            <p>And whereas he demands; <hi>How then can the Queriſt eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the uſefulnes and diſuſefulneſs of Baptiſm as to Church-communion, by circumciſion, as he doth,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Queriſt</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That he is ſo far from doing that, which he is here charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do, that (as he even now intimated) his ſince is, that there is altogether a different conſideration between Circumciſion and Baptiſm, in their reſpective relations to Church-communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Only herein he confeſſeth an agreement between them, that as <hi>that is not circumciſion, which is outward in the fleſh (Rom.</hi> 2. 28. meaning, not the circumciſion which much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth any man unto God) ſo neither is that Baptiſm which is externally adminiſtred and received, the Baptiſm that much intereſſeth any perſon in his favour.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whereas he yet demands, <hi>How the Apoſtles or others Chriſtians in theſe times would have known, or have been able upon good ground to have concluded, that ſuch perſons had truly beleeved in Chriſt unto Juſtification, and had been meet to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to communion with them, who ſhould (if any ſuch had been) have refuſed to obey Chriſt in ſubmitting to Baptiſm, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:166777:40"/>
Whoſoever refuſeth <hi>[i. e.</hi> profeſſedly denyeth] to obey <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not only <hi>in ſubmitting unto Baptiſm,</hi> but in any other of his commands, [being made known to be his unto him] cannot (I ſuppoſe) by any argument or teſtimony whatſoever be concluded to beleeve in <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto juſtification. But this nothing hindereth, but that in caſe any perſon be in the general courſe of his life conſcientious, and obſervant of the Laws of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as far as the knowledg hereof ſhall come to him, he may be upon this account concluded a Beleever unto juſtification, although being ignorant of, or diſſatisfied about, any particular Law of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as ſuppoſe his Law concerning Baptiſm, he ſhould not exhibit obedience unto it. Nor is a refuſal to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto Baptiſm, in theſe days, of a like interpretation with ſuch a refuſal in the days of the Apoſtles: Becauſe then there could be no place for any queſtion or doubt, whether a ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto Baptiſm, at leaſt being required by the Apoſtles, were an act of obedience unto Chriſt, or no; whereas now it is the ſence of ſome worthy <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (I do not ſay it is mine) that a ſubmiſſion unto Baptiſm is rather an act of will-worſhip, then of obedience unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and others are diſſatisfied about the neceſsity of it. Therefore although a refuſing to be baptized then, did argue a <hi>rejection of the Councel of God,</hi> in the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers; yet ſuppoſing that God hath now layd Baptiſm aſide (which is the judgment of thoſe lately mentioned) a refuſing to ſubmit unto it rather argueth an accepting, then a rejecting, of the Councel of God. As the <hi>Jews</hi> who refuſed to ſubmit, unto circumciſion after the Goſpel had been preached unto them, did not herein reject the Councel of God concerning cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but imbrace and accept it; however ſuch a refuſal before would have been a rejection of it.</p>

For whereas the Apoſtle expreſſeth himſelf, thus: <hi>In Jeſus Chriſt neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but</hi> FAITH WHICH WORKETH BY LOVE: And again, <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is nothing, but</hi> THE KEEPING OF THE COMMAND<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS OF GOD; He plainly declares and avoucheth, that

that which is oppoſite to ſuch things which <hi>are nothing, a vail nothing,</hi> (and conſequently, which is ſomewhat, and which highly <hi>availeth)</hi> is not Baptiſm, nor any other external rite or ceremony, but ſuch a thing, which is as contra-diſtinguiſhable againſt theſe, as againſt circumciſion, or uncircumciſion them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, viz. <hi>Faith which worketh by love;</hi> and, <hi>The keeping of the Commandments of God.</hi> Nor doth an <hi>oppoſition</hi> made <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Faith, and Goſpel Ordinances,</hi> any whit more <hi>ſet them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the ears,</hi> then the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> ſets <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> (who were and are, as <hi>good Friends,</hi> as <hi>Faith and Goſpel Rites) together by the ears,</hi> in making this oppoſition between them: <hi>For the Law was given by</hi> MOSES: <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus</hi> CHRIST. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 17. Or then <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt ſet</hi> his Baptiſm, and the Baptiſm of <hi>Chriſt, together by the ears,</hi> by oppoſing them thus: <hi>I indeed have baptized you with water: But He ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire.

He that ſaith, <hi>Luther</hi> was of an active reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and tearing ſpirit, <hi>Melancthon</hi> of a gentle and ſoft, doth not <hi>ſet</hi> theſe good Friends <hi>together by the ears,</hi> but only ſhews wherein, notwithſtanding their agreement as dear Conſorts and Friends, they yet differed the one from the other. There are no two things in the world, but differ in ſomething the one from the other: and conſequently may in reſpect hereof, be oppoſed the one unto the other. Yea though Baptiſm (I mean a ſubmitting unto Baptiſm) be the keeping of a commandment of God; yet may it regularly enough be oppoſed to the keeping of the Commandments of God, as one man may be oppoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many, or the ſetting of a mans foot out of his door, to the performance of a long journey. But theſe things are (I ſuppoſe) a little out of my <hi>Anti-queriſt</hi> his Element.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whereas he demands; <hi>Why doth the Queriſt make cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion a Goſpel rite, which is indeed a rite aboliſhed by the Goſpel?</hi> I may much more honeſtly demand, why doth the <hi>Anti-queriſt</hi> lay to the <hi>Queriſt</hi> charge a thing which he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, no nor yet the words of his <hi>Querie?</hi> For though he ſhould ſay (which yet he doth not, the Anti-queriſt making too bold here, as too frequently elſewhere, to miſ-recite his words, as the Reader may readily obſerve by comparing the Original all along with the tranſcript) that <hi>under the Goſpel
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:166777:41"/>
Circumciſion by a Synechdoche ſpeciei is put for all external rites and ceremonies,</hi> yet doth not ſuch a ſaying as this neceſſarily ſuppoſe, or imply, <hi>circumciſion to be a Goſpel rite.</hi> For <hi>rites,</hi> or ceremonies, being of two kinds, ſome of Divine, others of humane inſtitution, the Apoſtle may by the ſayd figure <hi>Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche,</hi> mention only <hi>circumciſion,</hi> in ſtead of all other Divine rites, without ſuppoſing it to be a <hi>Goſpel rite,</hi> inaſmuch as there were far more rites of Divine inſtitution under the Law, then there are under the Goſpel. His following words, <hi>And if for all kind, then certainly for Goſpel rites and ceremonies; for they are ſome of all,</hi> have neither goodneſs of ſence in them, nor pertinency to his buſineſs in hand. For what though <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion be put for all kinds of rites</hi> [of Divine inſtitution] and conſequently, for <hi>Gospel rites</hi> alſo, yet doth it follow from hence, that it ſelf muſt needs be a Goſpel rite? By what prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in reaſon is this conſequence formed? Suppoſing there are two ſorts of men in the world, rich, and poor, and I, having occaſion to ſpeak of men in general, ſhould, to give ſome light to my diſcourſe, inſtance in <hi>John, Thomas,</hi> or <hi>James,</hi> I ſhould not by my inſtancing <hi>Iohn</hi> (for example) in this caſe, ſuppoſe him to be determinately either a rich man, or a poor. But theſe things (I confeſs) are ſcarce worth the examining, excepting only that me thinks I perceive my Anti-queriſt in a little extaſie of contentment, by vertue of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit he hath that I have ſo ill behaved my ſelf in the paſſage in hand, that he can make large earnings by deſcanting upon it. And I would wilingly awaken him out of his extaſie. For certain I am, that there is nothing in the <hi>Query,</hi> rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but is exception-proof. And the truth is, that all things in his Anſwer to this Query from firſt to laſt, duly conſidered, together with that his contentment mentioned, there ſeems to be a mixture of a kind of diſcontent againſt the Apoſtle for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>new Creature, keeping the Commandments of God,</hi> unto <hi>circumciſion,</hi> and not Baptiſm rather. For if it had been written thus; <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion,</hi> but Baptiſm which is by dipping, or plunging into water, I beleeve he would have been as hard or heavy to be born, <hi>as an hand maid that is heir to her Miſtris: Prov.</hi> 30. 23. And I underſtand that a Great
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:166777:41"/>
Doctor of that way, taking occaſion not long ſince to open the ſaid paſſage of the Apoſtle to his people, made ſpeciall treaſure of this obſervation from it, that although the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That in Christ Ieſus circumciſion availeth nothing,</hi> yet he doth not ſay that Baptiſm availeth nothing. If he had underſtood the Apoſtle (a trouble of mind not much incident to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> generation) he muſt needs have known, that however the Apoſtle did not in ſo many words ſay, <hi>That Baptiſm availeth nothing,</hi> yet conſtructively and in pregnancie and neer-handedneſs of conſequence, he ſaid eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whit as much, yea and ſomewhat more too. For by ſhuting out <hi>Circumciſion</hi> inſtance-wiſe, together with <hi>uncircumciſion,</hi> and letting in onely <hi>Faith, the New creature, the keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God,</hi> it is a plain caſe that together with <hi>circumciſion</hi> he excluded <hi>Baptiſm</hi> alſo, yea and all other ceremoniall practications whatſoever. But ſuch an obſervation as that now ſpecified, is a competent inſtance, or example, whereby to eſtimate how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily the Scriptures are commonly handled in thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. But,</p>
            <p n="6">6. My <hi>Anti-querist</hi> greatneth the pile of his former imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies by heaping all theſe words upon it: <hi>Neither ſurely would any man (much leſs the Querist) be ſo impertinent, as to aſſert no externall rite availeable under the Gospel, becauſe circumciſion is not, unleſs he held circumciſion to be as much a Gospel rite, as any other; ſince it is against common ſence to ſay, That which is greater is not available to ſuch or ſuch an end, becauſe that which is leſs is not; and yet more irrationall would it be to aſſert the non-availeableneſs of that which is, from the non-availeableneſs of that which is not: which yet would be the trip of the Querist, if he ſhould not think that circumciſion had ſome manner of inſtitutive being, yea as eminent a being under the Goſpel, as any other rite of the Goſpel hath.</hi> Hereunto add we this vaine-glorious vapour in the following Paragraph: <hi>Truly I cannot but think that cauſe hard beſted, that is fain to beg its bread out of ſuch deſolate places as is that of Circumciſion for one, whoſe foundation was long ſince raſed by the hand of the Goſpel to the very ground.</hi> The long thread of all this diſcourſe is ſpun of tow that hath touched the fire. The baſis and ground work of the whole Fabrick hath been already, raſed to the very ground. For my friend al along ſuppoſeth, 1. That I make the beſt and moſt conſcientious obſervation of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:166777:42"/>
Goſpel rites, of no acceptation at all with God. 2. That I argue that comparative non-availableneſs of Goſpel rites, which I aſſert and hold, from the non-availableneſs of Circumciſion ſimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. Againſt both theſe I have ſufficiently explained my ſelf already, and likewiſe vindicated the words of the Queree from any intimation or ſuppoſition of either. Touching the former, I ſhall add nothing to the premiſes relating thereunto. For the latter, I have likewiſe ſhewed in as plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> as I know how to write, that neither do I, nor the <hi>Queree,</hi> argue the comparative non-availableneſs of Baptiſm, which the <hi>Queree</hi> onely aſſerteth (as the Anti-queriſt himſelf yeildeth, as we formerly heard) from the non-availableneſs of <hi>Circumciſion</hi> ſimply conſidered (this we have formerly ſhewed to be a palpable miſtake) but from <hi>Circumciſion</hi> conſidered in that oppoſition, which the Apoſtle maketh (in the Scripture before us) between it, and <hi>Faith;</hi> and again, between it, and <hi>the New Creature.</hi> From this oppoſition it evidently appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the Apoſtle by excluding <hi>Circumciſion</hi> (with uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion) from that availableneſs with God, which he ſolely aſcribes unto <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>new creature</hi> and <hi>the keeping the Commandments of God,</hi> intended together with <hi>circumciſion,</hi> to exclude all cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall obſervances, as well thoſe of the Goſpel, as thoſe of the Law. This conſidered, it had been more honour for the <hi>Anti-querist</hi> to have kept himſelf as free from the charge, as the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt is from the <hi>crime</hi> or <hi>trip,</hi> of reaſoning at any ſuch rate of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, at this: <hi>becauſe that which is leſs, is not available to ſuch, or ſuch as end; therefore neither is that which is greater avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hereunto:</hi> Or again, <hi>becauſe that which is not, is not avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; therefore neither is that which is.</hi> How can I but think that my Friend dreamt waking, when ſuch reaſonings as theſe, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to his imagination, as the arguing of his Friend the Queriſt? Either he complements profoundly in his private addreſs by Letter unto him, wherein he pretends to give him the right hand of himſelf in abilities to manage a diſcourſe; or elſe he renders himſelf weak indeed in ſuch affairs, by making himſelf an underling in abilities to a man, the tenour and ſtrain of whoſe reaſonings is ſo far beneath the line of the moſt irrationall of men.</p>
            <p>By this time we ſuppoſe that the <hi>vapour</hi> alſo mentioned is wholly vaniſhed into the ayre. The cauſe he ſpeaks of, cannot well, at leaſt needs not, <hi>beg the bread</hi> of it's ſupport <hi>out of deſolate

But concerning the <hi>place,</hi> which he calls <hi>deſolate,</hi> it hath been proved over and over, that there groweth a ſtrong <hi>ſtaff of bread</hi> for the ſupport of the cauſe depending, in the very midſt of it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And laſtly, whereas he demands; <hi>But why alſo doth the Queriſt oppoſe the rites and ceremonies of the Goſpel, or under the Goſpel, to the keeping the commands of God, &amp;c.</hi> he ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have demanded a reaſon why the Apoſtle doth it. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the Apoſtle, or the <hi>Queriſt,</hi> or both, who makes this oppoſition, a plain reaſon hath been given of it, and the ſenſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared wherein this oppoſition is to be underſtood. Yea I ſuppoſe the Anti-queriſt himſelf can hardly be ſo enormouſly extravagant in his opinion or notion about Baptiſm, as not to judg but that an habituall and conſtant courſe of obedience to the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, doth much more highly commend a perſon unto God, then one ſingle act of an externall ſubmiſſion unto Baptiſm. If ſo, then is there a manifeſt ground for an oppoſition between Baptiſm, and <hi>a keeping of the Commandments of God,</hi> yea though a ſubjection unto Baptiſm be ſuppoſed to be an act of <hi>keeping</hi> one of theſe <hi>Commandments,</hi> yea and available alſo, to a degree, for a commending of men unto God. For as <hi>little</hi> may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry regularly be oppoſed unto <hi>much,</hi> and ſo, <hi>leſs,</hi> unto <hi>more;</hi> ſo may that which is <hi>leſs</hi> acceptable unto God, be very properly, and according to the ſtricteſt rules of oppoſition, be oppoſed unto that which is <hi>more.</hi> Neither is there ſo much as a face, or the lighteſt appearance of <hi>a contra-diction,</hi> between <hi>denying the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ceremonies of the Goſpel to be available</hi> (compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively) <hi>to any mans acceptation with God,</hi> and an affirming <hi>that a keeping the Commands of God is</hi> highly <hi>available to ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi> But enough of this with a ſurpluſſage, formerly.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee plainly, and without a Parable, that no Anſwer hath as yet been given by the Anti-queriſt to the two firſt <hi>Queries,</hi> unleſs by Anſwer we underſtand any thing which he that makes it is pleaſed ſo to cal. Nor is it any diſparagement to any mans abilities or worth, that he isnot able to make an egg ſtand end-ways upon a ſmooth table, without cracking it, though ſuch an undertaking may (I confeſs) ſomewhat reflect upon him. My Friend (my <hi>Anti-queriſt)</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:166777:43"/>
hath ſuſteyned no loſs at all in my eſteem of his parts and abilities, by drawing up ſo inſufficient an anſwer to the Queries, as he hath don. For I well know and conſider how far a miſtaken province will oppreſs, abuſe, and belye any mans learning, knowledg, parts, and abilities whatſoever.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe there is no need of any further ingagement of mine againſt the ſaid Anſwer; the firſt fruits being polluted, the whole Lump is hereby ſufficiently proved to be unclean. Only I ſhall take notice from his Anſwer to the fourth <hi>Query,</hi> how impertinently he citeth (and upon no better account, vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) this of the Apoſtle. (1 <hi>Tim. 6. 1.) Let</hi> As MANY <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as are under the yoke, count their own Maſters worthy of all honour,</hi> to overthrow this aſſertion <hi>of his Queriſt,</hi> that this particle, <hi>as many as,</hi> in ſuch conſtructions as thoſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 27. is always partitive. <hi>When the Apoſtle</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſaith, Let as many ſervants, as are under the yoke, count,</hi> &amp;c. <q rend="margQuotes">doth he thereby ſuppoſe, or imply, that there were ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that were not under the yoke, or who were not to count their Maſters worthy all honour?</q>  Yes (my good friend) the Apoſtle doth here ſuppoſe that there were ſome ſervants not under ſuch <hi>a yoke</hi> as that, whereof he here ſpeaks; as is moſt evident from the oppoſition which he makes in the very nex words, verſe. 2. ſpeaking of ſervants of another kind; <hi>But thoſe who have Beleeving Maſters,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>let them not deſpiſe them,</hi> &amp;c. And the beſt expoſitors general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledg and give notice of a diſtribution or partition of ſervants into two kinds, in this context of Scripture; yet not into two ſuch kinds neither, as my <hi>Antiqueriſt</hi> notioneth in his objection, which he ſo favorably frameth againſt himſelf, that he may plaufibly (at leaſt) anſwer it. Servants are not here diſtributed into beleeving, and unbeleeving; but into ſuch who are <hi>under the yoke,</hi> [viz. of unbeleeving Maſters] and ſuch, who are free from this yoke, as being ſervants to Maſters, who beleeve. Both the one and the other kind of ſervants are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough ſuppoſed by the Apoſtle to be beleevers. Nor was it his manner in any of his Epiſtles, to give directions about the carriage or behavior of Infidels, or to preſcribe matters of duty unto them. How impertinent then is that which he pretends in the anſwer, which he draweth up to his own objection,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:166777:43"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe expreſſions, <hi>as many as,</hi> uſed. <hi>Rom. 6. 3.

For what can be more evident then that the Apoſtle by the particle, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>as manyas,</hi> in the Scriptures before us, did not intend to divide the beleeving members of the Churches of <hi>Rome &amp; Galatia,</hi> from the unbeleeving party of men in theſe places, but only beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers themſelves amongſt themſelves, the baptized, from the un-baptized; conſidering that in the former of the ſaid places, he expreſſeth himſelf thus; <hi>Know ye not that ſo many of</hi> Us <hi>as were baptized into</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c. and in the latter, thus: <hi>For as many of YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> as have been baptized,</hi> &amp;c? Is it worthy any mans belief, that <hi>Paul</hi> writing thus to the beleeving mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church at <hi>Rome, Know ye not that ſo many of us that were baptized,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould either in the pronoun, Us include <hi>Nero,</hi> with all the rabble of pagan Idolater in <hi>Rome,</hi> as if he wrot to theſe, as well as to the Saints or that he intended to ſignifie unto them, that himſelf was one of thoſe, who dwelt in <hi>Rome?</hi> Or is not his meaning in ſaying <hi>ſo many of us as,</hi> &amp;c. clearly this, that as many of <hi>us</hi> Saints, or of <hi>us</hi> beleevers, who have been baptized? For in what other conſideration, rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ion, or reſpect, he ſhould make himſelf one of them, is not eaſie to imagin. Evident it is from Chap. 1. 13. 15. that he was no dweller in <hi>Rome,</hi> at the time of writing this Epiſtle, nor had been any time before. So likewiſe when he writes to the Churches, and members of the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> thus; <hi>For as many of YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> as have been baptized,</hi> &amp;c. can his meaning be, as many of you <hi>who dwell in Galatia,</hi> as have been baptized? Or doth not ſuch a ſence as this plainly imply, that he wrote his Epiſtle aſwel to the Infidels in the Countries of <hi>Galatia,</hi> as to the members of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches there? Therefore (queſtionleſs) the Apoſtles meaning in the words before us, is plainly and directly this: <hi>As many of you,</hi> who being members of the Churches of <hi>Galatia, have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt:</hi> and conſequently the particle <gap reason="foreign">

but of beleevers amongſt themſelves, thoſe that had been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, from thoſe who were at preſent unbaptized, in either place reſpectively. This to be the expreſs ſence of the two paſſages mentioned might be further evidenced by the light of ſundry conſiderations, but that we judge the premiſes alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy levied ſufficient to eſtabliſh that concluſion. It being then ſo clear a caſe, that there were ſome members of Churches in the Apoſtles days, who were unbaptized, at leaſt for a time, it undenyably follows, that Baptiſm is no Conſtitutor of Churches; as the beloved notion of my Anti-queriſt beareth.</p>
