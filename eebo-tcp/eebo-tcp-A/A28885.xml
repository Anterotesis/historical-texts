            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Eſterday being at <hi>Heworth-Moor,</hi> I obſerved one reading ſomething, ſo as I drew neer to him, and by inquiry, I found that it was a Petition that was to be preſented preſently to His Majeſtie; thoſe that heard it read, approved of it: meeting with a friend, I enquired of him if he had not the Petition, or a Copy of it; which he told me he had: I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him that he would lend me it, which accordingly he did; and having read part of it, my Lord <hi>Savill</hi> came with a great company in a furious manner, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what I did there, and told me that I was reading ſome Pamphlet to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that I was labouring to ſow ſome ſeeds of Sedition, to ſeduce the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: whereupon I told him it was a Petition that I was reading privately to my ſelf, which I upon his approach put in my pocket. My Lord <hi>Savill</hi> in an imperious manner demanded of me to deliver it to him, which I refuſed; then his Lordſhip laid his hand on the belt of my ſword, and almoſt pulled me off my horſe, and forced me to deliver the Petition to him, leaſt otherwayes ſome greater miſchief might have come to him; for his Lordſhip told me, If we loved fighting, we ſhould have fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough. I told his Lordſhip, I came this day to labour for peace. And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly before his Lordſhips departure, he told me that he knew me wel enough; then I told his Lordſhip, that I hoped he knew no ill by me: Many that were with his Lordſhip held up their Canes in a terrifying manner; and one of them ſaid, Hold your prating, it were good to Cane you: and when his Lordſhip and the reſt were gone, one of them turned back, and bid me be quiet, or elſe I ſhould be Caned, and ſaid that it were a good deed to put me in the Stocks. Afterwards there was one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain <hi>Blague,</hi> who was one of my Lord <hi>Savills</hi> company, came in an intruding man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner into my companie, and I being diſcourſing with Sir <hi>Rich: Darley</hi> and ſome other; and telling them how I was affronted even now by my Lord <hi>Savill,</hi> and formerly, having fire thrown into my Coach, and ſome other affronts done unto me, which I have formerly told you on; this Captain told me I did ill to lay aſperſions upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Honour: Whereupon I told him I did not lay it upon my Lord, but that I was ſo abuſed and affronted; upon due conſideration, I verily believe hee came to make ſome quarrell.</p>
            <p>Sir, upon my parting from you, you deſired to hear from me; here I thought good to let you know thus much concerning my ſelf. Thus, with my ſervice to you and my Lady, I reſt</p>
