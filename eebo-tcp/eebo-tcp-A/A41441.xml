            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Good Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THou art here preſented
with a <hi>new Book</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Old Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
As therefore thou art not
to expect thy curioſity ſhould here
be gratified with new Notions, (for
I am not deſcribing a new way to
Heaven, but directing thee in the
good old way which the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
have marked out, and which
<pb facs="tcp:61579:3"/>
wiſe and good men have all along
walked in); ſo neither art thou to
think thy ſelf diſappointed, if thou
meeteſt not with a Diſcourſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhly
dreſt up, with all the faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Ornaments of Wit and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
For give me leave to tell
thee, though that would have been
acceptable to the humour of the Age,
and perhaps might without any
great difficulty have been complied
with; yet it would neither have
ſuited ſo well with the nature of the
ſubject I am upon, nor eſpecially
have fitted the perſons for whoſe
ſake this little Book was written.</p>
            <p>That therefore which I here
pretend, and which I hope thou wilt
not fail of in the Papers before
thee, is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> A brief but plain
<pb facs="tcp:61579:3"/>
and ſubſtantial proof of the
grounds and fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Religion in general. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
A diſcovery and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of ſeveral vulgar Opinions,
which deform the beauty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
the efficacy of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in particular. And <hi>laſtly,</hi>
A clear deſcription, a rational de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
and a ſerious inculcation
of the moſt important duties of that
Religion, wherein either the glory
of God, our own comfort, or the
peace and happineſs of Mankind
are principally concerned.</p>
            <p>As for the management of theſe
Points, though I have not given
countenance to this Diſcourſe by
citation of Authors, nor either
adorned the Text with fine Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb facs="tcp:61579:4"/>
nor the Margin with great
Names; yet I hope thou wilt find a
vein of ſound Reaſon in it, and the
ſpirit of the Goſpel running quite
through it. I aſſure thee I have
dealt ſincerely and conſcientiouſly
herein, I have impartially conſulted
the holy Scriptures, I have made uſe
of the beſt underſtanding God hath
given me, and I here ſet before thee
(though not the product, yet) the
reſult of many years obſervation,
conſideration, and experience. And
ſo I leave it to Gods bleſſing, and
thy candid acceptance. <hi>Farewel.</hi>

               <p>By all which, and abundance
of other ſuch like paſſages, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that Religion is as much
our intereſt as our duty; and that
Piety and Care of another World,
are not only the Commands of
God, and his impoſitions upon
us, but the upſhot and reſult of
the beſt and trueſt Wiſdom. For
Wiſdom doth not conſiſt in ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
jealouſies and ſuſpicions, but
in a determinate knowledge and
reſolution what is fit to be done;
not in a ſuperficial ſmattering of
many things, but in a clear and
diſtinct apprehenſion of the juſt
nature, value, and moment of
them; not in an endleſs hunting
after curioſity, but to know
where to ſtick and faſten; not
in pilling a flint, or laborious
beating out of unprofitable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61579:8"/>
but in applying a mans
ſelf to ſuch things as are ſavoury
and uſeful; not in tricks of wit,
ſophiſtry, or eloquence; and leaſt
of all in a jeſt or a repartee;
but to diſcover what is fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
to a mans ſelf as his end
and deſign, and by what means to
attain it; to have great things in
a mans thoughts, and to deſpiſe
and ſcorn little and petty deſigns:
in a word, to ſee a great way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and to be well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the future.</p>
               <p>Now all this is verified in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
more than in any other
thing in the whole World; for
here a mans mind is taken up
with the greateſt thoughts and
ſublimeſt objects, God and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
he takes care to ſecure the
main ſtake, his own Soul; he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
himſelf about things of the
greateſt moment and conſequence;
by inquiring about another
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61579:8"/>
World, he gives proof of the
greateſt foreſight; in conſidering
of it, he gives evidence of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious
temper; in reſolving up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, he ſhews judgment; in
purſuing it by the means appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he demonſtrates the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
he hath over himſelf, and
that he is led by his reaſon, not
ridden by his paſſions; and by
perſevering in this courſe, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
at true tranquillity of mind,
the Crown and Glory of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>Accordingly we find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that commonly where-ever
there is a grave, thoughtful, ſedate,
Perſon, ſuch an one as is either
fit to give or to take advice, he is
ſeldom deſtitute of a ſenſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
But on the contrary,
where-ever you ſee an incogitant
ſhatter-brain'd fellow, that knows
not himſelf enough to make him
modeſt and civil, that hath not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61579:9"/>
ſo much reaſon as to weigh an
argument, nor ſo much Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
as to value any thing but
what is preſent; that is ſo much
under the power of his Senſes, as
ſcarcely to know whether he hath
ſuch a thing as a Spirit within
him, or hath ſo much Drink a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, that his head works
nothing but yeſt and froth; here
is a man cut out to be an Advocate
for Scepticiſm or Atheiſm; this is
the Perſon that will be captious
againſt Religion, and malapert to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God Almighty.</p>
               <p>But let ſuch men enjoy their
humour as long as they can, they
will be ſure ſadly to repent, or
rue it at laſt: and in the mean
time, they only betray their own
ſhame and folly, for their tongue
will prove no ſlander to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
the mighty concern of
which, is not only declared by
God Almighty, confirmed by our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61579:9"/>
own reaſon, and juſtified by our
experience, but alſo affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recommended to us by all wiſe
and good men; by thoſe whoſe
ſagacity and diſcretion is ſuch,
that we have no reaſon to ſuſpect
they are deceived or impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themſelves; and whoſe ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and integrity is ſuch, that
we can as little think they ſhould
have any deſign to impoſe upon
us.</p>
               <p>And therefore thoſe Perſons,
who being either prevailed upon
by the evil examples of the World,
or diſcountenanced by the lewd
ſayings of ſuch as we mentioned
even now, and (declining the
ways of Piety and Devotion)
give themſelves up to a looſe and
irreligious life, are in the firſt
place errant Cowards towards
men, whileſt they are inſolent
towards God: And in the next
place, they are falſe to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61579:10"/>
reaſon of mankind, which
obliges men to provide for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
In the third place, they
are falſe to their own intereſt of
ſelf-preſervation. And laſtly,
they are falſe and ingrateful to
their beſt friends, whoſe counſels
they forſake, and abandon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the conduct of the moſt
ſilly and profligate Wretches.</p>
               <p>But if any ſhall think to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
themſelves from this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
by ſuggeſting, that they
look upon Devotion, as either
the effect of a weak judgment,
or of a melancholy and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
conſtitution. I add, that
this makes the matter ſo much
worſe, as that it involves them,
not only in the guilt of all the
former, but alſo of extream rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and incivility towards the
beſt of men.</p>
               <p>To make all this more clear
and convincing, and to lay the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61579:10"/>
ſurer foundation of all that is to
be ſaid hereafter, we will now in
the next place ſhew the grounds
upon which Religion ſtands.</p>

            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. II. The Reaſonableneſs of Religion in
general.</head>
               <p>THAT which is meant by
Religion (in the general
notion of it) is nothing elſe but a
due regard towards the Divine
Majeſty, a diligent care of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
our ſelves to the ſupreme
Being, the Creator and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the World: Or, which
comes to the ſame effect, the
prudent ordering a mans conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
in this World, ſo that he
may erect his mind with comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
expectations of the favour
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61579:11"/>
of God and happineſs in another
World. Thus much we are
taught by the Author to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bews,
<hi>Chap. 11. 6. He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to God, muſt believe that he is,
and that he is a rewarder of them that
diligently ſeek him;</hi> in which few
words, we may obſerve in the
firſt place the matter or duty of
Religion, expreſt by <hi>diligent ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God;</hi> and ſecondly, the
two Pillars, or (as I may ſay)
Poles of it, namely, 1. the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Being of God, 2. the
expectation of rewards from him;
the former of which moſt properly
contains the firſt riſe and reaſon
of Religion, and the latter the
motives and inducements to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
it.</p>
               <p>If theſe two Pillars be united,
they make ſo firm an arch, that
no objection can ſhake the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but if they be taken and
conſidered ſingly, they are each
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61579:11"/>
of them of mighty ſtrength for the
upholding of Religion.</p>
               <p>§. 2. As for the former, if (I
ſay) we conſider the nature of
God only, that alone is able to
poſſeſs us with an apprehenſion
of the fitneſs and reaſonableneſs
of <hi>diligently ſeeking him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true we cannot ſee the
Divine Majeſty as we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
corporeal objects, becauſe he
is of a ſpiritual nature, and for
the ſame reaſon we cannot ſee our
own Souls. And it is true alſo,
that we cannot fully comprehend
him in our minds neither, becauſe
of his infinite perfections; yet we
cannot ſo much as doubt whether
there be any ſuch Being or no,
if we do but bethink our ſelves
in this one thing, namely, how
we our ſelves came to be? For,
though it may be at the firſt bluſh
of this queſtion, we ſhall think it
ſufficient to ſay, we had our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61579:12"/>
from our immediate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and they in like manner
ſucceſſively from their Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
yet when we proceed on in
our inquiry ſo far as to conſider
and ask our ſelves, what it was
which brought the whole race of
mankind into Being? we ſhall
then find our ſelves forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the hand of God in it.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch as in the firſt place,
it is certain that nothing could
take a beginning without a cauſe,
and in the next place, it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that this thing called man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
could not be the cauſe of it
ſelf, or produce it ſelf; and then to
impute it to chance, or to imagine
that ſuch an excellent Being as
mankind is, wherein there is ſo
much variety of Parts, and yet
order and decency, and in ſhort,
ſo many inſtances of admirable
art and wiſdom in the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
of his Body (ſetting
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61579:12"/>
aſide his mind:) that this, I ſay,
ſhould be the product of blind
chance, is more abſurd than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the former; therefore there
muſt be a God, for none <hi>but a fool
indeed can ſay, There is no God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if we acknowledge a
God, who gave beginning to our
ſelves, and to all other things, we
muſt alſo own him to be eternal,
as being before all things, and
the cauſe of them; and as ſuch,
he muſt needs, not only have in
himſelf eminently all thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
which are to be found
in any part of his workmanſhip,
but be alſo unlimited in his own
perfections.</p>
               <p>And this will inavoidably lead
us to the acknowledgment of all,
or moſt of thoſe Attributes, which
either the Holy Scripture aſcribes
to him, or which Religion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in, namely, that he is a
free Agent, that he is Omnipotent,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61579:13"/>
that he is infinitely wiſe, that he
is juſt, and that he is good, as
will eaſily appear in particular.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He muſt needs be a free
Agent, that is, ſuch an one as
acts not neceſſarily, or that is
bound down by any fatal neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or determined to this or that
act, or object, or meaſure of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by any thing without him,
but wholly follows his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
motion and choice, <hi>the
counſel of his own will;</hi> the reaſon
is plain, becauſe he made things
when nothing was before, and ſo
there could be nothing to bound,
limit, or determine him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He muſt needs be
Powerful or Omnipotent, for the
ſame reaſon, namely, becauſe he
gave being and beginning to
things that were not at all; for
we cannot conceive a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Power, than to bring
ſomething out of nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:61579:13"/>
Thirdly, He muſt be wiſe,
both becauſe we ſee he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
things according to the rules
of exacteſt wiſdom, inſomuch,
that the more we underſtand the
Divine workmanſhip, the more
we admire it; and alſo, becauſe
he hath imprinted ſome image of
of his wiſdom upon our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him juſt, as well becauſe
(by reaſon of his infinite power
and wiſdom) he can have no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ends to biaſs him, as becauſe
he hath alſo made an impreſſion
of juſtice upon our minds.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, He muſt needs be good,
not only becauſe he is wiſe (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid)
but becauſe he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
happy and perfect, and ſo
can fear nothing, can envy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
can need nothing from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Being, but contrariwiſe,
being infinitely full, muſt have a
pleaſure to diffuſe and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61579:14"/>
himſelf to them.</p>
               <p>§. 3. All theſe Doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Deity, flow from that
one perſwaſion, that there is a
God; and the influence of every
of theſe upon Religion, is as
great and apparent as the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of them from the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of ſuch a Being, was
natural and neceſſary: ſo that a
man may with as much reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
any of the aforeſaid Attributes
to belong to the Divine Majeſty,
as (granting them to be in him,
or belong to him) avoid the force
of them upon his conſcience, to
incline him to regard this great
God, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be Religious, which
we will again ſhew particularly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If the Divine Majeſty
be a free Agent, then it is certain
all the good and all the evil which
he doth to us, he doth by choice;
and then we ought to be ſenſible
of our obligations to him for the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61579:14"/>
one, and humble our ſelves to him
under the other. And then alſo,
becauſe we are convinced, <hi>that he
hath mercy on whom he will have
mercy,</hi> we know there is no tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
and dallying with ſuch a
Deity, but we ought to uſe all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
means of propitiating him
towards our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the Divine Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency,
the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of that is, that we fear
him, and truſt in him; for who
is there that thinks of a God that
made him out of nothing, and is
therefore able to deſtroy him, and
reſolve him into nothing again
when he pleaſes, who doth not
think it the higheſt wiſdom in
the World that he ſhouldbe ſubject
to him, pay him all poſſible ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
tremble before him, and
alſo think fit to truſt and rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Almighty Power in all exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
and difficulties?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:61579:15"/>
Thirdly, The Divine Wiſdom
makes our obligations to Religion
yet more ſtrict and cloſe; for it
convinces our reaſon that we
ought to ſubmit to his Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
whatſoever they are, and not
to diſpute his commands, nor
doubt his promiſes, but hold him
in the higheſt veneration and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
that is poſſible for us to
expreſs; to be reverent towards
him upon all occaſions, to ſubmit
our wills to his; and eſpecially in
conſideration that he muſt needs
ſee and take notice of all our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and behaviour, to live with
as much caution in the greateſt
retirement and privacy, as when
we are ſenſible that we are upon
the greateſt Theatre.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The apprehenſion of
the Divine Juſtice and Integrity,
not only aſſures us that he hates
all ſin, but that he hath no reſpect
of Perſons, but will judge the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61579:15"/>
World in righteouſneſs, and then
who will grumble at any of his
Providences, break any of his
Laws, or do any unjuſt and baſe
action, and that becauſe <hi>it is a
fearful thing to fall into the hands of
the living God,</hi> who always can,
and in due time will right him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The conſideration of
Gods goodneſs, and that he is a
Gracious and Benigne Majeſty,
cannot chooſe but mightily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
our hearts with love to him,
and provoke us to ſerve him with
all chearfulneſs; for who that
believes him delighted to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
himſelf to the relief of all
his Creatures, doth not think of
him with pleaſure, and comfort
himſelf in him; or who can find
in his heart to offend and abuſe
him, and not rather repent of all
his former follies and ingratitudes,
and reſolve to ſin no more? For
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61579:16"/>
as the Apoſtle hath ſaid, the
<hi>goodneſs of God leadeth to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that in this one Principle
(the belief that there is a God)
we have a large foundation for
Religion in general, which I
have the rather inſiſted upon
thus particularly, for the ſake of
thoſe who are called, or call
themſelves Theiſts (becauſe they
pretend to be convinced of no
more of the Articles of Religion,
but only of this great point, the
Being of a Deity:) theſe men, I
ſay, if upon that ſingle Principle
they do not live religiouſly, are
either men of no Conſcience, and
then it will be all one what their
Principles are; or are men of no
Principles at all, <hi>i. e.</hi> are Atheiſts
rather than Theiſts, foraſmuch
as by what hath been ſaid, it
is apparent how pregnant that
one Principle is of Virtue and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61579:16"/>
if it be ſincerely believed,
and rightly improved. But ſo
much for that.</p>

            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III. Of the rewards of Religion in
another World.</head>
               <p>LET us now conſider the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Principle of Religion,
<hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>God is a rewarder of
them that diligently ſeek him.</hi>
This (as I intimated before) is
properly the motive or induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the obſervance of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Majeſty; for it hath pleaſed
him to conjoin our intereſt with
his own, and he hath made the
greateſt part of our duty towards
him to conſiſt in ſuch things as
conduce to our own good, as well
as to his glory; and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61579:17"/>
hath laid the foundation of
Religion, by planting in us that
principle of ſelf-love, and ſelf-preſervation,
which is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from our natures, and by
which he works upon us.</p>
               <p>Concerning this point there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the rewards of Religion,
we will firſt conſider the evidence
of it, and when that is clear,
we ſhall eaſily in the ſecond place
be convinced of the efficacy of
it, to the purpoſes of making men
devout.</p>
               <p>The former of the two we
will make way to the diſcovery
of by this train of diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>1. We have ſhewed already
that there is both juſtice and
goodneſs in the Divine Nature,
either of which ſeverally, but
moſt certainly both together in
conjunction, afford ground of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
that he will make a
difference betwixt thoſe that ſerve
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61579:17"/>
him, and thoſe that ſerve him
not. For ſeeing his power and
greatneſs render him a fit object
of Worſhip, and our dependance
upon him as his Creatures, makes
homage due from us to him: and
ſeeing by his infinite Wiſdom,
he muſt needs be ſenſible how
men carry themſelves towards
him; it cannot conſiſt with his
Juſtice to let thoſe eſcape unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
who pay no obſervance
to him; nor ſtand with his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to ſuffer thoſe to be unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
that ſerve and honour
him.</p>
               <p>Indeed it muſt be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that this conſideration of
thoſe Attributes will not amount
to a proof of rewards in another
World, becauſe of that other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
of his, <hi>viz.</hi> the Divine Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
or Freedom, upon account
of which, he cannot be bound to
exerciſe whatſoever act or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61579:18"/>
either of juſtice or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is poſſible; for that would
make him a neceſſary Agent (an
error which ſome men fall into
unawares, whileſt they are in
purſuit of ſome extreams of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions)
it may therefore be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
enough with thoſe Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
(barely conſidered, and
looking no further) that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and puniſh only in this
World: but that which follows
inevitably, is, that ſome ſuch thing
as rewards and puniſhments there
muſt be upon the account of mens
carriage towards him, which is
all I intend hitherto. But then I
ſubjoin.</p>
               <p>2. It is highly reaſonable upon
other accounts, to expect greater
rewards of Virtue and Obedience,
than what uſually befall men in
this World; as alſo ſeverer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Impiety and neglect of
the Divine Majeſty, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61579:18"/>
of the unequal diſtribution
of things in this Life, where <hi>the
race is not always to the ſwift, nor
the battel to the ſtrong,</hi> &amp;c. but
good and bad events happen of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
alike to all; wicked men
are ſometimes proſperous, and
holy men unfortunate and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
by which intricacy of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, the Wiſdom of
God ſeems to lead us into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of another World, where
amends ſhall be made for what is
amiſs here; partly alſo becauſe
the life of men is ſo ſhort, and
they ſo quickly go off the ſtage of
this World, that neither the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of Virtue would be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
nor the puniſhments of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
formidable enough, if they
were no more than what men
could receive or ſuffer in this ſhort
Pilgrimage; but principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the good things of this
World are ſo mean, and empty,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61579:19"/>
and inconſiderable, that they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
no ſatisfaction to the great
mind of a virtuous man. Riches,
and honour, and pleaſure, may
perhaps fill and ſwell up a narrow
ſenſual Soul, but a brave man can
by no means be contented with
them; and therefore it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
unworthy of the greatneſs
and goodneſs of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
to give no better rewards to
thoſe that love and honour him,
than what they are capable of in
this Life.</p>
               <p>3. There is no impoſſibility in
the thing, that there ſhould be
another World beſides this, and
that we ſhould live in it, either
to reap the fruit of our ſerving of
God, or to receive the juſt reward
of our Impiety; all the reaſon of
Mankind, nay all the wit, Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm
and Sophiſtry together, can
find no repugnancy and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in it; and therefore the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61579:19"/>
concern of Religion is not inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.
If there were any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
in it, it muſt lie in
this, that men ſhould live again
after they are dead; but this is ſo
far from implying a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it is not at all difficult
to him that believes an Almighty
Power, which every one muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that owns a God; for
why is it harder to reſtore a man
to life again, than to make him
at firſt out of nothing? ſo that
he relapſes into flat Atheiſm, that
denies the poſſibility of that
which we are now making way
for the belief of.</p>
               <p>4. Nay, I adde further, this
thing is ſo far from being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
or incredible, that the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the nature of our Souls
renders it very probable, and
makes us capable of ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
for it is plain, we have
that in us which doth not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61579:20"/>
depend upon our Bodies, but
our Bodies upon it; that which
gives life and motion to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but receives neither from it;
that which guides, governs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains
and contradicts the Body
when it pleaſes, and which can
act vigorouſly when the other is
weak and languid, as we often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
obſerve the ſtrange efforts
of wit and reaſon, when the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is almoſt worn out and at its
laſt gaſp. This being of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
nature hath no contrary
principles in its conſtitution, by
the conflict of which it ſhould be
brought to diſſolution, as the other
hath. In a word, the Soul hath
life in it ſelf (though not from it
ſelf) and therefore cannot periſh,
unleſs either it ſhould be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to deſert it ſelf, or elſe that
God by his Omnipotency ſhould
oppreſs and deſtroy it; which
laſt thing there is no reaſon to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61579:20"/>
ſuſpect, ſince from the beginning
of the World till now, he hath
not put out of being any thing
that ever he made; and we ſee
in all the changes and revolutions
of things, the leaſt Atom of
matter is not loſt: and can it
then ſeem credible, that a vital
Spirit ſhould utterly be extinct
and periſh when it leaves the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or rather is deſerted by it?
and this will be further confirmed
if we adde</p>
               <p>5. He that made us, hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
ſeveral things upon our
natures which have relation to
another Life, and another World,
and which make it reaſonable for
us to expect it accordingly; ſuch
as not only a deſire to live, which
yet we know we cannot do long
here below, but a ſollicitude what
ſhall come after, an inquiſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and continual thoughtfulneſs
for the future, extending it ſelf
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61579:21"/>
infinitely beyond the ſtage of this
ſhort life; nay, ſome kind of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
notion and anticipation of
another World, which generally
the beſt of men are moſt ſenſible
of, and uſually the more wiſe and
holy any men are, the more they
are under ſuch apprehenſions;
and ſure it would not conſiſt with
the goodneſs of God to permit
ſuch men to be the moſt deluded,
eſpecially he himſelf would not
be guilty of putting a cheat upon
them, which notwithſtanding
muſt be, if there were nothing
at all in it of truth; foraſmuch as
this is not the peculiar phancy
or opinion, either of the ſanguine
or of the melancholy conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but of all the braveſt and
worthieſt men; and this is that
which principally bears them up
in adverſity, and fortifies them
againſt Death, and in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of it, ſometimes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhes
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61579:21"/>
and tranſports them.</p>
               <p>Above all, there is ſuch a thing
as Conſcience, which is common
both to good and bad, and which
chears and animates the one
whenſoever they do virtuouſly,
though no humane Eye be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the action, and when they
expect no benefit of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
in this World: And on
the other ſide terrifies and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frights
the other, <hi>viz.</hi> wicked
men, though no man be privy to
their miſdeeds, and this as it were
binds them over to anſwer for
them another day; now all theſe
things being the hand-writing of
our Creator upon our Souls, are
more than probable Arguments
of another World.</p>
               <p>6. God hath declared there
ſhall be ſuch a ſtate. He that
created Mankind at firſt, hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
them he will revive them
after Death, and reward and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61579:22"/>
them in another World pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
to their carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
himſelf in this. This
comes home to the purpoſe,
whereas all that which hath been
ſaid hitherto (how reaſonable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever)
depends upon the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and fluctuating Diſcourſes of
men, (though it is very true, that
wherever there hath been wiſdom
and virtue in conjunction, they
have ſeldom failed to render this
great point competently clear to
thoſe who had no other light.)
But ſome are more ſtagger'd with
a trifling objection, than convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by a demonſtration, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are not able to follow ſo
long a train of conſequences as is
neceſſary to make out ſo great a
Queſtion. But now we come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Day-light, and have divine
Revelation for our guide, and
Gods veracity for our aſſurance.</p>
               <p>I confeſs I might have fallen
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61579:22"/>
upon this way of proof at firſt,
and ſo have ſaved all the labour
of what I have been ſaying hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,
but that I partly thought
it uſeful to ſhew how far natural
Theology would go in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and principally I took this
method to the intent that this
great Doctrine of Chriſtianity
might not ſeem ſtrange to any
one, but might be the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
entertained when it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
to, and uſher'd in with
ſo much probability of humane
reaſon.</p>
               <p>Now, I ſay, God Almighty
hath himſelf aſſur'd us, that <hi>our
labour ſhall not be in vain in the
Lord,</hi> that Piety ſhall not go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded
in another World, nor
Impiety unpuniſhed; this he
hath innumerable times expreſly
affirmed in the Goſpel, and with
ſuch circumſtances, as may both
beſt aſſure our judgments, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61579:23"/>
awaken our affections. He hath
told us he will hold a ſolemn
Judgment at the end of the
World, at which all men ſhall
appear and receive their Doom;
he hath declared who ſhall be
the Judge, and confirmed him to
be ſo, by that wonderful inſtance
of raiſing him from the Dead.
He hath foretold the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and the manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
at that great day, he hath
deſcribed (as well as words could
admit it) the Joy and Glory that
holy and good men ſhall thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
be put into the Everlaſting
poſſeſſion of, and ſet out the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and anguiſh that ſhall be
inflicted upon the Ungodly.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not need to go about to
aggrandize theſe things, ſince
they are ſo vaſtly great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that there is no way to
deſpiſe them but by disbelieving
them. But what colour or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61579:23"/>
can there be for that, after
God hath ſaid it, and ſent his Son
to declare this great news to the
World?</p>
               <p>Will men be ſo wretchedly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
as to ſay ſtill, it is impoſſible
that men ſhould live again after
they are once dead? when there
is plain matter of fact againſt this
ſuggeſtion, which is beyond all
the arguments in the World; for
was not our Saviour moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
put to Death, and did he
not alſo exhibit himſelf alive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to the Eyes and Ears,
and very feeling of his Apoſtles
and many others?</p>
               <p>Will men ſay, Heaven is but a
Dream, or a Romantick fancy?
when there were ſo many Eye
Witneſſes of our Saviours Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to Heaven, and that he was
alive and in power there; there
was that glorious proof, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
of the Holy Ghoſt upon his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61579:24"/>
Apoſtles on the famous day of
Pentecoſt, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
made whilſt he was upon
Earth.</p>
               <p>Will they ſay, God hath a mind
to impoſe upon men? when he
hath no ends to ſerve by it, when
he can compaſs his deſigns with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it; and when he hath it in
his power to diſſolve a World that
would not comply with him, and
make another in its ſtead.</p>
               <p>Or, Will they ſay, that men
impoſe upon one another, and
there was never any ſuch matters
of fact as we have here ſuppoſed?
But why do they not then disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
all Hiſtory, all antient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
give the lie to all great
actions, and abrogate all Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men; yea, although there
be never ſo plain, never ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
ſo concurrent, and ſo
diſintereſſed teſtimonies? all this,
and more than this, they muſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61579:24"/>
do that deny the matters of fact
we ſpeak of; and if they do not
do ſo, they muſt of neceſſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
another Life, an Hell and
an Heaven.</p>
               <p>And then, if thoſe be believed,
Piety will be the beſt Wiſdom,
and Religion the greateſt Truth;
Sin will then be the greateſt Folly,
and trifling with God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
the moſt dangerous thing
imaginable; but that we ſhall
more particularly make out in
the next Chapter.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="chapter">
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:61579:25"/>
               <head>CHAP. IV. Of the great influence and mighty
force of believing Heaven and
Hell, or rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in another World.</head>
               <p>THere are a ſort of men, who
(being too much in love
with this World to have any great
mind to the other) will pretend
that the grounds to believe theſe
things are not ſufficient, and that
there are, as the caſe ſtands, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
incouragements enough to
make a man Religious, nor Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
powerful enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
Vice; becauſe we are only
preſt upon by hopes and fears of
hereafter, but nothing befals pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.
Theſe men require, that
for the countenance of Religion,
there ſhould be a preſent diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61579:25"/>
between him that ſerves
God, and him that deſpiſes him;
that the Sinner ſhould be taken
and Executed in the very fact, and
the good man Crowned upon the
ſpot; or at leaſt they think it not
an unreaſonable demand, that if
it be the will of God that evil
men ſhould be reprieved, and
good men kept in ſuſpence till
another World; yet he ſhould
give Mankind a view of what
ſhall befal hereafter, that they
might have a ſight of Heaven and
Hell, and ſo diſpoſe themſelves
accordingly.</p>
               <p>The former part of this phancy
was taken notice of by <hi>Solomon,</hi>
Eccleſ. 8. 11. <hi>Becauſe Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
an evil work is not ſpeedily
executed, therefore the heart of man
is fully ſet to do wickedly.</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of it is much like that
of the Forlorn wretch in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<hi>Luke</hi> 16. 30. who thought it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61579:26"/>
reaſonable to ask, that one <hi>might
be ſent from the dead to convince his
relations of the reality of another
World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all theſe men, as they do
too palpably betray they have no
love to Religion, nor no deſire it
ſhould be true: ſo they evidently
diſcover that they neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
what ſatisfaction is fit for
God to give in theſe matters, or
for man to require; nor do they
conſider what the nature of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Religion will admit of,
no nor do they underſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſo well as to know what
motives will work upon men;
nor laſtly, have they applied their
minds to take a juſt eſtimate of
the value and efficacy of theſe
motives of hopes and fear which
it pleaſes God to ſet before
them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They do not conſider
what ſatisfaction in theſe matters
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61579:26"/>
it is fit for God to afford, or for
men to require. It is not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that the great God ſhould
gratify the humour and curioſity
of his Creatures, nor that they
ſhould peremptorily preſcribe to
him. It is fit indeed for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to give us aſſurance in theſe
important affairs; but he thinks
good to ſatisfy our reaſons, and
we will have our ſenſes convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
which is as much as to ſay,
we will not believe God but our
own Eyes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They do not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what evidence the nature of
Virtue and Piety will admit of,
that requires ſuch inducements
as may incourage good, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
evil, ſuch as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
us to chooſe the one, and to
avoid the other, not ſuch as will
over bear our choice and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
determine us. Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.
ſuch Arguments as may
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61579:27"/>
improve humane nature, not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſede
or deſtroy it; and it is
beſt promoted by ſuch a ſtate of
things as wherein a man conflicts
with ſome difficulties, exerciſes
ſelf-denial, modeſty, humility,
and truſt in God. It conſiſts in a
prudent eſtimate of all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
a diſcretion and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to value things in reverſion,
and is worth nothing if there be
no ſuch ingredients in it, as Faith,
and Patience, and a virtuous
choice; all which there is no
room for, if the rewards of it
were wholly preſent, or expoſed
to our ſenſes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Nor do the men that
talk at this rate ſo much as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
themſelves and their
own hearts ſo well, as to know
what would be ſufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with them. They phanſy
if they had the good luck to be
Spectators of a Miracle actually
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61579:27"/>
wrought, it would unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
lead them to aſſent; and yet
we ſee thoſe that were Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of abundance of ſuch, were
never the better for them. They
imagine that if they had ſeen the
paſſages of our Saviours Life,
Death and Reſurrection, they
ſhould not have been incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
yet there were multitudes
that all thoſe things wrought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon. And aſſuredly as
<hi>Abraham</hi> told the rich man in the
laſt mentioned paſſage of St. <hi>Luke,
if men hear not Moſes and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
i. e.</hi> if they do not believe
upon ſuch ſatisfaction as God
gives them, neither will they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
upon ſuch other as their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
or capricious humour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
no <hi>not if one roſe from the
dead;</hi> for the ſame unwillingneſs
which is in them to believe that
Evidence which they have, will
follow them ſtill, and the ſame
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61579:28"/>
captious temper will except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their own demands, and
find evaſions if their very Eyes
were gratified; for Faith cannot
be extorted from men, nor can
any thing make him believe that
hath not a mind to it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Nor do they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the force and efficacy of
theſe inducements of hope and
fear which God hath ſet before
us; which is the thing I princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
conſider in this place. If
indeed the objects of theſe paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or the things expected in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
World were mean and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable,
there were then no
reaſon to expect that they ſhould
have any great force upon the
minds of men to prevail with
them to deſpiſe a preſent World
for the attainment of Heaven. Or
(ſuppoſing the objects as great as
we can) if the grounds of our
hopes and fear were childiſh and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61579:28"/>
vain, <hi>i. e.</hi> our fears were panick
and unaccountable, and our hopes
mere ſanguine Dreams, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick
phancies; then it were
juſtly to be expected, that if Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God would oblige us to
Religion, he ſhould give us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Evidence. But if both the
things to be fear'd or expected in
another World are vaſtly great
and concerning, if they prove to
be real, and alſo the Evidence or
aſſurance of their reality be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
too, then it is no leſs than
madneſs, to run the hazard of
them by neglect of Religion,
whileſt we fondly cavil to have
our humour ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Now that theſe hopes and
fears of rewards and puniſhments
in another World are juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
and indeed as well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as hopes and fears can or
ought to be, I have ſhewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
foraſmuch as if there were
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61579:29"/>
more evidence than there is, they
would ceaſe to be hopes and fears,
and would be the apprehenſions
of ſenſe. And that the things thus
hoped for, and feared, or expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
are of ſo unſpeakable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as that if the evidence for
them were leſs than it is, it would
be all the wiſdom in the World
not to run the hazard of them,
will eaſily appear by this ſhort
and faint repreſentation.</p>
               <p>That which good men hope
for, and that which God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
promiſes them in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, is no leſs than to be
raiſed up again from the dead, and
to live for ever and ever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any pain, ſickneſs, want or
infirmity of Body; with minds
ſecure from danger, free from
temptation, void of care, incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of fear, errour or diſorder, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with ſerenity of Spirit,
peace of Conſcience, unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61579:29"/>
Joy, in the preſence of the
Divine Majeſty, and the bleſſed
Jeſus, and in the Society of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Angels and good men made
perfect, where alſo they ſhall
partake of a felicity as great as
divine Goodneſs could deſign,
as his wiſdom could contrive,
and his power effect for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, that which
God in the Holy Scripture gives
wicked men ground to expect
and fear, is, that they alſo ſhall
be raiſed up again from the
Grave, and then be expoſed
openly before all the World, their
hypocriſy, lewdneſs, folly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
being proved upon
them; and they thereupon be
condemn'd to utter darkneſs, to
be for ever abandoned of God and
good men, and to become the
Company indeed, but the ſport
and triumph, of infernal Spirits,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61579:30"/>
who ſhall make them the ſubjects
of their malice and tyranny, and
there live under the perpetual an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of their own Conſciences;
and in ſhort, full of the wrath of
the Almighty, which like Fire
and Brimſtone ſhall prey upon
them and burn them without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
or remiſſion of torment.</p>
               <p>Who now can doubt whether
theſe things are of mighty influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon the hearts and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men to incline them to
Religion? For can any man be
ſo void of all manly diſcretion, as
to deſpiſe ſuch an happineſs as is
promiſed to good men, or ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
of all ſenſe as to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to dwell with Everlaſting
burnings, which will be the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of wicked men?</p>
               <p>No wonder therefore if <hi>Felix</hi>
(a looſe and debauched man)
trembled when St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached
to him <hi>of righteouſneſs, temperance
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61579:30"/>
and judgment to come,</hi> Acts 24. 25.
and it would be ſtrange and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
fool-hardineſs, if any man
that lives without regard of God
and Religion, ſhould at any time
happen to conſider theſe things,
and ſhould not find a Convulſion
within himſelf like that of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar,
Dan.</hi> 5. 6. when he ſaw
<hi>the fingers of an hand writing upon
the wall againſt him,</hi> of whom
the Text tells us, that thereupon
<hi>his countenance was changed, his
thoughts troubled him, the joints of
his loins were looſed, and his knees
ſmote one againſt the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For certainly the leaſt impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which the conſideration of
theſe things can make upon a
man, is to render ſin very uneaſy
to him, and to ſpoil his greateſt
jollities. Foraſmuch as every
time he knowingly or willfully
commits it, he not only <hi>judges
himſelf unworthy of eternal life,</hi> but
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61579:31"/>
defies God Almighty, and <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
up againſt himſelf wrath againſt
the day of wrath.</hi> And the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on this muſt needs make the
proſpect of death very terrible to
him, when theſe things ſhall
come into Plea, and when what
before was only feared, muſt now
be felt and undergone; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a perpetual debauch, it will
be hardly poſſible for him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
thinking of this unpleaſant
Subject, ſince while he hath his
ſenſes about him, he cannot but
take notice how daily that unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
Gueſt makes his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
towards him.</p>
               <p>And if Death be terrible to a
man, it is certain thenceforward
life cannot be very comfortable;
for every accident will diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him, every Diſeaſe is dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him, as the Harbinger of
that King of terrors; his Spirits
are convulſed, his Joys are blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61579:31"/>
his diverſions afford him no
relief; he ſees reaſon to be afraid
of every thing, and is tempted
baſely to flatter and humour eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man, becauſe every body hath
it in his power to bring upon him
the ſumm of all Calamities, that
is, to kill him.</p>
               <p>Againſt all this there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
no Sanctuary but in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
if the Sinner flee not to
that, he periſhes, and which is
worſe, feels himſelf tormented
before the time: this therefore
he is mightily preſt to do, by the
terrors of another World. And
although it is true, that it is not
in the nature of fear (even of Hell
it ſelf,) to make a man generouſly
good, becauſe it only cramps his
powers, and is not a principle of
action, yet it is an inſtrument
of caution, and if it be attended
to, will make him leſs evil,
wherein the firſt work of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61579:32"/>
namely Reformation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</p>
               <p>And then ſo long as there is
Hope alſo in the other Scale, it
may happily not end there. The
Apoſtle hath told us, <hi>the law</hi>
(which was a Miniſtry of fear
and death) <hi>made nothing perfect,
but the bringing in of a better hope
did, by the which we draw nigh to
God,</hi> Hebr. 7. 19.</p>
               <p>For the hopes of that unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
felicity and glory, which, as
I ſhew'd before, doth await all
good men in another World, is
able to make a man forget fleſh
and infirmity, to deſpiſe danger
and difficulty, and to raiſe him
above himſelf, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Thoſe
great and precious promiſes which
are propounded to us by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
do <hi>make a man partaker of a
divine nature.</hi> For great hopes
raiſe brave Spirits, and effect

The mere perſwaſion, that I
have an immortal Soul, is of
mighty efficacy to make me va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
my ſelf more, than to think
my ſelf made to eat and drink;
and will not permit me to drown
this divine particle in drink and
debauches, nor exert it only in
folly and buffonry; but will
prompt me to cultivate this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
part, to furniſh it with
wiſdom and knowledge, that I
may enjoy it the better in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>The thoughts of living for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               <p>The contemplation of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable

               <head>CHAP. V. What particular Religion we
ſhould apply our ſelves to.</head>
               <p>HAving in the premiſſes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the ground and
foundation of Religion in general,
and thereby made it appear to be
ſo highly reaſonable, that it is
every mans wiſdom and intereſt
to comply with it; We now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to inquire, what mode or
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61579:34"/>
profeſſion of Religion in ſpecial, he
ought to apply himſelf to, who is
convinced of the neceſſity of it in
the general.</p>
               <p>And this is the rather to be
done, becauſe ſome men make the
variety of Religions which they
obſerve in the World, an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt them all; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there are ſo many forms of
it that they cannot eaſily reſolve
which to addict themſelves to,
theſe men (as they think very
wiſely) pitch upon none, but
fairly ſtand Neuters.</p>
               <p>Now for prevention of this
miſchief, as well as to make way
for the reſolution of the great
Queſtion before us, let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
theſe two things. Firſt, <hi>that
it is not</hi> only an impious, but a
very fooliſh and frantick reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſtand off from all Religion,
upon pretence that there are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
and diſputes about it. For</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:61579:34"/>
1. Men will not be content to
go by that rule in other Caſes, no
man will conclude there is no ſuch
thing as <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> or right
and wrong in their Civil intereſts,
becauſe they obſerve Lawyers to
wrangle at the Bar, or to give
different opinions in particular
Caſes; nor becauſe Phyſicians
often diſagree in their Judgments
of Diſeaſes, will any diſcreet man
refuſe their aſſiſtance, and reſolve
to let his Diſeaſe take its courſe:
this objection therefore of ſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
men, is but a mere pretence
made uſe of to countenance their
averſation to Religion, and not
a real Maxime of Reaſon with
them.</p>
               <p>2. The ground of this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is fooliſhly or maliciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented;
for it is plain, that
the main things of Religion are
very little or nothing in diſpute,
but are confeſſed and agreed in by
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61579:35"/>
all. Or if there be ſome points
of moment diſputed, they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
ſuch as are ſpeculative,
not matters of practice. For
who diſputes whether God ſhould
be worſhipped? whether a man
ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly,
and godly in this preſent World?
in ſuch things as theſe, all diſcreet
and well diſpoſed men agree. Let
the ſceptical perſon therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to theſe too, and practiſe
them; or elſe let him be ſo inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
as to acknowledge, it is
only his unwillingneſs to comply
with the rules of a good life, which
makes him pretend to ſtumble at
diſputes.</p>
               <p>3. It is to be conſidered, that
even thoſe who differ and diſpute
in ſeveral points, agree notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in this, that it is the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
and ſafeſt courſe to come to a
reſolution in Religion, foraſmuch
as particular diſputes about it,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61579:35"/>
prove undeniably this in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that by confeſſion of all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
there is great moment in it;
becauſe there could be no reaſon
why either the one ſide or the
other ſhould trouble themſelves,
and raiſe ſuch heats about it, but
that both are ſatisfied of the great
conſequence of the ſubject of the
queſtion, and the conſideration
of that is it which makes them be
ſo nice, curious and critical, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the very punctilioes of it.
But,</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, It is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to be conſidered, that he
that ſtands neutral, and holds off
from all Religion upon pretence
of the danger of miſtake, upon
account of the great variety of
perſwaſions, runs into the moſt
fatal miſtake of all, and is of all
men in the moſt deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
for whatſoever becomes
of other men, under a miſtaken
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61579:36"/>
zeal or a falſe opinion, he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a loſt man who hath no
Zeal or Religion at all. For
though it be certain, all perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
cannot be right, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſome muſt miſcarry; yet ſo
long as there is a real foundation
for Religion in general (as we
have ſeen) it is evident the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt
cannot be ſaved (whoever be
damned) who entertains no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
at all. Therefore as it is
better uncertainly to erre, than
certainly to periſh; ſo it muſt
needs be a wiſer courſe to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
our ſelves ſomeway, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the diſputes, than
gravely to doubt our ſelves into
Hell by a phantaſtical neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>But then ſecondly, as it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dangerous and abſurd reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be of no Religion, for fear
we ſhould miſtake the right; it is
not much better on the other ſide,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61579:36"/>
to be ſuch Latitudinarians, as to
think it indifferent what Religion
a man be of, ſo long as he is zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and devout in his way, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we could be aſſured, that the
<hi>broad way</hi> was the way to Heaven,
which is moſt certainly falſe.</p>
               <p>I confeſs it is a very bad Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
indeed which is not better
than none at all, as the fainteſt
hopes are better than utter deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
And it is undoubtedly
true, that without fervour and
devotion in the proſecution of a
mans perſwaſion, no Religion, be
it never ſo good and Orthodox,
will ſignify any thing. It is true
alſo, that a man of a devout tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
hath the ground of Piety, and
a foundation for good inſtitution
to work upon; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Religion ſpeaks ſomething
more than to be in earneſt, and
Piety requires more than a good
intention. For unleſs that honeſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61579:37"/>
temper be cultivated and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
it will bring forth nothing
but wild fruit; that zeal muſt
be governed and conducted by
good principles, or it will betray
a man to preſumption, to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
and to a thouſand irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities.</p>
               <p>We are ſet to run a race to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Heaven, but in that caſe it
is not only ſpeed, but the keeping
the exact courſe withal, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles
to the reward. He that
runs wrong, the more haſt he
makes, the worſe is his ſpeed;
for he hath the more to undo
again.</p>
               <p>Nor is this any reflection upon
the Divine Majeſty, who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
good, and conſequently
very pitiful to the well-meant er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of Mankind; for it muſt be
conſidered, that he is wiſe, and
great, and juſt alſo, not ſo ſoft
and fond as to be pleaſed with
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61579:37"/>
whatſoever is well meant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, or to be contented
with whatever men phanſy. No,
he hath a mind and will of his
own, and requires and expects
thoſe be complied withal by ſuch
as he rewards with Eternal
Life.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Queſtion which
we are now upon is very ſerious
and neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> how amidſt
ſuch variety of perſwaſions or
forms of Religion as are in the
World, a man may make a right
choice, and know which of them
in particular he ought to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
himſelf upon.</p>
               <p>But the aſſoiling of it cannot
be difficult, foraſmuch as if God
will be ſerved in his own way, it
is evident, that he muſt have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſome courſe or other for the
diſcovery and interpreting of his
mind and will to the Sons of men,
to the intent that they may have
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61579:38"/>
a rule to govern their devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by.</p>
               <p>Now it is plain, beyond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
that there are three and
but three things which can with
any colour of probability pretend
to give us aim in this Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
natural light, the Spirit, or the
holy Scriptures; and therefore all
the difficulty comes to this point,
which of theſe three we are to
follow and govern our ſelves by.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt of the three,
namely the light of nature, or
natural reaſon; it is true, that
this is able in ſome meaſure to
diſcover to us that there is a God,
and to aſſure us alſo of ſome of
his Attributes and perfections, ſo
as to lay a general foundation of
Religion (as we have briefly
ſhewed already) but it can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diſcover all the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
becauſe he is infinite
and beyond our comprehenſion,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61579:38"/>
nor much leſs penetrate the depths
of his counſels, or the ſecrets of
his will and pleaſure, becauſe (as
we alſo noted before) he is a free
Agent, and hath no neceſſary
meaſures, but freely chuſes as it
pleaſes him.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>as no man knows
the mind of a man but the ſpirit of a
man which is in him,</hi> ſo much leſs
can any man know the mind of
God till he be pleaſed to reveal it.
Now the deſign of Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to pleaſe and propitiate the
divine Majeſty to us, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
any man ſhould pretend to
know what will fully do that by
natural reaſon. Conſequently
not only the old Philoſophers but
the modern Theiſts, and that
Sect of men called Quakers, who
pretend to attain happineſs by
the natural notions of God, or
the light within them; muſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably
be bewildered whileſt they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61579:39"/>
follow ſo imperfect and uncertain
a Guide.</p>
               <p>As for the ſecond, namely a
private Spirit, there is no doubt
but that the divine majeſty could
(if he had pleaſed) have conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men by immediate Revelation,
and as it were led them by his
own immediate hand from time
to time, dictating his own will
to their minds; and there is as
little reaſon to queſtion, but that
ſometimes in extraordinary Caſes
he hath done ſo in former times:
but that this ſhould be his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and ſtanding courſe, is not
reaſonable to think; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we cannot now obſerve, that
the beſt of men either have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of, or ſo much as pretend
to any ſuch thing, but becauſe
in the firſt place it is evident that
ſuch immediate Revelation could
be of no further uſe than to that
particular perſon to whom it was
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61579:39"/>
made, in regard it would be like
the white ſtone, <hi>Rev. 2. 17. which
no man knows what is written upon
it, but he that receives it;</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
becauſe the very perſon
himſelf that ſhould pretend to it
could not ſecure himſelf from il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion,
but might eaſily miſtake
the Idols of his own phancy, or
the very illuſions of the Devil, for
the dictates of the Divine Spirit
(as we find by ſad experience that
many have done) unleſs there
were withal a conſtant ſucceſſion
of Miracles to aſſure their minds
that it was the divine impreſſion:
<hi>Therefore,</hi> foraſmuch as thoſe
who pretend to the Spirit, can
give no aſſurance of it, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
reaſon cannot pretend to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
ſufficiently the Divine Will;
it remains, that only the Holy
Scripture is that which muſt be
our guide in the way to pleaſe
God, and attain the Salvation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61579:40"/>
in another World.</p>
               <p>The holy Scripture then is that
proviſion God hath thought fit to
make for our weakneſs and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
This is the tranſcript of
the divine mind, a light that ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in darkneſs, and by which
divine wiſdom deſigned to guide
us through all the maze of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
and to reſolve us of all the
important queſtions that concern
our eternal intereſt; and this is
that which he hath ſo fitted to
our uſe, that whoſoever conſults
it with a mind free from prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and anticipation, he ſhall not
miſs his way to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Nor ſhall ſuch a man as is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<hi>to receive the Kingdom of
God as a little Child,</hi> i. e. comes
with a mind willing to learn and
be convinced, and with that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
applies himſelf to the holy
Scripture, need either the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
infallibility of a Pope, or
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61579:40"/>
the Authority of a Church to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
it to him: For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
God is as able to expreſs his
mind to us, as either of theſe are,
whenſoever he thought fit to do
ſo; and where he reſolved to be
obſcure, it is not to any purpoſe
to conſult them in the Caſe, who
are no more privy to his ſecret
counſels than we our ſelves are.
And it is not conſiſtent either with
the goodneſs or wiſdom of God,
to order matters ſo, that he ſhould
be betray'd to any capital error
(ſo as to indanger his Salvation)
who applies himſelf to the holy
Scripture, and comes qualified
with an honeſt heart, and in the
uſe of ſuch ordinary means as are
afforded for the underſtanding of
them.</p>
               <p>It is indeed not impoſſible, but
that ſuch a man, notwithſtanding
both the perfection and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity
of his rule, may erre in ſome
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61579:41"/>
ſmaller matters; but there is no
reaſon to fear they ſhould be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch as will abuſe him in the
great Doctrines of Faith, or the
rules of a good Life; he can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
miſtake the Object of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
nor the manner of it, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
the glory of God, or his
own Salvation. For this will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
him to a Religion plain and
eaſy, humble and peaceable, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
and hearty; a Religion
that neither impoſes an implicit
Faith, nor countenances a bold
preſumption, that will make men
devout without ſuperſtition, and
holy without arrogance or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to merit at Gods hands;
in a word, the holy Scripture im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
conſulted, will bring us
to a Religion that ſhall neither
conſiſt of ſpeculations, and be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinionative
and fanatical on the
one ſide, nor made up of external
ſhew and pomp, as that of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61579:41"/>
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on the other ſide,
but ſuch as that of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> which manifeſtly avoids
both extreams.</p>

in that caſe; yet (as I intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

able to defeat the ends of it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for the removal of that, it
will be of great uſe that the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61579:42"/>
following particulars be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He that would make a
right uſe of the holy Scripture,
and thereby diſcover the true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments
of Religion, let him
make inquiry after the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
and the moſt Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and not indulge his curioſity
ſo as to be taken either with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty,
or ſingularity; for each
of thoſe will lead him aſide, both
from the truth of Religion in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and from the Chriſtian
Religion in particular.</p>
               <p>As for the former of theſe notes
of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> Antiquity, the
oldeſt Religion muſt needs be as
much the truer, as God is before
the Devil; therefore the Prophet
<hi>Jerem.</hi> 6. 16. directs the people
<hi>to inquire for the good old way, and
walk therein, and they ſhould find
reſt to their ſouls;</hi> and for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
in particular, foraſmuch as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61579:42"/>
that depends upon Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
it is impoſſible that After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
ſhould add any thing to it,
or make improvement of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
new revelation. Whilſt God
is of the ſame mind, Heaven of
the ſame nature, and the Goſpel
of the ſame tenor, there can be
no new Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>Therefore let all new lights go
for <hi>Ignes fatui,</hi> and mere meteors,
that ſerve to no purpoſe but to
bewilder men; he that ſeeks for
true Chriſtianity, let him neither
content himſelf to look back to
41, or the laſt Age, as ſome do;
nor 500. years backward to a
dark Age, as others; but let him
inquire for a Religion as old as
Goſpel, and obſerve in what Rules
it was delivered, and in what Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
it firſt ſhew'd it ſelf in the
World.</p>
               <p>As for the other note of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>viz.</hi> Univerſality; It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61579:43"/>
the true Religion is the moſt
truly Catholick. For it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that our Saviour intended
but one Church, and one Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in all the World; and to
that purpoſe he inſtituted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
in ſuch ſort, that it ſhould
agree with all times and ages, fit
all Countries and Climates, ſuit
all Conſtitutions and conditions
of men, and ſubſiſt under what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
form of Government, or
Civil polity it ſhould meet with.</p>
               <p>Thoſe therefore who model
Religion according to the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
faſhion of ſome one Country,
or frame a notion of it which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a certain complexion and
temper of Body; (as for inſtance,
that make ſome auſterities eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to it, which all cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with) or that deſcribe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
for the Cloyſter, and not
adequate to common Life; or
that model it ſo, as that it muſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61579:43"/>
have the Civil Government ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to it, or it cannot ſubſiſt;
or in a word, that confine it to
narrow bounds, or Canton it into
ſeparate parties: none of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the true genius of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
nor take the meaſures of
Religion from the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He that would make
a right choice of his Religion,
muſt not take it upon publick
Faith, or be determined by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
fame, or ſo much as regard
the loud ſhouts and acclamations
of the vulgar. For they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
ſworn Enemies to ſober
reaſon, as being moved more by
heat than light, and governed by
ſenſe and phancy, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
cannot entertain any
great eſteem for a modeſt, ſedate,
manly and rational Religion, but
on the contrary infinitely dote
upon all the tricks of Superſtition
and Enthuſiaſm; and thoſe two
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61579:44"/>
do ſo wholly govern them, that
they receive no impreſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
where one or other of them
doth not ſtrike their imaginations.</p>
               <p>As for Superſtition, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
efficacy of that upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
minds, is ſo notorious, that
nothing can be more. If they ſee
a man ſo extreamly ſcrupulous,
that he finds (as we ſay) a knot
in a Bullruſh; ſo ſqueamiſh and
ſtrait-laced, that he becomes a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to himſelf and all about him;
ſo infinitely full of doubts, and
fears, and jealouſies, that he ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizes
Religion by his imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,
and renders God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a very unbenign and ſevere
Majeſty: ſuch a man notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is apt to be cried up as
a great Saint, although in greater
matters perhaps he gives himſelf
more liberty than other men.</p>
               <p>Or if they obſerve a man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to great auſterity and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61579:44"/>
by the careleſsneſs of his
habit, dejectedneſs of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
or other peculiarity of his
garb, as wearing an hair ſhirt, or
girt with a rope, eſpecially if he
alſo macerate himſelf with Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or whip himſelf till the blood
comes, or uſe any ſuch ſeverity
towards himſelf, they are ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected with this pageant of
Piety, and theſe things alone are
ſecurity enough to them that he
is an holy man, and of the beſt
Religion.</p>
               <p>Thus no doubt the Prieſts of
<hi>Baal,</hi> who (as we read, 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
18. 26.) prayed from Morning
to Mid-day, made horrible out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries,
and uſed antick poſtures,
and amongſt the reſt, in a blind
Zeal, cut themſelves with Knives
and Lancets, had a mighty vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
amongſt the rabble of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
Iſraelites, inſomuch
that the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> with all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61579:45"/>
the holineſs of his life, and very
great auſterity of converſation
too, was not able to bear up with
them.</p>
               <p>And thus the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
in our Saviours time, what
by their demure and mortified
looks, disfigured Faces, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearance of Sanctimony;
what by their broad phylacteries,
and fringes of their Garments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
with ſharp thorns to prick and
vex them; what with long Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and frequent Faſtings, and ſuch
other Artifices, they ſo led the
people by the Noſe, that all the
wiſdom, temper, goodneſs, nay
Miracles of our Saviour were
ſcarce ſufficient to procure their
attention to him.</p>
               <p>And thus it will be alſo with
Enthuſiaſm, that raiſes the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and captivates the minds
of the generality as much or more
than ſuperſtition. If a man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61579:45"/>
to the Spirit, and to extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Communications from
the Divine Majeſty; if he now
and then either feel or can coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
raptures and tranſports, ſo
that by turns he ſhall be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as it were ſnatcht up to the
third Heaven, and at another
time be caſt down to Hell; and if
in theſe fits he can talk non-ſenſe
confidently, can make vehement
harangues againſt pride, forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
or ſuperſtition; if he make
ſhew of extraordinary Zeal and
Devotion, and have the pride or
inſolency to ſpeak ill of his Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to ſlight all ordinary Forms
and cenſure the Government; if
he have either an horrible Voice,
or an oily melting tone, an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Countenance, a peculiar mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Eyes, or eſpecially hath
the trick to reſemble an Epilepſy
in all this Legerdemain, then
when he ſpeaks evil of dignities,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61579:46"/>
he ſhall be thought to have the
zeal and ſpirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably
the ſpirit of God is
in him, and he is admired, if not
adored, by inconſiderate people.
When in the mean time, ſound
Doctrine, ſober reaſon, wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
and grave Piety, ſhall
ſignify nothing but form and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality
with them.</p>
               <p>For (as I intimated before)
ſuch things as I laſt named, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
themſelves only to a ſedate
mind, and a conſiderative tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
but the other bear ſtrongly
upon the ſenſes and the phancies
of men, and ſo carry away the
vulgar.</p>
               <p>He therefore that would not
have his devout intention abuſed,
muſt not ſuffer the multitude to
chuſe his Religion for him, nor
take it upon truſt from publick
fame and noiſe; for if he decide
this caſe by the poll, he ſhall be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61579:46"/>
ſure to have ſhadow for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and either imbrace a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
made up of paint and var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
or elſe one animated only
by a ſpirit of Enthuſiaſm.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He that would make
a right choice in Religion, and is
content to follow the meaſures of
the holy Scripture therein, muſt
reſolve with himſelf, not to ſeek
for, or pitch upon ſuch a way as
will put him to the leaſt pains,
and give him the leaſt trouble;
but be willing to deny himſelf,
and to conflict with any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that he may ſave his Soul; for
pretended eaſy Religions are like
Mountebanks Cures, deceitful
and palliative.</p>
               <p>Some men have the folly to
perſwade themſelves, that a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
conſiſting of mere Faith,
without the trouble of a good
Life will ſerve the turn; nay, that
to be of a peculiar Party, Sect or
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61579:47"/>
Church will be ſufficient; but
then it is ſtrange our Saviour
ſhould bid us <hi>ſtrive to enter in at
the ſtrait gate:</hi> for it would be a
wonder if any ſhould miſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon theſe terms; or if any
be ſo ſottiſh, they deſerve to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
without pity.</p>
               <p>Others there are that entertain
a conceit of getting to Heaven by
the merits of other men, as by
purchaſing an Indulgence, or by
hiring a Prieſt to ſay Prayers for
the man when he is dead, that
would not be at the trouble to
pray for himſelf whilſt he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live;
or by getting a plenary ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of all his ſins at the laſt
gaſp, or ſome other ſuch volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and compendious ways of
Salvation.</p>
               <p>He that ſeeks out ſuch expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
as theſe, argues that he hath
ſome little love to himſelf, ſo far
as to be loth to be damned, but
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61579:47"/>
that he hath none at all towards
God or Virtue; and indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates,
that he hath not ſo
much as any worthy notion of
God, or apprehenſion of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the happineſs of the other
World. Nay, he gives evidence,
that he is as much in love with
his ſins as with himſelf, and
would have both ſaved toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10.
that when we ſhall appear at the
Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, we ſhall
receive our Doom, <hi>according to the
things done in the body, whether good
or evil;</hi> not according to what
ſhall be done for us when we are
out of the Body, much leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what others have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
officiouſly or mercenarily
performed for us. All ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
are Cheats, the artifices of
Hypocriſy, and conſtitute only a
Religion for an Epicure, but are
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61579:48"/>
as far, as Hell is from Heaven,
from the inſtitutions of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>It is true our Saviour ſaith, <hi>his
yoke is eaſy, and his burthen light,</hi> but
that is ſpoken either compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to the burden of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick
Law, eſpecially conſidered
with the additional impoſitions of
the Scribes and Phariſees, who as
he tells us, <hi>laid heavy burdens upon
others, but would not buckle under
them themſelves;</hi> or with reſpect
to the great aſſiſtance and mighty
incouragement which thoſe men
ſhall meet with that apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in earneſt to Chriſtianity.
For certainly, if there had been
no conſiderable difficulty in the
Chriſtian Religion, the firſt Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it would not have been,
that a man <hi>muſt deny himſelf.</hi> Nor
would our Saviour have required
us, that if <hi>our right eye or right
hand offend us, we muſt pluck out the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61579:48"/>
one, and cut off the other, that</hi> we
may enter into Life.</p>

            <div n="7" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VII. Cautions againſt ſome opinions
which are hindrances both of
an Holy and of a Comfortable
Life.</head>
               <p>WHen a man hath ſetled
his Principles, and made
a good choice of his Profeſſion of
Religion, he is then in a fair way
towards an Holy and a Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Life; yet there are ſeveral
vulgar opinions, which if they be
not carefully avoided will have
an unhappy influence upon both,
and therefore it is expedient he
ſhould be cautioned againſt them;
eſpecially ſuch as thoſe whereof
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61579:49"/>
I will here give a Catalogue in the
particulars following.</p>
               <p>To which I will premiſe this
in the general, that although
ſome of the opinions that ſhall be
mentioned, may ſeem only mere
ſpeculations in the firſt view of
them, and perhaps may go no
further with ſome perſons, whoſe
ſingular probity and ſincerity of
heart may antidote them againſt
the malignity of ſuch tenets, yet
in their own nature and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
conſequences of them, they
are very dangerous, as ſhall now
be made appear in particular.</p>
               <p>1. Therefore let him that
would make a due improvement
of the Principles of Chriſtianity,
take care of allowing himſelf to
pry too curiouſly into the ſecret
counſels of God, or of marſhalling
too confidently the Decrees of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
and Reprobation, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
of arguing preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61579:49"/>
concerning his own or other
mens Salvation or Damnation
from them.</p>
               <p>There is no queſtion with me
but that God Almighty foreknew
from all Eternity whatſoever
ſhould come to paſs in after times;
and let it be taken for granted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
that from the ſame Eternity
he decreed with himſelf whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he would afterwards effect or
permit; nay let us moreover ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he hath expreſly determined
with himſelf who ſhall be ſaved
and who ſhall be damned, and
that ſo peremptorily, that only
they ſhall be ſaved whom he hath
ſo decreed to ſave, and thoſe ſhall
certainly be damned whom he
hath paſt ſuch a Decree upon.
But what then? the proper and
only reaſonable uſe we can make
of theſe ſuppoſitions, is to admire
the Divine Eternity, Soveraignty,
Power and Omniſcience; here is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61579:50"/>
neither matter for our curioſity
nor for our reaſon to deſcant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
not for our curioſity, ſince
it is plainly impoſſible to know,
what the particular import of
thoſe Decrees is, or whom they
concern; and leſs for our reaſon,
ſince if we will argue any thing
hence, it muſt be no better than
deducing concluſions from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
premiſſes.</p>
               <p>The very prying into theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet
Counſels (beſides the folly
and immodeſty of it) tends to
very ill purpoſes, for it certainly
either blows men up with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
or caſts them headlong
into deſperation. The ſanguine,
and confident, and ſelf-applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
are filled with vain hopes by
theſe ſpeculations; and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
melancholy and deſpondent
tempers, are inclined to deſpair
by them.</p>
               <p>But the arguing and drawing
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61579:50"/>
conſequences of Salvation or Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
from thence, contradicts
the deſign of the whole Scripture,
which charges us <hi>to work out our
own ſalvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi>
and to uſe <hi>diligence to make
our calling and election ſure;</hi> Nay it
turns into ridicule all the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
threatnings and promiſes
of the Goſpel. For to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
doth God perſwade us, when
he hath irrevocably determined
our fate with himſelf? It diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
all uſe of means, and all
comfort in ſo doing, ſince it will
be labour in vain: it baffles Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
whenſoever it either
checks us for ſin, or would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
us for doing virtuouſly; for
what matter is it what Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſaith, when God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed?
it renders the ſolemnity
of the great day of judgment a
mere piece of empty pomp and
pageantry, ſeeing mens Caſes are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61579:51"/>
all decided before-hand; nay it
makes the very coming of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
his Life, Death, Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Interceſſion, to be illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory
and inſignificant things; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as upon this ſuppoſition,
men are ſaved or damned antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to his undertaking.</p>
               <p>Now if after all this, any man
will be ſo deſperately abſurd and
fool-hardy, as to ſay nevertheleſs
Gods Decrees are irrevocable, and
therefore the matter of fact is
true, that if I be decreed to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
I ſhall then be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more ado; and if I be decreed
to be damned, I muſt periſh, and
there will be no help for it; it
will be in vain to uſe means ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I ſhall but ſtrive againſt the
ſtream; my Doom is paſt, and I
may bewail my hard fortune, but
cannot reverſe it. I would only
further ask ſuch a man this plain
Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> How he came to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61579:51"/>
perſwade himſelf that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
hath decreed to ſave and
damn men right or wrong (as
we ſay) <hi>i. e.</hi> whether they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and believe in Chriſt, Jeſus
or no. Foraſmuch as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that he that harbours ſuch
an opinion of the Divine Majeſty
contradicts the very notion of a
God, and repreſents him to be
the worſt and moſt hateful Being
imaginable; a Being that hath
only power and will, but hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
love nor hatred, neither
wiſdom, juſtice nor goodneſs in
him at all; that hath no eſteem
for Faith, Virtue or Piety, no
ſenſe of gratitude and ingenuity,
nor any averſation to baſeneſs and
villany; but as if he were an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
rigid Idol, is inflexible
by any repentance, prayers, tears,
addreſſes and importunities, and
inſenſible of, and unprovoked by
all the affronts and inſolencies
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61579:52"/>
that can be done to him: to be
ſure he that can think thus of
God, will eaſily believe him to
have ſet a mean value upon the
blood of his only Son; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as he hath given him up to
Death to no purpoſe upon the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
ſuppoſition. Now unleſs
all this be true (which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible)
there can be no colour nor
foundation for ſuch an horrid and
barbarous opinion.</p>
               <p>And if this be falſe, as moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it is, then we ſhall eaſily be
led into this Scriptural Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
of the divine Decrees, <hi>viz.</hi> that
as he decreed from all Eternity to
ſend his Son to be the Saviour of the
World, ſo he then alſo determined
that as many as ſhould believe on
him ſhould be ſaved, and ſuch as
did not ſo, ſhould be damned. And
then, what if we find it to follow
from the nature of Gods Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that he muſt foreknow the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61579:52"/>
individual perſons that ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or damned, or from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his determinations, that
only ſuch and no other can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
namely, thoſe he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
to it; yet then it will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to no purpoſe to gaze up
to Gods Decrees: for then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hath been written in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chives
of Heaven, it is certain it
cannot contradict this, That if I
believe and repent, and become a
good and holy man, I ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
or otherwiſe I ſhall be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and then all is plain before
me: for in this caſe I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
further to do, but to make
uſe of the means of Grace which
God affords me, and to look into
my own heart and life for my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Thus as the wiſe Perſian, who
ſooner found the Sun to be upon
the Horizon, by turning himſelf
towards the Weſtern Hills, than
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61579:53"/>
he that fixing his Eyes upon the
Eaſt, expected to ſee the Sun it
ſelf: ſo we ſhall ſooner find the
beams of divine favour in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
and reflection of them upon
our own Souls, than by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
prying into his ſecret
purpoſes.</p>
               <p>And the conſideration of this
truth will ingage men in all care
and caution, in all diligence and
humility, in the uſe of means, till
they gradually improve into a
ſtate of holineſs and comfort here,
and to aſſurance of the Kingdom
of Heaven hereafter.</p>
               <p>And this is the courſe which
the Apoſtle leads us to, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.
19. <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth
ſure, having his ſeal, the Lord
knoweth who are his, and let him
that nameth the name of Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from iniquity;</hi> as if he had
ſaid, <q>It is true indeed, God
knows from Eternity whom he
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61579:53"/>
intends to ſave, and all ſuch
ſhall eventually be ſaved and
none elſe, but our hope and
comfort cannot be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unknown principles, ſuch
as only are recorded in Heaven,
but upon the counterpart of an
holy life, or a conformity to
thoſe conditions which God
hath expreſſed in his Goſpel, as
a Copy from the Original, kept
in his own boſom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>2. The next dangerous miſtake
which we ought carefully to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void,
is, concerning the Grace and
holy Spirit of God. When men
unreaſonably expect that God
ſhould do all for them in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of their Salvation, without
their own indeavours, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that we can do nothing our
ſelves, and therefore it is in vain
to go about it; our part is only
to wait Gods time of working,
and when his holy Spirit moves,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61579:54"/>
the buſineſs will be done without
more ado, but in the mean time
all our diligence is diſcharged as
impertinent, and even our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
too (if this Doctrine be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with it ſelf): for according
to this opinion, if ever men come
to Heaven, they muſt be dragged
thither by Omnipotency, (as the
Diſciples of <hi>Mahumet</hi> expect to be
by the hair of their heads.)</p>
               <p>Now though it be undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true, that all the good that is
in us, is owing <hi>to the father of lights
from whom every good and perfect
gift cometh,</hi> foraſmuch as <hi>he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in us both to will and to do;</hi> and
therefore we can never magnify
grace enough, nor attribute too
much to the holy Spirit (without
making machines of our ſelves, and
nonſenſe of the Goſpel) yet it is
as ſure on the other hand, that
God needs not that we ſhould tell
a lie for him, nor would have us
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61579:54"/>
ſlander his Creation for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Regeneration, ſince he
doth not deſtroy the man when
he makes a Chriſtian. So far
from it, that (as I have noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
he charges us to <hi>ſtrive to
enter in at the ſtrait gate,</hi> and to
uſe all <hi>our diligence to make our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and election ſure,</hi> Which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
implies, that he doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to ſuperſede our powers
when he repairs our natures; and
that although he made us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
our own activity, yet he will
not ſave us without our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.
And therefore the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture always repreſents to
us the way of Gods working good
in our Souls, to be by exciting
our Spirits, by aſſiſting and
ſtrengthening our faculties, and
by cooperating with us, not by
over-bearing our capacity, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all for us without us; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that that man who dreams
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61579:55"/>
of being carried to Heaven by
Omnipotency, without his own
concurrence, is ſo far from any
incouragement from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to hope that ever he ſhall
come there, that it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
he ſhall never ſee that happy
eſtate, unleſs it pleaſe the divine
mercy to make him ſo early ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of this fatal errour, that he
may timely repent and purſue the
right way thither. For he that
expects to attain the Kingdom of
Heaven by Miracle, it will be a
Miracle indeed if he come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And this fond opinion is as miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
as it is unſcriptural, not
only as it apparently deprives a
man of all the comfortable refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of his own Conſcience up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whatſoever (by the grace of
God) he hath obtained, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it equals the condition
and character of the moſt ſlothful
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61579:55"/>
Epicure, with that of the moſt
generous and induſtrious; but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
as it diſpoſes men to ſlight
all the means of grace, and all
the advantages of Gods Church,
and that upon good reaſon: for
if this opinion be true, they are
all inſignificant and colluſory. It
alſo tempts men to ſin, and that
without regret or remorſe, under
a pretence that they cannot help
it; and in ſhort, it perfectly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays
them to their own luſts, and
into the hands of the Devil, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
way for whatſoever tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he will think fit to make uſe
of. For the man of this perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
(that it is impoſſible to make
reſiſtance) is bound by his own
principles, and to ſave himſelf
uſeleſs trouble, to ſtrike Sail and
ſurrender upon the firſt aſſault or
Summons.</p>
               <p>3. A third dangerous opinion,
which it is neceſſary to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61579:56"/>
againſt, is a miſtaken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſins of infirmity; this at
firſt mention of it may ſeem of
kin to that which I laſt ſpoke of,
but as I intend it, it is of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
nature, <hi>viz.</hi> when men do
not altogether diſcourage their
own indeavours upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of natural impotency in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
but yet perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
that ſome certain ſins in
particular are ſo neceſſary to
them, and unavoidable, that God
will allow of them under the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
notion of infirmities,
and pardon them without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>It is very true, there are ſuch
things as pitiable infirmities,
which the beſt of men cannot be
altogether free from, and which
infinite goodneſs therefore ſo far
conſiders, as to make a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between them and wilful
or preſumptuous ſins; pardoning
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61579:56"/>
the former upon a general repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
whereas he requires a very
particular repentance for, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the latter. But the
miſchief (which I ſeek here to
prevent) is when men cheat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into a perſwaſion that ſome
voluntary ſin or other is neceſſary
to them, and therefore muſt come
under this eſtimate of infirmity,
and conſequently need neither be
repented of nor forſaken; from
whence it comes to paſs, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
the ſin which hath been
moſt cuſtomary and habitual to
them, (becauſe <hi>it eaſily beſets them,</hi>
and they find it not eaſy or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
to them to forgoe it) is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
incouraged under the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
name of infirmity. For thus
they ſay, every man hath his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
and this is mine; and
ſo the mouth of Conſcience is
made up, as if a pardon of courſe
were due to it, without the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61579:57"/>
of Reformation.</p>
               <p>They will allow ſuch a caſe to
be that which they muſt always
complain of, but yet they never
expect or deſire to ſee it cured;
for theſe ſins are thought to be
only like the <hi>Canaanites in the land,</hi>
or ſome other remainder of thoſe
devoted and accurſed Nations,
which muſt never be quite rooted
out, but be always as Thorns in
the Eyes, and Goads in the ſides
of the true Iſraelites, <hi>i. e.</hi> tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
but not extirpated.</p>
               <p>But if this be not a very falſe
notion, what was the meaning
of our Saviour when he requires
us <hi>to cut off our right hand, and to
pluck out our right eye, when either
of them offend us?</hi> That is, that
if we will enter into life, we muſt
part with the ſin that is as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
to us as our Eyes, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or convenient to us as our
right hand, and as painful to part
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61579:57"/>
withal as either of them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if the aforeſaid Doctrine of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
take place with us, it will
ſave all the pains and trouble of
mortification, and keep the body
of ſin whole and intire, and yet
put men in hopes they may go
to Heaven notwithſtanding; and
no ſin that we have a kindneſs to,
but a man may enjoy it without
danger. For thus, it ſhall be one
mans infirmity to be drunk, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans to ſwear, a third mans
to be ſeditious or cenſorious; and
in ſhort, by the benefit of a ſoft
word or diſtinction (together
with a good opinion of a mans
ſelf) he may reconcile God and
Mammon, Chriſt and <hi>Belial,</hi> Hell
and Heaven.</p>
               <p>But this cheat is too palpable,
for the Plea of infirmity is only
allowable in ſuch Caſes as theſe
following; namely, when either
ignorance or miſ-information be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61579:58"/>
a man into errour, or he
fails in the manner of doing that
which was otherwiſe good for
the matter of it, or a great fear
over-powers him, or the ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a temptation ſurprizes him
before he was ſo much aware as
to collect himſelf; or ſomething
of like nature to theſe, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſins of infirmity. But aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly,
that which a man knows
to be a ſin, and yet commits
it, that which a man takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in, and lives in the habitual
practice of, can never be eſteemed
a meer pitiable infirmity; and
therefore whoſoever truly loves
his own Soul, and is in earneſt
for Eternity, hath great reaſon to
take care of this errour.</p>
               <p>4. A fourth danger I would
give warning againſt, is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
opinion about Converſion
to God, which if it be rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
is a great, ſolemn and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61579:58"/>
divine thing, and whereever it is
truly accompliſht, is the happieſt
paſſage of a mans whole life, and
the very Criſis of Eternity, <hi>viz.</hi>
when either a man who (by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Education or otherwiſe)
was betray'd to evil and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
opinions, comes by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of better information
and the grace of God, to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
inſtructed and ſet right in
his principles, or eſpecially when
one who was formerly of a lewd
and flagitious life, is by the grace
of the Goſpel now brought to a
ſight of his ſin, a ſenſe of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and thereupon changes his
whole courſe and becomes a new
and holy man: Both theſe are (as
I ſaid) great, and ſolemn, and
happy things, to be ſpoken of
with all reverence, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with joy and admiration.</p>
               <p>But now there is a two fold mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
very common in this great
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61579:59"/>
affair, <hi>viz.</hi> when either ſuch a
Converſion (as we have now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed)
is looked upon as univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
neceſſary, and preſcribed to
all men, as the condition of their
Salvation, or elſe (which is far
worſe) when the whole nature
of the thing is miſtaken, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
from ſin to God, is made
to be a mere momentaneous act,
a kind of qualm or fit of Religion,
and as ſuch is relied upon, as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to Salvation, without an
habitual courſe of holy life ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
to it.</p>
               <p>Both theſe laſt named are falſe
and dangerous opinions, but the
evil of the former of them lies in
this, that it is apt to perplex the
Conſciences, and diſturb the peace
of very good men, <hi>viz.</hi> When
thoſe who by the bleſſing of God
have been trained up in good
principles, and by his grace not
only preſerved from a looſe and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61579:59"/>
debauched life, but ingaged alſo
in a holy and virtuous courſe all
along, ſhall notwithſtanding have
it preached to them, and preſt
upon them, that they alſo muſt
be converted and born again, or
elſe they ſhall never ſee the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God. This indeed was
neceſſary and proper Doctrine
from our Saviour to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi>
and to the generality of the Jews,
as well as from the Apoſtles to
the Pagan World, who had been
nurſed up in Ignorance, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
and Idolatry: But it was
not preached to <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt,
nor to St. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, nor
to <hi>Timothy, who had known the holy
Scriptures from a Child,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.
15. and who had been early in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in an holy life, by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God upon the careful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
<hi>of his Grandmother Lois
and his mother Eunice,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 5.
not can ſuch Doctrine (without
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61579:60"/>
equal indiſcretion and danger) be
preached to ſeveral others now
who are of that condition, that
as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>they need no
repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is the latter of theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
about Converſion, which I
intend in this place principally to
give caution againſt, <hi>viz.</hi> when
a man who hath been formerly
either of a ſottiſh and careleſs, or
of a notoriouſly debaucht and
profligate life, ſhall be incouraged
to think his peace is made with
God from ſuch time as he hath
had a qualm come over his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and been put into a mood
of ſeriouſneſs and devotion, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been taught to date his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
from hence.</p>
               <p>The miſchief of this miſtake is
very frequent and apparent, for
that it tempts men to grow ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
before they are ſafe, and it
is very common and natural for
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61579:60"/>
ſuch perſons to grow careleſs of
themſelves upon a vain confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in this kind of Converſion,
as if now their work were done,
without the trouble <hi>of bringing
forth fruits worthy of repentance and
amendment of life.</hi> Nay further,
when perhaps ſuch men have
committed ſome ſuch great ſin,
as (that were it not for this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
errour) would ſtartle their
Conſciences, they are hereby (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of applying themſelves to
God by hearty repentance) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
only fondly to look back,
and to remember that ſuch a time
I was converted, and enter'd into
a ſtate of grace, and therefore all
is well enough already; and from
hence it comes to paſs alſo, that
nothing is more frequent than
ſuch mens falling from grace in
this ſenſe, that is, to apoſtatize
from ſuch hopeful beginnings;
for indeed they were at moſt but
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61579:61"/>
beginnings, but being fooliſhly
reſted in, as if they had amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the whole attainment of
Chriſtianity, they flatter men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſecurity firſt, and betray them
to ſhame afterwards.</p>
               <p>And the falſity of this conceit
is evident in this, that whereas it
makes the great buſineſs of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to lie in an inſtantaneous act,
the tranſaction perhaps of a day
or an hour, or a Sermon, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture quite contrary-wiſe
repreſents it as the buſineſs of a
mans whole life, and requires,
that men not only ſet out well,
but that they make a daily and
gradual progreſſion towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
foraſmuch as it tells us, that
otherwiſe he who <hi>hath begun in
the ſpirit may end in the fleſh,</hi> and
that a man may <hi>return with the
Dog to his vomit,</hi> &amp;c. and then
<hi>the latter end of ſuch a man is worſe
than the beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:61579:61"/>
5. Another miſtake not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to any of the former, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in reſpect of errour or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
is about the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Conſcience, <hi>viz.</hi> When
men perſwade themſelves that all
is right and true, which they are
ſatisfied of in their Conſciences,
and that it is lawful for them to
do whatſoever that dictates to
them, or allows them in, as if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
were not a thing to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
but to rule, and were inveſted
with a kind of Soveraignty, ſo
that it were a Law to it ſelf, and
to others alſo. If you reprove
ſome mans opinion (inſtead of
arguments for it) he tells you it
is his Conſcience, and that's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
or if you blame ſome
action of his life, he regards not
your reprehenſions, for, ſaith he,
my Conſcience ſmites me not for
it, and therefore I am ſafe; or
if you forewarn him of ſome
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61579:62"/>
counſels or undertakings as tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Sedition and publick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance,
it is no matter, it is
his Conſcience, and he muſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
it.</p>
               <p>The miſchief of this is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable,
for by this means the
moſt fooliſh and extravagant acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are juſtified, and the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
rendered incorrigible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both hardened in his ſin and
in his ſufferings, for (if it come to
that) you cannot convince ſuch
men, for they have a teſtimony
within them which is infallible,
and in confidence of that, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
you bring an Argument
which they cannot anſwer, they
reject and defy it as a temptation
of the Devil. If you rebuke them,
you blaſpheme the holy Spirit; if
you go about to reſtrain them,
you violate the moſt ſacred Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of Conſcience, and are
gulty of the only ſacriledge
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61579:62"/>
which (in their opinion) can be
committed, and which is worſt
of all, thus God is intitled to the
very paſſions and follies of ſuch
men, and to all the extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in the World: for if it be
their Conſcience, God muſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize
it, and bear the blame
of all.</p>
               <p>Now one would juſtly wonder
what theſe men think this thing
called Conſcience to be, ſurely no
leſs than ſome God Almighty
within them, and ſo indeed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
expreſſions of them ſeem to
intimate. But certainly, if they
thought Conſcience to be nothing
elſe but a mans own mind, or opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
or perſwaſion, or practical
Judgment (which certainly it is,
and no more) they could not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in reaſon or modeſty think
fit that this ſhould have ſuch a
paramount Authority as to bear
all down before it, at leaſt they
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61579:63"/>
could not imagine that their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
phancy or humour, their
particular Education or Idiopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
their ignorance or ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſhould be lawleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable.
For if mens opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or perſwaſions are infallible,
what is inſtruction for? if the
light within be ſufficient, what
is the light of holy Scripture for?
if Conſcience be a guide to it ſelf,
to what purpoſe are ſpiritual
Guides provided by divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for our conduct? and if that
may not be reſtrained in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy,
wherefore were Laws
made, and Magiſtrates appointed?
So that either this wild notion of
the power of Conſcience muſt be
falſe, or elſe Inſtruction and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation
are uſeleſs, Magiſtracy
and Miniſtry impertinent, and
both Laws and Scripture of no
effect. And if notwithſtanding
this notion be imbraced, it is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61579:63"/>
plainly impoſſible, that ſuch men
ſhould live either holily or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably.
Not holily, becauſe
Conſcience thus left alone to it
ſelf, without guide or rule, will
in all likelihood follow mens tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and inclination, and then a
mans moſt beloved Luſts ſhall be
the dictate of his Conſcience. Not
comfortably, becauſe he that is
deſtitute of a Law, and a guide
to reſolve him in difficulties, muſt
needs (if he conſider and be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of any thing at all) be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
with perpetual diſputes,
and endleſs ſcrupuloſity upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
undertaking.</p>
               <p>But it will be pretended that
there is no help for it, but when
all is done, men muſt and will
follow their own Conſciences;
foraſmuch as Diſcourſe, or Laws,
or Scripture, ſignify nothing till
they are applied by Conſcience;
they indeed may give aim, or may
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61579:64"/>
be of the nature of evidence in a
Cauſe; but it is Conſcience which
collects the reſult, and he that
complies not with that, is guilty
of ſin, whether the Evidence was
well ſummed up or no. To this
purpoſe ſome paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are uſually miſapplied: e. g.
<hi>Let a man be perſwaded in his own
mind,</hi> Rom. 14. 5. <hi>That which is
not of Faith is ſin,</hi> Rom. 14. 23.
<hi>and he that doubteth is damn'd,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>I do confeſs here is ſomething
of truth in this Plea, but blended
with a great deal of errour, and
here I verily believe lies the riſe
or occaſion of the perſwaſion of
the extravagant authority of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
But when we conſider
wiſely, the truth is no more but
this, that a mans Conſcience
ought to go along with him in
the acts of his Obedience to the
Law, or that he ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61579:64"/>
the thing is lawful to be
done before he does it, otherwiſe
he doth violence to himſelf, and
condemns his own act. But it
doth not follow, that therefore it
is lawful to do whatſoever he is
perſwaded of in his Conſcience,
or that it is not his duty to do
any thing but what he is ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
of; for this abrogates all
the Laws both of God and Man,
and makes their Legiſlations to
depend upon private conſent. If
therefore any man through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
or prejudice, or any ſuch
cauſe, ſhall have his Conſcience
alienated from the Law, or dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
otherwiſe to him; this as it
cannot make a Law, ſo neither
can it diſcharge him from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of one. All that this
works, is, that it puts a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſo ſad a caſe that he may ſin
both ways, that is, both in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and in diſobeying; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61579:65"/>
he is brought into this ſtrait
by his own default, it is evident
this cannot acquit his Conſcience;
for one ſin is no diſcharge for
another. That therefore which
he hath now to do, is firſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his Conſcience better, and
then to comply with the rule.</p>
               <p>And that this is the true ſtate
of this Caſe, will appear (beyond
all exception) by the reſolution
of our Saviour himſelf in two paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of the Goſpel; the former
Matt. 6. 23. <hi>if the light that is in
thee be darkneſs, how great is that
darkneſs!</hi> Where firſt he ſuppoſes
that the principles of a mans
mind or Conſcience may be very
falſe and erroneous, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces,
that he that is in ſuch a
Caſe is in a very deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
foraſmuch as the errour
of his Conſcience will be ſure to
run him upon miſcarriages of life,
and the priviledge of its being his
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61579:65"/>
Conſcience will not exempt him
from the conſequences of ſo
doing.</p>
               <p>The other paſſage is <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 2.
where he foretels his Diſciples
that they ſhould fall into ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
times, and lie under ſuch
prejudices &amp; miſpriſons with the
World, <hi>that thoſe that killed them,
ſhould think they did God good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi>
Now thoſe that think they
do good ſervice, and perform a
meritorious action in ſuch a thing,
moſt certainly follow their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
in ſo doing, and yet it is
as certain, that this did not juſtify
the fact; for then the Perſecutors
of Chriſtianity and Murderers of
the Apoſtles, muſt have been a
very conſcientious and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſort of men: wherefore it is
evident, that Conſcience is no
rule nor ſufficient warranty for
our actions.</p>
               <p>6. In the ſixth place let him
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61579:66"/>
who hath thoughts of attaining
the happineſs of the World to
come, take care of entertaining
an opinion of the impoſſibility of
Religion according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the holy Scripture. This
is a common prejudice upon the
minds of ignorant or cowardly
people, for they phanſy that a
life according to the Laws of the
Goſpel, is rather a fine ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or a philoſophical Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
than a neceſſary and practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
truth. They confeſs it would
be a very good and commendable
thing, if we could comply with
the rules of our Saviour, but they
look upon it as impoſſible, and
ſo of no indiſpenſable obligation.
For they ſay, our natures are ſo
corrupted by our fall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
our faculties are ſo weak and
impaired, that we are indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but infirmity on the one
ſide; and on the other, we are ſo
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61579:66"/>
beſet with temptations, and the
World, the Fleſh and the Devil,
are ſo much too ſtrong for us,
that we muſt ſin, there is no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
of it, and God muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and there's an end of the
buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Now if ſuch an opinion as this
poſſeſs a man, it will prove im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that ever he ſhould live
holily. For if natural corruption
have not infeebled us ſufficiently,
this cowardly conceit will be
ſure to do it effectually. For no
man (in this caſe eſpecially) is
ever better than his deſign, nor
riſes higher than his aim or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
(no more than water riſes
above its Fountain) nay, it is a
thouſand to one, but he that ſets
his mark low, will fall yet lower
in his proſecution; and he that is
cowed and dejected in his own
mind, ſo as to think he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
overcome the difficulties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61579:67"/>
him, moſt certainly never
will or can do it.</p>
               <p>He only is like to prove a good
Chriſtian, that reſolves with the
true-hearted Iſraelites to deſpiſe
difficulty and danger, and to
conquer the good Land, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it coſt him; for ſuch a man
unites his ſtrength, collects his
Forces, and diſheartens his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
as well as defies their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;
but the deſpondent cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly
Perſon, both infeebles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and incourages his Enemies;
ſo that he can neither attempt,
nor much leſs effect, any brave
thing.</p>
               <p>And the ſame conceit of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
will as certainly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our Spirits uncomfortable as
remiſs; becauſe after all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
a man can make for his
cowardice and remiſsneſs, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but obſerve the ſtrain of the
whole Scripture to be againſt
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61579:67"/>
him; and ſurely that man cannot
enjoy himſelf very well under
thoſe attainments, which God
and his own Conſcience condemn
as mean and unworthy.</p>
               <p>But after all, the ground of this
opinion is as falſe as it is miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous;
for in the firſt place, the
holy Scripture aſſures us of ſome
perſons, and particularly of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi>
and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Luk. 1. 6. <hi>That
they walked in all the commandments
of the Lord blameleſs, and were both
righteous before God,</hi> and yet they
were the Children of the ſame
<hi>Adam,</hi> and expoſed to all the
temptations, ill examples, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
with other men. Beſides,
the aforeſaid opinion, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of modeſty, and an humble
acknowledgment of humane
weakneſs, reflects very diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
both upon the wiſdom and
goodneſs of God, when it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
to the great Law-giver of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61579:68"/>
the World, ſuch over-ſight and
ſeverity, as to preſcribe ſuch Laws
as were not fitted to the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of thoſe that were to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to them, and to be judged
by them; unto which adde, that
it puts an intolerable ſlight upon
the power of Faith, and (which
is more) upon the very grace of
God alſo, as if neither of them
could carry us through all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
we ſhould be expoſed to.
Upon all which conſiderations
(and ſeveral ſuch other which
need not here be mentioned) this
opinion of the impoſſibility of
Religion appears to be very bad,
and ſuch as ought by all means to
be avoided by him that would
lead an holy and comfortable
Life.</p>
               <p>7. And yet there is another o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
which is both as common
and as dangerous as any of the
former; againſt which therefore
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61579:68"/>
I will give caution in the ſeventh
and laſt place, <hi>viz.</hi> when though
perhaps Religion ſhall not be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
pronounced to be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
yet it ſhall be thought to
be only the peculiar buſineſs, or
eſpecially to belong to ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſorts or conditions of men,
but not to be the general calling,
the neceſſary and indiſpenſable
duty of all men. Under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
ſerious and conſtant devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is looked upon as appropriate
to the Cloyſter, where men live
retired from the World, and are
thought to have nothing elſe to
do; or to be the imployment of
Churchmen, whoſe peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
it is; or for old and Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridden
perſons, who are fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, but a Prayer-Book; or
at leaſt for men fallen into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
who have no other thing
to retire to, and to ſuppor them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
withal, but the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61579:69"/>
of another World. But for
men of callings and buſineſs, or
for thoſe that are in the flower
of youth, and warmth of blood,
in health and proſperity, theſe
are thought to have allowances
due to them, at leaſt for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and the more ſolemn conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of Religion muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed
to another time. If in
the mean while ſuch as theſe go
to Church, and perhaps now and
then ſay their Prayers, it is as
much as is to be expected; for
their buſineſs is pretended to be
too great, or their temptations
and avocations too many, or at
leaſt their ſpirits are too light and
brisk to permit them to be ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
devotional, or to make Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Thus men make vain Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
but doth God Almighty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of them, hath he made any
ſuch exceptions or diſtinctions? no
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61579:69"/>
certainly, he hath made Religion
every mans duty, and hath char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>us firſt to ſeek the Kingdom of
God and his righteouſneſs;</hi> he hath
equally impoſed this task upon
Prince and Peaſant, Clergy and
Laity, rich and poor, Maſter and
Servant, young and old, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
and the proſperous, the
man of buſineſs as well as thoſe of
leiſure and retirement. He that
hath an abſolute ſoveraignty over
the World, that hath right to our
homage and attendance, that hath
laid infinite obligations upon us
to love and obey him; he that
hath conſidered and forecaſt all
our circumſtances, buſineſſes, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
temptations and excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
he that obſerves our carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
and behaviour towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he that cannot be deceived,
will not be mocked, and is no
accepter of perſons: He, I ſay,
hath made no ſuch exceptions or
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61579:70"/>
exemptions in this great concern
of Religion; and therefore they
cannot be mentioned without
great unreaſonableneſs, nor reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon without horrible dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>If indeed Eternity were the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
concern of a certain ſort
and condition of men only; or
if old men only died, and none
elſe; or if rich men can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
that only poor men ſhall
go to Heaven, then the other
ſorts of men may excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from devotion: but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it is the greateſt abſurdity
that can be to hope for the end
without the means.</p>
               <p>What though old men muſt dy,
yet will not young men quickly
come to be, old men too, at leaſt
if they do not die firſt?</p>
               <p>And what if men of retired
lives have more leiſure for Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and more time to ſpend in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61579:70"/>
it, yet is any man ſo hard put to
it, but that he may (if he will)
ſpare ſome time for his Soul and
Eternity?</p>
               <p>What if it be acknowledged
that Churchmen have peculiar
obligations upon them to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
Religion to others, yet it
is certain, that the neceſſity of
practiſing it, is common to others
with themſelves; foraſmuch as
there is no duty of it peculiar to
them, unleſs it be to be exemplary
in all.</p>
               <p>It is true, poor men, and men
in adverſity, are juſtly accuſable
of intolerable ſottiſhneſs, if they
who are frown'd upon by the
World, do not ſeek to repair their
unhappineſs by the favour of God
and the hopes of another World.
But it is as true, that rich men
and thoſe in proſperity, are as
juſtly to be upbraided with diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
and baſe ingratitude, if
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61579:71"/>
they be not devout towards him
that hath dealt ſo bountifully
with them.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, there is no cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or condition of men, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it they may (if they have a
heart to it) very affectionately at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon Religion, conſiſtently
enough with all other lawful bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
or occaſions. Almighty
Wiſdom hath not ſo ill contrived
the ſtate of this World, that there
ſhould be any neceſſity that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
ſhould ſupplant Religion,
or Religion intrench upon buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
nor if things be rightly
conſidered, are theſe two kind of
affairs ſo contrary, or doth Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
take up ſo much time, or ſo
much exhauſt mens ſpirits, but
with a good zeal and a little fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt,
both may be carried on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Or if it were otherwiſe,
and that the care of our Souls
would indeed weary our Bodies,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61579:71"/>
or the ſecuring of Heaven would
diſorder, and a little incommode
our ſecular intereſts; yet neither
is Life ſo certain, nor the preſent
World ſo conſiderable, nor Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſo mean and contemptible an
intereſt, as that a man ſhould not
be willing to put himſelf to ſome
trouble for the latter as well as
for the former.</p>
               <p>And as there wants not reaſon
for this courſe, ſo neither are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
wanting in this kind,
where men that might have
made ſuch excuſes, as aforeſaid (as
juſtly as any perſons whatſoever)
have notwithſtanding quitted and
diſdained them all, and applied
themſelves remarkably to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God and Devotion. For
if riches, and the variety of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cares and buſineſs which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
attend them, were a juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
from attendance upon Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
then <hi>Job</hi> might have claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61579:72"/>
exemption, who was the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
man in all the Eaſt, and yet
the devouteſt too. His thouſands
of Sheep, and Oxen, and Camels,
his abundance of Servants, his
numerous Family, and the care
of all theſe, did not tempt him
to the intermiſſion of one dayes
Devotion.</p>
               <p>If either the temptations and
pleaſures of Youth, or the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs
of a Court, or the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Examples of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or the cares of a prime Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of State, or the jealouſies
of a Favourite, could all together
have amounted to a juſt diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
from the ſtrictneſs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
then <hi>Daniel</hi> who was in
all thoſe circumſtances might
have pleaded it, and upon that
account might have retrencht his
Conſcience, and intermitted his
praying three times a day, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when he knew his Enemies,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61579:72"/>
watcht advantage againſt him in
this particular.</p>
               <p>If the general licence of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
the temptations ſuch men
are expoſed to, the neceſſities they
often are preſt with, or the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
avocations they muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to, could make a tolerable
apology for profaneneſs, or an
excuſe for Irreligion, then <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,
Acts</hi> 10. had been excuſed
from <hi>praying to God continually,
and ſerving the Lord with all his
houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, laſtly, if either the ſtate
and grandeur, or the Prerogative
of a Soveraign Prince, if the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity
of a King, or the glory
and affluence of a Kingdom; nay,
if either intereſt of State, or weight
of affairs, the Cares and Policies
of Government, had been all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſufficient to make a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
from the ſtrict obligations
of Religion, then <hi>David</hi> might
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61579:73"/>
have pretended to it, in abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his duty to God, and of
his conſtant and ardent Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>But all theſe holy men conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that God was a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
not to be trifled with, and
an impartial Judge, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of perſons, that Eternity
was of more conſequence than
the preſent Life, and Heaven bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than this World; and they
were ſo far from thinking an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Intereſt to be inconſiſtent
with the management of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
affairs, that contrarywiſe they
believed there was no ſuch effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
way to ſucceed in the latter
as by a diligent proſecution of the
former.</p>
               <p>But as for thoſe who being
convinced of the abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Religion, and of the inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſableneſs
of a total and final o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of it, would notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61579:73"/>
make it to be only the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of old Age, or a Sickbed;
theſe (although by the folly and
ſloth of men, they have too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
followers in their opinion, yet
certainly) are the moſt abſurd and
inexcuſable of all. Foraſmuch
as in order to the making ſuch an
Hypotheſis paſſable with their
own Conſciences, they muſt not
only ſuppoſe ſeveral very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
things, which no wiſe man
can have the confidence or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
madneſs to preſume upon;
but the very ſuppoſition it ſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
divers other things ſo baſe
and diſingenuous, as no good man
can be guilty of.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they make very bold and
deſperate ſuppoſitions, as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
that they ſhall live to old
Age, and die by a leiſurely and
lingring ſickneſs. That God will
then accept of mens return and
repentance (who never ſtopt in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61579:74"/>
their carriere of ſin and the
World, till Death arreſted them.)
That God will give them repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
what time they prefix to
him, or that they can repent
when they will. That they ſhall
be fit for the moſt weighty affairs
when they are at the laſt gaſp,
and the moſt important of all
buſineſs can be tranſacted when
their ſtrength and ſpirits are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted.
And to ſay no more,
that it is fit and tolerable for a
man to leave that to be laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
which if any accident
prevent him in, he is everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ruined. All theſe things muſt
be taken for granted by him that
ſhall venture to put off the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Soul to the laſt act of
his Life, every one of which are
at the beſt uncertain, and for the
moſt part falſe, and therefore to
build upon them is extream pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:61579:74"/>
Secondly, If the foundation of
ſuch a courſe were not rotten and
unſafe, yet that which is built
upon it is baſe and diſ-ingenuous;
for the man who upon any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
whatſoever can content
himſelf to put off the things
wherein Gods Honour and his
Souls Welfare are concerned to
the very laſt, proclaims he hath
an unreaſonable love and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this World, for the ſake
of which he poſtpones Religion,
and that he hath no real kindneſs
for, or good opinion of the ways
of God, in that he puts the care
of that buſineſs as far off, as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
he can; and indeed that he
would not mind God or his Soul
at all, if it were not for mere ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
and fear of damnation.
Now whether this then can be a
reaſonable courſe, or he be a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate
of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that governs himſelf by theſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61579:75"/>
meaſures, it is too eaſy to judge.
Wherefore let the man who hath
entertained any principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and hath any value for
his Soul, and care of Eternity, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
abominate and avoid this
laſt named, as well as all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
prejudices or opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>And having ſo done, let him
then attend to the more poſitive
and direct advices in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chapter.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="chapter">
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:61579:75"/>
               <head>CHAP. VIII. Directions for an effectual proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Religion.</head>
               <p>HE that is reſolved to be a
Chriſtian in earneſt, will
find it neceſſary (in the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his deſign) to attend to
the ſix following Directions.</p>
               <p>1. Let ſuch a man be ſure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to keep himſelf ſtrictly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
by which I mean, not only
that he avoid the extremity of a
debauch, but that he indulge not
himſelf ſo liberal an uſe of Wine
and ſtrong Drink, as that he ſhall
come too near the confines of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,
eſpecially in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
habit of his Life; or that he
take care that through facility or
careleſneſs he comply not with
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61579:76"/>
the too common practice in this
particular. Foraſmuch as it is
evident, that the approving a
mans ſelf to God, and the taking
care of Eternity, are ſuch weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and important affairs, that
they muſt needs require the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
compoſure of thoughts, and
the utmoſt intention of our
minds; and can neither be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
taken in hand, nor much
leſs purſued as they ought, in ſuch
a light and jolly humour as the
cuſtom of tipling doth ordinarily
put men into; for that relaxes a
mans thoughts, and fills his ſpirit
with froth and levity; it renders
the mind of a man ſo airy and
trifling, that he becomes tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with a jeſt, and diverted
by every impertinence; it ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
ſollicitude, and puts him
beſides his guard of caution and
circumſpection; a mans head in
ſuch a caſe is impatient of weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61579:76"/>
conſiderations, incapable of
grave deliberations; his thoughts
are fluctuating and uncertain, he
comes to no ſtable reſolution, nor
can he make any conſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs;
and ſurely ſuch a temper
cannot make a fit ſoil for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to take root in, or to thrive
upon.</p>
               <p>Beſides, intemperance doth not
only diſturb the reaſon of the
mind, but alſo weakens and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
it, and exalts phancy in
the room of it; which fills a man
with wild, looſe, and incoherent
Ideas: And which is ſtill worſe,
it raiſes the brutal paſſions alſo,
both iraſcible and concupiſcible,
and thereby makes work for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and mortification; which
muſt needs become a very hard
task to perform, when the ſame
cauſes which have made it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
have therewithal impaired
thoſe powers that ſhould accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61579:77"/>
it; and therefore this courſe
is utterly inconſiſtent with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of Religion.</p>
               <p>Moreover, beſides the evil of
intemperance it ſelf, it expoſes a
man to a thouſand temptations,
and puts him at the very mercy
of the Devil, foraſmuch as he
that is under the power of drink,
is not only out of Gods keeping,
but out of his own alſo; he hath
quenched Gods Spirit whileſt he
inflamed his own, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
himſelf of Gods Providence
by going out of his way, and he
is not perfectly in poſſeſſion of his
own mind, and therefore ſurely
is in a dangerous condition.</p>
               <p>To which adde, that whereas
ſobriety and watchfulneſs uſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to be accounted inſeparable
Companions; it is apparent, that
he who neglects the former, can
never be able to maintain the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and conſequently the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61579:77"/>
man cannot be fit for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Meditation, and other
great exerciſes of Piety. Upon
all which accounts our Saviour
S. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34. charges thoſe that
will be his Diſciples to <hi>take heed to
themſelves, leſt at any time their
hearts be over-charged with ſurfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and drunkenneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. In the ſecond place, let the
man who deſigns to proſecute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
effectually, take care of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance
of mind, as well as
of that of the body; and with
equal heed, avoid intoxication by
wild opinions, as he would do a
ſurfeit of meats and drinks. The
Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> complains of the
people of the Jews, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29. 9.
<hi>That they were drunken but not with
Wine, they ſtaggered but not with
ſtrong drink;</hi> and the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
men to <hi>be ſober minded:</hi> ſo
that it ſeems there is a kind of
ſpiritual drunkenneſs, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61579:78"/>
mens minds as much as the
other brutal cuſtom diſorders
their outward perſon. Of this
there are a great many inſtances,
but two moſt remarkable, <hi>viz.</hi>
opiniatre and ſcrupuloſity: I
mean by the former, when men
have no ſetled judgment in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but allow themſelves an
endleſs inquiſitiveneſs in matters
of opinion, and are always hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after novelty: By the other I
underſtand a captious or ſqueam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
humour of Conſcience, under
which men perpetually vex both
themſelves and others with unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
fears and jealouſies.</p>
               <p>As for the former of theſe, it
is notoriouſly the humour of ſome
men to be always doubting, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting,
and gazing after new
light, as if all mankind had been
impoſed upon till now, and the
old way were not the good way,
but every new invention, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61579:78"/>
notion contained ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
myſtery in it; therefore
they think it neceſſary to try all
things before they can hold faſt
that which is beſt, and indeed
ſurfeit on the forbidden Fruit of
the Tree of Knowledge of good
and evil, as if it were the ſame
with the Tree of Life. And if
perhaps they fall not into any of
thoſe dangerous opinions which I
gave caution againſt in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Chapter, yet it is by chance
if they do not; for they having
no judgment of diſcern the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of things, no ballaſt to
poiſe and ſettle them, are driven
up and <hi>down with every wind of
Doctrine;</hi> they are of the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the laſt Book they read, or
the laſt man they diſcourſed
with, for always the neweſt and
freſheſt opinion is the beſt; and
ſo (as they ſay of the Chameleon)
they take their colour from the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61579:79"/>
next object. This temper is a
mighty diſparagement to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
truth, for it looks as if there
were no certain way of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the minds of men, but that
they muſt always ſeek and never
find, and endleſly diſpute but
could never come to a reſolution:
and it is ſo intolerable an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the life and practice of
Religion, that it is many times
more harmleſs to be ſetled in
ſome bad opinions, than to be
thus unſetled, and to diſpute e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing. For beſides that
this courſe draws off the ſpirits of
men, and ſpends their beſt heat
upon unprofitable notions, and ſo
takes them off from ſtudying
their own hearts, examining their
Conſciences, and diligent attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to their ways and actions;
it raiſes paſſion, nouriſhes pride,
foments diviſions, and in a word,
turns Chriſtianity <hi>into vain Jang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:61579:79"/>
Whereas a truly ſober
Chriſtian is readier to believe
than to diſpute in divine things,
and more careful to practiſe old
rules than to deviſe new models;
he ſtudies the Scripture ſincerely,
not for objections but for reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
he lives up to what he
knows, and prays God to direct
him where he is uncertain; and
ſo is led by the Divine Grace in
a plain path towards Heaven. The
Novelliſt or great Diſputer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe,
being unreſolved of his
way, makes no haſt in his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and cannot very earneſtly
practiſe any thing to day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he cannot tell what opinion
he ſhall be of to morrow.</p>
               <p>And then for the other inſtance
of intemperance of mind, namely
ſcrupuloſity. When men have ſuch
headſtrong and ungovernable, or
ſuch ſhy and ſqueamiſh Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
that they boggle at every
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61579:80"/>
thing which doth not juſt fit
their peculiar phancy and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
though they can give no
reaſonable account of their jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy
or averſation, but only they
diſlike and are offended with ſuch
and ſuch (indifferent) things,
they know not why, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
takes check at them, and
there is no more to be ſaid in the
Caſe. Now ſuch as theſe can by
no means be reputed ſober men,
who (like as we ſay of Drunkards)
ſee double, and conſequently fear
where no fear is, or who are
terrified by their own idle phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
their brains being clouded
and darkened by the crude ſteams
of riot and exceſs. This temper
however in ſome caſes it may be
pitiable, is notwithſtanding very
miſchievous, not only as it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs
the Peace of the Church
and of Mankind, by rendering
thoſe who are under the power
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61579:80"/>
of it, buſy and pragmatical, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious
and uncharitable towards
all that are not juſt of their own
mode and ſize, but (which is far
worſe) it miſrepreſents the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Majeſty, as if he were a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Deity, who watched mens
haltings, to take advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, as having more mind
to damn than to ſave them. By
which means it diſcourages men
from Religion, as if it were the
moſt anxious and uncomfortable
thing in the World; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
of all this, it extreamly
hinders proficiency in virtue; for
he that is always jealous of his
way, will often make halts, or
have a very uncomfortable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, he that is
likely to make a good Chriſtian,
ſatisfies himſelf of the Divine
Goodneſs and Candour in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
the actions of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61579:81"/>
and being conſcious of his
own ſincerity, in following cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the rule of the Scripture, where
it is plain, thinks himſelf at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
where that is ſilent, and
takes the direction of his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Guides where it is obſcure,
and then goes chearfully and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly
on his way towards
Heaven.</p>
               <p>3. Next to regard of Sobriety
both of body and mind, let the
man who deſigns the other
World, take heed that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
World grow not too much
upon him, and diſtract or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden
him in his Journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Heaven: and the diligence
and circumſpection in this point
ought to be the greater, in regard
this World is placed near us, and
therefore is apt to ſeem great to
our ſight, and the other (though
incomparably greater) being at a
diſtance from us, is apt to ſeem
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61579:81"/>
little and contemptible. Beſides,
it is the chief aim of the Devil to
make the preſent World ſeem
much more beautiful and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than it is, that by its blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhments
he may ſoften us, by
its allurements debauch us, or at
leaſt by the care and concerns of
it diſtract us and take off our edge
to better things.</p>
               <p>It is certain alſo, that he whoſe
affections are eagerly ingaged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſecular intereſts, can never be
ingenuous and free enough to
have a right underſtanding of the
true and real difference of things,
nor conſcientious enough to ſtand
by that truth which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands;
for he can never be ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in any principles, but muſt
turn with every Tide, and ſail
with every Wind, as it ſhall make
for his purpoſe: Beſides, it is
plain, that our Souls are too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to hold much of this World,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61579:82"/>
and yet to afford room for any
great ſhare of Heaven together
with it. Therefore our Saviour
hath ſaid, <hi>ye cannot ſerve God and
Mammon,</hi> and accordingly in his
firſt Sermon on the Mount, <hi>Matt.</hi>
6. 24, 25, 26. to the intent that
his Doctrine of the Kingdom of
Heaven might take place in the
hearts of his Diſciples and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
he very emphatically and
largely cautions them againſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of the World, and too
eager purſuit of it. And in the
aforementioned paſſage, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.
<hi>v.</hi> 34. to his admonition againſt
over-charging themſelves with
ſurfeiting and drunkenneſs, he
ſubjoins <hi>the cares of this life,</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating,
that thoſe two kinds of
Vices (as oppoſite as they may
ſeem to each other) agree in their
malignant influence upon Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
neither indeed are they ſo
contrary in their natures as they
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61579:82"/>
ſeem to be; for as Drunkenneſs is
nothing but a liquid Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo on the other ſide, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs
is a kind of dry thirſt or
drunken inſatiable humour; and
it is ſo much the more dangerous
and incurable than the other, as
it is the leſs infamous, merely
becauſe it doth not preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it ſelf by ſuch odd and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
ſymptomes as the other
doth.</p>
               <p>To avoid this therefore, let the
man we ſpeak of, conſider con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
with himſelf the ſhortneſs
and uncertainty of the preſent
life, by which he will eaſily be
apprehenſive of how much more
conſequence it is to provide for
Eternity, than for that little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
we are to make in that ſtate
wherein the things of this World
are of any uſe to us.</p>
               <p>Let him alſo obſerve the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of things, and he will eaſily
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61579:83"/>
conclude, that much more of our
proſperity is owing to the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, than to our own
forecaſt and indeavours; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
that it is a better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for our Children and Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
to leave them under the
bleſſing of God, than in great
poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p>And in conſequence of theſe
perſwaſions, he will not be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to graſp too much buſineſs,
ſo as to hinder him in devotion,
but will rather conſider his own
ſtrength, <hi>viz.</hi> how much care
and labour he can undergo, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
depreſſion of his Spirit, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing
his mind; and will weigh
the dangers and temptations of
the World againſt the pleaſures
and all urements of riches.</p>
               <p>This will alſo incline him pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to methodize his affairs,
and to put that buſineſs which
ſeems neceſſary, into the beſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61579:83"/>
that ſo it may take its due
place in ſubordination to his
greater concerns, and not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
or interfere with them.</p>
               <p>To which purpoſe alſo, if he
have any conſiderable matters to
diſpoſe of, he will think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to ſet his Houſe in order
as well as his buſineſs, and have
always his <hi>Will</hi> made, not only,
that thereby he may be the more
effectually admoniſhed of his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
and be provided againſt
the ſurprizal of Death, but that
in the mean time he may have
the leſs ſollicitude upon his ſpirit,
and may the more ſingly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtractedly
apply himſelf to his
main buſineſs. And then</p>
               <p>4. In the fourth place let him
attend to the counſel of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the
Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> Ecclus. 2. 1. <hi>My
Son, if thou come to ſerve the Lord,
prepare thy ſoul for temptation,</hi> that
is, as if he had ſaid, </p>
               <q>
                  <p>Whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61579:84"/>
thou undertakeſt a courſe of
Religion, be not ſo fond as to
imagine thou ſhalt be able to
accompliſh it without ſweat and
difficulty, or ſo ſecure as to
think of obtaining the Crown
without a conflict, but expect to
meet with temptations of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
kinds, and arm thy ſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly;
eſpecially in thy firſt
entrance on ſuch a courſe, thou
muſt look for the ſharpeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters,
for thy Enemies are
not ſo ſoon vanquiſht as defied,
nor are they either ſo fair and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
as to give thee ſcope to harden
and fortify thy ſelf in thy enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
or ſo imprudent as to ſlip
the opportunity of thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſecurity together. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
in all ſuch caſes are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with the greateſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
and difficulties. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
rages moſt at firſt, out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
to ſuffer the prey to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61579:84"/>
be taken out of his mouth,
whereas when he is paſt hopes
of recovering it, he hath more
wit than to labour in vain, and
will not ſo much trouble himſelf
to tempt when he ſees no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of ſucceſs, but he is more
reſolute than quickly to deſpair
or give over his ſiege upon the
firſt denial of his Summons. No
he will ſtorm and batter thee
night and day, and caſt in all
his bombs and fiery darts to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
and compel thee to a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render.
And for the fleſh it is
certain, that the firſt checks
which are given to ſenſual incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
are harſheſt, and go
moſt againſt the grain, becauſe
they have uſed to take their full
ſcope and ſwinge; indeed when
a man hath accuſtomed them to
denial in their importunities,
they by degrees and in time
grow tame, and ſubmit to the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61579:85"/>
yoke of reaſon, as fire is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
by being ſuppreſt, or as a
violent torrent that is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a new Chanel, and reſtrained
its antient courſe, at firſt rages,
and foams and ſwells againſt
thoſe new banks, though at
length it ceaſes its tumult, and
runs along quietly within its
boundaries. It is not one over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
will diſhearten the old
man, he muſt be baffled and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht
over and over before he
will ceaſe to rebel, nor muſt
you think to find virtue eaſy till
you have accuſtomed your ſelf
to it; for nothing but cuſtom
can intirely ſubdue cuſtom,
wherefore (till that is introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced)
you muſt never be ſecure
but always upon your guard.
And then as for the World, the
firſt rejection of that out of a
mans heart is performed with as
great difficulty as any of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61579:85"/>
former; when a man hath once
caſt over-board that luggage
which otherwiſe was likely to
have ſunk him, it's poſſible he
may be glad of the exchange,
and deſpiſe what before he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired;
but it is a great matter
to be convinced of the neceſſity
of unburdening the Veſſel, and a
long diſpute before men are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to loſe any thing for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
It requires a great ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to ſee the empty Pageantry
of the World, ſo as to ſlight fame,
applauſe, riches, eaſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
a hard piece of ſelf-denial
to abridge himſelf of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
other men take; a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of a mans ſelf to be deaf
to all the charms, and inſenſible
of all the careſſes of the World,
and in a word, to keep a mans
Eyes and thoughts ſteadily fixed
upon another life.</p>
                  <p>Therefore there is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61579:86"/>
that a man ſhould count up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
difficulty in the undertaking
of Religion, leſt when it comes
upon him unforeſeen, he turn
recreant, and come off with
ſhame and loſs.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Beſides all this there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more which (I apprehend)
the Wiſe man intended in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
advice, namely, that he
that reſolves to be a virtuous man,
muſt fortify his mind, as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the perſwaſions, examples,
and diſcouragements of his leſs
conſiderate Friends and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
as againſt the bitter ſcoffs
and reproaches of his Enemies,
that neither the inſenſible inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the one diſſolve him into
lukewarmneſs and remiſsneſs, nor
the rough attacks of the other
ſink his ſpirits, and ſhake his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
               <p>Oppoſition from each of theſe
he muſt expect to meet with:
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61579:86"/>
from the former, out of folly, or
elſe in their own defence, that
ſuch a man's zeal may not reproach
their negligence; from the other,
out of malice and as aſſailants, that
they may reak their ſpight upon
God and his holy ways; and
therefore he ought to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for both.</p>
               <p>Againſt the ſoft inſinuations of
injudicious perſons, he muſt be
provided, <hi>by being girt about with
truth, and have on the breaſtplate of
righteouſneſs,</hi> as the Apoſtle advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 14. that is, he muſt
eſtabliſh his heart in an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
belief of the truth on his ſide,
by conſidering the authority of
God, the Example of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and other holy men, and
hence be able <hi>to render a reaſon of
the hope that is in him with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and fear;</hi> and if this do not
eaſe him of their fond importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
he muſt then put on ſome
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61579:87"/>
degree of moroſity, and reſolve
with <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 6. 22. that
<hi>if this be to be vile, he will yet be more
vile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt the rude treatments of
lewd and malicious men, he muſt
as the ſame Apoſtle adviſes, <hi>Eph.</hi>
6. 16, 17. <hi>take the ſhield of faith,
whereby he ſhall repel all the fiery
darts of the wicked, and for an hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
the hope of ſalvation;</hi> and in
contemplation of the Objects of
both thoſe, he will be able gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
to contemn all obloquy
and reproach, as diſdaining to be
hectored out of Salvation.</p>
               <p>In a word, for altogether he
muſt always remember, that ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial
is the firſt Leſſon of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
and that he that hath
not ſo learnt it, as <hi>to take up his
Croſs and follow Chriſt, cannot be
his Diſciple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. In the fifth place, let the
Candidate of the Kingdom of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61579:87"/>
Heaven take care that he do not
precipitate himſelf into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for as on the one ſide we
ought to behave our ſelves ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and bravely, when it pleaſes
God to lay it upon us, ſo on the
other ſide, ought we to be as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and timorous of drawing it
upon our ſelves; the firſt of which
is ſeldom ſeparate from the laſt;
for he that knows how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
a danger, will not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
thruſt himſelf into it; and
uſually thoſe who are ſo ſtupid
and fool-hardy, as to run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into difficulties, ſhew as
little courage and conduct in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
with them, as they did
diſcretion in the adventure upon
them; and no wonder, ſeeing in
ſuch a caſe they put themſelves
out of Gods protection, truſting
to themſelves, and then they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in reaſon expect other than to
be deſerted by his grace in ſuch
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61579:88"/>
unwarrantalbe enterprizes.</p>
               <p>Let the piouſly diſpoſed man
therefore not be ſo fond as to try
experiments upon himſelf, leſt
he buy his knowledge of his own
weakneſs at the coſt of too great
an hazard. Let him not go too
near ſin, in confidence that he can
divide by an hair, and come off
clever enough. For inſtance, let
him not nibble at an Oath, nor
mince the matter of profaneneſs,
nor drink to the higheſt pitch of
ſobriety, nor go to the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of juſtice in his dealings;
for he knows not the deceitfulneſs
of his own heart, nor conſiders
the ſlippery ground he ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that will thus venture to the
very brink of his liberty.</p>
               <p>Nor let him provoke Enemies
to himſelf by intemperate zeal, as
if a good man ſhould not meet
with oppoſition enough without
his own procuring, nor the World
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61579:88"/>
had malice enough unleſs he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
and exaſperated it; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
let him not thruſt himſelf
into lewd Company, in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his own integrity and
ſtability: for he hath no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
apprehenſion of the power
and malice of the Devil, who by
any of the aforeſaid imprudences
tempts him to tempt himſelf;
nay, nor doth he ſeem to hate
and abominate ſin ſo abſolutely as
he ought to do, that loves the
Vicinage and Neighbourhood of
it. What the wiſe man therefore
adviſes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 8. concerning
the whoriſh woman, is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to this Caſe, <hi>Remove thy
way far from her, and come not near
the door of her houſe;</hi> and ſo alſo
he ſaith of flagitious men, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.
14, 15. <hi>Enter not into the path of
the wicked, and go not in the way of
evil men, avoid it, paſs not by it,
turn from it, and paſs away;</hi> for he
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61579:89"/>
that goes ordinarily to the brink
of a Precipice, is in great danger
ſometime or other to fall in, and
he that nibbles at the bait, will
one time or other be taken with
the hook.</p>
               <p>6. Sixthly and laſtly, as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
man, and concerned for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Life, ought not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daring
and confident in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
towards ſin and danger,
ſo neither ought he on the other
hand to be timorous and ſtrait-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in things eminently and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably
good; whether it be
in inſtances of devotion towards
God, or of ſelf-denial and mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of himſelf, or in acts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
towards others; for in all
theſe, there is ſuch a ſcope and
latitude, as that a brave and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſpirit of Chriſtianity, may and
will diſtinguiſh it ſelf from a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and ſtingy temper in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:61579:89"/>
For Example, ſuch a man as
we ſpeak of, neither will nor
ought to confine his Devotions to
ſuch ſtrict and preciſe meaſures,
as that he that falls ſhort of them
will be guilty of an omiſſion of
his duty; but will contrarywiſe
find in his heart to ſpend ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than ordinary of his
time in Prayers and Meditation,
and ſuch other acts of immediate
worſhip. He will not ſtick to
apply ſomewhat more than the
juſt tenth or tythe of his increaſe,
to the incouragement of Religion;
nor will he grudge to deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
upon weighty occaſions, ſome
of that pleaſure which at other
times he can allow himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſin: or if occaſion be, he will
give alms, not only out of the
ſuperfluity of his eſtate, but to
the utmoſt of his ability, perhaps
beyond his convenience; for theſe
things though (generally conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered)
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61579:90"/>
they are not matters of
expreſs duty, yet do they not
ceaſe to be good, merely becauſe
they are not commanded, ſo long
as the ſpecies and kind of them
is commanded; and beſides, ſuch
extraordinary expreſſions of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to a general command, are
very fit to demonſtrate our love
to God, our gratitude for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
bounty towards us, and
our value of the Kingdom of
Heaven, ſeeing that by ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
eſpecially, we ſhew, <hi>that
we love the Lord our God with all
our heart, and ſoul, and ſtrength;</hi>
and that we think nothing too
dear for the aſſuring our ſelves of
Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>And though it would not be
expreſly a ſin to omit any one of
the inſtances of the ſeveral kinds
aforeſaid, yet it muſt be a palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
argument of a narrow heart
towards God, to yield no ſuch
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61579:90"/>
inſtances at all, and cannot but
proceed from very culpable ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
to be afraid of ſo doing;
nay more, for a man to be barren
of ſuch fruits, and careleſs of ſuch
performances, is a great point of
folly and imprudence towards our
ſelves, in reſpect of the comfort
which our hearts might receive
by ſuch generoſity; for although
by no after act of ours (how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
ſoever) it be poſſible for
us, to make any proper amends
to the Divine Majeſty, for our
former offences and omiſſions, yet
by ſuch expreſſions as theſe (we
ſpeak of) we ſhew our ſelves ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of thoſe miſcarriages, and
that we are under remorſe for
them, and we give proof, that
we truly love God, though we
have offended him, and deſire to
obtain his favour by the moſt coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oblations. Upon all which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
it ſeems very adviſeable,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61579:91"/>
that he who ſets his Face towards
Heaven, ſhould indeavour to open
and inlarge his heart this way,
and not ſuffer himſelf to be cramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and contracted by any odd opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Whereas therefore ſome men
ſeem to fanſie a frugal way of
Religion, and accordingly inquire
for the <hi>minimum quod ſic</hi> (as we
ſay) or the loweſt degree of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
grace, as if Heaven and Hell
were divided by an hair, and
they would be at the trouble of
no more piety than would juſt
carry them out of danger; They
are to be admoniſhed that they
ſeek after impoſſibilities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions;
for it is in truth as
if they ſhould ſay, they would
have fire without heat, Religion
without Devotion, Piety without
Affection, Holineſs without Zeal,
or that they deſire to fear God, but
have no inclination to love him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:61579:91"/>
To ſpeak plainly, the loweſt
degree of goodneſs is never
ſought after but in an ill temper
of mind, and by a cowardly and
hypocritical heart, nor can it be
found with comfort; for the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of grace is no more diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable
without the fruits, than a
body without its accidents; and
therefore there are but two ways
of obtaining true comfort in our
Souls, <hi>viz.</hi> either by our daily
proficiency, or by our extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
fervency. Firſt, By daily
proficiency we diſcover the life of
grace in our hearts, as we diſcern
a plant to be alive becauſe we ſee
it grows. Secondly, By extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
fervency, as when perhaps
a man hath not had time to give
proof of himſelf by a long courſe
of growing daily better and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he may yet demonſtrate a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
principle of good in his Soul,
by ſuch generous efforts of zeal as
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61579:92"/>
we have been ſpeaking of; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of which, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not only ſordid and ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
towards God, but very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
to our ſelves to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
for the mere eſſence of
grace, and to ſtand upon ſtrict
and preciſe terms of duty.</p>
               <p>But perhaps theſe men think a
pretence of modeſty will counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
them againſt any imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of cowardize or hypocriſy,
for they will ſay they are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the loweſt ſeat in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and ſo they may arrive at
that ſtate, they are ambitious of no
more. Silly men! as if it were a
culpable ambition to indeavour to
be very good! as if ſupreme hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
could be modeſtly or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſly
deſired! or that he either
underſtood or truly deſir'd Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
who would modeſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
others to enter before
him! No, no; the chiefeſt good
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:61579:92"/>
is deſirable for it ſelf, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
manner of deſiring it, is to
do it without meaſure and
bounds, and it is impoſſible it
ſhould be otherwiſe; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that hath theſe modeſt deſires
of Heaven, is either a ſtark hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
or hath no true notion of
that ſtate at all.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if it were or could be
poſſible for a man to be modeſt
and good in this ſenſe, I mean to
love Heaven but moderately, and
yet to comethere, notwithſtanding
it could not be without great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and danger, for a man to ſet
himſelf too low a mark in ſo high
a concern; for (as I obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
we ſee it is almoſt conſtant
with men to ſhoot below their
aim, and nothing more ordinary
than for their practice to fall
ſhort of their ſpeculations; and
therefore every man that would
not miſcarry in his deſign, takes
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61579:93"/>
care to direct himſelf high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
accordingly in this great
affair of Religion, he that yields
to ſuch a faint-hearted temper, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the notion of modeſty, will
not only never be very good, but
ſcarcely ever be tolerable or good
at all; for if his projections be
mean, his performances will be
worſe, in regard the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his own heart, the relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy
of the fleſh, and the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the Devil, will be ſure
to get ſome ground upon him;
and when abatements are made
for all ſuch diſadvantages, what
a pittiful dwarfiſh ſanctity will
this over modeſty arrive to at
laſt?</p>
               <p>But yet after all this, ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
will be found ſo ſilly as to
think, or ſo diſingenuous as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to a ſuſpicion, at leaſt, that ſuch
extraordinary works as we have
been now recommending, may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61579:93"/>
of merit or ſupererogation;
very likely, if any man could be
ſo abſurd as to attribute any ſuch
thing to them; but ſurely he that
takes his meaſures of things from
the holy Scripture, will be in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
danger of ſuch a groſs miſtake,
eſpecially whileſt we are expreſly
told by our Saviour, <hi>that when we
have done all that we can, we are ſtill
but unprofitable ſervants;</hi> for can
a mortal man oblige his Maker?
can infinite perfection become a
Debtor to Duſt and Aſhes? But
foraſmuch as God requires and
deſerves that we ſhould love him
with all our Soul, and heart, and
ſtrength; it is impoſſible we
ſhould love him too much, but
great danger we ſhould love him
too little: it cannot therefore
chooſe but be the wiſeſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
courſe to incline to the ſide
of God Almighty, and to favour
his intereſt againſt the ſenſuality,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61579:94"/>
deadneſs and deceitfulneſs of our
own hearts.</p>
               <p>O but (may ſome man ſay) will
it not at leaſt be will-worſhip to
affect uncommanded inſtances of
love to God and zeal of his glory?
I anſwer, it is poſſible that ſuch a
thing may be, if theſe things be
done with neglect of thoſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of love and zeal which God
hath particularly appointed; for
this looks as if a man pretended
to be wiſer than God himſelf, and
ſo would undertake to chooſe for
him, what he ſhould be pleaſed
with. But now, if neither his
appointments in ſpecial be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded
by theſe voluntary perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
nor theſe voluntary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
be unagreeable to thoſe
ſtanding and general rules he hath
given us, there can be no danger
that divine goodneſs ſhould ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
them, eſpecially ſince
there can be no imaginable reaſon
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61579:94"/>
why he that was pleaſed with a
free-will-offering under the Law,
ſhould be offended with the like
under the Goſpel; where above
all things he requires a free,
chearful, generous and reaſonable
ſervice.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let the man who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
believes there will be rewards
of well-doing in another World,
and is reſolved to obtain them, be
always <hi>ready to every good work,</hi>
and chearfully imbrace the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
wherein he may perform a
coſtly or a difficult ſervice; and
let him take care that no traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of men, nor ſuperſtitious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of his own head, neither the
example of other mens careleſs
lives, nor the too natural remiſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his own heart, prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him to neglect ſuch inſtances,
whereby the glory of God may be
moſt advanced, and his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
aſſured.</p>

PRACTICE

Holy and Comfortable
LIVING.</head>
               <head>CHAP. I. Of ſecret Devotion, between God
and a Mans own Soul, and
particularly of Prayer.</head>
               <p>HItherto in the former part
of this little Book, we
principally deſigned theſe
four things, Firſt, To diſcover
the foundations of Religion in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61579:97"/>
and from thence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
the reality, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and neceſſity of it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
To ſettle mens judgments and
determine them in the choice of
their profeſſion of Religion in
particular. Thirdly, To give
caution againſt certain common
but dangerous miſtakes, which
might otherwiſe undermine and
diſappoint the ends and purpoſes
of Religion. Fourthly and laſtly,
To lay down ſome general di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
neceſſary to be premiſed
in order to the effectual proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a religious deſign, and all
this we comprized under the title
of <hi>An Introduction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now we come to build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe foundations, and more
particularly and plainly to draw
out the lines of an holy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Life.</p>
               <p>Here therefore it may ſeem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
that we ſhould in the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61579:97"/>
firſt place conſider the extent and
whole compaſs of Religion, to
the intent that it may not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for ſuch a narrow and ſtingy
thing as the generality of men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
it, namely to ſhew, that
it is not a mere ſcuffle about opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
nor a canting with peculiar
phraſes, neither a clubbing into
a diſtinct party under the notion
of a Church or ſelect Society, nor
yet the formal acting of a part
with the obſervance of abundance
of nice Rites, Ceremonies and
Punctilio's; that it is not a thing
which looks beautifully, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
fairly in publick, but is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
or laid aſide at home, nor
is it immured in a Cloſet, and never
ſufferd to take the air in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;
to ſay no more, that
it is not mere morality, nor mere
devotion, but both theſe in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
together with all that
is brave and noble, and wiſe and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61579:98"/>
good; all that can better the minds
and tempers, and lives of men,
and all that can improve the ſtate
of the World; all this is within
the Verge of Religion, eſpecially
the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>For ſo the Apoſtle intimates,
Phil. 4. 8. <hi>Finally Brethren, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
things are true, whatſoever
things are honeſt, (or grave), what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
things are juſt, whatſoever
things are pure, whatſoever things
are lovely (or friendly), whatſoever
things are of good report, if there be
any virtue, and if there be any
praiſe, think of theſe things,</hi> i. e.
Count them branches of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
for true Religion is nothing
leſs, nothing, I mean of no nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
extent than a wiſe and
worthy conduct and manage of a
mans ſelf in all thoſe Relations we
ſtand in, namely towards God,
our Neighbour, and our ſelves.</p>
               <p>This I take to be the true notion
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61579:98"/>
and the juſt Province of Religion,
but I can neither think it poſſible
to handle all the parts of ſo vaſt
a ſubject in this ſhort Treatiſe,
nor indeed do I apprehend the
diſcourſing of them all to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
neceſſary to thoſe for
whoſe uſe I principally intend
theſe Papers. Therefore omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
(but not excluding) all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
branches of Religion, I will
here only ſpeak of theſe three
things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of ſecret Devotion, or
thoſe acts of Piety which are
tranſacted only between Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God and a Mans own Soul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Of private Piety, or
the exerciſes of Religion in every
particular Family.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Of the more publick
acts of Religion, and concerning
a mans governing himſelf ſo as to
conſult the honour and ſervice of
God in the Pariſh wherein he lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:61579:99"/>
I begin with the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> of
ſecret or Cloſet Devotion.</p>
               <p>That this is an eſſential branch
of true Religion, and a neceſſary
and univerſal duty, appears by
the command of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi>
6. 6. <hi>When thou prayeſt, enter into
thy Cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut
the door, pray to thy father who is
in ſecret,</hi> &amp;c. in which words it
is not our Saviours meaning to
forbid or put a ſlight upon all but
Cloſet Devotion; for he himſelf
frequently prayed publickly and
taught his Diſciples ſo to do; nor
though he ſpeak of a Cloſet, doth
he intend to confine this duty to
the ſtrict formalities of a Cloſet,
but that it may be done in the
Fields, or in any receſs or place
of ſecrecy whatſoever, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
practiſed; nor laſtly, though
he uſe the word Prayer only, doth
he make that ſtrictly taken to be
the whole office of ſecret Piety;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61579:99"/>
for it is uſual in the Scripture,
and in common ſpeech alſo, to
expreſs all the acts of immediate
worſhip by the name of Prayer,
whether they be Praiſes, or Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
or Confeſſions, or Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
or Meditation or Self-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination;
all therefore which
our Saviour here intended, was
to repreſent the neceſſity of ſecret
Devotion as well as publick, and
to preſs that upon his Diſciples
which the hypocriſy and oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Phariſees had laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
becauſe in truth they ſought
not Gods glory but their own.</p>
               <p>And this is further recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to us by the univerſal pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of all good men in all Ages
and Countries of the World, and
of whatſoever opinion or perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
otherwiſe. There have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
been thoſe who under ſome
pretence or other have neglected
Family worſhip, and thoſe alſo
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61579:100"/>
who have been abaſed by ſome
ſcruples into an omiſſion of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
worſhip; but I verily think
that none but flat Atheiſts, or
groſs Hypocrites (which are much
the ſame thing) could ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with themſelves in the
common and habitual neglect of
ſecret worſhip; for a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe there is a God, or
much leſs have any worthy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of him, but it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
puts him upon ſome act or
other of adoration towards him.</p>
               <p>Acts of publick worſhip are to
the Soul as exerciſe is to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
it may live and ſubſiſt, though
not long and healthfully without
it; but ſecret Devotion is like the
motion of the heart and lungs,
without which a man is preſently
choaked up and deſtroy'd; if his
heart do not move towards God,
and as it were by circulation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
in praiſes, all thoſe benefits
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61579:100"/>
which it continually receives
from him, it is ſtifled by reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and if by Prayer he do not
breathe out his griefs, and as it
were ventilate his ſpirits, he is
ſtrangled by his own melancholy:
for the publick performance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
offices cannot make a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
in theſe Caſes, becauſe every
man hath his ſecret ſins to confeſs
to God, which it is ordinarily
unſafe to make other men privy
to, and his peculiar infirmities
and temptations, his griefs and
burdens, which it is in vain to
lay open to men, ſeeing only God
can relieve them; and every man
hath received ſundry perſonal
mercies and ſavours from the
hands of God, in anſwer of his
Prayers, which require a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
acknowledgment to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Goodneſs. And the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a mans heart in any of theſe
Caſes is commonly attended with
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61579:101"/>
ſuch affections and paſſionate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
as would be indecent
to the Eyes of men, though they
are very becoming towards God,
in reſpect of which laſt thing, we
find, 1 <hi>Sam. 1. 13. Hannah</hi> was
thought to be drunk, by the holy
and wiſe man <hi>Eli</hi> the Prieſt, when
yet, as the truth appear'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
he ſaw in her only the
devout ſymptoms of a ſorrowful
Spirit.</p>
               <p>Beſides, theſe acts of ſecret
worſhip are very neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to publick worſhip, both as
they diſpoſe and fit a mans heart
for it before he enters upon it, by
compoſing the thoughts and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the affections; and as they
make application of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
preſſing home upon the
Conſcience, the inſtructions there
received, and improving and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
into a ſtable reſolution,
thoſe good affections and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61579:101"/>
which were ſtirred up by
it; inſomuch, that that man will
either have no mind to Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
ſervice, or no ſuitable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in it, or be little the better
after it, that hath not firſt fitted
and prepared his heart for it by
ſecret Devotion. And herein lies
the true reaſon, as well of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
unprofitableneſs as of
the common irreverence of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
performances; becauſe men
ruſh into Gods Houſe without the
due Preface of ſecret preparation,
and they turn their backs upon
God when they depart from the
Church, never attending to, or
improving thoſe good motions
which the ſpirit of God had kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in them.</p>
               <p>Moreover, theſe devout offices
of Religion, though they are by
no means to ſupplant and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede
the publick (as we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
already, and ſhall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61579:102"/>
at large by and by) yet in
ſome reſpects they are more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God than the other;
foraſmuch as they are founded
upon an acknowledgment of his
Omniſcience, and demonſtrate
the great and intimate ſenſe we
have of the Divine Majeſty, and
conſequently of this they give the
greateſt aſſurance to our own
hearts, of our ſincerity, and ſo are
the moſt comfortable: for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Devotion may poſſibly have
a great alloy of ſecular intereſt,
and may owe it ſelf in a great
meaſure to the authority of Laws,
or to publick fame and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but he that worſhips God in
ſecret, where and when no Eye
is privy but only that of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
is ſecure to himſelf, that
he can have no mean or ſiniſter
end in ſo doing, nothing can move
him to this but the mere reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of God, and therefore our
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61579:102"/>
Saviour in the forementioned paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 6. lays an Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
upon thoſe words, <hi>thy father
which is in ſecret,</hi> and adds this
incouragement of ſuch addreſſes
to God, <hi>thy father which ſeeth in
ſecret will reward thee openly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon all which conſiderations
let the man who either values
Gods glory, or his own improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Peace and Comfort, or
indeed who makes any pretence
to Religion, ſtrictly make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of, and conſtantly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
ſecret Devotion. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
extent, manner, inſtances
and circumſtances whereof, I am
now further to explain in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
particulars.</p>
               <p>1. And I begin with that
which is ſo univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
and ſo principal a part of
Divine Worſhip, that (as I noted
before) it is ordinarily put for the
whole, I mean <hi>Prayer to God,</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:61579:103"/>
touching the ſecret exerciſe
whereof, let the good Chriſtian
take theſe following Directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let him not fail Night
and Morning (at leaſt) ſolemnly
and devoutly to pray to God: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
holy men we read of, who
according to the greatneſs of their
zeal, or urgency of the occaſion
for it, have preſcribed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſtricter meaſures than this;
particularly, <hi>David</hi> ſaith he would
worſhip God ſeven times in a day,
and <hi>Daniels</hi> cuſtom was to do it
three times a day, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10. as
ſeems alſo to have been that of the
Primitive Chriſtians; but leſs than
twice a day I cannot find to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with the practice of any good
men, unleſs either ſickneſs diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
them, or ſome very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
occaſion diverted them:
and it is wondrouſly fit and deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
that we, who owe our
whole time to God, ſhould pay
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61579:103"/>
him the tribute of devoting thoſe
critical periods of it (I mean Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Morning) to him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in conſideration of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
circumſtances theſe two
points of time are attended with,
namely in the Evening, having
finiſhed the courſe of that day,
and reflecting upon our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in it, we cannot but obſerve
by how many failings we have
juſtly incurred Gods diſpleaſure,
if he ſhould ſeverely animadvert
upon us; and therefore have great
cauſe to deprecate his anger, and
to make our peace with him: and
we muſt needs alſo be ſenſible
both how many dangers we have
eſcaped, by his Providence, and
how many inſtances of bleſſing
we have received from his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and therefore have reaſon
to praiſe and magnify his name;
nd eſpecially being then alſo to
betake our ſelves to ſleep, when
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61579:104"/>
above all times we are out of our
own keeping, and are expoſed to
a thouſand dangers from thieves,
from malicious men, from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Elements of Wind, Fire and
Water, from the enterprizes of
evil ſpirits, and frightful Dreams,
and our own fooliſh Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in which and ſundry other
reſpects, no man <hi>knows what a
night may bring forth,</hi> and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of which, he is a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly
ſecure, and fool-hardy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that doth not think it highly
to be his intereſt, by peculiar ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes,
to recommend himſelf
and all his concerns to the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Eye of Providence, <hi>which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſlumbers nor ſleeps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the Morning, having
not only by the guard of holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
been preſerved from all thoſe
dangers which might have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
us in the dark, and when
our ſenſes were ſo lockt up that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61579:104"/>
we could not help our ſelves, but
refreſhed and recruited in all our
powers by that admirable divine
Opiate, ſleep; nothing leſs can
become us than to conſecrate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
all theſe reſtored powers to
our Creator and Preſerver, by
hearty Adorations. Beſides this,
we are then ſenſible that we are
now entring upon a new ſcene of
buſineſs, where we ſhall be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to innumerable accidents, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
difficulties, and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
none of which we are match
for without divine aſſiſtance, and
have therefore need to implore his
grace and good providence before
we encounter them, ſo that it is
not timidity or ſuperſtitious fear,
but juſt wiſdom not to dare either
to go to Bed, or to ſet our foot
out of doors, till we have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
our ſelves to Almighty
God by Prayer. And by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as aforeſaid) we maintain
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61579:105"/>
the <hi>juge ſacrificium,</hi> and (in Gods
gracious interpretation are ſaid
to) <hi>pray continually,</hi> and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate
our whole time to him;
and beſides, we keep up a lively
and conſtant ſenſe of him upon
our hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let him be ſure that
theſe duties be done fervently as
well as conſtantly and frequently,
not formally and cuſtomarily,
without life and feeling of what
a man is about, or with wandring
thoughts and diſtracted affections,
but with the greateſt vigour and
intention of mind that is poſſible;
for if a mans heart be flat and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
in theſe ſpecial approaches
to God, he will be ſure to be much
worſe, and even looſe and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical
upon other occaſions; for
theſe ſecret duties are the ſpecial
inſtruments and exerciſes of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
our hearts towards Heaven,
and as it were the nicking up of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61579:105"/>
our Watch to that cue in which
we would have it go.</p>
               <p>In the more publick offices of
Religion the credit and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it is principally concerned,
and therefore they ought to be
performed with all gravity and
ſolemnity, but the very life and
ſoul of piety lies in theſe ſecret
duties, and therefore they ought
to be diſcharged with the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſenſe and moſt inflamed affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
inſomuch that a man
muſt not think he hath acquitted
himſelf when he hath repeated
ſuch, or ſo many Prayers, until
he find alſo his heart warmed, and
his temper of mind raiſed and
improved by them; to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
therefore, let him in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
upon theſe retirements
place himſelf under the Eye of
God, and be apprehenſive of the
immediate preſence of the Divine
Majeſty, that this may give check
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61579:106"/>
to all levity of ſpirit and wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thoughts, and make him
grave and reverential; let him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
all along be ſenſible of the great
value and neceſſity of thoſe things
which he either begs of God, or
returns thanks for; that this may
render him ardent in his deſires,
and affectionate in his praiſes,
and whileſt he perſeveres in theſe
duties, let him join with them,
reading and meditation, not only
to fix his mind, but to prevent
barrenneſs, and to impreganate and
inrich his Souls with divine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and affections. To this end,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let him take care that
he tempt not himſelf to flatneſs
by an affected length of theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
duties; for though it be a ſign
of an indevout temper to be too
compendious and conciſe in them,
as if we grudged the time ſpent
in Gods Service; and although
it be alſo irreverent towards God
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61579:106"/>
to be ſo ſhort and abrupt, as if we
briefly dictated to him what we
would have done; yet it is to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the ſame fault, to be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
tedious with him, as if he
could not underſtand us without
many words, or would be wrought
upon by tedious importunity.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
that often, <hi>when the ſpirit
is willing, the fleſh is weak,</hi> and that
our bodies cannot always corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond
with our minds: now in
ſuch a caſe to affect the prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Devotions, is to loſe
in the intention what we get in
the extenſion of them; for it will
be ſure either to make us go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly
to our duty, or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it very ſuperficially; in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of which circumſtances it is
not likely we ſhould be pleaſing
to God, or be able to make any
comfortable reflections after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
upon ſuch performance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:61579:107"/>
The meaſures of Devotion
therefore are not expreſly preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by God, but are to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by a prudent reſpect to
the peculiar conſtitution of the
perſon, the condition of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and the extraordinarineſs
of the occaſion; and to go about
to exceed theſe bounds, is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of intemperate zeal,
which is never acceptable to God,
and is ſo far injurious to a mans
ſelf, that it manifeſtly hinders
what it pretends to promote. To
theſe I add,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let not the devout
man be very curious or ſollicitious
about the from or expreſſions of
his ſecret duties; I mean, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Prayers be read out of a
Book, or be the preſent concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his own mind, ſo long as
they are offered up from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
Soul, and an humble
and affectionate heart, for theſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61579:107"/>
are all the things that God looks
at, and wherein his honour is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
concerned; and therefore
as he hath no value for eloquence
of ſpeech on the one hand, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath he for ſtrength of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
or for pregnancy and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of phancy on the other;
but only (as I ſaid) that we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him with our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and do not like Parrots, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
words whereof we have no
ſenſe or notion; that we bring an
humble and contrite ſpirit, as ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the infinite diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and us, and an heart
ſeriouſly affected with his preſence
and the nature and value of the
things we are converſant about.</p>
               <p>It is true, that a compoſed
form is moſt ſutable to publick
worſhip, where (as I noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
the dignity and credit of
Religion is concern'd, and that
perhaps in private duties, our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61579:108"/>
conceptions may moſt pleaſe
and affect our ſelves; but our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
with God (eſpecially in
theſe ſecret duties) depends nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the one nor the other,
but upon thoſe inward diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Soul aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let no man cheat
himſelf into an opinion that thoſe
heats of phancy or tranſports of
affection which ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in conceived Prayer, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of real and extraordinary
devotion; or that becauſe the uſe
of a form or Book may perhaps
be deſtitute of ſuch flights, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thoſe duties are dead and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal:
foraſmuch as thoſe ſervices
may be moſt acceptable to God
which are leſs pleaſant to our
ſelves; ſince it is not thoſe ſudden
flaſhes but a conſtant and even
ſervour of piety which he hath
regard to. And this leads me to
another advice, namely,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:61579:108"/>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let the pious man
think himſelf obliged to <hi>pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ceaſing,</hi> and that he is never to
lay aſide or intermit the regular
courſe of a daily devotion upon
any pretence whatſoever, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
not upon the abſurd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of awaiting the motion of
the ſpirit; for although it be
true, that the Spirit of God ceaſes
not to move men to their duty,
the way of the Spirit of God is not
to move ſenſibly, and to make
violent impreſſions upon us; and
therefore he that ſuſpends the
performance of his duty till he is
ſo jogged and ſtirred up to it,
will never pray at all: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
what reaſon can there be to
expect ſuch a thing, or what need
of it in the caſe of a known duty?
if it were the will of God to put
us upon ſome extraordinary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
then it were reaſonable to
expect ſome ſpecial mandate or
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61579:109"/>
impulſe upon our ſpirits from
him, which might both warrant
the enterprize, and quicken us in
the proſecution; but in ordinary
duties, the motion of the holy
ſpirit in the Scripture, is and
ought to be ſufficient, and he that
will not be ſtirred up by that,
doth but pretend to wait for a
ſpirit in excuſe of his own Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm,
Unbelief, or intolerable
ſlothfulneſs; and in ſo doing lays
himſelf open to an evil ſpirit,
whoſe deſign it is to check and
withdraw men from Religion,
and this is matter of ſad and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
experience, that from wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the motion of the ſpirit,
men very uſually grow firſt to
frequent omiſſions, then to care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs
of their duty, and at laſt
to a total neglect of it.</p>
               <p>Therefore let not any man
ſlight a regular and methodical
Devotion, as a meer formal and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61579:109"/>
cuſtomary thing, ſince this is the
very attainment of Piety, when
that which is matter of duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
alſo in a good ſenſe cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
and habitual; and he that
out of ſuch a temper performs the
duties of Religion conſtantly and
reverently, gives far greater proof
of ſincere Chriſtianity, than he
that ſeems to himſelf to do them
with greater heat and tranſport,
but needs from time to time to be
jogged and provoked to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To all theſe I adde in
the laſt place, that it is very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable,
though not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
that in theſe ſecret Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
a man ſhould (where it
may be done with privacy, and
without oftentation or ſuch other
impediment) pray vocally and
audibly; for although God knows
our hearts, and obſerves all our
thoughts, and the motions of our
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61579:110"/>
affections before we expreſs them,
and therefore needs not that we
ſhould interpret our minds to
him by words, yet it is fit we
ſhould imploy all the powers and
capacities we have in his ſervice;
our Bodies as well as our Souls,
and our Lips as well as our hearts.
Beſides, though we cannot affect
God with the tone and accents of
our Speech, yet we often times
affect our own hearts the more,
and raiſe them a note higher in
concord with the elevation of our
Voices: but that which I princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
intend is this, <hi>viz.</hi> by the
harmony of our tongue and voice,
our hearts are as it were charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the greater compoſure and
intention upon that we are about.
And ſo whereas it is the uſual
complaint, eſpecially of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
and thoughtful perſons,
that their hearts are apt to rove
and wander in theſe ſecret duties
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61579:110"/>
of Religion, by this means we
have it very much in our power
to keep them from extravagancy,
and at once to make our Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the leſs tedious to our ſelves,
and the more acceptable to God.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of ſeveral other inſtances of ſecret

               <p>THough Prayer be the moſt
general duty of Religion,
the common inſtrument of all Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
and the moſt immediate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
to God; yet it is a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
to make it the only inſtance
of ſecret Devotion, for there are
ſeveral others of great moment,
amongſt which I reckon in the
next place,</p>
               <p>2. Study and Meditation; not
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61579:111"/>
only to direct and aſſiſt our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
(of which I ſaid ſomething
before) but eſpecially to cultivate
and improve our own minds, that
we may be wiſer, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
both more capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God better ſervice in this
World, and alſo fitter for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Angels and the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<hi>of the ſpirits of juſt men made
perfect</hi> in the other World. For
we are to conſider, that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
hath ſet a mighty value
upon our Souls, in redeeming
them by no leſs a price than the
blood of his only Son; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſhould be intolerably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
towards him, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
no coſt upon them, but live
as if we were mere matter and
body, and take care only to pleaſe
and gratify our ſenſes, and in the
mean time abandon our minds to
folly and ignorance, to ſloth and
ſuperſtition. <hi>We are to conſider</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:61579:111"/>
alſo, that the ſame infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
hath by the ſame purchace
deliver'd us from the fear of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Death, which otherwiſe would
have kept us in perpetual bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and ſo have contracted our
ſpirits, and rendered our very
ſelves ſo inconſiderable to our
ſelves, that no man could have
had the heart to take any care of
himſelf, but would be tempted to
have lived like a beaſt becauſe he
expected to die like one, or worſe;
but now that we are made to
hope for immortality, and to live
for ever and ever, there is great
reaſon a man ſhould ſpare no coſt,
no labour and pains about him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
ſince he may reap the fruit
and enjoy the comfort of ſo doing
in the better enjoyment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a thouſand Ages hence, and to
all Eternity. Moreover the ſame
Divine Goodneſs hath deſigned
us to a glorious eſtate of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61579:112"/>
in his own Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
a ſtate of intellectual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and the moſt ſublimed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
of felicity, which a
dull, ſottiſh, and ſenſual Soul can
never be capable of perceiving, if
he were placed in the midſt of
them, and therefore he is more
than brutiſh that doth not diſpoſe
himſelf ſo, that <hi>he may be meet, to
partake of that inheritance with the
Saints in light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all this we are to conſider,
that the general apoſtafy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
hath weaken'd our natures,
clouded our underſtanding, and
diſorder'd all our powers; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
herewith the fooliſh opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and traditions of the World
have abuſed and deceived us yet
more and more, ſo that we muſt
be moſt ſilly and unhappy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
if we do not indeavour to
deliver and diſingage our ſelves
from both theſe Calamities. And
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61579:112"/>
the caſe is not totally irreparable
in reſpect of either of theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
if we be not wanting to
our ſelves; for to the intent that
we might in ſome meaſure reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our ſelves, it hath pleaſed
God to give us time to conſider
in privacy and retirement from
the noiſe of the World, that we
may recollect our ſelves; he hath
ſet before us his works and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
to meditate upon, we
have his holy Scriptures to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
our minds, and guide us
out of the perplexed ſtate of
things we enjoy, the publick mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
and abundance of good
Books to help us to underſtand
thoſe Scriptures, and above all
we are aſſured of the aſſiſtances
of his holy ſpirit againſt the
weakneſs and confuſion of our
own underſtandings.</p>
               <p>So that as there is great reaſon
and great neceſſity that we
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61579:113"/>
ſhould apply our ſelves to ſtudy
and meditation; ſo we have as
great incouragement to hope for
ſucceſs in ſo doing: for by appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of our ſelves to the means
aforeſaid, we may not only rid
our ſelves of that wildneſs and
ferity which is ordinarily upon
our natures, but outgrow vulgar
opinion and tradition, and come
to be able to make a true eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of things ſet before us; we
may greaten our ſpirits ſo as to
deſpiſe thoſe little things which
ſilly men dote upon; we may
free our minds of childiſh fears
and unaccountable ſuperſtitions;
we may underſtand the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Religion, the lovelineſs of
virtue, and in a word, have wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier
notions of God, and clearer
apprehenſions of the World to
come.</p>
               <p>And although it be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that all men are not alike
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61579:113"/>
capable of theſe improvements,
either by reaſon of the weakneſs
of their minds, or the unhappy
conſtitution of their bodies, or
the perplexed condition of their
outward affairs; yet certainly
God Almighty hath by the means
aforeſaid put it into every mans
power to be wiſer than he is if he
would but apply himſelf to the
uſe of them, and therefore let the
devout man be ſure to make the
experiment.</p>
               <p>To further him the more
wherein, let him to all the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
foregoing adde theſe
two following. Firſt, That for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as he was made in Gods
Image, it is no leſs than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Divine Majeſty to
have no regard to the cultivating
and adorning that part of himſelf
wherein he eſpecially reſembles
his Maker; and conſequently it
will appear to him to be a very fit
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61579:114"/>
and proper inſtance of worſhip
towards God to improve his own
Soul; and therefore it is here juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
placed amongſt the expreſſions
of Devotion. Secondly, Let him
conſider, that the great game of
Eternity is but once to be plaid,
and that there is no retrieving of
our neglects and careleſsneſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards;
therefore there is all
the reaſon in the World that we
ſhould play it intently and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily:
my meaning is, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ought to redeem time
from folly and ſenſuality, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it to the advantage of our
Souls; and he that doth ſo, and
begs Gods bleſſing upon it, will
undoubtedly find his mind inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
his life more regular, and
his ſpirit more comfortable, which
are all the chief ends of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>3. The next inſtance of ſecret
Devotion (for I am not curious
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61579:114"/>
in what order I place them) ſhall
be the exerciſe of Faith in God
and dependance upon him, in
purſuance of an acknowledgment
that he alone governs the World,
and the framing a mans heart to
take notice of him, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to him, and ſtay it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him in all exigencies, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and paſſages whatſoever,
that he may impute nothing to
chance, fate or the ſtars, but poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
himſelf with a deep and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
apprehenſion of the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of God in all revolutions or
occurrences.</p>
               <p>This is a point of great and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
honour to the Divine Majeſty,
as it ſets God always before us,
and places him continually in our
Eye, as it brings us to an intire
reſignation of our ſelves to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and puts us into a conſtant
gravity and a reverence towards
him, as it provokes us to addreſs
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61579:115"/>
our ſelves to him upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to pray to him, to truſt in
him, to walk humbly and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
before him. And it is of
mighty advantage to our ſelves,
as it ſtrengthens and fortifies our
weak ſpirits by the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that mighty providence we
are under, and that we are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
by a wiſe, and good, and
powerful Being, whom nothing
can be too hard for, and who is
liable to no ſurprize or miſtake,
as it aſſures us, that nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals
without him, and therefore
every thing is ordained for wiſe
ends, and ſhall be turned to good
in the concluſion; this alſo ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
us to be contented in every
condition, ſecure againſt all fears,
and to arrive at ſuch an evenneſs
of ſpirit, that we ſhall not be toſt
with every accident, hurried by
every emergency, but poſſeſs our
ſelves in patience and tranquility.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:61579:115"/>
And conſequently this muſt
needs be a very worthy enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of our retirements, and
ſuch as deſerves and requires the
application of our minds to it,
that we may be under the power
of this perſwaſion, and be able to
anſwer to our ſelves the atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
objections againſt it, to give
ſome account of the intricacy and
obſcure paſſages of Providence,
without (ſome skill in) which it
will be very difficult, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
to walk either piouſly
or comfortably; but by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
we hold continual conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
with God, we live and
walk with him, he is always at
hand to us, to awe us, to ſupport
and comfort us, and our hearts
become not only a Temple where
we ſolemnly offer up our ſervices
at ſet times to him, but an Altar
where the holy fire never goes out,
but ſends up conſtantly the ſweet
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61579:116"/>
odours of Prayers and Praiſes to
him.</p>
               <p>4. Another exerciſe of ſecret
Devotion is to premeditate our
converſation, and ſo to forecaſt
the occurrences of life, that we
may conduct our ſelves both with
ſafety to our Souls, and to the
beſt advantage of our ſpiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts;
foraſmuch as he that
lives <hi>ex tempore</hi> (as we ſay) and
unpremeditately, will neither be
able to avoid the dangers which
will be ſure to encounter him, nor
to improve the opportunities
which may offer themſelves to
him.</p>
               <p>In our converſe in this World
we muſt expect temptations from
the Devil, allurements from ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
objects, provocations from
the folly or malice of evil men,
vexations by unhappy accidents,
and above all abundance of evil
examples to debauch and corrupt
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61579:116"/>
us; and that man will moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be ſurprized by ſome or all
of theſe, that doth not forecaſt
them: and arm himſelf againſt
them, and therefore a wiſe man
will not adventure to go abroad
and take in the infectious air of
the World, till he hath antidoted
himſelf againſt the danger, by
the advantages of retirement, and
the ſecret exerciſes of Devotion.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe he will before
he goes out of his Cloſet, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſider the common Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the World, the reigning
ſins of the Age, but the eſpecial
difficulties of his calling and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and the peculiar infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his own temper; and
withal will forethink and prepare
himſelf againſt ſuch efforts as by
reaſon of any of theſe may be
made upon him.</p>
               <p>If he can foreſee that he ſhall
unavoidably fall into evil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61579:117"/>
he will firſt indeavour to
warm and affect his heart with
the quicker ſenſe of Religion, that
he may not only take no hurt
himſelf, but (if it be poſſible) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
ſome ſenſe of good upon
thoſe he converſes with.</p>
               <p>If any thing be likely to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
that will ſtrike him with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
he will firſt go to God
by Prayer for ſtrength and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
of mind, and indeavour to
fix his heart ſo intently upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, as that the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of this may not diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
him.</p>
               <p>If he be likely to meet with
that which may provoke him to
anger, he will compoſe himſelf
to as great a coolneſs as poſſibly
he can, that no paſſage may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
him.</p>
               <p>If any allurement to ſenſuality
preſent it ſelf, he will conſider
how he may retreat into grave
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61579:117"/>
Company, or earneſt buſineſs,
that ſo he may decline that which
is not eaſily to be withſtood.</p>
               <p>And on the other ſide concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
opportunities of doing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
good; foraſmuch as every
wiſe man is ſenſible that the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of things are no more in his
power than the time of his life is,
that no enterprize ſucceeds well
which is not nicked with a fit ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and that it is impoſſible to
recal it when it is ſlipped by;
therefore the pious man will fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
what may offer themſelves
probably in ſuch circumſtances as
he ſtands in, leſt he ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
them when they preſent, and
ſo he loſe an advantage of doing
glory to God, or good to men,
and of promoting the intereſt of
his own Soul, and accordingly
will diſpoſe his heart in ſecret to
apprehend them, and to improve
them; he examines his capacity,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61579:118"/>
and ſtirs up his attention, and
projects the means, either how
he may reap ſome benefit by good
and wiſe Company, or how he
may ſeaſonably interpoſe a word
on Gods behalf in common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
or how he may do
ſome good thing that will turn to
account another day.</p>
               <p>5. But if either by the neglect
of ſuch opportunities as aforeſaid,
the pious man omit the doing of
ſome good he might have done,
or by ſecurity of converſation he
fall into any of thoſe dangers he
ought to have watcht againſt,
then there is a fifth great work
for private Devotion, for in this
caſe there lies a double care upon
him; firſt, that he ſlight not his
danger, and ſecondly, that he
deſpair not of remedy, but be
both deeply ſenſible of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage,
and alſo riſe again with
indignation and reſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:61579:118"/>
Firſt, That he ſlight not his
fault (as generally men do by the
plea of Example, or the pretence
of humane infirmity) and ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
himſelf in his ſin, but feel a
deep remorſe, and conceive a
mighty diſpleaſure againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That on the other
ſide he aggravate not his guilt to
ſuch a degree as to preclude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
by deſpairing of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
mercy, but preſently flee to
the grace of the Goſpel, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
Gods Pardon, with ſetled
purpoſes never to offend in the
like kind again.</p>
               <p>Now neither of theſe are done
as they ought to be, but in retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>viz.</hi> when a man hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of dealing impartially
between God and his own Soul,
and therefore (eſpecially becauſe
the occaſions of them often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen)
are juſtly reckonable as a
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61579:119"/>
part of Cloſet Devotion, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
they are repreſented by
the holy <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 4. 4. Stand
in awe and ſin not, commune with
your own hearts in your chamber, and
be ſtill,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let every man that
hath any ſenſe of God upon him
be throughly perſwaded to ſet
ſome time apart for this purpoſe,
that he may romage his own
heart, and find out all the evils of
his life; and when he hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
any particular guilt upon
his Soul, let him not forſake his
Cloſet, and depart out of Gods
preſence till he have affected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with deep ſorrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
for his ſin, and proſtrated
himſelf at the throne of grace with
ſtrong and earneſt cries for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and until he have confirmed
his heart in a reſolution of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and more ſtrict obedience
for the time to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:61579:119"/>
And let him do this often, that
he may not run up too big a
ſcore, and ſo either his heart <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
hardened through the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſin,</hi> or his Conſcience be
ſo affrighted with the greatneſs
of his guilt, that like a Bankrupt
he be tempted to decline looking
into his accounts, becauſe he can
have no comfortable proſpect of
them, or run away from God in
a fit of deſperation, inſtead of
running to him by repentance.</p>
               <p>Let him, I ſay, do this often,
not by chance or unwillingly, but
frequently and periodically (ſet
times being appointed for it) and
though I would be loth to impoſe
a burden upon the Conſciences of
men, yet I think it ordinarily ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
adviſeable, that this be done
once a month, <hi>viz.</hi> whileſt a man
hath his paſt actions and carriage
in remembrance, and can take a
juſt account of himſelf; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61579:120"/>
it is very fit to do it againſt
the time of the adminiſtration of
the Holy Sacrament, and then
would be extraordinarily proper
and ſeaſonable: for theſe two
things, Self-examination and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of the Lords Supper, do
marvellouſly ſuit and anſwer to
each other; the former preparing
a mans heart for that ſacred ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,
and that holy ſolemnity
ſealing to him the pardon of thoſe
ſins he hath diſcovered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of in ſecret.</p>
               <p>But whether this work of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reflection
and ranſacking a mans
own heart in ſecret be abſolutely
neceſſary to be done at certain
times and periods, it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
uſeful, that it be ſeriouſly
and conſcientiouſly practiſed ſome
time or other; foraſmuch as on
the one ſide it is not conceivable
how a man ſhould be able to
maintain an holy and comfortable
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61579:120"/>
Life without it; ſo on the other
hand it ſeems equally impoſſible
that he ſhould continue to be an
evil man who habitually and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
practiſes it: for as there is
no way ſo effectual to preſerve
an eſtate from being ſquandred
away extravagantly, as the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conſtant and ſtrict accounts
of receits and expences, ſo there
is no method more powerful to
reſtrain ſin than this of ſelf-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
the very ſearching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our hearts jogs and awakens
Conſcience, and that being row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
will be a faithful Monitor of
all that was done amiſs, the mere
proſpect of which will make a
man very uneaſy, by the fears
and horrors that attend it; the
conſideration of the ſilly motives
upon which a man was induced
to ſin, will fill him with ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſhame and indignation, and
the eaſineſs (which he cannot but
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61579:121"/>
find) of withſtanding ſuch moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by the grace of God will
provoke him to a reſolution of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment;
in a word, the ſight
and knowledge of the Diſeaſe is
a great ſtep to the Cure, and an
heart well ſearched is half heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But this leads me to another
inſtance of great affinity with
what we have now been ſpeaking
of, and which ſhall be the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerciſe
of ſecret Devotion which
I will here make mention of,
<hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Trial of our proficiency and
growth in grace, this is of great
importance; foraſmuch as (we
have ſeen before) the truth of
grace is ſcarcely any otherway
diſcernible but by its progreſs, and
in that it makes men daily better
and better, for the eſſences of
things are indiſcernible, and a
man may endleſly diſpute with
himſelf whether ſuch or ſuch a
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61579:121"/>
thing be a ſign of grace, and of
ſpiritual life in him, till he puts
all out of controverſy by the fruits
and improvement of ſuch a vital
principle; and therefore it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
neceſſary, if we will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at ſpiritual comfort, that we
make experiment of our ſelves in
this particular, which can no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
be done than by retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into the Cabinet of our
hearts, and the diligent compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our ſelves both with our
ſelves and with the rules of the
Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The common eſtimation of
the World is a very fallacious and
improper meaſure of divine life,
and as the Apoſtle tells us, it is <hi>a
ſmall thing to be judged of men</hi> one
way or other, <hi>but if our hearts
condemn us not, then have we confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
towards God;</hi> for they being
privy to our ends and deſigns and
to all our circumſtances as well
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61579:122"/>
as to matter of fact, cannot nor
will not deceive us, if they be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
examined, and therefore
muſt be impartially conſulted, if
we would indeed know our ſelves,
and be able to prejudge our own
condition.</p>
               <p>Now the teſtimony which our
hearts can give us of our ſpiritual
improvement, is not to be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the increaſed length of
our Prayers, nor merely from the
paſſion and earneſtneſs of them;
for the former of theſe may be
the effect of hypocriſy, and the
latter may proceed from ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
temper of body or outward
accident; nor upon our affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
hearing of Sermons, for <hi>the
ſtony ground received the ſeed with
joy as well as the good ground;</hi> nor
yet upon a more than ordinary
ſcrupuloſity of Conſcience (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in ſmaller matters) for this
may proceed from Ignorance, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61579:122"/>
or Hypocriſy. But the
ſafeſt deciſion of this great caſe,
whether we grow in grace or no,
is to be made by examining our
hearts in ſuch points as theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<hi>viz.</hi> Whether we be more
conſtant in all the duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
than formerly? Whether we
be more exact and regular in our
lives daily? Whether our hearts
be more in Heaven than they
were wont, and that we have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at a greater contempt of the
World? Whether we are more
dead to temptation, eſpecially in
the caſe of ſuch ſins as agree with
our conſtitution and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
Whether affliction be more
eaſy than it uſed to be, and we
can better ſubmit to the yoke of
Chriſt? Whether we are more
conſcientious of ſecret ſins, and
ſuch as no Eye of man can take
notice of and upbraid us for?
Whether we are more ſagacious in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61579:123"/>
apprehending, and more careful
of improving opportunities of
doing good than heretofore? In
a word, Whether we are grown
more meek, more humble and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to our Superiours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If upon due inquiry, oru hearts
can anſwer affirmatively for us
in ſuch points as theſe, then we
may comfortably conclude, that
we have not <hi>received the grace of
God in vain,</hi> which being of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
conſequence to us to be
ſubſtantially reſolved of, ſelf-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
in the aforeſaid parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
(as the only way to arrive
at it) ought to have its ſhare in
our Cloſet Devotions.</p>

               <p>THough the conſideration of
Gods Almighty Power,
Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and his other
perfections, together with our
dependance upon him, and obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iouſneſs
to him, be the firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and ground of religion (as
we have already ſhewed) and ſo
the Divine Majeſty is the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
and principal object of it;
yet notwithſtanding this is not ſo
to be underſtood, as if the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of Religion extended no
further than to acts of worſhip
or addreſs to God: for it is as
much our duty to manage our
ſelves well towards others for
Gods ſake, as towards him for his
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61579:124"/>
own ſake. And therefore (as hath
been intimated heretofore) true
Piety in its juſt dimenſions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes
no leſs than a worthy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of our ſelves in all thoſe
relations Divine Providence hath
placed us in.</p>
               <p>Now next to our obligations to
our Creator and Preſerver, and
next to our concern for the better
part of our ſelves, our own Souls,
a man ſtands related to his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo nearly, that he is wanting
in both the former that is negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of this.</p>
               <p>Almighty Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
pronounced it not fit for man
to be alone, and therefore the firſt
proviſion he made againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
ſtate of ſolitude, was
to enter him into the Society of a
Family; partly, that in ſo near a
ſtation, they might mutually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and help one another in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
entertain one another
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61579:124"/>
by Diſcourſe, and improve one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers
reaſon; partly, that in
this Conjunction they might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
one anothers Spirits againſt
all ill accidents, or the enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes
of wicked and malicious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
more powerful than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
but principally, that they
might mutually provoke and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
one anothers hearts to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
love and reverence of
their great Creator.</p>
               <p>And this end is ſo great and the
injunction of it ſo ſtrict, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man in this Society ſtands
charged with the Soul of another,
and is accountable for it, at leaſt
ſo far, that he cannot be excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that doth not indeavour to
bring thoſe with whom he ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately
converſes, and upon
whom he hath ſo many opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
to a ſenſe and regard of
God and Religion. And this eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
concerns thoſe that are
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:61579:125"/>
heads of Families; foraſmuch as
by virtue of their place they have
always been accounted, not only
Kings and Governours, but alſo
Prophets and Prieſts within their
peculiar ſphere and province.</p>
               <p>Accordingly we find it to have
been the conſtant care and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of all good men in all Ages,
to train up thoſe of their Families
in the knowledge of the true God,
and the exerciſes of true Religion:
particularly God himſelf teſtifies
of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18—19. <hi>that he
knew he would command his children
and his houſhold after him that they
keep the way of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Job</hi> 1. 5. we find it to
have been the continual care of
that holy man to ſanctify his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Family, and daily to
intercede with God for them by
Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6. it is an expreſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
upon the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:61579:125"/>
that they not only <hi>keep the
laws of God in their own hearts, but
that they ſhould teach them diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to their Children, and talk of them
when they ſate in their houſes, and
when they walked by the way,</hi> &amp;c.
that is, that they ſhould convey
and imprint a ſenſe of God and
his Religion upon the minds of
thoſe they familiarly converſed
with.</p>
               <p>And ſo great is the authority
and influence of Governours of
Families, and ſo powerful is good
example in this particular, that
<hi>Joſh. 24. 15. Joſhua</hi> undertakes
for his Family, <hi>that they ſhould
ſerve the Lord,</hi> whether other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
would do ſo or no.</p>
               <p>David <hi>often declares his zeal
for the maintenance of Religion
in his Family, ſo far, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
thoſe perſons ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
his Houſe that made no
Conſcience of God, and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably,</hi>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:61579:126"/>
1 Chr. 28. 9. <hi>he gives
this ſolemn charge to his Son</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,
Thou Solomon my Son, know
thou the God of thy Father, and
ſerve him with a perfect heart, and
with a willing mind; for the Lord
ſearcheth all hearts, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all the imagination of the
thoughts: if thou ſeek him he will
be found of thee, but if thou forſake
him he will caſt thee off for ever.</p>
               <p>And for the times of the New
Teſtament there is abundant evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that it was the conſtant
practice of all thoſe who had a
ſenſe of Religion in their hearts,
to ſet it up in their Families alſo,
of which the teſtimonies are ſo
many, and ſo ready at hand, that
it is needleſs here to recite them;
and the ſucceſs was commonly
anſwerable to the indeavour: from
whence it comes to paſs that <hi>Acts</hi>
10. 2. it is ſaid of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that
he was not only <hi>a devout man
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61579:126"/>
and prayed to God always,</hi> but that
<hi>he feared the Lord with all his houſe,
i. e.</hi> his Example, Prayers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
prevailed upon all thoſe
that were under the influence of
them, to bring them to (at leaſt)
a profeſſion of piety alſo; upon
which account it is further obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
that generally when any
Governour of a Family imbraced
the Chriſtian Faith, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to that Religion, it is ſaid
that ſuch <hi>an one believed and all
his houſe,</hi> or <hi>he and all his houſe
were baptized,</hi> namely, becauſe
truly good men did not fail by
their example and endeavours to
bring thoſe over to the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which themſelves were
heartily perſwaded of, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
we ſee it often come to
paſs in theſe times wherein we
live, that ſeveral perſons very
heartily bleſs God that his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
diſpoſed them into ſuch or
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61579:127"/>
ſuch pious Families wherein the
foundation of their eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
hath been laid, by the means
of the inſtructive and exemplary
devotion which they have there
been under the advantages of; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
conſideration of all which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
examples and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and ſeveral others which
might with great eaſe have been
added, let no good Chriſtian be
of ſo monaſtick a ſpirit as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his care no farther than his
own Cell, and to think he hath
acquitted himſelf well enough
when he hath diſcharged the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his Cloſet, and hath kept
Religion glowing in his own
heart; but think it his duty to
take care that his light ſhine quite
through his Houſe, and that his
zeal warm all his Family.</p>
               <p>In order to which we will here
conſider theſe three things. Firſt,
Of the ſeveral members which
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61579:127"/>
uſually a Family conſiſts of, and
which are concern'd in its diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
Secondly, The ſeveral
duties of piety which eſpecially
become and concern a Family.
And thirdly, By what means the
members of a Family may be
brought to comply with all thoſe
duties.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, The ordinary relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a Family (eſpecially as it
ſignifies thoſe which dwell or
converſe together under the ſame
roof) are Husband and Wife, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and Children, Maſter and
Servant, Friend and Friend; and
all theſe I take to be comprized in
thoſe ſeveral paſſages of the <hi>Acts</hi>
of the Apoſtles, where it is ſaid,
that ſuch a man <hi>and all his houſe
were converted or baptized,</hi> for there
are great intereſts of Religion
which intercede between every of
theſe; as for the relation of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and Wife, as it is the neareſt
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61579:128"/>
and ſtricteſt that can be, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
it is of mighty impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to their mutual comfort, and
a wonderful indearment of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
when both the relatives are
animated with the ſame ſpirit of
Religion, and promote the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
intereſt of one another: As it
is vaſtly miſchievous and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
when thoſe who are inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
yoked together, draw divers
ways, one towards Heaven, and
the other towards Hell; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of which danger the Apoſtle
adviſes thoſe who are free <hi>not to
be unequally yoked with unbelievers,</hi>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. for ſaith he, <hi>what fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
hath righteouſneſs with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs?
what communion hath
light with darkneſs? what concord
hath Chriſt with Belial? and what
part hath he that believeth, with an
infidel?</hi> Yet becauſe it is poſſible,
that light may prevail againſt
darkneſs, therefore when ſuch an
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61579:128"/>
unequal Society is contracted, he
doth not think it a ſufficient
ground for ſeparation; for ſaith
he, 1 Cor. 7. 16. <hi>What knoweſt thou,
O Wife, but thou maiſt ſave thy Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?
or what knoweſt thou, O man,
whether thou ſhalt ſave thy Wife?</hi>
eſpecially ſince by the piety of one
of the Parents, the Children are
ſanctified and placed under the
advantages of the Covenant of
grace, as he there adds, <hi>v.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing it is poſſible for one
of theſe relatives to be ſo great a
bleſſing to the other, there is
mighty reaſon they both ſhould
endeavour it, out of ſelf-love as
well as charity and conjugal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
ſince it is both very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to go to Heaven alone, and
alſo equally eaſy and comfortable,
when thoſe in this relation join
hearts and hands in the way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>As for the relation of Parents
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61579:129"/>
and Children, that is alſo very
near and intimate, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
their intereſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is bound up together; for as
it is a mighty advantage to have
holy Parents, in regard the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of ſuch perſons ordinarily
fare the better to many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as is aſſured in the ſecond
Commandment, and therefore
there is a double obligation upon
Parents to be good and virtuous,
not only for the ſake of their own
Souls, but alſo for the ſake of their
Children; ſo on the other hand,
it is no leſs glory and comfort to
Parents to have good and pious
Children, and therefore they are
ſtrictly <hi>charged to bring them up in
the nurture and admonition of the
Lord;</hi> and indeed he is worſe
than an Infidel, nay worſe than a
Brute, that can be content to
bring them up to Hell and the
Devil; for they are part of our
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:61579:129"/>
ſelves, and a man that conſiders
any thing, can as well be willing
to be damned himſelf, as that they
ſhould be ſo if he can help it.
Now that there is much in their
power this way, appears by that
charge of the Apoſtle laſt named,
as alſo by the obſervation of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
Prov. 22. 6. <hi>Train up a child
in the way he ſhould go, and when he
is old he will not depart from it;</hi> for
Children in their young and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
years are like Wax, yielding
and pliable to whatſoever form
we will put them into, but if we
miſs this opportunity it will be
no eaſy matter to recover them
to good afterwards, when they
are debauched by evil principles,
confident of their own opinions,
headſtrong by the uncontrouled
uſe of liberty, and hardened by
the cuſtom of ſinning. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is obſervable, that far the
moſt part of good men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61579:130"/>
are ſuch as had the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of piety laid in their youth,
and very few are to be found who
were effectually reclaimed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>But whileſt Children wholly
depend upon their Parents, and
their natures are ſoft and pliant,
when as yet they have not the
hardineſs to rebel, nor the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to diſpute the commands of
their Fathers; ſo long they may
by the grace of God eaſily be
wrought upon to good, and
which is very remarkable, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of the mother is eſpecially
conſiderable in this caſe: for ſo
we find not only that King <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,
Prov.</hi> 31. 1. remembred the
Leſſons which his mother taught
him, but as I have noted before,
<hi>Timothy</hi> was ſeaſoned with grace,
by the inſtructions of his Mother
<hi>Eunice,</hi> and his Grandmother
<hi>Lois, 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 5. and many other
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61579:130"/>
inſtances there are of the ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of the Mothers pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.
But where Parents neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
their duty, uſually the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
periſh, and their blood will
be required at the hands of care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Parents: and which is more,
there is commonly this dreadful
token of divine vengeance in this
World, that thoſe who are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
of their duty both towards
God, and towards their Children
in this particular, feel the ſad
effects of it in the undutifulneſs,
contumacy, and rebellion of thoſe
Children againſt themſelves after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
as if God permitted them
to revenge his quarrel.</p>
               <p>In the next place, as for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Maſter and Servants, it
is a mighty miſtake to think they
are meerly our ſlaves to do our
will, and that nothing is due from
us to them but what is expreſly
bargain'd for, ſince they are or
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61579:131"/>
ought to be Gods Servants as well
as ours, and muſt do him ſervice
as well as us, and they are put
under our protection, and placed
in our Families, that they may be
inſtructed in his pleaſure, and have
the liberty to ſerve <hi>him, of whom
the whole family of heaven and earth
is called.</hi> So that properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we and they are common Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to one great Maſter, only
in different ranks, as the one part
(after the manner of Stewards) is
allowed to have Servants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, and the other muſt
do the inferiour buſineſs, but
ſtill they are Gods Servants more
properly than ours, and muſt
therefore have not only (as I
ſaid) liberty and leiſure to ſerve
our common Maſter, but alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
from us and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſo to do: and he that denies
them any of theſe, might as juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny them their. Bread or their
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61579:131"/>
Wages; nay more, he that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
to pray for them too, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
himſelf but by halves, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as his intereſt is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not only in their health and
proſperity, but in their virtue
and piety; for it is evident, that
the better men they are, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Servants they will prove. So
St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells <hi>Philemon</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to him, that he would be a
gainer by <hi>Oneſimus</hi>'s Converſion,
for that he would be ſo much a
more profitable ſervant hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
as he was now become a
better man, ſuch perſons being
not only the moſt faithful and
truſty, but by ſo much the more
induſtrious as they are the more
conſcientious: Beſides, that it is
well known that Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
often bleſſes a Family for
the ſake of a pious Servant, as
God bleſſed <hi>Labans</hi> ſubſtance for
the ſake of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the Houſe
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61579:132"/>
and all the affairs of <hi>Potiphar</hi> for
the piety of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> So that in
ſhort, he loves himſelf as little as
he loves God, who doth not indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that his Servants ſhould be
ſincerely religious. And though
it's true, it is not altogether in his
power to make them ſo, or to put
grace into their hearts, yet by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his place and authority, he
hath mighty advantages of doing
them good, and will be ſure to be
called to account how he hath
improved his Stewardſhip in this
particular.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, In a Family there are
commonly ſome who under the
general relation of Friends or
Acquaintance, are either reſident
in it, or at leaſt hoſpitably enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by it; now as this lays an
obligation upon the perſons trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
ſo it gives ſome authority to
him who treats them: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
as ſuch a Maſter of a
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61579:132"/>
Family is in ſome meaſure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
towards men for the
ſcandals and miſdemeanours of
his Gueſts; ſo is he much more
reſponſible to God for any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs
they ſhall be guilty of
towards his Divine Majeſty. For
(as I ſaid before) every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
King in his own Family may
give Laws to it, and oblige thoſe
who are under his protection to
pay him Allegiance, and to ſerve
and worſhip God with him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
he ought to do this, becauſe
the fourth Commandment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
at our hands that we uſe
this authority, not <hi>only over our
Sons and Daughters, our Man-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Maid-Servants, but over
all thoſe that are within our Gates.</hi>
But ſo much in the general, let us
now conſider in the ſecond place
the particular duties of Religion
in a Family; of which in the next
Chapter.</p>

               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:61579:133"/>
               <head>CHAP. IV. Of Family Duties in ſpecial.</head>
               <p>IN the firſt place I look upon
it as the duty of every Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that (beſides Cloſet-Devotions,
of which I have ſpoken before;
and beſides publick Worſhip,
of which I ſhall ſpeak anon)
once a day at the leaſt they join
together in Prayers to God. I
ſay once a day at the leaſt, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of mens occaſions, and the
peculiar circumſtances of ſome Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
were it not for which, it
would be very fit that there ſhould
be Prayers Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as is the general practice of
moſt pious Families; but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is wonderfully decent, that
all the members of every Family
ſhould once in the day meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and with one heart and
one mouth glorify God and pay
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61579:133"/>
their homage to the great Maſter
of the whole Family of Heaven
and Earth; and it is very ſtrange,
if any excuſe ſhould be pleaded or
admitted in this caſe. For as I
ſaid before, every ſeveral Family
is a peculiar Body or Society, which
hath its diſtinct circumſtances,
effects and conſideration; it hath
its reſpective needs to be ſupplied,
and therefore hath occaſion to
make proper and peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
to God, as that he will be
pleaſed to continue it in health,
to ſettle concord and unity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the ſeveral members of it,
that the whole may enjoy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
and ſafety from Thieves,
from Fire and other dangers. And
every ſuch Society hath alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and peculiar mercies to give
thanks to God for, as namely for
ſucceſs in affairs, for quiet habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that they are not moleſted
with ill Neighbours, nor vexed
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:61579:134"/>
with Law-Suits, for hopeful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
faithful Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for
in ſeveral of theſe reſpects a man
may be well and comfortable in
his own perſon, and yet be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
in the Society; and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywiſe
the Society or Family may
be happy in the general, and yet
a particular perſon may be in ill
circumſtances: and therefore there
is juſt reaſon of addreſſes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
to God in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Family, and by the
whole Family in Conjunction, as
well as by every ſingle perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
and in his Cloſet.</p>
               <p>And though perhaps there may
be ſome Family wherein there is
no perſon who can aptly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
repreſent the peculiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of it to the Almighty, and
it may be alſo there is no form of
Prayer at hand that will expreſs
all the reſpective circumſtances of
ſuch a Society; yet they may lift
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61579:134"/>
up their hearts and voices toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a general form, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with their thoughts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
whatſoever is wanting in
the expreſſions.</p>
               <p>And as there is juſt ground and
reaſon for ſuch family worſhip, ſo
there is good cauſe to expect it
will be ſingularly ſucceſsful,
when the whole community joins
together, and preſent themſelves
and their tribute of praiſe before
the Lord: no queſtion but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
manner of doing it, as well as
the matter, will be highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to him; and when with
proſtrate bodies, devout hearts
and hands, and eyes lift up to
Heaven, they combine together to
importune, and as it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege
the Almighty, they cannot
fail of a bleſſing; or however it
is a mighty ſatisfaction to the
minds of all ſuch perſons, and a
great ſecurity to them that they
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61579:135"/>
have thus jointly and ſolemnly
commended themſelves to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
protection.</p>
               <p>Beſides, that this courſe is an
effectual means to conciliate peace
and love and kindneſs, between
all the members of this body, and
to knit their hearts to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when they are thus accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to unite their hearts and
join their hands in Gods ſervice,
and conſpire to pray with and
for each other, which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
indearment of affection.</p>
               <p>Perhaps ſome man will now
ſay, there is no expreſs Scripture
which requires of men this daily
office of Family Prayer: To which
I anſwer, firſt, what if it were
ſo, yet nevertheleſs it is a duty,
ſeeing there is ſo apparent reaſon
for it. For God who conſidered,
that he gave Laws to reaſonable
men, did not think himſelf bound
to preſcribe every thing in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61579:135"/>
eſpecially in natural wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
where the reaſon of man
might ſupply him with direction
what was fit to be done in ſuch
a caſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſecondly, (as I diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the former part of this
Treatiſe) it is a ſtingy and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-ſoul'd
trick, and an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of no true love to God and
goodneſs, to ſtand upon ſo ſtrict
terms in our piety, as to require
an expreſs command in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
for that which is admirably
good in the general, and hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
been the general practice of
all good men, as this hath been.</p>
               <p>But after all, I would in the
laſt place crave leave to ask thoſe
men a plain queſtion, who inſiſt
upon more expreſs proof of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
Prayers, and it is no more
but this, Whether they think there
is any ſuch thing as publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
required of men? if they do,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:61579:136"/>
then let them remember there
was a time when there was no
more publick Society than that of
Families, namely at the firſt
planting of the World, and then
either publick worſhip muſt be
this of Families or none at all;
and to inlighten them in this caſe,
let them conſider that paſſage,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 26. when <hi>Seth</hi> had <hi>Enos</hi>
born to him, it is ſaid, <hi>then began
men to call upon the name of the
Lord,</hi> that is, ſo ſoon as there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be a Family in the pious
line of <hi>Seth,</hi> then preſently they
ſet up Gods worſhip in it. Now
this was not the beginning of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
worſhip, for no doubt but
<hi>Seth</hi> was careful of that before <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi>
was born; nor was it proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
publick or Eccleſiaſtick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
for in that minority of the
World, there neither was nor as
yet could be any Church eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in ſuch a ſenſe: therefore
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61579:136"/>
it muſt follow that Family wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is as antient as the being of
Families themſelves.</p>
               <p>Or let pious and ingenious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
conſider of that paſſage of the
Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1. where in the
firſt place we find our Saviour
was at Prayers; and that it was
not ſecret Prayer but with his
Diſciples, is more than probable,
ſince they were preſent at them:
and accordingly, when he had
concluded, one of them asks him
to inſtruct them how to pray.
Now if this be acknowledged,
then here is our Saviours Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for what we are diſcourſing
of, foraſmuch as the Diſciples
with whom he was at Prayer,
were his Family. But that which
I obſerve further is, they ask
him to teach them to pray, as
<hi>John</hi> taught his Diſciples, that
is, to preſcribe them a form
wherein they (who were his
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:61579:137"/>
Family) might join together, as
the Family or Diſciples of <hi>John</hi>
did; or not only to pray ſeverally
or ſecretly, but in Conjunction
and Society: and this our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
gratifies them in, by preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
to them the well-known and
admirable form: in which theſe
two things are further remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to this purpoſe; firſt, that
the Prayer is in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which renders it far more
probable, that it was intended for
a ſocial office. For though ſome
other account may be given of his
uſing that number, yet nothing
is ſo natural as this reaſon which
I have intimated. Secondly, The
very petitions themſelves (if they
be conſidered) will incline a man
to think, that though the Prayer
was contrived with infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to fit other purpoſes, yet it
was primarily intended for the
uſe of a Family or Society, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:61579:137"/>
ſuch an one as this of our
Saviours Diſciples was; but ſo
much for that.</p>
               <p>2. The next inſtance of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Duty is the ſanctification of the
Lords Day, and other days and
times ſet apart for his ſervice. As
for the Lords Day, though it be
undoubtedly true, that as the
Jewiſh Sabbath (which is our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi>)
is not obliging to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
at all; ſo neither are we
bound to obſerve any day with
that Sabbatical nicety and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which (for ſpecial reaſons)
was required of that people: yet
that the firſt day of the Week, or
the Lords Day, be obſerved pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
and devoutly, is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to us by the conſtant
practice of the Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>And the ſanctification of it
principally conſiſts in this, that
we make it a day peculiar for
the offices of Piety and Devotion,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:61579:138"/>
as other days are for common and
ſecular affairs; for though the
buſineſs of Religion muſt be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on every day of our lives, and
that be a profane day indeed in
which God hath not ſome ſhare
allowed for his ſervice, yet as God
hath not required that it be the
whole work of thoſe days, but
after a little of the time be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
to him, the reſidue be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the common affairs of
Life; ſo on the Lords Day we are
allowed to conſult our infirmity,
to provide for neceſſity, and to
do works of humanity or mercy:
but the proper buſineſs of the day
is Religion, and to that the main
of it muſt be applied.</p>
               <p>And there is great reaſon for
this, namely by this interruption
of the courſe of Worldly affairs,
in ſome meaſure to take our
hearts off from them; for we
ſhould hardly avoid ſinking ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61579:138"/>
into the cares and buſineſs
of this life, if we went on in a
continual courſe, and were not
obliged at certain intervals of time
to retreat from them, and betake
our ſelves to things of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by which means alſo, we
begin to practiſe an Heavenly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batiſm,
and inure our ſelves by
degrees to thoſe ſpiritual imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which we are to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and be everlaſtingly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in another World.</p>
               <p>Let therefore the pious man
thus ſanctify the Lords Day by
applying it to holy uſes, that is
(beſides publick worſhip) to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Meditation, ſinging of Pſalms,
and grave Diſcourſes of Religion,
and let him according as he hath
Warrant from the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
oblige all <hi>thoſe within
his Gates</hi> to do ſo too, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſtrain his Family from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
labours, but from lightneſs
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61579:139"/>
and folly, tipling and goſſipping,
idle viſits and impertinent talking
of News; and uſe his indeavour to
ingage them to be as much in
earneſt about the ſervice of God
and their Souls on that day, as
they are about their buſineſs or
pleaſure on other days.</p>
               <p>As for other holy days ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
by the appointment of the
Church, there is very good uſe
to be made of them too: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that the great Feſtivals are
the ignorant mans Goſpel, and
bring to his mind all the great
paſſages of our Saviour and his
Apoſtles, it is certain alſo, that
God hath not ſo ſtrictly tasked
us to the labour of ſix days, as
that he will not be better pleaſed
if we now and then apply ſome
of them to his honour, and make
a ſally towards Heaven; but then
the obſervation of theſe days is
not to be made merely a relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61579:139"/>
from ſervile work, nor much
leſs a diſpenſation for looſeneſs
and profaneneſs, but God muſt
be ſerved on them with greater
diligence than can be ordinarily
expected on other days. And this
is another branch of the pious
mans duty in his Family.</p>
               <p>3. There is another thing I
would mention in the third place,
amongſt Family exerciſes, which
I do not call a neceſſary duty, but
would offer it to conſideration,
whether it be not adviſeable in
ſome caſes for the promotion of
Family Piety, that in every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
where it can be done, ſome
perſons ſhould be incouraged to
take notes of the Sermons which
are preached in the Church, and
repeat them at home; foraſmuch
as this courſe would not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
a very ſeaſonable and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
entertainment for the Family
in the intervals of publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61579:140"/>
on the Lords Day, but would
alſo be very advantagious, both to
Miniſter and People.</p>
               <p>For the Miniſter, it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
him to ſtudy and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
weighty things, when he
ſaw his words were not likely to
periſh in the hearing, and be loſt
in the air, but be reviewed and
conſidered of; by which means
one Sermon would be as good as
two, and might ſerve accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>For the People, it would put
the moſt ordinary ſort of them
upon conſidering and indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to remember and make ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that which is delivered
to them, when they obſerve, that
ſome of the ableſt of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
think it worth their pains
to take ſo exact notice of it as to
write it down; at leaſt they would
be aſhamed to ſnore and yawn,
when others are ſo intent and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:61579:140"/>
And as for the Family in which
the repetition is made, they would
have further occaſion to obſerve,
with what clearneſs and evidence
the doctrine was inferred from
the Text, opportunity to weigh
the arguments uſed to inforce it,
and be put upon making applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all to their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>But I foreſee ſeveral objections
(ſuch as they are) will be made
againſt this; it will be ſaid, this
courſe is unfaſhionable and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical,
that experience hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
that writing after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
hath taught men to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
and captious, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſets up men for Lay-Preachers;
and in a word, that repeating Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
raiſed the Rebellion. But</p>
               <p>In anſwer to the firſt of theſe,
I obſerve, that it is neither unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
nor under any ill character
in Courts of Judicature, for men
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61579:141"/>
to take Notes of the reaſonings,
determinations, and even the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
of the Judges; and ſurely
Religion is of as much moment
as the municipal Laws; and Caſes
of Conſcience are of as great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
as <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum:</hi> but
if the Diſcourſes of Preachers be
not ſo conſiderate, their reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
not ſo cloſe and weighty,
nor their determinations ſo well
grounded as to be worth noting,
the more is the pity, to ſay no
more. As for the ſecond objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I anſwer, that if the Preacher
handle only the indiſputable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Chriſtianity, and preſs
them home and cloſe upon the
Conſciences of men, theſe will
afford little ſcope for conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or captiouſneſs; but ſome
men that are of ſuch an humour
will be pragmatical and profane,
whether they write after Sermons
or no, and therefore let us lay
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61579:141"/>
this blame where it is due. To
the third objection it is anſwered,
that though writing after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
might perhaps furniſh men
with materials for Lay-preaching;
yet it was impudence which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
men to it, and the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Government which gave
opportunity for it: and if the laſt
of theſe three things be taken
care of, the ſecond will be curbed,
and the firſt harmleſs and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, whereas it is object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that writing and repeating of
Sermons was acceſſary to the late
Rebellion: I anſwer, that it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
it could be neither the
writing nor the repeating, but
the ſeditious matter of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
that was in the fault; for
it is certain, that good and pious
Sermons are the moſt effectual
way to prevent all miſchief of
that kind, tending to make good
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61579:142"/>
Subjects as well as good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and the writing and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſuch Sermons is a means
to ſettle ſuch Doctrine the deeper
in the hearts of men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſee not but that it would
be good prudence to apply that
to a good end which hath been
abuſed to a bad one, unleſs we
will countenance the humour of
ſome late Reformers, whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
was to aboliſh things for
the abuſe of them. Upon the
whole matter, I ſee no juſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
from this inſtance
of Family-Devotion; however I
will ſay no more of it, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to ſuch as are unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>4. It is certainly a Family Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to inſtruct all the young and
ignorant perſons in it, in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
Doctrines of Religion, and
rules of good life. The obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to, and the advantages of this
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61579:142"/>
office, have been ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
before in the foregoing
Chapter; now therefore only to
ſpeak briefly and plainly of the
manner of diſcharging it, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes
theſe following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That care be taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to ſubdue the unruly wills
and paſſions of Children; which
is ordinarily not very hard to do
if it be minded time enough,
whileſt they are tender and plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but the defect herein (like
an errour in the firſt Concoction)
is hardly remediable afterwards:
accordingly the wiſe man advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
<hi>Prov. 19. 18. Chaſten thy
Son whileſt there is hope, and let
not thy Soul ſpare for his crying:</hi> By
breaking his ſtomach now, we
prevent the breaking of our own
hearts hereafter; for by this
means with the bleſſing of God
upon it, we ſhall have comfort
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61579:143"/>
in a Child, and the State and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Society, a governable Subject;
whereas contrariwiſe ſtubborneſs
and malapertneſs in youth grows
to contemptuouſneſs of Parents, &amp;
to faction and ſedition in the State,
in age. In purſuance of this,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let them learn and
be accuſtomed humbly to beg
the bleſſing of their Parents and
Progenitors; this (as meanly as
ſome inconſiderate people think
of it) is of mighty uſe: for it not
only teaches Children to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
their Parents, but wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
provokes and inflames the
affections of Parents towards
them; and beſides this, it is the
uſual method of conveying the
bleſſings of God upon them: for
though it be only God that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows
the bleſſing, yet his way is
to uſe the intervention and deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Parents, and generally
thoſe whom they bleſs (in this
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:61579:143"/>
caſe) are bleſſed, and thoſe whom
they curſe are curſed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Then let them learn
to read, to pray, and eſpecially
to ſay their Catechiſe; for though
theſe things are not throughly
underſtood by them now, yet
they will ſtick by them, and be
remembred when they are more
capable of improving them: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that it will be uneaſy to
one that hath been well princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
in his minority, to be impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and profane hereafter; or if
he ſhould prove ſo, there will yet
be ſome hopes of reclaiming him,
becauſe theſe things will ſome
time or other revive and awaken
his Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, after this, let them
be brought to the Biſhop, that he
may lay his hands upon them,
pray over them, bleſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
them. For <hi>if the fervent
Prayer of every righteous man avail
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:61579:144"/>
much,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
the ſolemn Prayer and
Benediction of Chriſts immediate
Subſtitute, and the prime Officer
of his Church is not inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Beſides, when men have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly
and ſolemnly addicted
themſelves to the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and made it their own act
by a voluntary and publick
choice, it will ordinarily have a
great influence upon them in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
honour and reputation as
well as Conſcience, that they
ſhall not eaſily go back from it,
and renounce it: and though it is
too true, that many have miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
afterwards in point of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
yet it is very obſervable in
experience, that few or none who
have been confirmed as aforeſaid,
have apoſtatized from the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and laſtly, After ſuch
foundations are laid, it is no time
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:61579:144"/>
yet to be ſecure, but theſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
muſt be followed with fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inſtructions, that ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
may be brought to a ſavoury
ſenſe of Piety, and to underſtand
the reaſons of the Religion which
they have imbraced, and ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be debauched with Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
nor toſſed to and fro by
every wind of new Doctrine; nay
further, theſe young perſons ought
to be put upon all the ingenuous
learning they are capable of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and we are able to afford
them, for the improvement of
their minds, that they be the
more ſerviceable to God both in
Church and State, by the intent
proſecution of which, they will
not only be kept out of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
which raſh and unimployed
youth is ready to run upon, but
become an Ornament to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and to their Relations; and
which is more, be able to imploy
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61579:145"/>
and enjoy themſelves in elder
years, without the uſual diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of drinking and gaming,
which commonly are the ſilly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts
and refuges of thoſe who
wanted Education in their youth.</p>
               <p>5. There is a principal branch
of Family Diſcipline yet remains
to be taken notice of, and that is
the curbing and reſtraining firſt
of all profaneneſs and contempt
of things ſacred, whether it be by
curſing, ſwearing, blaſpheming,
or any other impudent ſcurrility;
and then in the next place, of all
intemperance, drunkenneſs and
debauchery; for ſuch things as
theſe do not only bring a ſtain
and blemiſh, but a Curſe upon
the Family, and to be ſure the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of them is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with any pretence to
Piety.</p>
               <p>And the care and concern for
the ſuppreſſing theſe Vices, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:61579:145"/>
not only ſo far as to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
of it in all the conſtant
and ſetled members of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but alſo to the diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of it in thoſe that are only
occaſionally as Gueſts in it. For
how can any man that loves God,
indure to ſee him abuſed before
his face, and not interpoſe for
him, eſpecially where he hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
namely, <hi>within his own
Gates?</hi> Shall a man pretend Piety,
and make his table become a ſnare
to his own Soul, and his Houſe a
Sanctuary and priviledged place
for prophaneneſs? Nor let any
man think it becomes him in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility
and complaiſance to take no
notice of the one, or out of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality
to indulge the other; for
he that loves God as he ought to
do, and hath any meaſure of
manly courage, will not be ſo
ſheepiſh, but that he will at leaſt
diſcountenance ſuch indecencies
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61579:146"/>
within his juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>But as for thoſe that are ſetled
members of the Family, as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Relations; if any of
them be guilty of ſuch lewdneſs,
I do not ſay, that they muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
be baniſhed the Society: for
it may be divine Providence ſent
them thither on purpoſe for their
Cure, and that we might have
the glory of performing ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
a work, and thoſe Sinners
the happineſs of meeting with
the means of reformation; and
therefore we muſt when it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
ſo, look upon it as our duty
to apply our ſelves in good earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
to recover them: but if after
all good means uſed, there appear
no hopes of reformation, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a good mans duty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
ſuch perſons, both to avoid
the ſcandal and the infection of
them. And he that is truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious
of Gods honour and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61579:146"/>
the ſpiritual intereſt of his Family,
will not ſtick to Sacrifice the pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
intereſts of an uſeful Servant,
or a beneficial relation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. V. Family Diſcipline,
Or by what means the ſeveral
members of a Family may be
brought to conform to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Duties.</head>
               <p>HE that reſolves to maintain
Piety in his Family, muſt
do it by ſuch a method as this.
Firſt, Let him be ſure to keep up
the authority which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, and not through care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs,
facility or ſheepiſhneſs,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:61579:147"/>
level himſelf with thoſe he is to
govern, and ſuffer every body to
do what is right in their own
Eyes; for then no wonder if Piety
and all things elſe be out of order.
He that abjects himſelf ſhall be
a meer cypher, and ſignify no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in his own Houſe; but it is
very much in a mans own power
whether he will be deſpiſed or
no: for he that values himſelf
upon the dignity of his place, and
aſſerts his own juſt authority,
ſhall find Divine Providence ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by him therein, and ſtriking
an awe upon the ſpirits of thoſe
that ought to be governed, and
ſo he will be able to do good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
not only in his Cloſet, but
within the whole ſphere of his
Family.</p>
               <p>To this end let him obſerve,
that as in the fourth Command
God requires and expects, that
every Maſter of a Family be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:61579:147"/>
for all thoſe that are
<hi>within his Gates;</hi> ſo accordingly in
the fifth Commandment he hath
inveſted him with honour under
the title of Father and Mother,
and both commanded and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to reward obedience to him:
and let not any one think that
God will deſert his own inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſo as to permit the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
he hath here inveſted Parents
with, to be either trampled upon
by others, or proſtituted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
without ſevere animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
               <p>Let him conſider alſo the great
intereſt that lies in the conſerving
of paternal authority, in which
the foundation is laid, both of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and Eccleſiaſtical Government;
foraſmuch as accordingly as
people are inured to order, and
to be in ſubjection in private Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
ſuch will be their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
afterwards in Church or
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:61579:148"/>
State: for he that ſuffers his
Children and Servants to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious
towards himſelf, trains
them up for inſtruments of Schiſm
and Rebellion; and he that on
the other ſide countenances Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Diſobedience to publick
Authority, makes a leading caſe
for Rebellion and confuſion in his
own Family; but he that accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
thoſe which belong to him,
to obedience at home, makes his
Houſe a Seminary of good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and of good Chriſtians, and
will feel the comfort, and reap
the bleſſing of both.</p>
               <p>Above all let him conſider the
nearneſs and naturalneſs of the
Principles of Religion to the
minds of men; inſomuch that
there are hardly any but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the neceſſity and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it in their own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
in other things Inferiours
may perhaps diſpute the wiſdom
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:61579:148"/>
of their Governours, and ſo be
tempted to diſobey their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
but plain matters of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
admit of no diſpute, they
are impoſed by divine authority,
written upon the hearts of men,
and inacted and proclaimed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Conſciences, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
people may with the greater
readineſs be brought to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of them, if we do but ſtir
up and awaken, or at moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Conſcience by our Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But then</p>
               <p>Secondly, This authority ought
to be tempered with ſweetneſs
and benignity in the exerciſe of it;
for a man is not to be a Tyrant
but a Father in his Family, he
muſt not ſuperciliouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and imperiouſly will and
require, but incline and perſwade
by the uſe of all motives and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,
and by all the arts
of indearment oblige men to their
Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:61579:149"/>
A mans Family is his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and may be called himſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
at large and in all his
capacities, therefore unneceſſary
harſhneſs and ſeverity is as inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
in this Society, as cruelty to
his own fleſh is unnatural. And
it is commonly as inſucceſsful as
it is indecent; for power without
goodneſs is a weapon without
edge, which will go no further
than mere force carries it. When
men only fear, they will hate too,
and be ſure to obey no more than
needs muſt. Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 4. adviſes, <hi>Fathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
not your children to wrath,</hi> and
<hi>v.</hi> 9. forbids Maſters to uſe <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
towards Servants,</hi> but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Col. 3. 19. <hi>all bitterneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
wives is prohibited;</hi> for theſe
courſes (in ſuch near Relations)
ordinarily make them worſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of mending them, and ſtir
up all the mud and dirt of their
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:61579:149"/>
temper. Beſides, it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that the intereſt of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
men good is very great and
valuable, and he doth a very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
ſervice to God who obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
his Family to ſerve and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him; for by ſo doing a man
promotes the Salvation of his own
Soul, and he will have great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances
made for his perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
at the day of Judgment,
who in his more publick capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hath advanced Gods glory in
the Salvation of others. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is exceedingly worth the
while, that we ſhould deny our
ſelves, and condeſcend to any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
art and method of ingaging
men in Religion.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially this is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that the inſtances of Piety
and Devotion are above all things
to be voluntary, free and chearful,
or they are nothing worth; and
therefore harſhneſs and ſeverity
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:61579:150"/>
are the moſt improper inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for ſuch an effect; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
it muſt be wiſe Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
obliging carriage, ſweetneſs
of temper, kindneſs and benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that are the moſt likely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of prevailing in ſuch a caſe;
and ordinarily to gain this point,
no more is requiſite, than that a
man diſcriminate between the
good and the bad, that he favour
the one and diſcountenance the
other; and this alone will in time
make a ſtrange change in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
Eſpecially</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If in the third place
the Governour of a Family be a
great Example of Piety himſelf:
Rules without Examples are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
underſtood nor conſidered
by thoſe to whom they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded;
and he that goes about
to over-rule his Family to Piety
without making Conſcience of it
in his own practice, nay, who
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:61579:150"/>
doth not make his own life a great
pattern of what he perſwades to,
undermines his own indeavours,
and ſhall not only fail of ſucceſs,
but be ridiculous for his pains;
for every body is aware of this,
that if Devotion be neceſſary to
one, it is ſo to another; if the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
ought to pray to God, ſo
ought the Maſter; if one ought
to be zealous, certainly the other
ought not to be careleſs or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane;
or if one may be excuſed
the trouble of Religion, ſo may
the other alſo.</p>
               <p>And indeed it is hardly poſſible
for a man in theſe matters to have
the confidence earneſtly to preſs
the obſervation of that upon
thoſe under him, which is not
conſpicuous in his own practice;
or at leaſt, if he have the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
to do it, and can ſo well act
the part of the Hypocritical Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee,
as to <hi>lay heavy burdens upon
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:61579:151"/>
others, which he himſelf will not
touch with one of his fingers;</hi> yet
as he cannot do it heartily, ſo he
muſt be very vain if he thinks
men will not be able to ſee
through the diſguiſe, and very
ſottiſh if he can expect that ſuch
commands of his ſhould carry
any authority with them.</p>
               <p>But there is a majeſty in holy
Example, it not only commands
but charms men into compliance;
there is life and ſpirit in it, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that it animates and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames
all about a man; it makes
Piety to become viſible, and not
only ſhews it to be neceſſary, but
repreſents it with all its advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of goodneſs, beauty and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament;
it confutes mens mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
of it, anſwers their obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
againſt it, removes their
ſuſpicions, ſhames their cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
and lukewarmneſs: in a
word, it doth (after the manner
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:61579:151"/>
of all great Engines) work pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully,
though almoſt inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
               <p>We find by common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that men are ſooner made
wiſe and fit for great actions by
the reading of Hiſtory than by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
of Politicks; becauſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of fact ſtrikes us more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and the circumſtances of
things as they are done, inſtruct
us more effectually than all dry
rules and ſpeculations can do: to
which purpoſe it is to be remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the way of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is rather to teach men by
Examples than by rules; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the whole ſacred Writ
conſiſts principally of the Hiſtory
of the Lives of holy men, Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Wiſdom thinking that way the
fitteſt, not only to expreſs the
Laws of Virtue, but to make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of them upon the ſpirits
of men; and indeed (which is
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:61579:152"/>
further remarkable) there are
ſome of the more curious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
lines of Piety, which can
hardly be expreſt by words, but
are eaſily legible in the lives of
holy men.</p>
               <p>Therefore let him who would
ingage his Family to Devotion,
give them a fair Copy of it in his
own Example, and then he ſhall
not fail of the honour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to ſee it tranſcribed and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by thoſe about him.</p>
               <p>4. But that he may with the
more certainty and expedition at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this deſireable effect, it is
very neceſſary, that he neither
make the lives of thoſe he would
gain upon, burdenſome to them,
and exhauſt their ſpirits by too
great and conſtant drudgery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the affairs of the World, nor
that he make the buſineſs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
irkſome and unpleaſant to
them by unneceſſary length and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:61579:152"/>
tediouſneſs of Family-Devotion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For the former of theſe will take
off their edge, and leave them with
no heart to Religion; and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will beget an utter averſation
to it.</p>
               <p>As for the former, our Saviour
hath told us, <hi>we cannot ſerve God
and Mammon,</hi> and <hi>that no man can
ſerve two Maſters;</hi> i. e. either one
of them muſt be neglected, or both
ſerved very remiſly: for it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
when men are haraſſed with
ſecular buſineſs, they cannot have
ſpirits enough to attend Religion
with any vigour.</p>
               <p>And for the other, if the duties
of Religion be drawn out phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtically
to a tedious length, it
will be impoſſible (whileſt men
are men) that they ſhould either
be inclined to go to them with
ſuch chearfulneſs, or perſevere in
them with ſuch delight and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
as is requiſite.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:61579:153"/>
Therefore let the World be ſo
moderately purſued, as that time,
and ſtrength and room, may
be left for Devotion; and let the
Duties of Religion be ſo contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that they may be pleaſant
and eaſy, and then (beſides that
Devotions ſo performed are moſt
acceptable to God) it will be
no hard matter to bring our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
to comply with them. Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially</p>
               <p>5. If in the fifth place the
Governours of Families take care
to order and methodize affairs
ſo, that theſe different things
intrench not upon each other,
neither the World incroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Religion, nor Religion ſhut
out and exclude the common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of life; but both may take
their places in a juſt ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>We commonly obſerve, that
things in an heap, and which are
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:61579:153"/>
not digeſted into any order, look
vaſt and numerous, ſo as to amuſe
our minds in the contemplation
of them, inſomuch that we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
apprehend any of them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly,
nor comprehend them
all together; and in a crowd of
buſineſs, we are either ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with the multiplicity, or
diſtracted with the variety of
things before us, that we apply
our ſelves to nothing at all effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually;
for one hinders and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plants
the other. So it is here in
the caſe between the affairs of
the two Worlds, if both lie in
groſs before men, and no diſtinct
place be aſſigned to each of them;
the effect is, that both together
being an intolerable burden, one
of the two muſt neceſſarily be
neglected, and that commonly
falls to be the lot of Religion: or
if it happen that theſe offices are
not totally omitted, they will be
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61579:154"/>
ſure to be ſuperficially performed;
the minds of men neither being
ſufficiently prepared for them,
nor united enough to attend
them without diſtraction and
wanderings. Therefore as the
wiſe man tells us, <hi>there is a time
for every thing;</hi> ſo let every man,
who would promote Religion in
his Family, appoint ſet hours for
Prayer, and all the offices of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
and then it will neither
be difficult to obtain the conſtant
obſervance of them, nor ſo ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
to perform them careleſly
and formally.</p>
               <p>6. Sixthly and laſtly, It will be
the wiſdom of every Maſter of
a Family who would bring thoſe
which are under his care and tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to an uniformity in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the worſhip of God, and
to ſeriouſneſs and heartineſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
that he expreſs all tender affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to them and regard of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61579:154"/>
them, when any of them happen
to be ſick, or under any adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and by that means make to
himſelf an opportunity of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
them to take his counſel,
and follow his direction in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
caſes.</p>
               <p>We uſe to ſay, he that will
gain an intereſt in any man, ſo
that he may be uſeful to him, or
compliant with him in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,
muſt lay the foundation
of his Friendſhip in that mans ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.
For no man knows who
are his Friends till he hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to make experiment of them,
which cannot be done but in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity;
for every man is a Friend
to him that hath no need to him,
but he that like the <hi>good Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
deſerts us not in our greateſt
difficulties, him we have juſt
grounds to value and confide in.
Now above all kindneſſes men are
moſt ſenſible of thoſe which are
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61579:155"/>
done to their Bodies, and they
commonly take the meaſures of
all Friendſhip and ſincerity from
thence, and therefore he that will
win upon the minds of men, muſt
firſt oblige them in their bodily
intereſts.</p>
               <p>Beſides, as we obſerve, that all
inferiour Creatures are moſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
and docible at ſuch times
as wherein they are loweſt and
can leaſt help themſelves; ſo
mankind is moſt diſpoſed to take
advice, and moſt obedient to
counſel when he is at a non-plus
in his affairs, and eſpecially
when the vanities of this World,
which dazled his Eyes before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to vaniſh, and there ſeems to
be but one way left with him
(that is, to prepare for another
life) he will then freely admit of
Diſcourſe of the other World, and
be glad to comply with all ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
advice in order thereunto.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:61579:155"/>
Theſe ſeaſons of adverſity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are by no means to be let
ſlip by him who is tender of the
Souls of thoſe who are under his
charge.</p>
               <p>To which add, that foraſmuch
as it is the conſtant method of all
the Zealots and Emiſſaries of falſe
Religions to inſinuate themſelves
into ſick and calamitous perſons,
to the end that by ſuch an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
they may gain Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to their party, and they too
frequently find this ſubtilty ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful:
the conſideration hereof
ought to awaken the diligence,
and incourage the hopes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of all thoſe that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
deſire to ſave their own
Souls, and thoſe that are imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued
with them, to apprehend
and improve ſuch opportunities
to better purpoſes; eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that in ſuch ſeaſons men are
as capable of good principles as of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:61579:156"/>
bad, if there be not as much
ſhameful and ſupine careleſsneſs
on the one ſide, as there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
vigilance and application
on the other. And ſo much for
Family-Piety.</p>

               <p>AS it is certain we were not

               </p>
               <p>Now every private man is in
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:61579:157"/>
ſome meaſure concerned in the
Neighbourhood and Pariſh where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he dwells, and whereto he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs;
and therefore ſhould ſo
far at leaſt diſpenſe the influence
of his zeal for God and Religion:
for Almighty God, <hi>who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the bounds of mens habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
having thus ſetled every man
in his ſtation, expects that he
ſhould look upon this as his
proper ſphere, and adorn it as
his peculiar Province.</p>
               <p>No private man hath any juſt
reaſon ordinarily to prompt him
to go beyond this, foraſmuch as
if every good man would do his
part within theſe bounds, the
whole World would be amended,
and he that is remiſs and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in this, cannot eaſily ſatisfy
himſelf that he hath demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſuch love to God as becomes

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:61579:157"/>
which otherwiſe by a conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
diſcharge of himſelf in this
particular might redound to
him.</p>
               <p>Now that which we mean by
the relation to a Neighbourhood
or a Pariſh hath a double conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
Firſt, As every Pariſh
is or ought to be a branch or
member of the Church. Secondly,
As it is a branch or member of
the Commonwealth. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
there is a double obligation
lies upon every man that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the bounds of it, and from
thence ariſe duties of a different
nature: for brevity and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
I will diſtinguiſh them by
the names of Eccleſiaſtical and
Civil Piety, and then ſhew what
each of them comprehends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with that which I call
Eccleſiaſtical Piety, or the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of ſuch publick duties as
eſpecially concern the Society of a
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:61579:158"/>
Church. And this conſiſts in theſe
few following particulars.</p>
               <p>1. That a man join himſelf to,
and carry himſelf as a member of
the Church, and not out of pride,
phantaſtry or contempt ſeparate
himſelf from it, or ſchiſmatically
ſet up Factions and Conventicles
againſt it. It is evident, that our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt eſtabliſhed the
Society of a Church; that is, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
that all thoſe who would
be his Diſciples, ſhould not content
themſelves ſingly and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to believe on him, but ſhould
all be obliged to aſſociate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and make up a body or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
corporation wherein they
were to hold Communion with
each other, as members, as well
as with him their head. The
ends and uſes of this inſtitution
were very many and great; for
beſides that by this means order
and unity is promoted, which is
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:61579:158"/>
very beautiful in the Eyes of God
himſelf, our Lord hereby provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that the truth of Chriſtianity
might be jointly held up in the
World, and the ſeveral members
of this Society become mutually
more helpful and comfortable to
each other, and alſo that by a
conſtant method of Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe
here, they may be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for Eternal Friendſhip and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
in Heaven. In ſubſerviency
to all theſe ends, publick Officers
were appointed in the Church to
govern and to inſtruct the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
members of it, which it were
plainly impoſſible for them to do
(unleſs their numbers were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
infinite and equal to that of
the people) if it had not been that
the people were to join together,
and become a common flock for
thoſe Officers to govern and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct.</p>
               <p>Moreover it was alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:61579:159"/>
of our Saviour, that this
Church of his ſhould be but one,
and Catholick, imbracing all the
true Believers all the World over,
and therefore it is called his Body
and his Spouſe: from whence it
follows that every man who will
partake of the benefits which flow
from him, muſt be a part of this
Body, and thereby hold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with him by Conjunction
with that, which is otherwiſe
impoſſible to be done, than by
joining with that part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church where it hath
pleaſed the Divine Providence to
ſettle our abode and habitation,
that is, in the Pariſh and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
where we dwell; for
without this, though it's poſſible
we may retain the fame Faith in
our hearts with the Catholick
Church, yet we cannot perform
the offices of members, nor ſerve
the ends of ſuch a Society. The
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:61579:159"/>
reſult is therefore, that it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
every Chriſtians Duty to
communicate in all the offices of
Chriſtianity, to ſubmit to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
to be ſubject to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
ahd to comply with the
orders of that part of the Church
amongſt which the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
hath placed him.</p>
               <p>I ſay <hi>ordinarily,</hi> becauſe it may
happen that the Society of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
amongſt whom a man lives
may be heretical in their Doctrine,
or Idolatrous in their Worſhip,
and then it will not be his ſin
but his duty to ſeparate from
them; but bating that caſe, and
where the Doctrine is ſound, and
the worſhip free from Idolatry,
I ſee not what elſe can acquit
him of Schiſm that ſeparates, or
what can be ſufficient to diſſolve
the obligation of joining with the
Catholick Church by Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with that particular Society,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:61579:160"/>
or Member of it, where he is
placed.</p>
               <p>Therefore let not the good
Chriſtian without flat neceſſity,
ſuffer himſelf to be alienated from
the particular Church, leſt by ſo
doing he loſe the comforts and
benefits of the Catholick Church;
but let it be his care and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
(ſo far as it is in his power)
that there may be but one Church
in the World, as was the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Saviour: to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
let him not hearken to the
fond pretences of purer Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and double refined worſhip,
or to the vain boaſts of greater
edification in other Aſſemblies;
for beſides that a man may juſtly
expect moſt of Gods bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe means which are moſt
his duty to apply himſelf unto; it
is alſo evident, that if ſuch ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions
be attended to, it will be
flatly impoſſible that there ſhould
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:61579:160"/>
ever be ſuch a thing as unity or
order in the Chriſtian Church;
nay theſe conceits will not only
diſtract and confound the order
of the Church, but they ſerve to
fill mens heads with endleſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
and their hearts with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
ſcruples about purity of
adminiſtrations, ſo that they ſhall
reſt no where, but under pretence
of ſoaring higher and higher, ſhall
ramble from one Church to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
till at laſt they caſt off all
Ordinances as the higheſt attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſpirituality.</p>
               <p>Nor let him give ear to any
peeviſh inſinuations againſt the
Church and publick worſhip, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
account that there are ſome
Rites or Ceremonies made uſe of
which are only of humane inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;
for it is not only reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to hope that God will be well
pleaſed with humility, peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and obedience to humane
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:61579:161"/>
Laws, but certain, that there is
no Church in the World, that is
or can be without ſome obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that have no higher original
than humane inſtitution. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
theſe, and all other ſuch
like principles of ſeparation, let
him indeavour to ſecure himſelf;
Firſt, by diſmiſſing the prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Education, and the unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
ſcrupuloſities of a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
temper, and above all, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
himſelf of pride and pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticalneſs,
and then he will eaſily
and comfortably comply with
any ſound part of the Chriſtian
Church. In purſuance whereof</p>
               <p>2. He muſt diligently frequent
all the publick offices of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in that Society, whether it be
Prayers, Preaching or reading the
word of God, or Adminiſtration
of the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For it is
a mighty ſhame that a man
ſhould pretend to be of the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:61579:161"/>
Church, who cares not how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or how ſeldom he comes at it,
and who ſlights the advantages
of its Communion. For ſuch a
man, however he may hector and
ſwagger for the notion of a
Church, manifeſtly betrays that
all is but humour or intereſt, and
no true principle of Chriſtianity
at the bottom; and really, he doth
more diſhonour to that Society,
than the profeſſed Schiſmatick
doth or can do. For beſides that
he incourages them in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of it, and diſcourages good
men in their zeal for it; he fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the ſuſpicion of Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
men, that Religion is but a
politick trick to catch ſilly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
with, whileſt thoſe that are
privy to the plot, keep out of the
bondage of it: I need not adde,
That he defeats the inſtitution of
our Saviour, that he baulks his
own Conſcience (if he have any)
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:61579:162"/>
and aggravates his own Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which are all very ſad
things.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the bleſſings
and comforts of frequenting the
offices of the Church are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and great, that it is not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
how any man who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the duty of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in general, ſhould be able to
neglect the particular inſtances of
it. For beſides that the Church
is Gods Houſe, where he is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
preſent, and where we meet
him, and place our ſelves under
his eye and obſervation, and from
whence he uſually diſpenſes his
favours; it is a great furtherance
of our zeal and piety, to be in
the preſence of one another, where
the example of holy fervour and
devotion in one, powerfully ſtrikes
and affects others. There is alſo
an extraordinary majeſty in the
word of God, when it is not only
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:61579:162"/>
fitted to our peculiar condition,
but authoritatively pronounced,
and applied to our Conſcience by
Gods Meſſenger. Above all, in
Prayers, when our Petitions and
requeſts are not only put up to
Almighty God, by his own Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
appointed for this purpoſe;
but our weakneſs is relieved, our
ſpirits incouraged, and we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
(notwithſtanding our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
meanneſs or guilt) to hope
for acceptance and ſucceſs in our
deſires, by the concurrent Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of ſo many holy men as
there join with us in the ſame
ſuit, and in the ſame words, and
whoſe united importunity beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
Heaven, and prevails with
Almighty Goodneſs for a bleſſing.
Wherefore let no man permit the
private exerciſes of Piety it ſelf,
ſuch as Prayer, reading, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
to ſuperſede or hinder his
attendance upon the publick offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:61579:163"/>
of the Church, ſeeing that as
theſe yield more publick honour
to the Divine Majeſty, ſo they
are more effectual for our own
benefit; much leſs let ſloth or too
great eagerneſs upon the affairs
of the World, make us forget or
neglect them; but leaſt of all let
any lukewarm indifferency or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical
careleſsneſs ſeiſe upon
any man in this particular; but
let the man who glories to be of
the Chriſtian Church, be ſure to
be found there in the Aſſemblies
of Gods Servants.</p>
               <p>3. And more particularly, let
him not neglect the opportunities
of receiving the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper, as often as they
are preſented to him, unleſs ſome
weighty occaſion hinder or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him. It is well known to
have been the uſe of the primitive
Church to adminiſter this holy
Sacrament as often as it held any
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:61579:163"/>
ſolemn Aſſembly for divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and the Chriſtians then as
duly received it as they came to
Church; nor did the frequency of
it abate their reverence to it, but
highly increaſed it rather. And
this office they therefore called
the Communion, becauſe it was
the ſymbol of a compleat mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Church, and the fulleſt
inſtance of that Society. To have
been kept from it by any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
was then looked upon as a
great Calamity; but to be debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from it by the cenſure of the
Church, was as dreadful to them
as the Sentence of Death. They
ſought to be reſtored to it with
tears, with proſtrations in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Cloth
and Aſhes, with all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
of their Friends, and
all the intereſts they could make.</p>
               <p>There was no need in thoſe
times to uſe arguments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
men of the duty, or repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:61579:164"/>
exhortations to preſs them to
the performance of it; the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Church had no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in anſwering objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, or removing imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
ſcruples about it, much leſs
was there any occaſion to urge
the obſervance of it by humane
Laws; for they remembred it
was inſtituted by their Saviour <hi>on
the ſame night in which he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed,</hi>
for the Commemoration
of his Paſſion, and recommended
to their obſervance by the moſt
obliging circumſtances; they
found the conſtant ſolemnity of
it ſetled in all Churches by the
Apoſtles, and they were well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of the unſpeakable comforts
of it.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon of all theſe
things holds as much in theſe
times as then (ſaving that men
are not ſo conſcientious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
as they were): for in the firſt
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:61579:164"/>
place, it hath been the cuſtom of
the Church in all times ſince, to
make this Sacrament the badge
and cognizance of her members,
until of late thoſe have pretended
to be Churches where there was
neither Order nor Unity, neither
Sacraments adminiſtred nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
perſons qualified to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
them; and it's great pity and
ſhame that ſuch an unhappy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
ſhould preſcribe againſt all
Antiquity. And then ſecondly,
as for the inſtitution of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
by our Saviour, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
that he did not deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by way of counſel and advice,
ſo as to leave it to our diſcretion
or courteſy to obſerve this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or omit it, but by expreſs
and poſitive command, <hi>Do this in
remembrance of me;</hi> and therefore
there is no room for the cavil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
mixt Communion, as if
we were excuſed from celebrating
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:61579:165"/>
the Lord's Supper, becauſe others
do it unworthily; which is as
much as to ſay, becauſe ſome do
it as they ſhould not, I may chuſe
whether I will do it at all. But
(as I ſaid) here is an expreſs
command that <hi>we do it,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we have no liberty to omit it
upon any ſuch pretence. And
upon the ſame account it will be
in vain to pretend I am not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for it, and therefore muſt
be excuſed; for when our Lord
hath made it our duty to do it, it
is our duty alſo to do it as we
ſhould do, and the neglect of one
duty will not excuſe another, <hi>i. e.</hi>
our ſin of unpreparedneſs will be
no apology for our ſin in total o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of the Sacrament. The
whole truth is, here are two
things required of us, one expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and the other implied; the
expreſs duty is; that we celebrate
the memorial of our Saviours Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:61579:165"/>
the implied duty is, that
this be done with ſuch preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as agrees with ſo ſacred a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery;
both theſe therefore are
to be performed: for as my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Sacrament will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
my coming unpreparedly, ſo
much leſs will my unprepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
excuſe my not coming at all.
But of the two, it ſeems far the
more pardonable to come, though
ſomewhat unpreparedly, than not
to come becauſe of unprepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
for that is neither to come
nor prepare neither. I ſay, though
neither ought to be done, yet it
is plainly better to offend in the
point of an implied duty, than of
an expreſs one; but eſpecially, it
is more tolerable to commit one
ſin than both, as he that comes
not to the Lords Supper at all, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
doth.</p>
               <p>But then thirdly, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of this holy Sacrament, thoſe
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:61579:166"/>
are ſo vaſtly great, that the man
is as well inſenſible of his own
good as of the honour of Chriſt
Jeſus, who willfully neglects the
Lords Supper. For in the firſt
place, by commemorating the
Paſſion of our Lord in that holy
Feaſt, we not only perform an
office of obedience and gratitude
to our Saviour, but we ſtrengthen
our Faith in the efficacy of his
Death and Sacrifice for the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſin, which affords the
greateſt relief to our guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
that can be. And together
herewith we melt our own hearts
into contrition, fears and ſorrow
for thoſe ſins of ours which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
ſuch an atonement. For
who can conſider what his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
ſuffered, and <hi>look upon him
whom we have pierced,</hi> and not
mourn heartily for his ſin and his
danger? Again, by eating and
drinking at the Lords Table we
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:61579:166"/>
are made ſenſible of the happy
eſtate of Friendſhip with God,
which we are now reſtored to by
the interceſſion of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.
Moreover by commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Death, and the ends and
effects of it, we fortify our own
minds againſt the fear of Death,
and by feeding upon his body and
blood we have the pledges of our
own Reſurrection and Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and to ſay no more (though
in ſo copious and comfortable a
ſubject) by partaking of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and blood we become united
to him, and partake of the ſame
ſpirit that was in him.</p>
               <p>And now after all this, who
will make that an excuſe for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the Sacrament, that they
do not find or obſerve, that either
themſelves or others profit by it?
What, is it no profit that we have
done our duty and expreſt our
gratitude to ſo great a Benefactor?
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:61579:167"/>
Is it no profit to ſee Chriſt Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
before our Eyes, and to ſee
him pour out his heart blood for
Sinners? Is it no profit to be
made ingenuouſly to weep over
our own ſins? Is it no priviledge,
no comfort to be admitted to the
Lords Table, in token of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and reconciliation with him?
Certainly there is no body but
profits ſomething more or leſs by
theſe things; and if there be any
man who doth not profit greatly
by them, he muſt needs have a
very naughty heart indeed, and
had need to prepare himſelf, and
go often to the Sacrament that it
may be mended. But however
let the good Chriſtian gladly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
all opportunities of this holy
ſolemnity, and not doubt to find
comfort by it.</p>
               <p>4. As for the other offices of
the Church, ſuch as Prayers eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
let him remember to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:61579:167"/>
them conſtantly and intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
By <hi>conſtancy</hi> of attendance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
publick worſhip, I mean, that
he ſhould not only apply himſelf
to it on the Sundays or Lords
Days, but every Day of the Week
if there be opportunity: and by
<hi>intireneſs</hi> of Gods Service, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it to be his duty both to go
at the beginning, and to join in
it both Morning and Evening, that
by all together he may not only
ſure himſelf and his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of his heartineſs and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but demonſtrate to all about
him the great ſenſe he hath of the
moment of Religion, and that he
looks upon the ſerving of God as
of greater conſequence than all
other intereſts whatſoever.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
the frequenting the publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
every day (where they are to
be had) it is obſervable in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10. 2. that
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:61579:168"/>
amongſt other inſtances of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it is ſaid of him <hi>that he prayed
to God always,</hi> which cannot well
be underſtood of any thing elſe
but his daily frequenting the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayers, becauſe his private
Prayers could not be ſo well
known as to make his Character.
But moſt expreſly it is ſaid of all
that believed, <hi>Acts 2. 46. that they
continued daily with one accord in
the temple,</hi> which muſt needs prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
have reference to this duty
of publick Prayer; and it is very
hard if any man be ſo put to it,
that he cannot ſpare one hour in
a Day to do publick honour to the
Divine Majeſty, or rather it is
a great ſign of unbelief in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
as well as want of love to
him, if a man cannot truſt God
ſo far as to hope that ſuch a time
ſpent in his ſervice ſhall be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
by his bleſſing upon the
reſidue of the Day; or however,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:61579:168"/>
a good Chriſtian will be well
contented, and gladly ſacrifice ſo
much of his ſecular intereſts (as
this comes to) to the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
               <p>As for the ſecond point, <hi>viz.</hi>
going at the beginning of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
it is a ſhameful neglect which
ſeveral perſons are guilty of, who
will not altogether be abſent from
the Church, but yet will come
commonly ſo late, that they not
only loſe part of the Prayers, but
enter very abruptly and irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
upon that which they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of. It is poſſible a man may
ſometimes be ſurprized by the
time, or diverted from his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by ſome emergency; but to
be frequently tardy is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that he loves ſomething bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than God and his worſhip.
For doubtleſs a good Chriſtian
would ordinarily chooſe rather to
ſtay for the Miniſter, than that
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:61579:169"/>
the publick office ſhould ſtay for
him, and thinks it fitter to ſpend
a little time in preparing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
his heart for the duties of
Religion, than either to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the divine preſence rudely, or
to ſerve him only by halves.</p>
               <p>And as for the third branch of
this inſtance of Devotion, <hi>viz.</hi> the
reſorting both to Morning and
Evening Service, it is obſervable
<hi>Acts</hi> 3. 1. that the Apoſtles <hi>were
at the temple at the hour of Prayer,
being the ninth hour,</hi> which is both
a proof of their frequenting the
Evening Service as well as that of
the Morning, and alſo an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of obſerving the juſt and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
times of publick worſhip; and
ſurely it will become every good
Chriſtian to be lead by ſuch a
precedent, eſpecially ſeeing the
Goſpel worſhip which we reſort
to is ſo much more excellent and
comfortable than the Jewiſh was
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61579:169"/>
(which thoſe holy men thus care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
frequented) as we ſhall ſee
by and by.</p>
               <p>5. In the next place it is to be
minded, that in all theſe publick
approaches to Gods Houſe, we
are to expreſs a great reverence
towards the Divine Majeſty: by
which I do not only mean that
we ought in our hearts to think
worthily of him, and proſtrate
all the inward powers of our Souls
to him, but that in our outward
man, in our carriage and bodily
deportment we expreſs an awful
regard to him, by all ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
and ſigns, as according to
the common opinion of men, are
taken to betoken the higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and obſervance, ſuch as
ſtanding, kneeling, bowing, and
proſtrations of our ſelves before
him.</p>
               <p>For though the heart be that
which God principally looks at,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:61579:170"/>
yet foraſmuch as he made our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
as well as our Souls, and we
hope he will ſave both, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
expects <hi>we ſhould glorify him,
both with our ſouls and with our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
which are his, and which he
hath bought with a price,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.
20. And indeed there is ſuch a
nearneſs and ſympathy between
our bodies and ſpirits, that they
ordinarily move by conſent, and
draw one another into compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
Inſomuch, that he who
truly bows his Soul to God, can
ſcarcely forbear at the ſame time
to bow his knees to him alſo; and
he on the other ſide that bows his
knee to him, is by that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his body in ſome meaſure
put in mind to entertain reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
thoughts and affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him.</p>
               <p>And this care of bodily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is the more important in
publick ſervice, and eſpecially in
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:61579:170"/>
Gods Houſe, becauſe (as I noted
before) then and there his honour
and grandeur is concerned, and
any indecent carriage in ſuch a
caſe, is an affront to him, and
expoſes him to contempt in the
eyes of men, and therefore that
carriage which in ſecret worſhip
might admit of excuſe, will in
publick be intolerable profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let not the pious
man be affrighted by any one out
of the expreſſions of bodily reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
under the notion of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
which is become a Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
by which weak men are
made afraid of every inſtance of
a decorous or generous Devotion.
There can be no culpable ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
in our worſhip, ſo long as
we have the true object for it, and
whileſt we uſe not ſuch expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our Devotion as he hath
forbidden; but this of bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:61579:171"/>
is ſo far from being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
that it is expreſly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the holy Scripture, and
hath been conſtantly practiſed by
all holy men.</p>
               <p>Nor let the phancy of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
worſhip, required under the
Goſpel, beguile any man into a
contempt or neglect of bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence;
for it is plain, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Chriſtian Religion
raiſes mens inward Devotion
higher, yet it abates nothing of
outward adoration; but rather
when it requires the former
ſhould be more intenſe and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate,
it ſuppoſes the other
ſhould be anſwerable, becauſe it
is natural ſo to be; for this being
the acceſſory cannot but follow
the principal.</p>
               <p>It is true, there is a poſſibility
that more ſtreſs may be laid upon
the ſhadow than the ſubſtance,
and ſome men may hope to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:61579:171"/>
God Almighty out of his
right to their hearts, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
of their bodies: but the
fault in this caſe is not, that there
is too much of the latter, but too
little of the former; and the good
Chriſtian therefore will be ſure
to join both together; and as he
will come to Gods Houſe with
the moſt elevated affections, ſo
he will expreſs his apprehenſions
of the infinite diſtance between
him and the Divine Majeſty by
the lowlieſt poſtures of his
body.</p>
               <p>6. Next to this let the pious
man think it his duty to pay ſome
meaſure of reverence to Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
as well as to the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and for his ſake. In the Old
Teſtament, God took ſpecial care
of the reſpect and dignity of his
Miniſters as well as of their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
for indeed all contumely
towards them redounds upon
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:61579:172"/>
himſelf: And the new Teſtament
is very full and expreſs in this
particular, they are thoſe that
<hi>watch for our ſouls, and muſt</hi> give
account for them, they are Gods
<hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> and <hi>workers together
with him,</hi> thoſe by whoſe hands
he pardons <hi>and bleſſes</hi> his people,
and therefore he holds them <hi>as
the ſtars in his right hand,</hi> and
thoſe who ſlight them that ſpeak
in his name on earth <hi>affront him
that ſpeaketh from heaven,</hi> but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the many paſſages in the
New Teſtament to this purpoſe,
that of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Theſſal.</hi>
1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 5. 13. is very conſiderable, the
words are theſe, <hi>We beſeech you
brethren to know thoſe who labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
you, and are over you in the
Lord, and to eſteem them very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in love for their works ſake.</hi> The
laſt words are ſo emphatical they
cannot be expreſſed in Engliſh,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to give
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:61579:172"/>
them greater eſteem than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
is due to them for their
work and office ſake, <hi>i. e.</hi> to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
them above their parts and
merits and quality in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
for the ſake of that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they ſtand in to God, and
for their office and uſefulneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our Souls.</p>
               <p>And indeed touching that laſt
particular, it is evident in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that all thoſe who have any
regard to their own Souls, are
ſuch as indeavour to raiſe in their
hearts an eſteem for their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
not only that they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
his ſtudies and ſweeten
his labours to him, but that they
may render themſelves the more
capable of following his counſels
and receiving benefit by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions:
and on the other ſide,
thoſe that ſlight and vilify the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of ſuch, neither do nor poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
can (ordinarily) receive any
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:61579:173"/>
benefit by their Miniſtry, and
therefore the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4. 4.
ſpeaking of a profligate and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſort of people, uſeth this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<hi>this people are as thoſe that
ſtrive with the Prieſt, q. d.</hi> they are
not only horribly vicious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane,
but they are incorrigible too.
Therefore the piouſly diſpoſed
man will be ſure to reverence
Gods Miniſters, both for Gods
ſake and his own too, and this
leads me to another duty of kind
to the former, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. That the good Chriſtian ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it an office of publick Piety
as well as of common juſtice, to
pay truly and faithfully his Tithes
and Church dues to the Miniſter:
this the Apoſtle intimates by the
expreſſion <hi>of double honour,</hi> 1 Tim.
5. 17. Natural reaſon and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſe of mankind requires
that they which <hi>ſerve at the Altar
ſhould live upon the Altar.</hi> And in
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:61579:173"/>
the Old Teſtament when God
himſelf ſetled the proviſion for his
Miniſters, he did it moſt amply
and honourably; and under the
Goſpel pious antiquity took care
that the Chriſtian Church and
Miniſtry thereof ſhould be libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
indowed, till the envy and
rapacity of after-times deprived
it of a great part of its rights;
but now after thoſe depredations
it would be an horrible ſin and
ſhame to rob the Church of any
part of that remainder, or frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently
to diminiſh or impair it.
For it is evident, that no man can
pretend any right to it, as having
neither purchaſed it nor hired it,
nor had it deſcend upon him by
inheritance; the Churches due
being a reſerved eſtate, or a rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
upon every private eſtate.
And it is notorious that it is what
pious Anceſtry conſecrated to
this uſe, and therefore no part of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:61579:174"/>
it can be invaded, intercepted or
incroached upon without Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and the Curſe of God.</p>
               <p>And for proof of this, we need
no more than to obſerve the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſucceſs of ſuch men as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loin
from the Church, and (as
their own phraſe is) are always
pinching on the Parſons ſide.
They are generally a querulous,
uneaſy, lean, hungry and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifty
ſort of people, God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
blowing upon and blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their other labours for the
ſake of this accurſed thing in their
Tents; or if any of them thrive
for the preſent, yet, one time or
other, a Coal from the Altar will
take hold of, and fire their Neſts.
Whereas on the other ſide, thoſe
that are juſt to God in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
ordinarily find the benefit
of it in the ſucceſs of their affairs,
and they are commonly chearful
in their ſpirits and proſperous in
the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:61579:174"/>
But the good Chriſtian will not
need theſe arguments, for he loves
God and his ſervice, and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
and thinks it fit that he
that <hi>reaps ſpiritual things ought li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally
to ſow temporal things,</hi> at
leaſt he will rather abridge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
than wrong the Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it may be never ſo clever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done, under the countenance
of a corrupt cuſtom or preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
So far from it, that</p>
               <p>8. In the eighth place he will be
an example of pious munificence,
and put himſelf to ſome volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
coſt for the Ornaments of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and the Houſe of God, and
that his publick ſervice may be
performed with gravity, decency
and ſolemnity. For he thinks it
very fit that the great Majeſty of
Heaven and Earth ſhould not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be worſhipped with ſincerity
and devotion, but with grandeur
and magnificence. He will not
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:61579:175"/>
therefore humour the profaneneſs
of degenerate times ſo much as <hi>to
forſwear building of Churches,</hi> if it
be in his power, nor much leſs
will be backward or ſtingy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
of them when there is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion;
for he cannot find in his
heart to let Gods Houſe lie waſte
when he builds his own, nor
frame his mind to think that is
good enough for the uſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which he could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with for his private ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
if better were in
his power, and therefore will in
all Pariſh-meetings about theſe
matters vote for God againſt his
own Purſe, for he is of <hi>Davids</hi>
mind, who had no fancy for a
cheap Religion, <hi>nor would ſerve
God with that which coſt him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
1 Chron. 21. 24. And as he
<hi>Pſal. 84. verſes</hi> 5, 6, 7. bleſſes
thoſe that took pains to repair
the ways, and to make the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:61579:175"/>
eaſy towards God Houſe at
<hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſo the pious Chriſtian
will indeavour by his counſel and
example, that the whole external
face of Religion may be light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
beautiful and decorous in
the place where he dwells, to the
end that not only his animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
may the more chearfully
comply with the devotion of his
mind, but that thoſe alſo may be
invited to frequent Gods Houſe
and worſhip, who have not yet
experimented the ſpiritual raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of it. In further purſuance
whereof</p>
               <p>9. The pious man (we ſpeak of)
will together with all the aforeſaid
allurements, uſe alſo his utmoſt
indeavours by perſwaſions, incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements,
and all other fit means
to prevail with the whole Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
or Pariſh to frequent
the Church. For as he would not
go to Heaven alone, nay knows aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:61579:176"/>
he ſhall not come there, if
he do not indeavour to carry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
along with him; ſo neither
is he contented to feed upon the
fatneſs of Gods Houſe alone, but
would have others partake with
him.</p>
               <p>He hath a holy indignation to
obſerve Theaters to be filled, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes
and Markets thronged,
and Gods Houſe unfurniſhed with
Gueſts. He wonders at the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderateneſs
of men who incur
ſuch a guilt by the contempt of
Religion, and pitties their folly
that deny themſelves ſo many
comforts and advantages as Gods
Houſe affords above any other
place of reſort whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he conſiders, that not
only God is more honour'd by a
general confluence to his ſervice,
but that his own heart is more
inlarged and chearful, and his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
more raiſed (as it were
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:61579:176"/>
moving in Conſort) when there
is a brave concourſe in Divine Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pſal. 122. 1, 2. I rejoiced</hi> (ſaith
the holy man) <hi>when they ſaid,
Come, let us go up to the Houſe of
the Lord, our feet ſhall ſtand within
thy gates O Jeruſalem.</hi> Well-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
perſons (it ſeems) then were
wont to call upon and provoke
one another, and to flock toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Companies towards the
Temple, and it was a pleaſant
ſpectacle to the Pſalmiſt to behold
it. And let good Chriſtians be
aſhamed to be outdone in any
thing of this kind, ſince our
Church and worſhip is ſo incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
more excellent than
theirs. What was it that a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Jew could provoke his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to go up to the Temple for?
to ſee a Beaſt ſlain and a ſmoke
made with the fat and entrails, or
to muſe upon the obſcure Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:61579:177"/>
in the Fabrick, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſils,
the Ornaments and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of that Houſe? But a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
goes to the Church to hear
the lively Oracles of God, to ſee
Heaven opened in all its glories,
and to be ſhewed the way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Therefore he that is ſenſible of
the great odds on the ſide of the
Chriſtian worſhip, and who hath
ſo much Prudence and Charity
as to render him ſerviceable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
his Neighbours to ſuch a
purpoſe, will jog and awaken
them out of their ſloth and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of going to the Church, by
wiſe and manly Diſcourſes, and
friendly and familiar Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
from the conſiderations of
the ſcandal to Religion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to the Miniſter by
the peoples remiſsneſs, and of the
duty and benefit of diligent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
and he will with the ſame
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:61579:177"/>
zeal and care indeavour to anſwer
their objections, and remove their
ſcruples about it; and eſpecially
conſidering, that this is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
better taken, and ſinks deeper
into ſuch men as need it, when it
is done (not only by the Miniſter,
who is preſumed by theſe incogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
perſons to do it for his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
or the reputation of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or profeſſion, but) by thoſe
who are upon the ſame terms
with themſelves.</p>
               <p>To all this, the pious man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
will wiſely improve the
intereſt of his Charity to oblige
the poorer ſort to their duty, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing
moſt liberally to them
who are moſt inclinable to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his counſel in this particular;
and for the middle ſort of men,
he will trade and buy and ſell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
choice with thoſe that are beſt
affected to the Church and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
But if all this ſhould not do,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:61579:178"/>
and that he cannot prevail upon
all, yet</p>
               <p>10. In the laſt place, he will
not fail at leaſt to over-rule his
own Family, that they ſhall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
and conſtantly frequent
the Church, and ſo be an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to the Neighbourhood. This
I have ſhewed before, every Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of a Family hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from God to do, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture affords us ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the efficacy and ſucceſs
of making uſe of it to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
amongſt the reſt, by virtue
hereof, <hi>Joſhua</hi> undertook for his
Houſe, that <hi>they ſhould ſerve the
Lord;</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe under him ſo, that he
is ſaid <hi>to fear the Lord with all his
Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed a Maſter of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
will be able to give a very
ſorry account of his Family, if he
cannot oblige them to go to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:61579:178"/>
Church with him; for we find
by woful experience, that where
under pretence of ſcruples about
the publick worſhip, inferiours
have claimed the priviledge of
exemption, and been permitted
to reſort to Conventicles, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
hath been, that ſuch perſons
have not only grown captious and
inſolent, and by degrees to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
their Superiours, but having
by this means gotten from under
the Eye of their Governours have
made no ſcruple to run into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery.</p>
               <p>Therefore let the pious man
ſtrictly charge himſelf thus far,
and look upon himſelf as very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant
in his place, if he do
not ſo much publick honour to
God and Religion, as to bring his
Family to the Houſe of God.</p>

               <p>WHen our bleſſed Saviour,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 13. ſaith to his
Diſciples, <hi>Ye are the ſalt of the
earth,</hi> he did not direct himſelf
only to his Apoſtles, or to them
and their Succeſſors, the Paſtors
of his Church (as ſome have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined)
but to all his Diſciples in
general. For beſides that the
Beatitudes which he pronounces
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:61579:179"/>
in the former part of the Chapter,
and his other Diſcourſe (purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
of them) which immediately
precedes theſe words, apparently
concern all Chriſtians, ſo far as
they are qualified for them; It is
evident alſo by S. <hi>Luke, Chap.</hi> 14.
comparing the 25 Verſe with the
32. that it was his intention to
apply this title of being <hi>the ſalt of
the earth,</hi> to the whole body of
true Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>And then the importance of
that expreſſion will be this, That
the true ſpirit of Chriſtianity is
and ought to be a principle of
activity; and the Profeſſors of this
Religion are not to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with paſſive innocency, and
that they eſcape the contagion of
evil Example, nor be corrupted
and debauched by the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or cuſtoms of the World: But
that they muſt look upon it as
their duty to better and improve
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:61579:180"/>
the ſtate of Mankind, to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon it, to ſeaſon and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
others from corruption as
well as themſelves.</p>
               <p>Nor is this activity of true
Chriſtianity to be ſtrictly confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
within the limits of the
Church, or to diſplay it ſelf mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the great duties of Religion
properly conſidered. For as our
Saviour deſigned not only to ſhew
men a way to another World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
but alſo to amend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of this preſent World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and to make it a more quiet
and comfortable habitation: ſo
doubtleſs when he calls his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
the ſalt of the whole Earth,
he intended to require, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good man ſhould (within his
whole ſphere) indeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
humanity, morality, and the
civil and political happineſs of
mankind. The diſcharge of which
is that which I call <hi>civil Piety,</hi>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:61579:180"/>
and the meaſures whereof (at
leaſt ſo far as concerns the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in hand) are briefly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in the following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>1. The firſt office of civil Piety
is to maintain Government and
Order, to keep up the honour
and dignity of the Prince, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the reverence of Magiſtracy
and the Laws of a mans Country.
For the doing of this, we have as
expreſs and urgent commands of
God as any are to be found in the
whole Scripture; and therefore
the conſcientious diſcharge here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is as acceptable to him as any
act of immediate worſhip. For
God Almighty needs nothing at
our hands for himſelf, or for his
own uſe and advantage, but makes
the publick good of his Creatures
the matter and reaſon of his Laws:
Now publick Peace and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
(which are only to be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:61579:181"/>
by Laws and Magiſtracy) are
of mighty concernment to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
as well as beautiful in the
Eyes of him that calleth himſelf
<hi>a God of order.</hi> For without Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
we could have no quiet
in our habitations, no ſecurity of
our perſons, no propriety in our
Eſtates, no defence againſt Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Invaſion, nor any refuge
from the inraged multitude or
combined force of evil men; but
the weak would be a prey to the
ſtrong, the ſlothful would eat the
labours of the induſtrious, the
World would be filled with Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Rapine and Violence, and
become an Hell upon Earth; and
therefore it is not only worthy
of a wiſe mans care to uphold Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but muſt be his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
duty to indeavour it.</p>
               <p>And the being inſtrumental
herein, is not only very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Religion, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:61579:181"/>
procures the benign aſpect of
Princes towards it, and provokes
them to become nurſing Fathers
of it, but is peculiarly commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to all the offices and exerciſes
thereof. Therefore it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the Apoſtles generally
in all their Writings, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after they have diſcourſed of
the peculiar Duties of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
ſubjoin earneſt exhortations
to obedience to humane Laws and
civil Powers; and the primitive
Chriſtians were ſo infinitely ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
herein, as if they thought
that God could not have his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and glory, and ſervice
rightly performed to him, unleſs
Peace and Order were preſerved in
the World.</p>
               <p>Now foraſmuch as the greateſt
Kingdoms conſiſt of ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
leſſer Bodies, as the integral
parts thereof; and thoſe again of
ſo many Pariſhes: And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:61579:182"/>
as it is impoſſible there
ſhould be peace and good order
in the Whole, if the particular
parts or members be out of order:
Therefore it muſt not only be the
duty, but be within the power
of every private perſon to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
ſomething towards the great
ends aforeſaid; firſt by diſpoſing
himſelf, ſecondly by principling
his Family, and thirdly, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
and inclining his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to favour and aſſiſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
towards the attainment
of the deſign of humane Society.
And this the good Chriſtian
ought at this time eſpecially to ſet
himſelf about with the greater
zeal, becauſe the looſeneſs herein
ſeems to be one of the peculiar
evils of the preſent age we live
in, and that which not only
makes an ill reflection upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but indangers the ſtate
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:61579:182"/>
In order therefore to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
of Government, let the
good man indeavour in converſe
with his Neighbours to poſſeſs
them with an apprehenſion of the
neceſſity of ſubmitting private
intereſts to common utility, and
particular opinion to publick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
and ſo bring them into
a good opinion of the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Laws, and of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of their Governours. Let
him labour to remove peoples
diſcontents, to confute their jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies,
and to make them chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and well-pleaſed with the
ſtate of the World, which God
hath ordered. Let him diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
all ſeditious Libels and
News, not permit in his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
any pragmatical cenſuring of
the Laws or publick Counſels;
no traducing the perſons or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the infirmities of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
nor no repining at, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:61579:183"/>
the glory and ſplendour of
thoſe that are preferred above
themſelves.</p>
               <p>That he may be ſucceſsful in
all this, let him be careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
and keep up the diſtinct
ranks, orders and degrees of men,
and that thoſe differences which
it hath pleaſed the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to make in the fortunes and
conditions of men be obſerved, I
mean in reſpect of age and youth,
riches and poverty, honour and
obſcruity; the neglect of which
is not only a malapert Quakerly
humour, but a principle of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and confuſion in the World.
For as it is evident, that there
can be no peace and quiet in the
World, if there be no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
ſo it is as certain, there can
be no Government where there is
no Order, nor the different degrees
amongſt men obſerved: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he that would either level the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:61579:183"/>
condition of all men, or (which
is the ſame things in effect) would
deſtroy that reverence which
keeps up that diſtinction and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of condition, diſſolves the
very ſinews of humane Society.</p>
               <p>God Almighty indeed could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
have levelled the condition of
all men, and taken away or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the differences of Rich and
Poor, honourable and ignoble;
and of old and young too, if he
had ſo pleaſed. But then, it is
not imaginable how there could
have been any Society amongſt
men, at leaſt, unleſs he had alſo
by his omnipotency made them
all to be wiſe and good too: but
foraſmuch as he reſolved to have
order and government amongſt
men, and yet would not effect it
by violence; he therefore reſolved
by means of thoſe different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
aforeſaid, to ſubordinate
them one to another, and to unite
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:61579:184"/>
them together in the Bonds of
mutual uſefulneſs and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>So he ordered that ſome ſhould
be poor to eaſe the rich of labour
and drudgery, and others rich to
imploy and incourage their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry;
that the one might have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity
to relieve the others
want, and the other be obliged
by their bounty: the ſame Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ordered that there ſhould
be ſome men in power and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and others in privacy and
obſcurity; that the man of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
ſtanding by and countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the ignoble as his Client, he
on the other ſide ſhould obſerve
and acknowledge him as his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
and ſo harmony ariſes out
of this diſcord.</p>
               <p>Again, he ordered the World
ſo, that all ſhould not be of a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and capacity of body or
mind, but that there ſhould be
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:61579:184"/>
old men able to counſel and adviſe
others, but not of ſtrength to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute;
and young men of ſpirit and
vigour for Execution, but deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of counſel and wiſdom: that
the former by their experience
and obſervation inſtructing the
latter, and the latter by their
ſtrength and courage aſſiſting the
former; they might be mutually
indeared to each other as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the ſame Body.</p>
               <p>He therefore who incourages
or ſuffers (if he can help it) the
Poor to be ſurly and inſolent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Rich, or the private
perſon to be contumacious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thoſe in dignity, or the
young to be rude and malapert
towards the aged, oppoſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to Divine Providence, and is
the Author of diſſolution of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and confuſion in the
World. But he that perſwades
the poor to be modeſt, as well as
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:61579:185"/>
the rich to be charitable; that
puts private perſons in mind of
ſubjection, as well as great men
of generoſity and mildneſs; that
diſpoſes young men to reverence
the gray hairs of the aged, as well
as them to do worthily of their
reſpect and gravity, ſubſerves the
Divine Providence in his wiſe
method of preſerving peace and
order, and lays the firſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of good Government. For
the foundation of all Laws and
Magiſtracy is to be laid in the
hearts and principles of men; and
unleſs a modeſt reverence of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
be firſt ſetled there, the
exerciſe of mere power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
will be very difficult and
inſucceſsful. So that it is in the
power of private perſons to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
publick Government, and
the office of virtuous men to
do ſo.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond office of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:61579:185"/>
in his Pariſh is to promote
juſtice and honeſty amongſt the
Neighbourhood in all their deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and tranſactions one with
another. It is commonly and
truly ſaid, that juſtice is the Pillar
of the World, and therefore it is
obſervable, that the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and Governour of the World
uſually interpoſes by a viſible
Providence, more in behalf of
this Virtue than of any other;
inſomuch, that oppreſſion, and
thoſe ſecret inſtances of injuſtice,
which cannot ordinarily be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned
and puniſhed by the hand
of the Magiſtrate, ſeldom eſcape
a curſe and Divine Vengeance in
this Life. For beſides the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
that ſuch ſins do to humane
ſociety, they are Arguments of
great Infidelity and Atheiſm;
foraſmuch as it plainly betrays
that man to have no perſwaſion
of a World to come, who can be
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:61579:186"/>
tempted for the ſake of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
World to do ſuch baſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unworthy
actions; and therefore
it is as well an act of Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and of Charity to
men, as of advantage to the ſtate
of civil Society, to uſe all indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to prevent ſuch kind of
tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p>But it is not only ſtrict juſtice
which I here intend, but my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is to take it in the full lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
ſo as to compriſe truth, and
faithfulneſs, and equity alſo; that
men be true in their aſſertions,
faithful and ſteady in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and equitable and candid
in all their dealings, and ſo far
from doing violence to each other,
that they do not enterprize to
out-wit, ſurprize, or over reach
one another, but that they uſe a
humane temper, and expreſs a
publick ſpirit; and in a word,
that they govern themſelves by
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:61579:186"/>
that golden Rule <hi>of doing to others
as they would be content to be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
every man making the caſe of
his Neighbour to be his own.</p>
               <p>And this I the rather repreſent
to the good Chriſtians care, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this kind of injuſtice is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
another very common and
epidemical ſin of the age, and
men ſeem to applaud themſelves
in being able to cheat beyond the
cognizance of humane Laws,
and to play upon and abuſe the
ſimplicity, credulity, or inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
one of another.</p>
               <p>For prevention and remedy of
which, the Perſon we ſpeak of,
muſt in the firſt place render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a great example of integrity
and equity, eſpecially becauſe the
meaſures of theſe Virtues cannot
be ſo well delivered by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of any Laws whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as they may be expreſt in the
Life, and obſerved in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:61579:187"/>
of good men. And in the
next place he ought to endeavour
by diſcourſe to make thoſe he
converſes with, ſenſible of the
baſeneſs and villany of injuſtice,
by repreſenting the ſordid love
of the World from which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
the diſtruſt in Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with which it is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
or rather the utter unbelief
of a God by which it is incouraged.
How treacherous and cowardly
a thing it is to work upon other
mens neceſſity or facility: how
ſelfiſh and un-neighbourly a thing
to have no reſpect to any thing
but our own private intereſt:
how little is commonly gotten at
laſt by ſuch kind of courſes: and
to how little purpoſe, ſince a
man cannot but expect the curſe
of God upon his honeſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
(otherwiſe) for the ſake
of his unjuſt acquiſitions.</p>
               <p>3. The third office of good
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:61579:187"/>
neighbourhood is to indeavour to
bring into faſhion again that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
antiquated Virtue of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
and plain-heartedneſs in
our diſcourſes and communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
that men, eſpecially Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
ſhould ordinarily be free
and open and plain to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without cunning and ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
reſervation, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more ſuitable to the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Neighbours, nothing more
friendly and obliging; for it
makes converſation ſafe and eaſy
when men expreſs a moderate
confidence one in another: and
although this like ſome of the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
ſtars, make no great ſhew in
the World; yet is it of very great
influence to ſweeten the tempers
of men, and improve the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of Society. Beſides, it is an
argument of ſincerity of heart,
of competent aſſurance of a mans
own judgment, and a real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:61579:188"/>
of true greatneſs of mind;
whereas little artifices of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are juſtly looked upon as
the diſguiſes of weakneſs, or the
prefaces to fraud, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
render a man either dangerous
or contemptible to thoſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes
with.</p>
               <p>Some men indeed pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
much in cloſeneſs and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and count it not only a point
of prudence, but a piece of ſtate
and greatneſs to live in the dark
to all about them; but it is eaſy
to obſerve, that if any men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
ſuch perſons for their depth,
they withal ſuſpect them for their
deſigns, and to be ſure do not
love them.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge there is ſuch a
thing as a prudent and virtuous
ſecrecy and taciturnity, which is
very commendable and neceſſary
in ſome caſes; for no man values
him that labours under a looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:61579:188"/>
of tongue, and an inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
of mind, ſo that he cannot
keep his own counſel: and who
ſhall truſt him with their ſecrets
who is a blab of his own? And
it is well enough ſaid, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs
of mind is as undecent as
that of the Body. But then on
the other ſide, muſt a man be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
naked unleſs he cloath
himſelf in Armour? To be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
upon the Ward, and to
ſtand continually upon our guard,
as if we were in an Enemies
Country, is at leaſt un-neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly
and diſobliging. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that ſuch an artificial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
is very troubleſome to
both Parties, in regard on the
one hand it is very difficult to
the reſerved man always to ſtand
bent, ſo as never to betray him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and then he ſpoils all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign:
And on the other hand, it
puts other men upon their guard
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:61579:189"/>
too; for men are naturally ſhy of
thoſe whom they obſerve to be
conſtantly and rigidly cloſe, and
ſo converſation is interrupted;
whereas nothing unlocks other
mens hearts, like the opening of
our own to them.</p>
               <p>Again too great reſervedneſs as
it is always entertained with jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy
and ſuſpicion for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
ſo it commonly breeds diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
and conteſts in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
whereas plain-heartedneſs
hath no rubs nor difficulties in
its way, nor no after-game to
play: for every man believes and
truſts ſuch a man as plays upon
the ſquare, and ſuch a converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is pleaſant and acceptable.</p>
               <p>Moreover cunning is always
lookt upon as an argument of a
little mind and of a cowardly
temper; for what ſhould tempt a
man to diſſemble and work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ground,
but miſtruſt of his
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:61579:189"/>
own abilities or conſciouſneſs of
evil deſigns; and this is ſo far
from affording a man any ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that it provokes other men,
firſt to pry the more curiouſly
into him, and then to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
him, and at laſt to expoſe
him.</p>
               <p>To all which add, that if this
reſervedneſs we ſpeak of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from inſincerity and deſign,
it betrays great unbelief of God
and of Providence; for the clear
apprehenſions of thoſe great
points will incourage a man to be
open, and plain and confident:
but if it proceed from temper and
conſtitution only, yet even then
it doth far more harm than good,
and particularly (as I ſaid before)
it makes life and converſation ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uncomfortable, and good
Neighbourhood plainly impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and therefore it is well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the care and indeavours
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:61579:190"/>
of a good man to reduce and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the antient ſincerity and
ſimplicity, inſtead of that hollow
complemental hypocriſy which
hath of late ſupplanted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
it.</p>
               <p>4. But yet care is to be taken
withal, that this plainneſs and
ſimplicity degenerate not into
rudeneſs, or frothy and fooliſh
converſation, and therefore it is
the fourth office of a virtuous
man amongſt his Neighbours, to
indeavour to render converſation
favoury, and manly and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as well as ſincere; that is, that
it be neither trifled away with
flat, inſpid and goſſiping imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence,
nor miſimployed in light
and idle drollery, nor turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an occaſion of tipling and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality,
much leſs debauched by
profaneneſs and malapert reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on things ſacred, but that it
be applied to the furtherance of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:61579:190"/>
real buſineſs, to the bettering of
mens underſtandings, to virtuous
purpoſes, and eſpecially to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Religion. Theſe laſt
things are uſeful to the World,
and worthy of men; but the other
are a miſ-expence of time, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading
of our ſelves, a reproach
to our reaſon, and the bane of
converſation.</p>
               <p>With a peculiar reſpect to ſuch
things as theſe it is that Chriſtians
are called <hi>the ſalt of the earth</hi> (as
I obſerved before) becauſe they
are not only to prevent the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs
and putrefaction, but alſo
the flatneſs and inſipidity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.
And as for that which
I intimated in the laſt place,
namely, the conſulting the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Religion, I muſt now
ſay further, that although it be
true that that is not the only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of good Diſcourſe, foraſmuch
as God allows us both the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:61579:191"/>
of our ſpirits, and a
moderate concern about the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of this life; and therefore
conſequently the affair of another
World ought not to be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely
thruſt in upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the excluſion of other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments:
yet moſt certainly
it ought to have its place and
ſhare in our friendly communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as being the moſt weighty
and important ſubject, and if it
be dexterouſly managed, the moſt
gentile and obliging. Neither
will it be ſo very difficult as is
commonly imagined, to turn the
ſtream of Neighbourly Diſcourſe
this way, if men would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to try, and apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſeriouſly to it: and ſurely
he that hopes to attain the joys
of Heaven himſelf, cannot but
wiſh his Neighbours in the way
thither alſo; nor can he whoſe
heart is throughly affected with
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:61579:191"/>
the apprehenſions of it, omit now
and then to let fall ſomething or
other that way tending; at leaſt
every good man owes ſo much to
God and Religion, as to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a good word ſometimes in
their behalf, which beſides that
it gives ſome countenance to Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for the preſent, may by the
bleſſing of God make a greater
impreſſion than we are aware of,
and redound to his own comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
account another day. But</p>
               <p>5. It is unqueſtionably the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of every Chriſtian to labour to
the utmoſt of his power to make
and preſerve peace amongſt his
Neighbours. To this purpoſe it
is very obſervable, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>Mark</hi> 9. 50. joins theſe two
things together, <hi>have ſalt in your
ſelves, and have peace one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
as if he had ſaid, <q>Though
you are the ſalt of the Earth, yet
you muſt take care you be not
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:61579:192"/>
too ſharp and acrimonious. You
muſt indeed preſerve the World
from corruption, but yet you
muſt not exaſperate it into paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and diſorder; for you muſt
compoſe men to peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs,
and quench their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtions
as well as inflame their
Zeal and Devotion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed the latter of theſe
can never ſucceſsfully be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
unleſs at the ſame time,
the former be provided for; for
Religion never takes place in
mens hearts, nor brings forth
fruits in their lives, when the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of men are imbroiled with
heats and animoſities. Men are
not fit to conſider of the counſels
of the Goſpel, nor to eſtimate
the reaſon and importance of
them, when their minds are in a
flame, and their thoughts in an
hurry. Nor if they were already
perſwaded of them, could they
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:61579:192"/>
be in a temper to comply with
them, or to make any fit expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of love and ſervice towards
God, whilſt they are at variance
with their Brethren, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>the fruits
of righteouſneſs are ſowen in peace,</hi>
James 3. 18.</p>
               <p>And as peace is very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
to Gods ſervice, ſo the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and procuring it is very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and comfortable to them
that are imployed about it. They
are under one of our Saviours Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atitudes,
and he intitles them <hi>the
Children of God</hi> in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>Mat. 5. 9. viz.</hi> as being thoſe
who eſpecially imitate and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him. And one inſtance of the
bleſſedneſs of ſuch men is this,
that they which make peace,
commonly reap the fruits of it,
both in the benign and kindly
chearfulneſs of their own ſpirits,
and in the fair and courteous u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:61579:193"/>
they generally meet with
from other men, as well as in the
repoſe and quiet they enjoy when
all the World is peaceable and
ſtill round about them; whereas
Makebates and Incendiaries tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
themſelves firſt before they
torture other men, and beſides,
bring the fire home to their own
Houſes when they have inflamed
other mens.</p>
               <p>The Good Chriſtian therefore
is not only peaceable himſelf, but
a Peacemaker in his Pariſh, to
which end he will in the firſt
place diſcountenance all Whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Eves-Droppers and Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bearers
as the peſt of Society; for
theſe are the Bellows that blow
up a ſpark into a flame.</p>
               <p>He will indeavour to prevent
and take up Law-Suits, which
commonly begin in paſſion and
end in malice: for the deciſion of
them rather immortalizes the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:61579:193"/>
quarrel than finiſhes the diſpute;
and he that overcomes, very often
like the Bee, deſtroys himſelf
whilſt he faſtens his ſting upon
another.</p>
               <p>He ſets a mark upon them that
ſingle themſelves from the reſt of
their Neighbours, and divide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
parties as men of a great deal
of Pride, but of little Wit; for a
great and generous mind would
be eaſily able to animate ſuch a
Society as a Pariſh, and render
himſelf conſiderable in the whole
without tearing it in pieces that
he may lead a Faction.</p>
               <p>He deteſts and abhors all affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
ſingularity, though the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of it be in it ſelf unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
(ſo long as it is not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neceſſary) becauſe he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
ſuch things firſt raiſe Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,
then provoke Emulation; and
at laſt end in alienation of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:61579:194"/>
He indeavours that no new
Opinions in Religion may be
broached amongſt the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
as knowing well there
can be no new Goſpel, or new way
to Heaven, and he hath learnt by
experience, that whilſt men ſtand
gazing after new lights they
make halt in the race of virtue,
and loſe the way of peace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which they ſhall never come
at Heaven.</p>
               <p>He indeavours therefore to keep
up the antient Landmarks, both
in ſpiritual and temporal affairs;
but if any diſputes be raiſed, he
will preſently bring Water to
quench the Fire in the beginning,
and by diſcreet and temperate
Diſcourſes incline both Parties to
coolneſs and moderation, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
the littleneſs of the
matter in Controverſy between
them, the great benefit of Unity
and Concord amongſt Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:61579:194"/>
and eſpecially by putting
them in mind of the approaches
of Death, which will very ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take away the ſubject of the
Queſtion, and the Diſputants too.</p>
               <p>6. Sixthly, Next to this and
to the intent that his indeavours
of making Peace may be the more
ſucceſsful, he will contrive to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his perſon acceptable and fit
to be interpoſed in quarrels, by
making himſelf remarkable for
all other offices of Charity and
Beneficence, ſuch as relieving of
the Poor to the very utmoſt of
his ability, and by ſympathizing
with thoſe he cannot help, by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting
the ſick, counſelling the
weak and injudicious, comforting
the diſconſolate, vindicating the
injured, reſcuing the oppreſſed,
and taking the part of the Widow
and Fatherleſs; by all which and
ſeveral other good offices he will
become a common Father and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:61579:195"/>
Friend to the whole Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>Moſt of theſe things may be
performed without much coſt or
trouble, or if they be chargeable
either way, the expence will be
abundantly recompenſed by the
delight that attends the diſcharge
of them: for they are commonly
as comfortable in the doing to
thoſe that undertake them, as
they are beneficial to thoſe for
whoſe ſake they are undertaken.
Thus at a cheap rate a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a Benefactor and a bleſſing
to the times and places where he
lives, and beſides, doth a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſervice to God, vindicating his
Providence in the inequal diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of his temporal bleſſings,
and he renders Religion lovely in
the Eyes of all the World, and he
very effectually conſults the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of his own Soul, giving proof
to himſelf, that he <hi>loves God whom
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:61579:195"/>
he hath not ſeen, becauſe he loves
his Brother whom he hath ſeen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Seventhly and laſtly, (and
to ſpeak ſummarily) it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and the practice of a good
Chriſtian by all the means he can
deviſe, to promote the welfare
and proſperity of his Pariſh and
Neighbourhood, not only becauſe
it is far more comfortable living
amongſt thoſe who are in a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
condition (as to their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
affairs) in regard that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
proſperity ſweetens mens
ſpirits and betters their temper,
as much as pinching want and
neceſſity, ſoures and diſorders
them: but alſo becauſe generally
God is better loved and ſerved by
men whoſe hearts are chearful and
eaſy, than by the querulous and
unhappy.</p>
               <p>In order therefore to the wealth
and proſperity of the place where
he dwells, the good Chriſtian
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:61579:196"/>
will in the firſt place take care to
prevent the idleneſs of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
by bringing in ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture
or other (if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
that ſo all hands may be ſet
on work in ſome honeſt way of
living; for Idleneſs, beſides that
it makes a very ugly figure,
clothing the ſlothful perſons with
Rags, it commonly inclines peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be great Eaters, having
nothing elſe to do but to mind
their Bellies, and ſo they become
a ſort of Caterpillars which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
other mens labours; it alſo
tempts them by their neceſſity to
pilfer, cheat, lie and ſteal, and do
any baſe action imaginable; and
moreover ſuch people are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
envious, malicious, buſy
bodies, medlers in other mens
matters, and in a word, being
deſperate in their fortunes, they
are paſt fear and ſhame. Whereas
on the other ſide, honeſt induſtry,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:61579:196"/>
beſides that it is attended with
the bleſſing of God, renders peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
modeſt, quiet, governable,
chearful, good natured, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
ſpirited.</p>
               <p>In the next place, and in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
of the ſame ends, the pious
Pariſhioner will, as far as he is
able, prevent tipling and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs
amongſt his Neighbours,
which is well known to be the
common cauſe of want amongſt
the inferiour ſort of People; for
this beaſtly way they will ſwill
down preſently that which might
go a great way in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of their Families, beſides,
that the cuſtom of it loſes their
time, ſoftens and relaxes their
Nerves, and makes them impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of labour; it raiſes their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and abates their diſcretion,
and ſo diſpoſes them to be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſome
with their Families when
they come home; and which is
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:61579:197"/>
worſt of all, renders them proud,
inſolent and ungovernable.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the good man
will indeavour (if it be wanting,
and the place be capable of it) to
get a good School ſetled in the
Pariſh, which beſides the great
advantage of it, for the education
of youth, doth generally inrich
the place, and is more beneficial
than a manufacture; for this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
ſome imployment for thoſe
poor that are there already, and
makes no more, nor draws other
ſuch to the place as manufacture
uſually doth.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, to all this, a good
Neighbour will indeavour to
bring all vicious and incorrigible
people to ſhame and puniſhment,
than which nothing conduces
more to the honour of Religion,
to the peace of the Inhabitants,
or the felicity of the place.</p>

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:61579:197"/>
ſome fond and incogitant people
who think this courſe quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to good Neighbourhood,
and look upon thoſe as the beſt
Townſmen that will connive at
mens Vices, and let every Body
do what they liſt: but with their
leave, as it is the greateſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
toward ſuch vicious perſons,
to make uſe of the proviſion
which the wiſdom of Laws hath
made for their amendment, ſo he
is the beſt Chriſtian that diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
between good and bad
men, as well as the beſt Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who will not permit virtue
and induſtry to be diſcouraged by
the impudence and impunity of
ſome lewd perſons; but ſo much
for that.</p>
               <p>Theſe things which I have
now treated of in this Chapter,
are a certain kind of leſſer Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
and the peculiar inſtances of
that which I called Civil Piety;
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:61579:198"/>
But if the good Chriſtian will (as
he ought) take care of them, he
will do at leaſt a collateral ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to Almighty God, by being
a Benefactor to the World; he
will render the attendance upon
Religion more eaſy, and make
his own paſſage through the
World towards Heaven the more
quiet and comfortable, which is
the thing aimed at all along in
theſe Papers.</p>
