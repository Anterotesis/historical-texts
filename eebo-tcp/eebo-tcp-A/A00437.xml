            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

When he heard this, he went forth with great opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him ſelfe, that he had the praiſe of ſo diuine a perſon. <hi>Philometer</hi> with his companions gladſome, met him at the gate. <hi>Maximus</hi> a far off ſpake to him.

               <p>Men thought them ſelues the better, when they erred in going to the Sepulchres. They were called Martyrs, Deacons, and Legates of the prayers that were made to God, being vyle ſlaues, and branded for their faultes, carying the ſcarres of their whyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, as markes of their lewdneſſe.

bandes, and their Maiſter with them. Hauing long heayre and bodies, euyl handled, as the ſtripes might appeare to the Iudge. Whenleaue was geuen to the accuſers to ſpeake, <hi>Apſines</hi> beganne. Then ſpake the Preſident. The <hi>Romaines</hi> alloweth not this. For he that ſpeaketh the fyrſt accuſation, is in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the ſecond.

For they were come to make a noyſe and crye, onely when their Maiſter ſhould ſpeake. There was great ſcilence &amp; trouble.

               <p>Than the Proconſull ſayd: None of you Teachers prepared, ſhall take the matter in hand, nor any of you Diſciples, ſhall make noyſe to the ſpeaker: and then ſhall you know, how pure and ſyncere the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi> iudgement is.

                  <hi>Iulianus,</hi> as the Preſident commaunded, to anſwer the fyrſt accuſation, ſayd thus. Thou, O Preſydent, by thine exquiſite Iuſtice, haſt cauſed <hi>Apſines,</hi> as a <hi>Pythagoream,</hi> to hold his peace, though it were late, which he ought to haue learned chiefly before.

The maiſter crying to him with lowde and high voyce, as they that encourage them that go to fyght. So ſpeaking ſhryll vnto him, ſayde. Now is it tyme to ſpeake. Than he made a Proeme, which <hi>Tuſcianus</hi> dyd not tell, but onely the ſence. That it tended to moue pitie, of that they had ſuffred: and that it was mixed with a praiſe of their teacher. And that there was added in the Proeme, a reproofe of one purpoſe, declaring the ſwift maner of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſulles power. That it was not lawfull that they that had bene iudged, ſhould be ſo vſed againe.</p>
               <p>The Preſident helde downe his head, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed in his minde, at the words &amp; pithe of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the myid countenance and good ieſture.

                  <hi>Chio,</hi> that had kylled many, in praetiſing with the ſicke and the whole. He, (as appeared afterwarde) being earneſt with them that lamented, ſayde. Let me come to geue the dead man a medicine. They were content that <hi>Aeſchines</hi> ſhould make an ende of him, that was already well nyedead. He opened his mouth with certaine inſtruments: and than he ſpake, which, by the wyll of God, was many yeares after verified. When he had receyued the medicine, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was thorowly loſed, and he ſaw the ayre, &amp; knew his friends.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Aeſchines</hi> cleared his former faultes, by this one fact, &amp; was honoured of the Patient, and of them that were his friends. When he had done this, being honoured of all men: he went to <hi>Chio,</hi> and taryed ſo long there, tyll by the vertue of the medicine, he had gotten health, after the which tyme, the Patient kept company with the Phiſitian.</p>
               <p>Diuine <hi>Proaereſius</hi> had not yet ſeene this wryter, but lamented his caſe: and when he heard, he had gotten health beyonde all hope, he called the chiefe of his Diſciples, and prayſed to them the efficacie of that arte. I am glad (ſayth he) of this young mans recouery, whome I haue not yet ſeene, being greatly

grieued with his infirmity. If you wyll doo me a pleaſure, take him to the publique Bathe, and leauing your wanton toyes, vſe him as mine owne chylde. Thus this matter went, of which ſhalbe ſayde more in our Hiſtory. Notwithſtanding, the wryter thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that all the benefyte he got by <hi>Proaereſius,</hi> came by the wyll of God. Yet in the declaration of his lyfe, he wyll not ſwarue one whytte from the trueth. A diuine ſaying was it of <hi>Plato.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Trueth is the guyde of all good,</l>

               <p>The goodlineſſe of <hi>Proaereſius</hi> body (for now I come <note place="margin">

And it might be maruayled, that the perfectnes of beuty, did ſuffice ſuch a body, that had a iuſt proportion with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greateſt. For his ſtature was bygger then a man would beleeue, yea, coniecture, for he was hygher then all other, by a foote, as he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Gyant amongſt the talleſt men. When he was yong, Fortune droue him from <hi>Armenia</hi> to <hi>Antiochia,</hi> for he went not ſtrayght to <hi>Athens,</hi> for he wanted money, and that way, he was infortunate, though he come of honeſt parentage.</p>

               <p>His enimies, againe aſſembling, roſe againſt him, lyke ſtynging Serpents: but being preuented of his friendes, he was reſtored to <hi>Athens,</hi> as <hi>Tuſcianus,</hi> who was preſent at euery thing, tolde me, who had <note place="margin">Tuſcianus of Lydia.</note> bene <hi>Proaereſius,</hi> if <hi>Proaereſius</hi> had not bene. When he was come, as <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi> after a long abſence, he founde ſome of his friends in good caſe: among whome, was <hi>Tuſcianus,</hi> they could not leaue beholding of him, nor he embracing of them.

               <p>Then were <hi>Proaereſius</hi> Schollers ſodenly called in: who came, not knowing what was meant.

               <p>Commaunde them, O Preſident, to come foorth, paraduenture they wyll tell, they haue done naught. When they heard this, they hydde them ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, coueiting to be cloſe.</p>
               <p>The Preſident, ſending ſome of his Sergeaunts, brought them foorth, and with an exhortation, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted them to ſpeake, in that forme, that is called, Concluſiue. When they had looked a lytle and ſpoken together: They propounded a baſe matter, rude and

               <p>He looked grimly vpon them, and ſayde to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſull. I beſeech thee let me haue the right that was graunted me before the action. He ſayde, he ſhould not be denied right. I requyre (quoth he) ſwyft No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries.</p>

               <p>Than I (ſayd he) would aſke a greater thing: which he was bidden to doo. Let no man, ſayd he, clappe his handes, at the ende of Sentences.

               <p>The Notaries coulde ſcarcely follow him, and the Auditours, hardly holde their peace. Such was the plenty of the wordes, turning his face to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries.</p>

               <p>His aduerſaries freating for anger, yet ſome of them coulde doo no leſſe then prayſe him.

But as they had all bene ſtroken with a lightning, they acknowledged him for the better.</p>
               <p>In proceſſes of tyme reuiuing againe, as the heads of <hi>Hidra,</hi> they returned to their nature, alluring ſome of the beſt ſort with great feaſtes, &amp; fayre Damiſels.

He ſayled to <hi>Rome,</hi> and for his pythy wiſdom and eloquence, was called to Courts, and in ſhort tyme came to great power.</p>
               <p>He had all Princely offices geuen him, with ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation, as his very enimies wondred at him, and in tyme was made great Maiſter of the Court.

               <p>Being mooued with a feruent deſyre to ſee <hi>Grecia,</hi> and the Images of the Oratours, with his owne eyes: he made great haſte into <hi>Grecia,</hi> and came thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with much authority.

But when there was no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they determyned the ſtate of the matter, as they call it: vpon the which, was ſuch a contention, as the wryter hereof, neuer heard a more foolyſh thing. They were deuided by difference in opinion, euery man being bent to pleaſe his audience, and prayſe his eloquence.

               <p>When <hi>Anatolius</hi> had done his Ceremonies in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> he commaunded the Oratours to begyn their diſputation.

So ambitious a creature is man. <hi>Anatolius</hi> laughed at them, that ſought to pleaſe their Schollars, and pitied their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that had put them to ſuch Teachers.</p>
               <p>Then he called <hi>Proaereſius</hi> which was onely left. He got familiaritie of <hi>Anatolius</hi> men, and learned the meaning of all the purpoſe. The which thing (as the wryter ſayde before) was to be laughted at) being of no moment, nor any rewarde of victory propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet <hi>Proaereſius</hi> obeyed, as ſoone as he was called. And ſpake ſo aptly and eloquently to the thing, that <hi>Anatolius</hi> leapt out of his ſeate, and the audience was caried to cries, and there was none but thought him a God in ſpeache. So as <hi>Anatolius</hi> eſteemed him very much, and as for the reſt, ſcarcely thought them worthy his table. For he was pleaſaunt, and fine in talke at Feaſts, and there was no meale with out ſome purpoſe and learning. Theſe happened long before, and the wryter had the better tyme to heare of them.</p>

He illuded all the inuentions of ſuch Oratours, ſaying: if there were aboue thyrteene, the problemes ſhoulde be infinite.</p>
               <p>Not long before, he was called of the Emperour into <hi>France,</hi> who had him in ſuch admyration, as <note place="margin">Conſtance.</note> he admitted him to his table among his Nobillitie.

Diligence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall in inſtruments, bringeth an arte, not a ſcience.
<pb facs="tcp:1914:43"/>
So <hi>Libanius</hi> by zeale, and imitation, forcing him ſelfe to follow the olde Oratours that were accoumpted beſt, made good ſteppes, and paſſed thorough the moſt of the way. Truſting in his eloquence, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading him ſelfe to be equall with them that were in eſtimation: he would not be hydden in a lytle Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but went to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> a Cittie moſt famous and wealthy, hauing neede of their wordes &amp; works, that could ſet the ſame forth. He quickly became no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table there. And after a tyme returned to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Where he continued all his lyfe, which was long. Wherfore the memory, worthy his lyfe, is ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in our Chronicle, of <hi>Iulianus</hi> actes. Now his priuate doings are rehearſed.</p>
               <p>None of his friendes or familiars, went away without a taunt. What euery mans maner was, he well marked, and vnderſtoode his minde, whether he enclined to vertue or vice. Such a one he was, in deſcribing and vttering the condition of men, all the which he dyd with a nyppe. His familiars ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be in him, an other him ſelfe. Therfore his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintaunce ſayd, he was a table and Image, of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry facions.</p>
               <p>Neyther coulde he be perceyued of his Scholers, (were they neuer ſo many) to what part he enclined. But to contrary nature, of contrary maners, he was lyked, euen of them that were contrary to his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. So euery man dyd thinke to beholde their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, alone in him, not without admiration, ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers formes of ſundry qualities were found in him at ones. He alſo deſpiſed mariage, yet he had a woman as his wyfe, but not of lyke worthyneſſe. His Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were colde and barraine, without lyfe, ſo as in

this poynt, it ſeemed he was without a teacher. For the common rules woont to be knowen to chyldren, he knew not. But in Epiſtles and ſuch other lyke fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar talke, he roſe ſufficiently to the auncient forme.

One <hi>Inocentius</hi> was his Grandfather, a man of great rytches and eſtimation, being appointed by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours to make Lawes.

Which teſtifieth his deepe and ſtayed iudgement, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne knowledge of theſe thinges, for ſuch as be deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chryſanthius</hi> being left young of his Father, and geuen to Philoſophy, by his diuine nature, went to <hi>Pergamo,</hi> to the great <hi>Aedeſius.</hi> And growing in yeares, had ſuch a deſyre and thyrſt of Philoſophy, as chancing on ſuch a Teacher, as dyd geue him inough to aſlake his thyrſt, he loſt no leſſon, nor gaue place to any in dilligence. For he was of a ſounde and ſtrong body, acquaynted with labour.</p>
               <p>He got full knowledge in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and gaue all his minde to Philoſophy.

And when he ſpake, to get the maiſtry, he would vſe high prayſe and pompe.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1914:47"/>
as he gotte the full of all that ſcience to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt, and was perfyte in all foreſyght.</p>
               <p>Men ſayde, he dyd better ſee, than ſpeake of things to come, as one that euer had bene preſent with the Goddes. After he had beſtowed a good tyme this waye, and coferred with <hi>Maximus</hi> very much, he <note place="margin">Conditions of <hi>Maximus.</hi>
                  </note> left his ſociety. For being contentious and obſtinate of nature, ſtriuing againſt the tokens that God ſent, he ſearched and wreſtled for others.

But <hi>Maximus</hi> continued faſt in the Ceremonies, and deuoutly vſing the Sacrifyces, with cryes: he would aſke of God other tokens, to differ the deſtiny.</p>
               <p>And where he had ſtyll contrary tokens, and therby cauſed <hi>Chryſanthius</hi> to trye it againe: yet at length the wyll of the Goddes was manifeſted by ſygnes, and their determination many times ſhewed by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, although the thing that appeared, was not by him, approued. So as <hi>Maximus</hi> tooke that iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which was cauſe of all calamitie: Euen ſo <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanthius</hi> taryed at home.</p>
               <p>At the fyrſt, the Emperour conſydered the cauſe, and coniectured, why <hi>Chryſanthius</hi> would not come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:1914:48"/>
he ſawe difficulty in the matter. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Iulianus</hi> wrote againe for him: and not onely exhorted him, but alſo moued his wyle to perſwade him to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chryſanthius</hi> againe, reſorted to diuine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And the Goddes ſhewed him continually, all one tokens. The which comming oft to paſſe, and the Emperour hauing great opinion of him, gaue him the chiefe Byſhoprike of that countrey. And he knowing certainly what woulde followe, was not grieuous in his dignitie, nor oppreſſed the younger, as all in this age, were woont to do, hotly and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently, neyther was he very extreme to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
               <p>So great lenitie was in his behauiour, that in all <hi>Lydia</hi> it was ſcarcely knowen, that there was any alteration of Religion. Wherof followed, when the chaunge came, that no new thing ſeemed to be done: Nothing ſodenly appeared to be altred, but al things ſtayed quietly, and vniformly, and without motion. And where all other were toſſed, as with the Sea, he onely was in quietneſſe, ſome of the ſodaine thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen downe, other ryſing againe, from their former myſeries.</p>
               <p>He was in admiration, for that he dyd not onely foreſee thinges to come, but alſo vſed well the things he knewe. This was his behauiour alwayes. So as it might be ſeene, that <hi>Socrates</hi> was reuiued againe: or that from his youth, he had immita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and followed him, and was tranſformed into him.</p>
               <p>A plaine and ſymple manner of grace appeared in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1914:48"/>
his ſpeeche: yet the ſweetneſſe of his wordes, dyd moue his audience. He was gentle to all in conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Inſomuch that they that went ſrom him, were thought ambitious. And as gentle and mylde verſies, do eaſily and readily enter and paſſe into eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans eares, and moue thinges voyde of reaſon, as they ſay of <hi>Orpheus.</hi> So <hi>Chryſanthius</hi> ſpeeche was harmonious to all men, as it agreed and was fytte for ſuch a diuerſitye of manners. Yet was hee ſtyffe and ſtable in his ſentence and opinion, for the which he ſawe moſt men at controuerly. Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhoulde any man heare him boaſt of his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or bee thereby the more inſolent to others: what they ſayde, he prayſed, though it were not well ſayde.</p>
               <p>Hee allowed an opinion, though it were not of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ug to ſaye any thing of the coutrouerſie, all was full or ſcilence, as though there had bene noman.</p>
               <p>So neyther int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Many that dyd but meanely knowe him, and coulde not conceyue the depthe of his minde, blamed his ſymple ſpeeche, and onelye prayſed his myldneſſe of mynde. But when they hearde him dyſpute, and wrapping himſelfe, with reaſons into pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1914:49"/>
So vnlyke dyd he ſeeme vnto him ſelfe, in matters of controuerſie. His heayres ſtoode ryght vp as in a feare, and his eyes teſtified, that his minde was rapt, about his doctrine. Lyuing to great yeares, he ſpent his dayes, without the cares of mans cauſes: but onely for prouiſion of familie, mayntenance of the Plowe, and gayne that was iuſt.</p>
               <p>He better dyd beare penury, than others plenty. His dyet was ſuch, as might be eaſily gotten. He neuer eate Porke, and ſyldome any other fleſh. Alwayes worſhipping God, he applyed the reading of olde Authors, diligently. He differed neyther in age, nor in youth. For being fowre ſcore yeares olde: he wrote ſo many Bookes with his owne hand, as few young men can reade ouer: wherby his fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers endes, for the continuall vſe, waxed crooked. When he roſe from ſtudy, he recreated his mynde by walking ſoftly abroade, taking this wryter with him.</p>
               <p>He would walke a good way, but fayre and eaſily. So as it might be thought, he had paine in his feete, ſo much was hee caryed, with declaration of the trueth. Bathes he ſeldome vſed, yet alwayes ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as he had bene waſhed. As touching the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of great men, hee refuſed not for arrogancie or pride, but as it may be iudged for ſimplicitie, as a man ignoraunt of power, yet he talked with them openly, and plainly.</p>
               <p>He taught the wryter hereof, being young, who came to him to <hi>Athens.</hi> And continued his loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde him, as his Childe, encreaſing it with dayly beneuolence. And ſo much encreaſed in learning this wryter, as in the morning, he taught others,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1914:49"/>
and read <hi>Rhetorique</hi> to them that woulde heare it. And after noone reſorted to his chiefe maſter to learn more diuine and Philoſophicall matter, which was not painefull, becauſe he beſtowed it vpon his deere beloued: and to him, ſo readily taking it, the worke was a paſtime.</p>
               <p>Than the Chriſtian ſtate preuayling, and ruling <note place="margin">

                  </note> ouer all: One <hi>Iuſtus</hi> came to gouerne <hi>Aſia,</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> which was a long iourney. He being olde and of gentle behauiour, not hauing leſt the auncient rites of his countrey, but followed that bleſſed and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py manner of life, euer in prayer, and depending vpon the aunſweres of God, being the more bolde, that he proſpered ſo well therby.</p>
               <p>He came dyrectly from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to <hi>Aſia,</hi> and appoynted <hi>Hilarius</hi> an officer, who was of his owne <note place="margin">Hilarius.</note> opinion: And on the ſodaine ſet vp Altares at <hi>Sardis,</hi> (where was none,) and repayred the Temples that were decayed, and making publique Sacrifyce: By his letters, ſent to euery place, called all ſuch as had opinion, and fame of learning, who came to him out of hande, maruayling at him, thynking nowe the tyme to be come, that euerie man might vtter his knowledge.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe put their truſt in flattering, lyke chyldren, hoping that way, to get honour, glorie, or gayne. There was a publique Feaſt proclaymed, at the which all we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>

a great maruayle, that he coulde diuine by Fygure, and affyrmed that he onely knew it.</p>
               <p>The grauer ſort, ſtryking their beardes with their fyngers endes, ſtaying their countenaunces, and ſhaking their heads, ſlowly and leyſurely, behelde the thing as it laye, and ſayde ſome one thing, and ſome another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iuſtus</hi> ſcarcely refrayning from laughter, turned to <hi>Chryſanthius,</hi> ſpeaking a lowde, what ſaye you olde man? <hi>Chryſanthius</hi> being nothing abaſhed, ſayde: he diſallowed all.

               <p>At this tyme, many that had names of learning, came to talke with <hi>Chryſanthius,</hi> moued by the fame of his excellent knowledge. But when they percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

He was ſo deſyrous of learning, that he went to places vnknowen, to ſeeke better learned than him ſelfe. And being furniſhed with goodlye trauayle, and great learning, he came to <hi>Sardis,</hi> the olde Cittie of <hi>Lydia,</hi> to ſpeake with <hi>Chryſanthius.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Chryſanthius</hi> had a ſonne, of the name of his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <hi>Aedeſius</hi> at <hi>Pergamo,</hi> of whome we haue ſpoken before, who from a chylde, enclyned to vertue, as <note place="margin">

Not hauing but one of the Horſes that <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaketh of, neyther a puffed minde, but quicke &amp; ſwyft to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, whollye bent to the honour of God, and ſo much aboue the affections of the body, as he ſeemed almoſt to be created of the mindeonely.</p>
               <p>His body in mouing, was ſo delyuer, as is to be ſcarcelye credyted, as one (according to the Poets) that was caryed in the ayre. He had ſuch familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie with diuine matter, and that ſo eaſily, and ſo readily, that it was ſuperfluous to ſet a Garlande on his head, but looking onely againſt the Sunne, hee vttred true Oracles, and conformable to that kinde that commeth from a pure diuination. Yet he knew no verſe, nor was ſufficiently learned in <hi>Grammer.</hi> So God wrought all thinges in him. Neuertheleſſe, at the determined ende of his lyfe, he dyed: at the twentie yeare of his age.</p>
               <p>Than his father declared himſelfe to be a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. For eyther the rauiſhment of his ſences made him voyde of affections, or the patience of his minde,
<pb facs="tcp:1914:51"/>
made him beare the loſſe of his ſonne. And the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hauing regarde to her huſbande, paſſed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a woman, refrayning from all lamentation, though the paſſion were moſt grieuous. After theſe matters, <hi>Chryſanthius</hi> returned to his ſtudies. And many great &amp; publique cauſes chauncing, that droue mennes mindes to feare, he onely remayned without trouble, that it might ſeeme, he was not of the earth.</p>
               <p>At this time <hi>Helleſpontius</hi> came to him, but ſeldome entred diſputation. But when they were at it, <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpontius</hi> was ſo rapte, as he leſt all to abyde with <hi>Chryſanthius,</hi> and learned lyke a young man, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented he had loſt ſo much tyme, and was ſo olde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had taſted of ſo healthfull doctrine. So whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dyd he geue his minde to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chryſanthius</hi> would be let blood, as he was woont: when this wryter was preſent, as he commaunded. When the Phiſitians agreed that he ſhoulde ſtryke a vaine, he attended to ſee it done accordingly. And affyrmed that it was raſhly and vnaduiſedly done, to take ſo much blood, and commaunded him to be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. For this wryter was not ignoraunt of Phiſicke. <hi>Helleſpontius</hi> hearing of it, came in great anger, and chyding, as in a great offence, that ſo much blood ſhoulde be taken from ſo olde a man. But when he ſawe him ſafe, and heard him ſpeake, he turned to this wryter, ſaying: The Cittie accuſed you of a great fault, but now they wyll be ſtyll, when they ſee the olde man ſafe, and voyde of daunger.</p>
               <p>This man comming after to <hi>Chryſanthius</hi> in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique cauſe, fell ſicke by the way of a flyxe, and at <hi>Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea</hi> in <hi>Bythinia,</hi> dyed.
