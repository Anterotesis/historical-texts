            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Moone, of Gold and Silver, which had wont to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse
their radiant luster with greater brightnesse,
and consolation then those that shine i'th Zodiacke,
have now withdrawne their splendor, and left us in
this Cimmerian night of small takings? A Terme
so like a vacation? you would take them to be the
<hi>Gemini,</hi> which constellation never appeares but out of darknesse, There
is no plague to fright away the Termers, unlesse it be that plague of
plagues, want of trading, which their money would easily cure.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Westminster Hall</hi> wherein pristine ages you might without offence
shoulder a Lord to get through the presse, now you may walke in the

of a Delinquent, play with your bandstrings, and twist your
beard with the same gravity, and not an elbow-rub to disturbe
you, The Benchers better halfe-empty, and those few Judges left
have time enough to get a nap, and no noise to awake them, The barrs
that had wont to swell with a fivefould row of listed gownes, where
the favorites in the front imbursd more Fees then would supply an
Army, and the rest (by Lady) had good doings, a motion or a short
cause to open, are now so empty that boyes may peepe over them, The
surly Tipstaves and messengers whom your best Oratory, and money to

stands looking over the dore as it were through a Pillory, to aske you
Sir shall I open? and for the teaster you give him, kisses his hand and

no Dashes, nor any imployment, towards maintenance of Taffata,
Sack, Wenches, and other the usuall prodigalities, and luxuries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto

can shew you at this present no subject but his owne humble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
you that knew it when the necessity of over great imployment,
caused it to double the number of its Clarkes, and they to treble theirs,
when it was solicited by petitions as numberlesse as Hops, or Ants,
which all her Welsh kindred had brought two hundred and twelve and

would wonder how it should tumble from such a throng, to such a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of imployment. That that Court that hath made two hundred
Orders in one cause, should be in danger not to have one cause to Order,
It is me thinks a lamentable change.</p>
            <p>The Ministers of the Court of Wards, doe all weare mourning

not a Lawier nor Clerke comes neere them: And at hell where they had
wont to flock like Swallowes to a Reede bush, they come but drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in now and then one, as apportunity of businesse makes them able,
the Coaches which had wont to rumble up and downe as they would
chalenge Heaven to thunder for a wager, and did use to lie in the
Pallace yard, and before the Innes of Court gates, like so many Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
or fleetes of fisherboats in harbour, pearing over the haven keyes, now
seeme like westerne Barges on the <hi>Thames</hi> at a high tide, here and

            <p>And you are no sooner out of the Hall-yard but entring into Kings
streete, you finde the Cookes leaning against the Dore-postes, rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
upon those Halcion Termes, when whole herds of Clerks, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitors
and their Clyents, had wont to come with their sharpe-set
noses, and stomacke, from the Hall, and devoure the Puddings, and
minc't Pyes by dozins, as swiftly as a kennell of Hounds would worry
up a dead Horse, And now the Courts are risen before they are hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
The Tavernes, where an Iron Mill would hardly have drown'd
the noise of the yawling boyes, the Bar-bell, the fidling, and roreing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
staires, now so silent you may rock a child asleepe: The spruce
Mistris that had wont to sit in the Bar, domineering over the Drawers,
and not to be spoken withall if you would kisse her arse to speake with
her, now so familiar, bids you so heartily welcome, and will come and
joyne her halfe pint with yee, and let you salute her, and thanke you,
And thinke it very well if all that courtesie will invite you to mount
the reckoning to a pottle, The Ale-houses and Tobacko-shops are
growne sweete for want of takings, you may walke by them without
danger of being choack't.</p>
            <p>All along the strand, (lodgings being empty) you shall finds the
house-keepers generally projecting where to borrow, and what to
pawne, towards payment of their quarters rents, thereby to preserve
their Leases from forfeiture, and themselves, from the tyranny of their
sterne Landlords, who are very infidells in trusting, and will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
a minute; Nay the mischiefe on 'tis, there are no Courtiers nor
bad paymaisters to curse, and raile at for want of money, and that's the
heaviest torment of all.</p>

where those Doves of <hi>Venus,</hi> those Birds of youth, and beauty, (the

Their eyes which like glistering comets had wont to dazle their
Idolaters, now shadowed with clowds of griefe, their golden tresses
which had wont to flag about their shoulders, like so many ensignes in

which did superstitiously dote on it, now for want of curling, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
growne to the fashion of an Irish rugge, And what a misery it is
to see the Velvets, Sattins, and Taffaties, nay the curious smockes, sent
to the brokers, and the whole wardrope that was purchast with so large
a proportion of free favours, and communities, now reduc't to one
pore tufted holland suit? It is not pitty to see them (pore soules) who
had wont to shine like so many constellations in the Firmament of the
suburbs, and be hurried in Coaches to the Tavernes, and Sparagus
Gardens, where ten or twenty pounds suppers were but trifles with
them, should now goe to the Chandlers, and herbe-wives in slip-shooes,
for Cheese and Onions to dinner? Well content your selves, (you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
Load-stones, of delicious and smooth damnation) And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the Arch-angell my successor, will bring your angells to redeeme
all, And your Champions and Cavaliers, will returne with their
pockets doubly furnisht, for you are as sure of them as they are of your

licking of his lipps, a spitting, and a casting up his ugly eyes towards
the place hee is not worthy to looke at, hee whispers a tale through
his rotten Nose, of a great danger that is falling upon the Kingdome,
And strange discoveries of imminent mischiefes, which had happened
if by some providence towards the Brethren of the selected sedition,
and for their sakes onely it had not beene prevented, And then at

hollow-ey'd, longnos'd, wide-mouth'd cur: This carrion that stincks
worse then the corrupted River of <hi>Egypt,</hi> This Cockatrise that hath
hatch't more Serpentine distempers, then all the grave wisdome of a
pregnant Kingdome can pacifie, hath beene the sole cause of poore S.
<hi>Hillaries Teares;</hi> Who would thinke that this Ideot, this Fathomlesse-bellyed,
Thingutted Snake should begin to hisse, and shew his sting,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65278:5"/>
before the glorious splendor of those excellent worthies of our hope|
full <hi>Parliament,</hi> could have leasure to disperse it selfe upon this <gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Kingdome, that this Owle, this Buzzard, should be the instrument
to bring clouds upon all their proceedings, and yet without doubt
will be the first that will oppose, and curse them, when they shall
please to declare that in the title of <hi>Puritane,</hi> they never entended, blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apron
Preachers, <hi>Brownist,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptist:</hi> And yet this secure confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
impudent, malignant, twenty times dam'd Heretique dares attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
all their favour to himselfe, well may Saint <hi>Hillaries</hi> curse pursue
him: Nay the unquenchable zeale of his next Prayer, prolong the
nonsence and foolery thereof to so large a measure of time, that all the
Roast-meate be burn't off the spit, before hee have done, the White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broth
boyled dry, and the stew'd and back't meate scorch't to cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
(which in his opinion is one of the greatest earthly curses that
can befall him) May his wife be catch't in the spirituall act of her next
carnall copulation, that all the World may discover what yet they
carry so closely, may the fervency of his hot zeale to the younger
sisters burne his reines, and kindneyes to ashes, and in stead of an Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall
let him be cast into the Sawpit hee so often defiled under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of edification, Let him be burried amongst the Dunghills, as not
worthy to come neere the Church he so abused, where none may finde
his grave but Dogs to pisse against it, may the ashes of his loath'd car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case
be collected from the pestiferous urne, by Murderers and Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bancks,
to mix with their killing potions, And may no poysons ever
hereafter be operative, but what is compounded with that infernall
dust that as he liv'd to the confusion of all goodnesse, and vertue, so hee
may after death be knowne or mentioned by no other notion, then
some fateboading character, that brings with it the dreadfull summons
of a woefull horrour to ensue, till which end be fallen upon him we shall
never see day of good trading againe, but when it is accomplish't S.
<hi>Hillary</hi> will make a Holiday, and in stead of his Teares will send you
himnes and madrigalls for joy of the Roundheads confusion, and
your more sull imployment.</p>
