            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE offering friendly Advice and Counſel, eſpecially in great and important Caſes, is, tho often, a Thankleſs, yet a very Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Office: a thing agreeable to the beſt Inclinations of Humane Nature, and highly condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the Neceſſities of Men, and conſequently needs no Apology to introduce it. We live, 'tis true, in an ill-Natured and Cenſorious Age, wherein 'tis rare to find any one, who will not take with the Left-hand, what's offered to them with the Right. But I am not diſcouraged from this Attempt, by the Pieviſhneſs and Frowardneſs of many that differ from us, Remembering that all Honeſt Undertakings (and ſuch I am ſure this is) are under the more peculiar Conduct and Bleſſing of the Divine Providence, which can and will ſucceed and proſper them to an happy Iſſue, if Mens own Obſtinacy and Perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do not put a Bar in the way to hinder it. I do
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95248:3"/>
therefore beſeech our <hi>Diſſenting-Brethren,</hi> with all the earneſtneſs that becomes a matter of ſo much Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and with all the Kindneſs and Tenderneſs that becomes a Chriſtian, that they would <hi>ſuffer the Word of Exhortation,</hi> and duly Weigh and Conſider the Requeſts and Advices that are here plainly laid before them, which I hope will be found ſuch, as carry their own Light and Evidence along with them.</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>I.</head>
               <p>And Firſt, <hi>We beg of them to believe, That they may be miſtaken about thoſe matters, which are alledged as the Cauſes of their Separation.</hi> This, one would think, were as needleſs, as 'tis a modeſt and reaſonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. For did ever any Man, (the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> excepted) lay claim to Infallibility? Do not the Woful Infirmities of Humane Nature, The Weakneſs and Short-ſightedneſs of our Underſtandings, The Daily Experience of our ſelves, and the lamentable Failures we obſerve in others, ſufficiently convince us, how prone we are to Error and Miſtake? But tho this be granted and owned on all hands, yet in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, we frequently find Men Acting by other Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. For how many are there, that in the moſt Controverted Caſes bear up themſelves with as much Confidence and Aſſurance, Cenſure others with as Magiſterial a Boldneſs, Condemn the things Enjoined by our Church, with as poſitive and peremptory a Determination, as if they were infallibly ſure, that they are in the Right, and all others in the Wrong that differ from them. The early prepoſſeſſion of a contrary Opinion, the powerful prejudices of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, an implicite and unexamined Belief of what
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95248:3"/>
their Guides and Leaders teach them, have a ſtrange force upon the Minds of Men, ſo that in effect, they no more doubt of the Truth and Goodneſs of the Cauſe they are engaged in, then they queſtion the Articles of their Creed. Wherefore I do once and again intreat them, that laying aſide all Pride, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and Self-conceit, they would not <hi>think more highly of themſelves,</hi> and of their own way, <hi>then they ought to think;</hi> eſpecially remembering, that the matters contended about are confeſſedly Diſputable, and that they cannot be Ignorant, that the Caſe ſeems otherwiſe to others, who may at leaſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be as wiſe Men, and as competent Judges as themſelves. Truth makes the eaſieſt entrance into modeſt and humble Minds; <hi>the Meek will he guide in Judgment, the Meek will he teach his Way;</hi> The Spirit of God never reſts upon a Proud Man.</p>

               <head>II.</head>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We beg of them, that they would ſeriouſly and impartially Weigh and Conſider, as well what is ſaid on the one ſide, as on the other.</hi> This is a peice of Juſtice, that every one ows to Truth, and which indeed every Man ows to himſelf, that is not willing to be deceived. To take up with Prejudices, which Education or long Cuſtom have inſtilled into him, or wherein any other Arts or Methods have engaged him, without ſtrictly enquiring whether thoſe Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices ſtand upon a firm Foundation, is to ſee only on one ſide: to bind up ones ſelf in the Judgment or Opinion of any Man, that is not Divinely-inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and Infallible, or pertinaciouſly to adhere to any Party of Men; how plauſible and ſpecious ſoever their pretences may be, without examining their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95248:4"/>
Grounds, and endeavoring to know what is ſaid againſt them, is to chooſe a Perſuaſion at a perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; and 'tis great odds, whether ſuch a one be in the right. In all Enquiries after Truth, we ought to keep an Ear open for one ſide of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as well as the other, and not to think we have done enough, till without Favour or Prejudice, and to the beſt of our Underſtandings, we have heard, tryed, and judged, the Reaſons brought, as well for, as againſt it. And till this be done, I ſee not with what pretence of Reaſon, Men can talk ſo much of their <hi>Scruples,</hi> or plead for Favour on the account of their Diſſatisfactions. Conſciences truly tender, are willing and deſirous to embrace all opportunities of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, &amp; are ready to kiſs the Hand that would bring them better information, and are not wont to neglect, much leſs thruſt from them the means that might eaſe them of their Doubts and Scruples. We juſtly blame it in them of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that in a manner they reſign up their Underdſtanings to their Guids and Confeſſors, and are not ſuffered to be truly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Principles, and the Grounds and Reaſons of the Reformation; nor to Read any of the Books, that are written for their Conviction, without a ſpecial and peculiar Licence. Whether our Brethren of the Separation be under any ſuch Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Diſcipline, I know not; ſure I am it looks very odly, that ſo many of them are no more concerned to underſtand the true State of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Nature and Reaſons of her Conſtitutions, that ſo few of them care to Confer with thoſe that are able to Inſtruct them, but Cry out, <hi>They are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied already;</hi> nay, ſome of them, to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, when deſired to propoſe their Scruples, in order to the giving them ſatisfaction, have plainly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95248:4"/>
refuſed to do it. Little reaſon there is to believe, that ſuch Perſons have ever Read and Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined what the Church of <hi>England</hi> has to ſay for her ſelf. Are there not many, that not only Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but Rail at the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> that yet never heard it, nor perhaps, ever read it, in all their Lives? And if this be not to ſpeak Evil of what they know not, I cannot tell what is. How many incomparable Books have been heretofore written in defence of our <hi>Church,</hi> her Rights and Uſages, that yet generally lie by the Walls, little known, and leſs read, by thoſe that ſo much Cry out againſt her. And at this time how many excellent Diſcourſes have been Publiſhed, for the ſatisfaction of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the greateſt Temper and Moderation; with the utmoſt plainneſs and perſpicuity, with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable evidence and ſtrength of Reaſoning; ſo ſhort, as not to require any conſiderable portion, either of Time or Coſt, ſo ſuited to preſent Circumſtances, as to obviate every material Objection, that is made againſt Communion with us; and yet there is juſt cauſe to fear, that the far greateſt part of our <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> are meer ſtrangers to them, and are not ſo juſt to themſelves, or us, as to give them the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And that thoſe few that do look into them, do it rather out of a deſign to pick quarrels againſt them, and to expoſe them in ſcurrilous or cavilling Pamphlets, then to receive ſatisfaction by them. I do heartily, and from my Soul, wiſh an end of theſe Contentions, and that there were no further occaſion for them; but if our <hi>Diſſenting Brethren</hi> will ſtill proceed in this way, we deſire, (and hope 'tis but what is reaſonable) that the things in difference may be debated in the moſt quiet, peaceable, and amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, that they may be gravely and ſubſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95248:5"/>
Managed, and only the Merits of the Cauſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, and that the Controverſie may not be turned off to mean and trifling Perſons, whoſe higheſt attainment perhaps it is, to write an idle and ſenceleſs Pamphlet, and which can ſerve no other uſe, but only that the People may be born in hand, that ſuch and ſuch Books are Anſwered. Which is ſo unmanly and diſingenuous a way, and ſo like the ſhifting Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of them of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that I am apt to perſuade my ſelf, the wiſer Heads of the <hi>Diſſenting Party</hi> cannot but be aſhamed of it. If they be not, 'tis plain to all the World they are willing to ſerve an ill Deſign by the moſt unwarrantable Means. But however that be, we think we have great reaſon to expect from them, that they ſhould hear our <hi>Church,</hi> before they condemn Her, and conſider what has been ſaid for the removing of their Doubts, before they tell us any more of <hi>Scruples, Tender-Conſciences;</hi> and the hard Meaſure that they meet withal. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, could I meet with a Perſon, that had brought himſelf to ſome kind of unbyaſdneſs and indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Temper, and that deſign'd nothing more then to ſeek and find the right way of Serving God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to the Intrigues and Intereſts of this or that particular Party; and in order thereunto, had with a ſincere and honeſt Mind read whatever might probably conduce to his ſatisfaction, fairly propoſed his Scruples, and modeſtly conſulted with thoſe that were moſt proper to adviſe him, and humbly begged the guidance and direction of the Divine Grace and Bleſſing; and yet after all, ſhould ſtill labour under his old Diſſatisfactions; I ſhould heartily pity and pray for ſuch a Man, and think my ſelf obliged to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all my Intereſt for Favour and Forbearance towards him. But ſuch Perſons as theſe, I am afraid,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95248:5"/>
are but thin Sowed, and, without breach of Charity, it may be ſuppoſed, there is not One of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, <hi>We deſire, that before they go on to accuſe our Church with driving them into Seperation, they would directly charge her with impoſing ſinful terms of Communion.</hi> And unleſs they do this, and when they have done it, make it good, (for barely to accuſe, I hope, is not ſufficient,) I ſee not which way they can poſſibly juſtifie their Separation from us. 'Tis upon this account that the whole <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation defends their departure from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> They found the Doctrine of that Church infinitely corrupt in ſeveral of the main Principles of Religion, New Articles of Faith introduced, and bound upon the Conſciences of Men under pain of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, its Worſhip overgrown with very groſs Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Superſtition; Its Rites and Ceremonies not only over-numerous, but many of them advanced into proper and direct acts of Worſhip, and the uſe of them made neceſſary to Salvation; and beſides, it's Members required to joyn and communicate in theſe corruptions and depravations, nay and all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals and attempts toward a Reformation obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected and thrown out; in which caſe they did with great Reaſon and Juſtice depart from her: which we may be confident they would not have done, had no more been required of them, than inſtead of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Images, to uſe the <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, or inſtead of the Adoration of the Hoſt, to <hi>kneel</hi> at the Receiving of the <hi>Sacrament.</hi>

And if our Church commands nothing that renders her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ſinful, then certainly Seperation from her muſt be unlawful, becauſe the Peace and Unity of the Church, and obedience to the commands of lawful Authority, are expreſs and indiſpenſable duties; and a few private ſuſpicions of the unlawfulneſs of the thing are not ſufficient to ſway againſt plain, publick, and neceſſary Duties: nor can it be ſafe to reject Communicating with thoſe, with whom Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf does not refuſe Communion. This I am ſure was once thought good Doctrine by the cheifeſt of our Diſſenters, who when time was, reaſoned thus againſt thoſe that ſubdivided from them;

               </p>
               <p>And in the ſame Book they tell us of a Two-fold Schiſm, Negative and Poſitive; 

<q>Negative, when Men do peaceably and quietly withdraw from Communion with a Church, not making a Head againſt that Church, from which they are depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the other is, when Perſons ſo withdrawing do conſociate and withdraw themſelves into a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and oppoſite Body, ſetting up a Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Church, which (ſay they) <hi>Camero</hi> calls a Schiſm by way of Eminency; and further tells us, There are Four Cauſes, that make a Separation from a Church lawful; 1. When they that Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are grievouſly and intollerably Perſecuted; 2. When the Church they Separate from is Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; 3. When it is Idolatrous; 4. When it is the Seat of Antichriſt. And where none of theſe Four are found, there the Separation is inſufficient, and Schiſm. Now we are fully aſſured, that none of theſe Four Cauſes can be juſtly charg'd upon our Congregations; therefore you muſt not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with us, but with your ſelves, if we blame you as guilty of poſitive Schiſm.</q> All which is as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95248:7"/>
true now, as it was then, and as applicable to us and them, as it was to them and their <hi>Diſſenters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Admit then there were ſome things in our Conſtitution, that might be contrived to better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and that needed amendment and alteration; yet I hope every Defect, or ſuppoſed Corruption in a Church, is not a ſufficient ground for Separation, or warrant enough to rend and tear the Church in peices.

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>We entreat them to Conſider, whether it be pure Conſcience, and meer Zeal for the Honour of Religion, and not very often Diſcontent, or Trade and Intereſt, that has the main ſtroke in keeping them from Communion with our Church.</hi> Far be it from me to judg the Secrets of Mens Hearts, or to faſten ſuch a Charge on the whole Body of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> yea, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe not any particular Perſon; but only deſire, they would lay their Hand upon their Hearts, and deal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially with themſelves, and ſay, whether they ſtand clear before God in this matter. And there is the more reaſon to put Men upon this Enquiry, not only becauſe Secular Ends are very apt to mix with, and ſhelter themſelves under the ſhadow of Religion; but becauſe this has been an old Artifice, made uſe of to promote Separation. Thus the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times upheld their Separation from the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and kept their Party faſt together, by Trading only within themſelves, by imploying none to Till their Grounds, or be their Stewards, but thoſe that would be of their ſide; nay, and ſometimes hiring Perſons by large Sums of Mony to be Baptiz'd into their Party, as <hi>Criſpin</hi> did the People of <hi>Mappalia.</hi>

them, that ſo they might find Friends, be ſooner diſpatched, and fare better in their Cauſes; that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, Proud, Covetous Men, who had a mind to Offices, places of profit about the Army, Exciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> turned about to the <hi>Independents,</hi> and were great Zealots for them.

               <p>Fifthly, <hi>We deſire them to-Conſider, Whether it be not a Juſt Prejudice to their Cauſe, and that which ought to prevail with Men Modeſt and Peaceable, that in thoſe things, wherein they differ from us, they are Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Practice of the whole Catholick Church for Fifteen Hundred Years together.</hi> This, were I mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might afford a large Field for Diſcourſe, but I ſhall inſtance only, and that very briefly, in a few Particulars,</p>
               <p>And Firſt, We deſire them to produce any ſettled part of the Chriſtian Church, that ever was without Epiſcopal Covernment, till the time of <hi>Calvin:</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then as hard to find any part of the Chriſtian World without a Church, as to find a Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Biſhop. This is ſo evident in the moſt early An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities of the Church, that I believe our <hi>Diſſenters</hi> begin to grow ſick of the Controverſie. And if <hi>Blondell, Salmaſius</hi> and <hi>Daille,</hi> (whoſe great Parts, Learning, and indefatigable Induſtry, could, if any thing, have made out the contrary) have been forced to grant, That <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> obtained in the Church within a few Years after the <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Age; We are ſure we can carry it higher, even up to the Apoſtles themſelves. There are but Two paſſages,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95248:9"/>
that I know of, in all Antiquity, of any Note, and both of them not till the latter end of the <hi>Fourth Century,</hi> that may ſeem to queſtion <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: The One, That famous and well known paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> which yet when improved to the utmoſt that it is capable of, only intimates <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> not to be of <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Inſtitution.<note place="margin">Idem Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, qui Epiſcopus, &amp; ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aboli in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctu ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligione fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hier. in Epiſt. ad Tit. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> And very clear it is to thoſe that are acquainted with St. <hi>Jeroms</hi> Writings, that he often Wrote in haſt, and did not always weigh things at the Beam, and forgot at one time, what he had ſaid at another; that many expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions fell from him in the heat of Diſputation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the warmth and the eagerneſs of his Temper, &amp; that he was particularly chafed into this Aſſertion by the fierce oppoſition of the <hi>Deacons</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Uſurp upon, and over-top the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which tempted him to Magnifie and Extol their Place and Dignity, as anciently equal to the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Office, and as containing in it the common Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of Prieſthood. For at other times, when he Wrote with cooler Thoughts about him, he does plainly and frequently enough aſſert the Authority of Biſhops over Presbyters, and did himſelf conſtantly live in Communion with, and Subjection to Biſhops. The other paſſage is that of <hi>Aerius,</hi> who held indeed that a Biſhop and a Presbyter differed nothing in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Dignity, or Power. But he was lead into this Error meerly through Envy and Emulation, being vext to ſee that his Companion <hi>Euſtathius</hi> had gotten the Biſhoprick of <hi>Sebaſtia,</hi> which himſelf had aimed at. This made him ſtart aſide, and talk extravagant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but the Church immediately branded him for an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and drave him and his followers out of all Churches, and from all Cities and Villages. <note place="margin">Cont. Aer. haeres. 75.</note>And <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi> who was his Contemporary, repreſents him
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95248:9"/>
as very little better then a Madman; and adds, that all Hereſies that ever were from the beginning of the World, had been hatched either by Pride, or Vain Glory, or Covetouſneſs, or Emulation, or ſome ſuch Evil Inclination. But his Hereſie, it ſeems, was not long-liv'd, for we hear no more concerning this matter, till the Reformation at <hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We deſire them to ſhew any Chriſtian Church that did not conſtantly uſe <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi> in their Publick Offices and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations of Divine Worſhip: I take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there were Forms of Publick Prayer in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church; and I make no doubt, but that the uſe of ſuch <hi>Forms,</hi> was, together with many other <hi>Synagogue</hi>-rites and Uſages, transferred into the Practice of the Chriſtian Church, and did actually obtain, in the moſt early Ages in all Churches, where there were not Miraculous Gifts: and every where as ſoon as thoſe Miraculous Gifts ceaſed, it being very fit and proper, and agreeable to Order and Decency, that the Peoples Devotions ſhould be thus Conducted and Governed in their Publick Miniſtrations. Not to inſiſt upon the <hi>Carmen,</hi> or <hi>Hymn,</hi> which even the <hi>Proconſul Pliny,</hi> ſays, the Chriſtians upon a ſet Day were wont, one among another, to ſay to Chriſt, as to their God; Apparent footſteps of ſome Paſſages of their Ancient <hi>Liturgies,</hi> are yet extant in the Writings of <hi>Origen</hi> and St. <hi>Cyprian:</hi> And when <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> gives us an account, how Religiouſly <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> ordered his Court,<note place="margin">De vit.

                  </note> That he was wont to take the Holy Bible into his Hands, and carefully to Meditate upon it, and afterwards to offer up <hi>Set</hi> or <hi>Compoſed</hi> Prayers, together with his whole Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; he adds, <hi>He did this after the manner,</hi> or in imitation <hi>of the Church of God. Nazianzen</hi> tells us of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95248:10"/>
St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> That he compoſed <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> of Prayer, and appointed decent Ornaments for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.<note place="margin">In Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium Orat. 20. Baſ. Epiſt. 63.</note> And St. <hi>Baſil</hi> himſelf reciting the manner of the Publick Service, that was uſed in the Monaſtical Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of his Inſtitution, ſays, That nothing was done therein but what was Conſonant and Agreeable to all the Churches of God. And the Council of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odicea,</hi> holden much about the Year 365, expreſly provides, that <hi>the ſame Liturgy,</hi> or <hi>Form of Prayers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Can. 18. conf. Conc. Milev. can. 12. Conc. Carth. 3. c. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhould be always uſed both Morning and Evening:</hi> That ſo it might not be lawful for every one that would, to compoſe Prayers of his own Head, and to repeat them in the Publick Aſſemblies; as both <hi>Zonaras</hi> and <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamon</hi> give the reaſon of that <hi>Canon.</hi> Further then this we need not go, the Caſe being henceforward evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent beyond all Contradiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let them ſhew us any Church, that did not always ſet a part and obſerve <hi>Feſtival</hi> Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morations of the Saints: beſides the more ſolemn times for Celebrating the great Bleſſings of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, his <hi>Birth Day</hi> and <hi>Epiphany, Eaſter</hi> in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his Reſurrection, <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> or <hi>VVitſuntide</hi> for the Miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, they had Annual days for ſolemnizing the <hi>Memories</hi> of the Bleſſed Apoſtles; they had their <hi>Memoriae</hi> and <hi>Natalitia Martyrum,</hi> whereon they aſſembled every Year, to offer up to God their Praiſes and Common Devotions, and by Publick Panegyricks to do honour to the memory of thoſe Saints and Martyrs who had ſuffered for, or Sealed Religion with their Bloud. Not to mention their <hi>Lent</hi> Faſt and their <hi>Stationary</hi> Faſts on <hi>VVedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays,</hi> which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> more then once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſays, were a <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles.<note place="margin">Serm. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend: de Expoſ. fid. <hi>p.</hi> 466. adv. Aer. Haeres. 75.</note>
                  </hi> But the leſs need be ſaid on this head, becauſe few that have any Reverence for Antiquity, will have the hardineſs to oppoſe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95248:10"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We deſire them to produce any Church ſince the Apoſtles Times, that had not its Rites and Ceremonies, as many (if not more) in number, and as liable to exception, as thoſe that are uſed in our Church at this Day; nay, there are few things, if any at all, required by our Conſtitution, which were not in uſe in the beſt Ages of Chriſtianity. This, were it my deſign, I might demonſtrate by an Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of particulars, but it is fully done by other Hands. I ſhall therefore, only as a <hi>Specimen,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in One, and the rather, becauſe 'tis ſo much boggled at, (<hi>viz.</hi>) The <hi>Sign of the Croſs</hi> in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which we are ſure was a Common and Cuſtomary Rite in the time of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the latter whereof ſays oft enough, that <hi>being Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,</hi> that is, <hi>Baptized, they were Signed with the Sign of Chriſt;</hi> that <hi>they were Signed on their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, who were thought worthy to be admitted into the fellowſhip of our Lords Religion.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cypr. adv. Demetr. <hi>p.</hi> 203. de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nit. <hi>Eccl. p.</hi> 185. vid. de Laps. <hi>p.</hi> 169. Bas. de Spir. S. <hi>c.</hi> 27. Tert. de Coron. mil. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> And St. <hi>Baſil</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puts it amongſt thoſe Ancient Cuſtoms of the Church, which had been derived from the Apoſtles: Nay, <hi>Tertullian</hi> aſſures us, that they uſed it in the moſt common Actions of Life; <hi>that upon every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at their going out, and coming in, at their going to Bath, or to Bed, or to Meals, or whatever their Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions called them to, they were wont to make the Sign of the Croſs on their Fore-heads;</hi> and therefore 'tis no wonder, that they ſhould never omit it in the moſt Solemn Act of their being initiated into the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith. And now let our <hi>Diſſenting-Brethren</hi> ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reflect, whether the Conſtant and Uniform Practice of the Church in all times, be not a mighty Teſtimony againſt their Separating from us, upon the account of thoſe things, which were uſed in the wiſeſt, beſt and happieſt Ages of the Goſpel; and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95248:11"/>
when their Separation upon this account, can in point of Example, pretend not to much more then a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years Countenance and Authority to Support and Shelter it. And yet it has not that neither; for I could eaſily ſhew, that moſt, if not all, the Uſages of our Church,<note place="margin">See <hi>Durels</hi> view of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and publick worſhip of God, 1662.</note> are either practiſed in Foreign Churches, or at leaſt, allowed of by the moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Eminent Divines of the Reformation, whoſe Teſtimonies, to this purpoſe, are particularly enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and ranked under their proper Heads, by Mr. <hi>Sprint,</hi> in his <note n="*" place="margin">p. 123, 124, ctc.</note>

               <p>Sixthly, <hi>We beg that thoſe, who by their Conformity have declared, that they can cloſe with our Communion, would ſtill continue in the Communion of our Church.</hi> This is a Requeſt ſo reaſonable, that I hope it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fairly be denied. Whatever Diſſatisfactions o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may alledg, to keep them at a diſtance from us, theſe Men can have nothing to pretend, having actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſhewed that they can do it. For I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to think, that herein ſuch Men acted againſt their Conſciences, or did it meerly to ſecure a gainful Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or a place of Truſt, or to eſcape the Laſh and Penalty of the Law. Theſe are Ends ſo very Vile and Sordid, ſo Horrible a proſtitution of the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the moſt Venerable Myſtery of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſo deliberate a way of Sinning, even in the moſt Solemn Acts of Worſhip, that I can hardly ſuſpect any ſhould be guilty of it, but Men of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate and Atheiſtical Minds, who have put off all Sence of God, and Baniſhed all Reverence of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I would fain believe, that when any of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren receive the Sacrament with us, they are fully
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95248:11"/>
perſuaded of the lawfulneſs of it, and that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that brings them thither, is the Conſcience of their Duty. But then I know not how to Anſwer it, why the ſame Principle that brings them thither at one time, ſhould not bring them alſo at another, and that we ſhould never have their company at that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and Sacred Ordinance, but when the fear of ſome Temporal Puniſhment, or the proſpect of ſome Secular Advantage prompts them to it. 'Tis commonly blamed in thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, that they can diſpenſe with Oaths, and receive Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſerve a turn, and to advance the Intereſt of their Cauſe: But God forbid, that ſo heavy a Charge ſhould ever lie at the Doors of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe, who would be thought moſt to abhor <hi>Popiſh</hi> Practices, and who would take it ill to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted not to make as much, if not more, Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their ways then other Men.

Does not the Apoſtle ſay, that <hi>if it be poſſible, and as much as in us lies, we are to live Peaceably with all Men?</hi> And ſhall Peace be broken only in the Church, where it ought to be kept moſt entire? And that by thoſe, who acknowledg it to <hi>be poſſible,</hi> and within their power? Are they ſatisfied in their Conſciences, to join in Communion with us, and will they not do it for the ſake of the Church of God? Or will they

refuſe to do what is lawful, and as the Caſe ſtands neceſſary, in order to Peace, only becauſe Authority Commands it, and has made it their Duty?

               <p>Eighthly, <hi>We deſire it may be conſidered, what plain and apparent Advantages Separation gives to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy of the Proteſtant Religion in theſe Nations:</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> is notoriouſly known to have been the moſt ſtrong and ſtanding Bulwark of <hi>Proti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,</hi> ever ſince the Reformation; for being Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on Scripture-grounds, and the Practice of True, Genuine, Primitive Antiquity, and having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by the moſt wiſe, regular, and juſtifiable Methods; it ſtands like a Rock impregnable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Aſſaults, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes upon it. This has ingag'd them to Plant all their Batteries to beat it down, as being the only Church conſiderable enough to ſtand in their way: and when not able to effect it by any other Arts, they have betaken themſelves to the old Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Ruining us, by dividing us. In Order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they have upon all occaſions ſtrenuouſly promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Separation, mixed themſelves with our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, put on every ſhape, that they might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter follow the Common outcry againſt our Church, as <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> ſpurring on the People to call for a more pure and ſpiritual way of Worſhip, and to Clamour for Liberty and Toleration, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they well knew they themſelves were like to have the greateſt ſhare; And that having ſubverted all Order, and beaten People out of all ſober Principles, they foreſaw they muſt be neceſſitated at laſt to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Communion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church.

it is that has brought it upon them. The Laws in this caſe were framed with great Advice, and upon dear bought Experience, and every Nation in the World thinks it ſelf obliged, when no other ways will do it, by Penalties to ſecure the Publick Peace, Safety and Tranquility of the State, though it may ſometimes preſs hard in ſome particular Caſes, when Men through Fancy, Humour, Miſtake or Deſign, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about little, and as themſelves confeſs, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent matters,) ſhall endanger the Publick Welfare, and by an ill Example expoſe the Reverence and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the Laws.

I would theſe Perſons who complain ſo much, would conſider a while, how their Predeceſſors were dealt with in the times of the <hi>good Queen Elizabeth;</hi> which will appear, either from the Laws then made, or from the Proceedings then had againſt them.

                  <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. wherein, among other Clauſes and Penalties, it is provided, <hi>That if any Perſon, ſhall in any Plays, Songs, Rhimes, or by other open Words, declare or ſpeak any thing in the derogation, depraving, or deſpiſing the Book of Common-Prayer, or any thing therein contained, being thereof lawfully convicted, he ſhall forfeit for the firſt Offence an Hundred, for the ſecond Four Hundred Marks, for the Third, all his goods and chattels, and ſhall ſuffer Impriſonment during Life.</hi> A Clauſe, which had it been kept up in its due Life and Power, our <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Divine Offices,</hi> had been Treated with much more Reſpect and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, then I am ſure they have met with, eſpecially of late.

for the better Execution of it.

               <p>Such were Her Laws, and ſuch alſo were Her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, againſt thoſe who faultered in their Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or began to Innovate in the Diſcipline of the Church; and theſe Proceedings as quick and ſmart, as any can be ſaid to be againſt the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> of this time.

followeth,—<q>And eſpecially, you are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Her Majeſty to take heed, that no Ear be given, or Time afforded, to the weariſome Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations of thoſe, that commonly be called <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes,</hi> wherewithal the late Parliaments have been exceedingly Importuned. Which ſort of Men, whilſt in the giddineſs of their Spirits, they labour and ſtrive to advance a new Elderſhip, they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but diſturb the good repoſe of the Church and Common-wealth: which is as well grounded for the Body of Religion it ſelf, and as well guided for the Diſcipline, as any Realm that profeſſeth the Truth. And the ſame thing is already made good to the World, by many of the Writings of Learned and Godly Men, neither Anſwered, nor Anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by any of theſe new fangled Refiners. And as the preſent caſe ſtandeth, it may be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they, or the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> do offer more danger, or be more ſpeedily to be repreſſed. For albeit the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> do impoiſon the Hearts of Her Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, under a pretext of Conſcience, to withdraw them from their Obedience due to Her Majeſty, yet do they the ſame, but cloſely, and only in privy Corners, but theſe Men do, both Publiſh in their Printed Books, and, Teach in all their Conventicles ſundry Opinions, not only dangerous to the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled Eſtate and Policy of the Realm, but alſo much derogatory to Her Sacred Majeſty, and Her Crown, as well by, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In all which things (however in many other points, they pretend to be at War with the Popiſh Jeſuits, yet) by the Separation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Unity of their Fellow-Subjects, and by abuſing the Sacred Authority and Majeſty of their Prince, they do both join and concur with the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in opening the Door, and preparing the way
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95248:21"/>
to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Invaſion, that is Threatned againſt the Realm.</q> Thus far he, <hi>by Her Majeſties moſt Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Pleaſure, and Wiſe Direction,</hi> as he there ſpeaks. To which let me Add, That the Speech took ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that the Parliament paſſed the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>35th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Severeſt Act againſt <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in the whole Body of our Laws. And indeed, ſo Jealous was the Queen of the leaſt appearances of Innovation, that Arch-Biſhop <hi>Grindall,</hi> only for giving too much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to <hi>Propheſyings</hi> (which were beheld as likely to prove Nurſeries of Schiſm and Faction, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they did) fell under Her Diſpleaſure, and was Sequeſtred from his Archiepiſcopal Juriſdiction, and though great interceſſion was made in his behalf, yet could he never be reſtored to his Dying Day.</p>
               <p>This was the State of things then, and yet theſe were the Proceedings of thoſe Days, which our <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> at another time, are wont ſo much to Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and Extol; nothing of late having been ſo much in their Mouth, as the Wiſdom and Prudence, the Care and Diligence, the Zeal and Piety of <hi>Good Queen Elizabeth.</hi> I ſpeak not this to caſt any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion upon the Memory of that incomparable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, whom we have all the reaſon in the World to own to have been the Glorious Inſtrument of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting and Setling the Reformation in this Kingdom; and whoſe Memory will be dear and pretious, as long as the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Name has a Being in <hi>England.</hi> But I only take notice, how extreamly partial People are, and how apt to be prejudiced againſt the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under which they live, and to be always Crying out, That <hi>the former Days were better then theſe?</hi> whereas ſuppoſing their Circumſtances were really harder then they are, and harder then thoſe of the <hi>Puritans</hi> in former times, yet they have no reaſon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95248:21"/>
to accuſe the Government of Rigor and Severity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, if Three things be farther taken into Conſideration,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> of old, eſpecially the firſt Race of them, were generally much more Modeſt and Peaceable then thoſe of later times, more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Laws, leſs Turbulent and Offenſive to the Government: when they could not Conform as Miniſters, they yet did as private Chriſtians, and quietly acquieſced in their Suſpenſion, or Deprivation, and as one truly ſays of them, <hi>When they could not be Active without Sinning,</hi> [as they judged] <hi>they could be Paſſive without Murmuring.</hi> They medled not with things without their Line, nor mixt themſelves with matters of State;<note place="margin">See a Book called, <hi>The Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</hi> 1605. Numb. 8, 9, 11.</note> Declared, That Kings have power by the Law of God, to make ſuch Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Laws as tend to the good Ordering of the Churches in their Dominions, that the Churches ought not to be Diſobedient to any of their Lavvs, that if any thing vvere Commanded contrary to the VVord, they ought not to reſiſt the King therein, but peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to forbear Diſobedience, and ſue to him for Grace and Mercy, and vvhere that cannot be obtained, meekly to ſubmit themſelves to the puniſhment. They generally came to Church, and did not run into Separate Congregations, nay, writ ſtoutly and ſmartly againſt thoſe who began then to attempt a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. But whether our Modern <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have obſerved the ſame Courſe, and be of this Spirit and Temper, let the World judg, yea, let themſelves be Judges in the Caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sad Experience of the Evil Conſequences of Schiſm and Separation, have made it neceſſary for the Government to take all juſt and lawful ways, for preventing the like for the time to come. Men firſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95248:22"/>
began to be diſſatisfied with the Rites and Orders of the Church, then diſcontented that they were not preſently gratified with an Alteration, Diſcontent brought on Sedition, Sedition Rebellion, and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ruin of Church and State. And what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if the Laws bear a little hard there, where there are the ſame appearances, and where there ſeem to be the ſame Tendencies and Inclinations to the ſame Diſmal State of things? Whoever conſiders by what ways the moſt flouriſhing Kingdom in the World, and the beſt Church that ever was ſince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, were miſerably Harraſſed and Deſtroyed, cannot think, that thoſe who ſit at the Helm, ſhould be content to have them Ruined again by the ſame means; eſpecially, after the King, for ſeveral Years together, has in vain tried, by all the Methods of Favour and Indulgence, to win upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let thoſe who now complain ſo much, conſider, how little Favour themſelves ſhewed to others when they were in Power, how the Loyal and Epiſcopal Party were Plundered, Sequeſtred, Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, Dungeoned, Starved, and often ſtunk to Death: What Oaths and Covenants were Rigorouſly Impoſed upon them; what Reſtraints laid upon their Liberties, both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical; though all this while they had Law and Right ſtanding for them. In the Year 1645, an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of Parliament was Publiſhed, <note place="margin">An <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> for putting in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

                  <hi>That if any Perſon hereafter ſhall at any time uſe or cauſe to be uſed the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer in any Church or Publick place of Worſhip, or in any private place or Family within the Kingdom, every Perſon ſo offending ſhould for the firſt Offence pay the ſum of five, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ten pounds, and for the third, ſhould ſuffer one whole Years Impriſonment, without Bail or Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:95248:22"/>

Then I <hi>Suffer as a Chriſtian,</hi> when the Honour of Chriſt, or ſomething that offers Violence to my Religion, and Chriſtianity is concerned in it, when I Suffer for that which I cannot avoid, without diſowning my ſelf to be a Chriſtian, and <hi>making Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of Faith and a good Conſcience.</hi> But where the Caſe is not evidently this, a Man may draw Miſeries upon himſelf, and yet not <hi>Suffer as a Chriſtian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may proceed from Humour, or Intereſt, or the Conduct of a miſinformed Judgment, miſtaking things for what they are not: Men very often place Religion in doing, or not doing, what is no part of it, and then think they may ſafely Suffer upon that account, when there is more, it may be, of Paſſion or Prejudice, of Fancy or Opinion, of Humour or Miſtake, then of the real Concerns of Piety or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. I am very ſure, neither the Ancient Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, would have paſſed through the <hi>Fiery-Tryal</hi> every Day, nor the Holy Martyrs in <hi>Queen Mary</hi>'s Days, have thought themſelves obliged to Forfeit their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, much leſs their Lives, had no more been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them then there is of us, to come to Church, or to Kneel at the Sacrament; but would rather have Bleſſed God, and thankfully owned the Favour of the Governours, under which they lived, might they have enjoyed both upon the ſame Terms as we do. In Caſes that only concern indifferent things, and meer Circumſtances of Worſhip, ſtiffly and obſtinately to ſtand out, is, rather for a Man to be a Martyr to his own Humour and Opinion, then to the Cauſe of Chriſt. Whether this be not the Caſe of our <hi>Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Bretren,</hi>

they themſelves might quickly ſee, would they but lay aſide the unreaſonableneſs of their Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and lay no more ſtreſs upon things, then they ought to bear. Let us hear what Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in a late Book, ſays to this matter, <note place="margin">Obed. Patience <hi>p.</hi> 79.</note>
                  <hi>I am One that have been firſt in all the Storms that have befallen the Miniſtry, theſe Twenty Years paſt, (to look no farther back,) and yet my Conſcience commandeth me to ſay, as I have oft done, that many through miſtake, I am perſuaded, now Suffer as Evil-doers for a Cauſe, that is not Good and Juſtifiable.</hi> I ſhall leave with them the Wiſe and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Counſel, which was given by one in the time of the Elder Puritanes, <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Follow true Antiquity, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Practice of the Church of God in all Ages, where they have not Erred from the evident Truth of God. If thou Suffereſt, let it be for known Truth, and againſt known Wickedneſs; for which thou haſt Example in Gods Word, or of the Holy Martyrs in Church-Story. But beware of far-fetched Conſequences, or for Suffering for new Devices, and for things, formerly, unto all Ages unknown, ſeem they never ſo Holy and Juſt unto Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All that now remains, is to call upon our <hi>Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Brethren,</hi> by all the Conſiderations of Love and Kindneſs to themſelves, of Tenderneſs for the Honour of Religion, the Edification of their <hi>Brethren,</hi> and the Peace, Security and Welfare, of the Church and State wherein they Live, that they would duely and impartially Weigh and Conſider things, put a ſtop to the Separation, wherein they are engaged, return to, and hold Communion with us, and <hi>keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let them bethink themſelves what a mighty Evil Schiſm is, and will be ſo found before God at the laſt Day, and whether any thing can be meet to be put in the Ballance with the Peace and Unity of the

Church, and thoſe Vaſtly-important Conſequences, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it. Let us Conſider a little, what a deep Sence the Beſt and moſt Pious Chriſtians, that ever were, had of it: <hi>It's better to Suffer any thing, then that the Church of God ſhould be Rent aſunder; it is every whit as Glorious, and, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, a far greater Martyrdom, to Die for not Dividing the Church, then for refuſing to Sacrifice to Idols,</hi> ſays <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> the good Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Novation.</hi> And St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks very ſevere things to this purpoſe,<note place="margin">Ap. <hi>Euſeb.</hi> lib. 6. cap. 45. Epiſt. 52. (ad <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian.</hi>) de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nit. Eccleſ. fol. 181, 184, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <q>That a Perſon going from the Church to Schiſmaticks, though in that Capacity he ſhould Die for Chriſt, yet can he not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Crown of Martyrdom.</q> And how oft elſewhere doth he tell us, <q>That ſuch a One has no part in the Law of God, or the Faith of Chriſt, or in Life and Salvation, that without this Unity and Charity, a Man <hi>cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> and that although he ſhould deliver up himſelf to the Flames, or caſt his Body to Wild Beaſts, yet this would not be the Crown of his Faith, but the Puniſhment of his Falſhood; not the Glorious <hi>Exit</hi> of a Religious Courage, but the Iſſue of Deſpair; ſuch a One may be Kill'd, but he cannot be Crown'd. He Rents the Unity of the Church, Deſtroys the Faith Diſturbs the Peace, Diſſolves Charity, and Profanes the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q> And were it neceſſary, I could ſhew, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers generally ſay the ſame thing. And can we now be ſuch Degenerate Chriſtians, (if we can be ſaid to be Chriſtians at all) as to make nothing at all of Schiſm and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration? Are not the Glory of God, the Peace of the Church, and the Good of Souls, things as conſiderable, as neceſſary and indiſpenſable now, as they were of old? I beſeech you, Brethren, return from whence you are fallen; and let us all with one Shoulder ſet our ſelves to Support that Church, with whoſe Ruin we are all likely to ſink and fall. Let us lay aſide <hi>Envying and Strife, Confuſion and every Evil Work,</hi> and <hi>let us follow after the things, which make for Peace, and things wherewith one may Edifie another.</hi>
