            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

write, and many more doe
ſpeake of <hi>Death:</hi> and it were
not much, if as many wrote
thereof, as could write at all.
For it is the <hi>Way,</hi> that <hi>all</hi> muſt walke in: and
although to all it be either very <hi>fortunate,</hi> or
very <hi>fatall,</hi> yet of the moſt it is forgotten, till
it ſeeme to ſeize vpon them: yea, euen we,
that ſpeake and write about it, are ſometimes
too vnmindful of it; perhaps then alſo, when
we ſpeake and write vpon it. But howſoeuer
<pb facs="tcp:693:3"/>
wee doe forget it, it will bee ſure to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
vs. It hath been wiſely ſaid, that <hi>to ſpeake
and thinke often and ſeriouſly of hell, is a good
meane to ſaue the ſoule from hell:</hi> ſo I ſuppoſe
that a ſad and ſober thinking, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
of <hi>bodily</hi> death, will bee a bleſſed helpe
to keepe the ſoule and bodie from <hi>eternall</hi>
death. It is ſtrange to ſee the feares of many:
yet euen the fearefull ſometimes ſhew ſmall
feare of death, except then, when it is to bee
embraced. Others well neare with the feare
of death are brought to death. Some will not
beginne to liue, till they feele themſelues
beginne to die. And how many are there,
that are a-fraid of death, and yet dare play
with the <hi>ſting</hi> of death? It were no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to handle a <hi>Snake,</hi> when her <hi>poyſoning
tooth</hi> is pulled out: but to flie a <hi>Snake,</hi> and in
the meane time not to feare that, which
makes her venome, were (I wot not well)
whether more <hi>baſe,</hi> or <hi>fooliſh.</hi> I know not why
death ſhould not be counted terrible, whiles
her venomous and <hi>killing</hi> tooth is in her head;
but that being once pulled out, why ſhee
ſhould affright a man, I ſee no reaſon. For
why ſhould he feare death, whom death
doth <hi>helpe,</hi> not hurt, and <hi>eaſe</hi> rather then end?
<pb facs="tcp:693:3"/>
Hee that dies, whiles he liues, liues whiles he
is dead: yea, and that death at laſt ſhall meet
with death it ſelfe. Certainly death cannot
be ill to him, that liues well: neither is that
worthie the name of death, which is made
the doore of life. Yet I finde the vertuous
ſometimes appalled with her griſly lookes.
They are loth to part, that haue liued long
together: and a man can ſcarce without ſome
reluctation forſake the houſe, wherein he was
bred, and hath euer liued, ſince he liued, to
dwell in another, though a better, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.
But (me thinks) the delicacie of the place,
the affluence of all good things there, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

            <p>As for you <hi>(Right Worſhipfull)</hi> I doubt not
but that God, to whom you ſtriue to liue,
hath taught you both ere now to die. I write

thoſe things, which ye know alreadie, that,

I pray you, why ſhould man lift vp himſelfe againſt

Why ſhould we be proud and inſolent, who are but

            <p>To theſe teſtimonies of the Creature we may for
better ſatisfaction adde the witneſſe of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">Scriptures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie of the Soule. <hi>Ec.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 66. 24.</note>
which are the very Oracles of the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.
<hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, that when the body returnes to

the mortall immortalitie, or <hi>immortall morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie</hi>
of their ſoules. Accordingly our <hi>Sauiour</hi>
ſheweth in two parables, that the ſoules of wicked
men dye not with their bodies, but remaine in
torments. The one is of him that ſaid, <hi>Soule, thou
haſt much goods layed vp for many yeeres:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 19. 20.</note> but God
ſaid vnto him, <hi>Thou foole, this night will they fetch
away thy ſoule from thee.</hi> The other of another rich
<hi>Epicure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 22. 23.</note> who was grieuouſly tormented <hi>in hell af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hee was dead.</hi> It is true therefore, that as <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Lib. 7. c. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de diu. praem.</note> 
               <hi>Mors non funditus perimit, ac delet,
ſed aeternis afficit cruciatibus,</hi> Death doth not vtterly
kill and extinguiſh, but euerlaſtingly torment and
puniſh.</p>
            <p>Now if the ſoules of the wicked dye not, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
(though indeede afflicted ſo, as that their life
is worthy to bee called and accounted death, an
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:693:9"/>
euer-dying life, or an euer-liuing death) it were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
abſurd to thinke that the ſoules of the godly
ſhould periſh with their bodies. Doth not our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour

               <hi>and that their

now? what is their honour, if their ſoules doe dye
with their bodies? And to what end ſhould that his
<hi>Proto Martyr</hi> Saint <hi>Steuen</hi> commend his ſoule vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him,<note place="margin">Act. 7 59.</note> ſaying, <hi>Lord Ieſus receiue my Spirit,</hi> but
that hee knew his ſoule did liue, when his bodie
was diſſolued? Or why ſhould Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> if he did
not verily beleeue the immortalitie of the ſoule, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<hi>to bee looſed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23.</note> 
               <hi>and to bee with Chriſt,</hi> and vſe this
boldnes of ſpeech vnto the <hi>Corinthes. We know that
if our earthly houſe of this Tabernacle bee deſtroyed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 2.</note>
               <hi>wee haue a building of God, an houſe not made with
hands, eternall in the heauens?</hi> And finally, if Chriſt
<hi>Ieſus</hi> be like vnto his Brethren in <hi>All things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 17. &amp; 4. 15.</note> as the
Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Sinne excepted:</hi> then it appeares,
that his Brethen are like vnto him: but Chriſt hath
a ſoule, which is immortall, and did not dye, though
his body lay dead a time: their ſoules therfore liue
euer, and dye not with their bodies. And that vvee
may not ſeeme to forget that memorable ſpeech of
our Sauiour to the <hi>Sadduces,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 32.</note> 
               <hi>God is not the God of
the dead, but of the liuing:</hi> but hee is the God of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:693:9"/>
               <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob:</hi> therefore theſe three
are liuing in their ſoules, though dead as touching
the life of their bodies.</p>
            <p>And thus our faith concerning the not dying of
the ſoule is founded, fed, and fortified by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of the Scriptures, which beeing of infallible
veritie, are ſimply to bee beleeued, for God, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
and Inſpirer of them.</p>
            <p>Neither is Philoſophy here of no vſe: therefore
<hi>Iulius Caeſar Scaliger,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exerc. 307. Sect. 20.</note> by three reaſons prooueth
it, taken (as himſelfe profeſſeth) from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and
created Nature.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Philoſophicall arguments ſhewing the ſoule of man to be immortall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> no ſimple is reſolued into the grounds ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
for it is compoſed of no grounds: but the ſoule
of man is a thing ſimple, and not compounded: for
it is an <hi>Act,</hi> (and no Act is a <hi>Power:</hi> therefore it is
not compounded) and a Ground, <hi>Principium effen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
&amp; agendi,</hi> which it cannot bee, if it be compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
It followes therefore that the ſoule beeing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed
is irreſoluble, and ſo immortall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſoule is a celeſtiall Nature: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
a <hi>Fift Eſſence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arg. 2</note> differing from the Nature of the
foure elements: vnſubiect therefore to corruption,
whereunto all bodies elementarie are obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if the ſoule doe die, being a ſimple na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it muſt needes be brought to nothing:<note place="margin">Arg. 3.</note> for it
cannot be reſolued into the grounds of it, becauſe
it hath none (for grounds are the acts of thoſe
things whereof they bee grounds: and no ſuch
ground as the ſoule, hath a ground of it ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
God, into whom nothing can bee reſolued:)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:693:10"/>
now if the ſoule ſhould be brought to nothing, then
of ſomething nothing ſhall be made.</p>
            <p>It is true indeede,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that the ſoule and all created
natures, may be corrupted &amp; deſtroyed, how ſimple
they be ſo euer. For there is but <hi>one abſolute and
prime Beginning or Ground</hi> of all things, which is
God: all other things are dependant, they are all
from and by him. Now whatſoeuer dependeth
on God, at his will the ſame thing may bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of God, and altered at his pleaſure. But the
ſoules of men depend on God, and therefore at
his becke they may bee depoſed from that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
in which hee made them. Now they are
not corrupted, becauſe hee will not haue them ſo
to be.</p>
            <p>Theſe Arguments are of ſome ſoliditie, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be receiued: but as for that, which ſome doe
bring to demonſtrate the immortalitie of the ſoule,
to wit, becauſe (they ſay) it is (not onely <hi>A Deo,</hi>
but alſo <hi>De Deo</hi>) of the very eſſence of God, which
is immortal, it is altogether vnreaſonable &amp; wicked.
For ſo it wold follow that the nature of God ſhould
be captiuated,<note place="margin">Note.</note> deceiued, altered, defiled, damned, &amp;
tormented. For though indeede wee be the <hi>Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 17. 28.</note> and <hi>partakers of the diuine Nature,</hi> as
the Apoſtles ſpeake,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 4.</note> yet are we <hi>not parts</hi> of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
neither doth he communicate by generation
his nature to vs, as a Father to his Children: For
God hath but one naturall ſonne, which is Chriſt
Ieſus, who is begotten from all eternitie, and hath
the whole Nature of the Father in his perſon, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the Nature of God capable of alteration or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:693:10"/>
diuiſion: and for the ſpeeches of theſe two Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
               <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> they are to bee vnderſtood
partly becauſe God is our Architect and Creatour,
and partly in reſpect of thoſe excellent giftes and
graces, which ſhine in men, ſpecially good men,
more then in all other creatures, and partly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of that new name, ſtate or Nature, which is
through the grace of God in Chriſt beſtowed on
vs. It is true indeede that the Soule in ſome ſenſe
may be ſaid to be <hi>Mutable (in deterius ſcilicet deſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note>

ſay that the ſubſtance, the eſſence of the Soule, doth

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:693:12"/>

who beareth not the ſword for nought, but for the

cut off by the Magiſtrate, as he is a Magiſtrate, or

are not cut off by Man, but by God, in as much as

And although we be <hi>all as one</hi> by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 28.</note> yet is it in
reſpect of the Communion of the Spirit, and not by

               <hi>Our Kingdome is not of this world,</hi>
though begunne in this world: and our <hi>regalitie</hi>

<hi>ſword.</hi> But to returne.</p>
            <p>Ciuill death is double, iuſt, or iniuſt. A man dies
iuſtly, when he dies for ſome wickednes committed,
or for ſome notable villany, as high treaſon, inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded

Thus iuſtly died thoſe <hi>Powder-Papiſts,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Againe, a man dies vniuſtly, when he dies vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruedly.

by the authoritie of the Magiſtrate, who

rather to die, then to denie their Lord, and to

then diſhonour God by cowardize, and
looſe their ſoules by Apoſtacie. And that it may ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeare that their death was with their willes
(though not ſimply,<note place="margin">Note.</note> as if they were in loue with

would denie their Lord, that bought them, and his

<hi>O God, great vertues</hi> (and what greater

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:693:18"/>
firſt?</hi> I demaund yet once more; Is it by Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
aſſiſtance, or by their owne proper ſtrength,
that the Martyrs did vſe their gifts and vertues wel,
and not looſe them, or vſe them indifferently? No
man, though his head were made of ſteele, could ſay
but that it is by Gods grace that he doth continue
conſtant in grace, and vſe his gifts with profit. For
who doth <hi>confirme</hi> vs vnto the end, but God?<note place="margin">1. Cor. 8. Phil 1. 6. 1. Pet. 15</note> who
but he doth performe the good woorke begunne,

ſtrength,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 10</note> confirmation, perfection, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
but of God? Whom to are we to aſcribe
them, but to God. It followes therefore that the
Martyrs for their very martydomes ſtand rather
bound to God, then God to them. No man hauing
freely beſtowed vpon another a gift,<note place="margin">Note.</note> is bound by
the good vſe of the ſaid gift to beſtow more, but he
that receiueth it, is rather bound to him, that giues
it. But all the works of grace whatſoeuer, though
neuer ſo well vſed, are freely beſtowed vpon men
by God, who alſo of his free good will doth ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
them to vſe them well: therefore God is not
bound by the good vſe therof to beſtow more. And
ſo conſequently all holy Martyrs ſtand obliged vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and all their reward (which is very great:
for according to their paſſions and their patience,
ſuch ſhall bee their euerlaſting poſſeſſions in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe)
is of Gods mercie, and not for their
merits.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, it may bee asked if a man ſeeing his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:693:19"/>

and will not hold him guiltleſſe of murther, that

that God ſhould ſet the feete of his Iuſtice on thee,

that God may iuſtly deny thee mercy now, ſeeing
thou haſt neglected thy good, miſpent thy time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed

neither hereafter will be euer doe all which he may
may iuſtly doe: but hee ſometimes ſhewes mercie,
when men are moſt miſerable, and haue very long
abuſed his patience towards them. Hee vouchſafed
mercy to the Thiefe vpon the Croſſe, that no man
by reaſon of long or grieuous wickedneſſe ſhould
deſpaire of mercy. Deſpaire not then, O Man, but
hope in God: he can forgiue thee, if he will: he hath
not told thee that he will not: he will forgiue thee,
if thou wilt repent: repent then, and repent of theſe
deſperate imaginations, and he will remit thee. Cry

            </p>
            <p>And this is one common cauſe, to wit, the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
of pardon, which makesmen make themſelues
away.</p>
            <p>Another is very vanity of minde,<note place="margin">The ſecond common cauſe of Selfe-murder.</note> and to auoide
reproch, inſamy, beggery, contempt, and the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pight
of the enemy. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> commanded his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour-bearer
to thruſt him through with his ſword,
leaſt the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> ſhould kill and mocke him: and
becauſe his Armour-bearer would not,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 31. 4.</note> therefore
he killed himſelfe: And his Armour-bearer ſeeing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:693:21"/>
him dead, fell likewiſe vpon his ſword, and dyed
with him.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 17. 23.</note> In like manner <hi>Achitophel</hi> ſeeing his
counſel was not followed, and no doubt fearing the
wrath of his Soueraigne, which he had by his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie
deſerued, went home and hanged himſelfe.
<hi>Lucretia</hi> ſtab'd her ſelfe to renowne her chaſtitie.
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> applyed venemous Serpents to her body,<note place="margin">Hor at. car. in l. 1 Od. 7.</note>
becauſe ſhee would not bee carried as a Captiue in
triumph. Others (wee haue heard) haue hanged
themſelues, becauſe the price of corne hath fallen
againſt their couetous deſire and expectation. Oh,
what horrible iniury is here offered vnto God!
Such ſurely either thinke God is not, or that his eye
mindes them not, or elſe they preſume vppon his
mercie, or diſtruſt his prouidence: but how euer it
be, it is ſure there wants true wiſedome, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of ſpirit, they forget to humble themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the mighty hand of God, and are not contented
with his corrections, and finally take vpon them as
if they were the Lords of their owne liues, and
forget to winde their care vpon his prouidence.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing theſe are cauſes of ſuch ſelfe-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
courſes, wee muſt needes account ſuch ſelfe-ſlayers
guilty of greeuous ſinne, whereby they are
very iniurious to Almightie God, the Lord and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of their liues.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſon 2. againſt ſelfe-murder.</note> hee that murthers himſelfe is iniurious
to the Church of God. For whereas he ſhould obey
the doctrine taught him, which ſhe commends vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him from Chriſt her Husband, hee flatly ſhewes
himſelfe diſloyall, vnthankefull, and vnruly: and is
by this his wilfull murder a griefe vnto her, &amp; ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:693:22"/>
by his leud enſample. And whereas his life
ſhould vpon neceſsitie haue beene giuen away in
her ſervice and for her ſecuritie, it cannot now bee,
neither can he performe ſuch ſeruice for her, as hee
ought and might haue done, if this murderous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
had not poſſeſt and ſpoiled him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Reaſon.</note> he that murders himſelfe, offers wrong
vnto his Country. For as he was borne in her, ſo he
was born for her. His life, which he owed to death,
ſhould (if neede had beene) haue beene offered vp
in her ſeruice: but by this vnnaturall murder of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
he depriues her of all helpe and honour, which
otherwiſe ſhee might haue enioyed of him, if true
valour, faith, and wiſedome had poſſeſt him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Reaſon.</note> he offers wrong vnto his Parents, which
vnder God were the cauſes of his life. And is this all
the thankes, the comfort, and credit, hee does them,
for their generation, and education, care and coſt,
to make himſelfe away, to bee his owne hangman
or executioner? Such a Sonne is a <hi>Shame</hi> to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and an <hi>Heauineſſe</hi> vnto his Mother, and by his
wickedneſſe depriues them of that helpe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
which God and Nature claimed at his
hands.</p>
            <p>Finally,<note place="margin">5. Reaſon.</note> he is iniurious vnto himſelfe: firſt to his
ſoule, making himſelfe guilty of murder, and ſo of
death: Secondly, to his body, which with his owne
hands hee doth deſtroy, and deliuer to corruption,
beeing neuer able to repaire it by himſelfe againe,
and depriues it of that honeſt and comely buriall,
which otherwiſe it might haue had with the bodies
of the Saints: Thirdly, he marres his credit, making
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:693:22"/>
himſelfe famous by an infamous death, and giues
iuſt occaſion to men greatly to ſuſpect his ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Wee are now come to the ſecond part of the
Queſtion,<note place="margin">Second part of the 6. queſt.</note> 
               <hi>Whether may this Selfe-murder be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen?</hi>
Vndoubtedly it may, if God will; for Gods
mercy is greater then the miſchiefe and malice of
any ſinne or ſinner:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Selfe-murder may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</note> and the death of Chriſt is of
merit ſufficient to waſh away the fouleſt wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that can be committed. This therefore I ſay,
a man that killes himſelfe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> if hee doe repent of his
murder, before he be dead, he may, and ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen.
Gods mercy may be beſtowed, <hi>Inter pontem
&amp; fontem,</hi> betweene the bridge and the water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the ſtabbe and death.<note place="margin">Note.</note> The ſinne againſt the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> might be forgiuen, if the ſinner could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:
but becauſe hee cannot repent by reaſon of
the hardnes of the heart, which ſhall not be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to death, therefore he cannot be forgiuen. But
Selfe-murderers are not alwaies (as thoſe ſinners)
puniſhed with finall hardnes and impenitencie, and
therefore they may be forgiuen, and no doubt are
ſometimes, then when God doth giue them grace
to repent, and grone vnto him for his mercy. But
let no man preſuming vpon Gods mercy dare to
commit this barbarous villany, leaſt by preſuming
on mercy, he meet with iudgement, which is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
portion of preſumptuous offenders: but
rather let him pray and ſay with <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>Keepe thy

is too too vvicked and abominable.</p>
            <p>To conclude,<note place="margin">Queſt. 7.</note> it may be demanded whether a man
be guilty of his owne death, if he ſhall be kild, when
out of a priuate humour, and deſire of reuenge hee
doth either make, or take a challenge?</p>
            <p>Yes no doubt:<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> for though hee did not ſimply
will, but rather nill his owne death, yet becauſe he
left his calling, and did willingly agree and condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
vnto the meanes of his death, which is fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
hee becomes thereby guilty of his death. And
it is not inough to ſay that hee did not intend to
worke his death, but rather to ſaue his credit, and
honour, by offering or accepting the challenge, and
by sighting. For neither God, nor the poſitiue lawes
of our kingdome doe allot and allow thoſe meanes
of ſauing mens reputations and of righting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
by them, but vtterly condemne them, and
puniſh the vſurpers of them: &amp; beſides, whatſoeuer
he ment to effect by thoſe irregular courſes, yet the
euent ſhewes (when he is ſlaine by them) that they
were the meanes of his ſlaughter, to which he gaue

            <p>I anſwere thus,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> Death is a puniſhment, or at the

Our Sauiour <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt wee all know was moſt
wickedly put to death by the Iudges iniuſt ſentence
at the malitious purſuite of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> now Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> ſaith expreſly that <hi>he was deliuered by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
councell of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 2. 23.</note> and that his enemies were

<hi>To doe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) What ſoeuer thine hand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 4. 28.</note> 
               <hi>and thy

I ſay, if any man kill himſelfe, or bee killed by
others, no more is done then was of old determined
by the hand and counſell of Almightie God.</p>
            <p>Thou wilt then replie,<note place="margin">Ob. 3.</note> if a murtherer do but what
God willed and determined to be done, then he is
to be excuſed as one that fulfils the will of God.</p>
            <p>Not ſo:<note place="margin">Sol.</note> and the reaſon is, becauſe though he did
that act,<note place="margin">No murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer is excuſed by Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</note> which God would, and determined in his
ſecret and eternall councell to be done, yet he did
it not vpon thoſe grounds, &amp; for thoſe ends, which
God did propoſe vnto himſelfe. For all the workes
of God are done in wiſedome and iuſtice: but the
murtherer is ſet a worke by the diuell, and his owne
inward corruption. <hi>When the Father deliuered his
ſonne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Vinc. 38.</note> (ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine) and Christ his bodie,
and</hi> Iudas <hi>his maſter, wherfore is God in this deliuery
iuſt, and man guiltie, but that becauſe in one thing,
which they did, the cauſe is not one, for which they did
it?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note> Againe, though a murtherer doe what the hand
and counſell of God hath determined to bee done,
yet that is no warrant for his murther, becauſe hee
ſinnes againſt the reuealed will of God, the which
is to be obeyed of euery man vnto death: now Gods
reuealed will is that we ſhould not murther.<note place="margin">Ex. 20. 13.</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:693:26"/>
It will be ſaid then that the reuealed will of God
(which forbids murther) is contrario to his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
will,<note place="margin">Ob. 4.</note> by which hee doth determine and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
it.</p>
            <p>I anſwere,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> the reuealed will is not contrarie to
his ſecret will: for the reuealed will forbids mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſimply as it is murther: but the ſecret decrees
and willes it, not <hi>as or becauſe</hi> is is <hi>murther, ſed prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
coniunctum bonum,</hi> but for ſome good conioined
with it. For it is not poſſible that God, who is the
fountaine of good things, yea and goodneſſe it
ſelfe, ſhould will any euill for it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>But that no man be miſtaken, that readeth theſe
things, I will heere briefely ſhew mine opinion in
this point of murther.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Note.</note> I ſay God is not the Author of murther, as
it is murther, but doth deteſt and condemne it, and
puts no (not the leaſt) malice into any mans heart,
which ſtirres him, or moues him vnto murther.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſay that which God doth about
murther, is comprehended in theſe actions.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Three actions of God about murther. 1.</note> as the vniuerſall cauſe of all things hee ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaineth
man and all his actions, ſo that no man
could either be, or act any thing, but that God
doth ſuſtaine him.<note place="margin">Act. 17. 28.</note> For by God we are, we liue, and
moue. All a mans actions therefore, as they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and euery man, as he is a man, is the worke
of God, and therefore alſo good. The action then
(which is the materiall part or ſubiect) of murther,
the <hi>naked action</hi> (I ſay) is of God,<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
               <hi>not the murther,</hi>
which is the formall part, indeed the deformitie of
that action.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:693:27"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> God with-holdeth his grace from the
murtherer, and leaues him to himſelfe, being tied to
no man further or longer then he liſt. Now, as <hi>Hugo
de Sancto Victore</hi> ſaith, <hi>Peccatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neceſſarie ſequitur ex
gratiae ſubtractione,</hi> Sinne neceſſarily, followes vpon
the with-holding of grace: but how? not as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
followes the efficient:<note place="margin">Note.</note> for God doth not put
any murtherous thought or intention into their
hearts: but he doth onely denie them his grace,
which ſhould make them tender hearted &amp; louing:
he giues Satan leaue to egge them on, and offers
them ſundrie obiects by themſelues good, which
they turne into occaſions of euill, hauing neyther
will nor power to ſtay themſelues. And God may
thus deale, becauſe he is bound to no man.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God ordereth and diſpoſeth the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that is thus:<note place="margin">Act. 3.</note> hee directes it ſo, as that it
proceeds no further, nor no otherwiſe, then hee
pleaſeth: ſometimes hee turnes it to another end,
then the murtherer thought of: ſometimes hee
makes a way by it to puniſh ſome other ſinne, and
ſometimes he turnes it to the good of them, that
are murthered.</p>
            <p>But I will ſet downe ſome ſentences of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

               <hi>will haue done,</hi> Either by permitting it to be done, or

where we are to note theſe things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that God in his counſell hath determined the

houre, minute, and moment of euery mans death
that dieth. He that denies this, denies the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this time prefined by God for death,
cannot be auoided by man, or prorogued. <hi>For the
counſell of God ſhall ſtand</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eſay</hi>)<note place="margin">Iſa. 46. 10. 11.</note>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:693:33"/>
that
whatſoeuer he doth will, ſhall irreuocably and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly

Fourthly, no man can tell certainly how long he

And as euerie man doth carrie death about him in

            <p>Sixtly, death befalles one man ordinarily but once.
<hi>It is appointed to men that they ſhall once die,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 27.</note> ſaith the

Thus much for the time and number of

that it is an eaſie thing for a man to be depriued of

takes men ere they bee aware, and like a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieant
is at their backes before they looke for
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> her.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Death is a Sea.</note> death is like the <hi>Sea,</hi> which is terrible,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:693:38"/>
not to bee drained, not to bee turned out of his
channell, and which breaking bankes and preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
without mercy carries all away with it, which
it meetes with. And as into the Sea, ſo vnto death,
there are many vvayes and meanes to bring
men.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is compared to the <hi>Lyon</hi> in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
to whoſe denne many beaſts went,<note place="margin">Death a Lion.</note> but none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned:
ſo many die, but from death to life again we
ſee no man to returne. It accepts as many as comes,
but like a couetous niggard, it keepes all and parts
with none.</p>
            <p>Finally, death is compared to <hi>Sleepe. Homer</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
calles Sleep the Brother of death (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
And <hi>Diogenes</hi> being wakened
out of a dead Sleepe,<note place="margin">Death a Sleep.</note> and asked of his Phyſitian,
how he did,<note place="margin">Laert. lib. 6. Plutarc. Conſol., ad Apoll.</note> anſwered <hi>I am well, Nam frater fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem

            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Gorgias</hi> beeing neere vnto death and ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic,
if any man askt him how hee did, returned
this anſwere, <hi>I am ſomnus incipit me fratri ſuo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere.
Sleepe begins now to deliuer me to his brother,</hi>
meaning death. Which two are ſomething alike.
For death is common as ſleepe: and a dead man is
depriued of worldly cares, and is at reſt in his ſoule,
if godly, and his bodie lyeth in the graue as in a
bed:<note place="margin">A Disſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> but yet a man ſleeping is not wholly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of the vſe of his bodie: for the pulſes beate, the
ſtomacke digeſteth, and the breath comes &amp; goes:
but death depriues a man wholly for a time of all
vſe of his body: Againe, a man wakes out of his
ſleepe and returnes vnto the workes of his calling a

freſh: but a dead man wakes not to the workes of
his former life: neither can hee bee awakened out
of the ſleepe of death, but by the power of God,
of whom alone the day of our reſurrection is ſeene
and knowne.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the things, where vnto death may
be compared.</p>
            <p>There remaine certaine Queſtions concerning
death,<note place="margin">28 queſtions about Death.</note> worthy to bee ſoiled, which I remembred
not in time to ſet in their more proper places, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are they here ſo methodically digeſted, as
plainely reſolued.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Queſt. 1.</note> it may bee demanded whether any death
may be ſaid to be <hi>naturall,</hi> ſeeing it deſtroyes life,
which is according to nature, <hi>Quae cupit ſuum eſſe,</hi>
which delights ſtill to be?</p>
            <p>I anſwere,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> a thing is ſaid to be naturall more waies
then one.<note place="margin">How death may be ſaid to be naturall.</note> Death being ſimply in it ſelfe conſidered
is not naturall: but foraſmuch as that which doth
neceſſarily follow the nature of a thing, and hath
the beginning or ground of his exiſtence therein,
to which that, which is violent, is oppoſed, is called
naturall,<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
               <hi>That death</hi> therefore, which followes the
conſumption and diſſipation of the <hi>naturall</hi> moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
by the <hi>naturall</hi> heat, ſeeing it comes of cauſes,
which are <hi>within</hi> the bodie, in that reſpect is called
<hi>naturall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Quest. 2.</note> it may againe be asked, what naturall
death is <hi>properly?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sol.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwere,<note place="margin">Naturall death deſcribed.</note> that <hi>properly</hi> is called naturall death,
when naturall heat faileth, by reaſon that the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
is dried vp by it, as a lamp goeth out when the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:693:39"/>
oyle is ſpent. And this death is with much eaſe,
and with little or no paine, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writeth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Queſt. 3.</note> it may be asked, what violent death is
properly?</p>
            <p>I anſwere,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that is called <hi>violent</hi> death, when by
accident, eyther the moyſture is drawne out of the
bodie,<note place="margin">What violent death is.</note> or the heat extinguiſhed by ſome inward or
outward violence and oppreſſion. <hi>Inward</hi> violence
is by poyſon,<note place="margin">A Simile.</note> gluttonie, drunkenneſſe, or ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
as when a lampe is drowned in the oyle. <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
violence is when a man is ſtrangled with an
halter, as a fire ſodainely choaked with ſome huge
heape of earth,<note place="margin">A Simile.</note> or aſhes, throwne vpon it; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
moe oppreſſions of life there are of this kinde.
So that, taking violent death in this largeneſſe of
ſenſe, it will appeare that <hi>fewe die a naturall
death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Queſt. 4.</note> it may be demanded, when a man doth
die, or when the ſoule doth leaue the bodie?</p>
            <p>I anſwere,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> then when there is a defect of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of the ſoule, whereby life is prolonged.
When the bodie is become vnfit for the ſoule to
worke with, then doth the ſoule forſake the bodie,
which it loues moſt dearely,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and not before. Death
comes not by the impatience &amp; fickle-mindedneſſe
of the ſoule, but by reaſon of the impotencie and
vnaptneſſe of the bodie;<note place="margin">A Simile.</note> as a workeman leaues his
toole, when it is become altogether vnfit for his vſe.</p>
            <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">Quaeſt. 5.</note> but whence is it that one man dieth ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
then another, that nature failes in one ſooner
then in another?</p>
            <p>I anſwere,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> the higheſt reaſon hereof is Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:693:40"/>
but the Principall naturall cauſe of the length
of life is firſt a fit compoſition of heat and moyſture
in the ſinewes,<note place="margin">The cauſes of long life.</note> marrow, ſpirits, &amp;c. And ſecondly,
the long and fortunate continuance of this good
temper, which being interrupted by diſeaſes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
oppreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s death neceſſarily follows, &amp; a mans
life is ended, as an artificers occupation then endes

            </p>
            <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">Queſt. 6.</note> whether natural death be by no meanes to
be auoided (if a man eſcape violence) ſeeing that
the radicall humour, as it waſteth, may be repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by nurriture, and therewith maintained?</p>
            <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that the radicall humour may indeed
by nouriſhment be daily renewed, yet that reſtored
moyſture is not ſo good, as that which was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
of the beate:<note place="margin">This anſwere belongs to the ſtate of mans fall by ſinne.</note> it is not ſo pure as that, which
was of the ſeed: it is not ſo wel wrought and excoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as the ſeed, neither ſo exactly mingled and atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated.
Seeing therefore that which is reſtored, is
not ſo pure as that, that was waſted, the heat for
want of conuenient matter to feed vpon at length
is diſſipated and put out. Neyther is the quantitie
of the humour reſtored ſo much to be reſpected,<note place="margin">Note.</note> as

            <p>I anſwere,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> when a beaſt dies, his ſoule doth va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
and is diſſolued: but when a man dies,
his ſoule ſtill continues. For the ſoule of a beaſt is

               <hi>one, which is not couered with fleſh: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

eyther the perſon or the life is to be vnderſtood, or
ſuch a death as is not the extinction and deletion
of the ſoule, but her ſeparation from God, who is
her comfort and contentment.<note place="margin">2. Difference.</note> Secondly, the death
of a man is wont to be with much comfort, or elſe
horror of hell it ſelfe, our conſcience telling vs of
another ſtate after death: but beaſts, becauſe they
haue no conſcience, no hope of heauen, nor feare
of hell, are not therefore ſubiect to ſuch paſſions,
eyther of ioy or ſorrow.<note place="margin">3. Difference.</note> Thirdly, when beaſts die,
they die for euer: but though death deuoure vs, as
the <hi>Whale</hi> did <hi>Ionas,</hi> and binde vs as the <hi>Philistins</hi>

bands and ſnares of death ſhall be broken, and we
ſhall be deliuered. For it is moſt true which Saint
<hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">In Cant. ſer. 107</note> 
               <hi>There is a threefold ſtate of holy

condition of wicked ſoules: the firſt is in their

            <p>Eightly, Whether may death be ſaid to be euill?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thales</hi> ſaid that death was no more euill,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> then a

life and death one is not better then another:
for that is counted the better, which is deſired. If
therfore I ſhould haſten mine owne death, it might
be well ſuppoſed that I doe account death better

them. But to paſſe by this conceit of <hi>Thales:</hi> that

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> How death is an euill, and how not.</note> and as it is an
effect of ſinne, is euill: for if life bee good, then
death muſt needes be euill: and if it bee an euill to

brought into affliction in hell, and hee altogether
depriued of thoſe benefits of life, which hee did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

better to die the child of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third death Spirituall of the Godly is,
whereby the world is crucifyed or dead to them,

            </p>
            <p>The World is dead to them,<note place="margin">When the World is dead to a man.</note> when as they dote
not on the world, but contemne all worldly things,
and account them as nothing in compariſon of
Chriſt <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and his benefits. This death is very
needfull: for he, that liues to the World, liues not
vnto GOD: and hee liues to the World, to whom
the World is not dead, but who doteth on the
World, ſhall periſh with the World: hee that liues
not to God in this life, ſhall not liue with God in

            <p>Godly men are ſaid to bee dead to the World,<note place="margin">How a man is ſaid to be dead to the World.</note>
when the World coutemnes them, hates them,
perſecutes them, and wiſheth (as it were) to be rid
of them. This kind of death is the ordinarie por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Godly. For they being not of the
World,<note place="margin">Iob. 15. 19. &amp; 16. 3.</note> but of God, whom the World knowes not,
and being but as <hi>Forrainers</hi> and <hi>Strangers,</hi> it is no

is no wonder though wicked Worldlings beat
them, bite them, barke at them, and flie at their

            <p>The third kind of death is called <hi>Eternall</hi> death,<note place="margin">Reu. 22. 8</note>
or the ſecond death,<note place="margin">What eternall death is.</note> which is the Separation of the

from the comfortable preſence of GOD,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 1. 9.</note> in hell

            </p>
            <p>Now God doth not ordaine and inflict death
for it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> as if he did delight in death and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:

crammed himſelfe too full, as hee got vp his horſe,
he burſt a veine, whereat flowed ſuch ſtore of bloud
that hee died. Theſe and many more ſuch are the
iudgements of GOD vpon Sinners and are in him
moſt iuſt. For firſt his will is the rule of iuſtice: but
theſe puniſhments hee doth will and ordaine (for
there is no euill in the Citie, no puniſhment, which
hee ſendeth not): therefore theſe muſt needes bee

what he will. But ſometimes he is pleaſed to ſmite

The Eaſterne Emperour <hi>Zeno</hi> was ſuch a loathſome
<hi>Belly-god,</hi> that his wife <hi>Ariadne</hi> fell to loath bim,
and on a day as he lay ſenſeleſſe (as his manner was)
through gurmandizing, ſhe got him into a tombe,
and throwing a great ſtone vpon it, pined him to
death. This was a iuſt puniſhment of a glutton, in
regard of God, though vniuſt in reſpect of her, that
did it. This then I ſay, If a man out of the ſtate of
grace be murthered, or die by an iniuſt ſentence of
the Magiſtrate, yet he is not therfore deliuered from
the ſentence of God, but muſt ſuffer as he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued;
that his vntimely death being alſo long of

within the ſtate of grace may die not deſeruing it of
man, as <hi>Archelaus</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who was

death may be iuſtly puniſhed in their murtherers (as
<hi>Cratenas</hi> was himſelfe alſo after murthered) and yet
death deſerued at the hands of God. For though
God and the murtherer agree in the act, yet not in
their grounds and ends: God therefore purſues the
murtherer, becauſe he violates his law ſo ſouly, he
not bidding him,<note place="margin">Why God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he doth permit.</note> but forbidding him to murther,
and putting no malice into his heart to make him

ſhort to ſaue, his eare is neuer too dull to heare:
neither doth any man know what the purpoſe of
God is. <hi>Paul</hi> was as bad as one God; did call him, &amp;
ſo was the Thiefe, that was called on the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, a man may be in the ſtate of grace, and
yet ſometimes feele no comfort,<note place="margin">Note.</note> no working of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:693:63"/>
Spirit, euen as a man in a ſwoone or ſleepe doth
liue, though hee knowes not ſo much, and a child
(we ſee) liues before it knowes it liues.</p>
               <p>I ſay finally, what though thou feelſt no grace?
what though thou beeſt nothing ſo good, as thou
ſhouldſt bee? Wilt thou therefore deſpaire? Is
there no way with thee, thinkeſt thou, but death?
Wrong not thy ſelfe: where is thy faith? wee liue
by faith, and not by feeling. It is not thy graces in
thee, that doth ſaue thee, it is Gods grace in Chriſt
vnto thee, of which grace thou maiſt bee partaker,
though thou feeleſt no graces in thee.<note place="margin">Note.</note> And know
this, that it is not ſo much thy loue of God and thy
knowledge of Chriſt, which is ſauing to thee, as
Gods loue, whereby hee loues thee, as Chriſts
knowledge, whereby he knowes thee, who knowes
and loues thee before and better,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4. 10. 19.</note> then thou canſt
know and loue him. And certainely, if thou doeſt
earneſtly ſeeke and affect his grace, thou haſt grace:
for it is a grace to deſire grace: and it argues that,
if thou doeſt truely ſeeke Chriſt for Chriſt, thou
haſt alreadie found Chriſt, or rather that Chriſt hath
found thee. And finally, what if thou findeſt not all
the workes of the Spirit in thee?<note place="margin">Note.</note> If thou findeſt but
one, there is reaſon of quietneſſe. If feeling no
grace, thou doſt feelingly deſire and couet grace,
one drop of grace, this is a grace, a voice of the
Spirit, and there is reaſon of comfort, and why thou
ſhouldſt not be diſmaide. One greene leafe vpon a
Tree will ſhew the tree is aliue, one ſigh doth argue
life.<note place="margin">Note.</note> This then I ſay, if out of the want of Chriſt
thou deſireſt Chriſt, if feeling the want of the Spirit
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:693:63"/>
thou doeſt deſire and pant after the Spirit, aſſure
thy ſelfe thou art not voide of grace, Chriſt doth
loue thee, the Spirit hath taken poſſeſsion of thee:
ſtand not in thine owne light, bee not ouer wiſe,
but bee ruled, and remember that Chriſt
cries,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28.</note>
