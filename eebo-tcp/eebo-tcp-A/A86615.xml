            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I Will not look back and rake the aſhes of antiquity ſo far,
as to ſpeak of the <hi>ſociall</hi> warre they entred into with the
ancient <hi>Brittaines</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> againſt the Engliſh, when they
began to take firſt firme footing in <hi>England.</hi> Nor, of that ſo
famous battell 'twixt <hi>Athelſtan</hi> and them, at which time
they had a great Army of <hi>Danes</hi> joyned with them; when
being above twice more in number then the Engliſh, King
<hi>Athelſtan</hi> carried away a compleat victory by a kind of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blow
(<hi>Parthian</hi> like) For the two Armies being ready to
joyne, the Engliſh made ſemblance to fly away, leaving all
their baggage behinde, and much matter for booty, which as
the Scots and Danes were ſharing, the Engliſh ſuddenly
wheeled about by the advantage of a woody hill, and finding
them in diſarray, and the Souldiers laden with pillage, they
ruſhed upon them with that reſolution, that above fourty
thouſand of them fell, and as <hi>Buchanan</hi> their Prime Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger
recordeth, the flower of their Nobility periſhed that
day.</p>
               <p>But I intend not to involve my diſcourſe in theſe miſtie
times, but will take my riſe from the Norman Conqueſt, for
indeed the Hiſtorie of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> being over clouded with
ſo many incertainties, caſteth but a dim light before thoſe
times, whereas ſince, ſhe ſhines with ſuch a luſtre, that what
ſtands upon Record may be aſſerted for cleere and undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
truth.</p>
               <p>At that time, I mean the time of the Conqueſt, <hi>Scotland</hi>
did <hi>England</hi> a very good office by preſerving the Engliſh
blood-royall (which not long after returned to the Crowne
in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond) but it was caſually: For Prince <hi>Edgar</hi>
and his Mother, with his two Siſters, intending to goe for
<hi>Denmarke,</hi> (ſome ſay for <hi>Hungarie</hi>) and being by diſtreſſe of
weather driven upon the Scottiſh coaſts, they were hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

time civility with the Engliſh tongue took firſt footing in
the Scottiſh Court, as the French did amongſt the Engliſh.</p>

               <p>Hereupon the Earl of <hi>Norfolke</hi> was ſent with 20000. men, who for

pleaſed God to give the Engliſh a compleat victory (and victories

                  <hi>invitations,</hi> by ſome ſpurious and moſt unworthy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous
Engliſhmen, who from a long time had plotted the
bringing of them in, and it was the moſt pernicious and baſeſt
treaſon that ever was practis'd againſt poore <hi>England:</hi> But to give
a full and ſatisfactory relation of this Warre, I will deduce the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines
from the beginning.</p>
               <p>Before this unlucky ſtorme fell 'twixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> there
were certain <hi>clowds</hi> iſſuing from the vapors of divers diſcontented
braines, plainly diſcern'd to hover up and downe a long time in
both Kingdomes ſpecially in that Northerne Region: The firſt
which appeard was, when ſome yeers after his Majeſties acceſſe
to the crowne, there was an act of revocation paſſed, where ſome
things which had inſenſibly ſlipped away from the crowne, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things which were illegally ſnatch'd from the church were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd,
and reannex'd to both; which lighting upon ſome of the great
ones, they were over heard to murmure though this was done with
as much moderation as poſſibly could be, and by the mature advice
of the Counſell of ſtate there, with the free opinion of the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved'ſt
Lawyers of that Kingdome, and from hence iſſued the firſt
ſymptome of diſcontentment.</p>
               <p>Not long after his Majeſty being inform'd of the meane and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
condition of the Miniſters of that Kingdome, which have the
charge of the conſcience, and ſervice of God, and make up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
part of the free borne ſubjects; his Majeſty underſtanding
what poore pittances they receiv'd for their ſubſiſtence, and for
thoſe ſmall ſtipends alſo, or rather almes of benevolence, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
upon the pleaſure of the Laiks, His Majeſty by a ſpeciall
Commiſſion to that end found away to augment and acertain that
allowance, and free them from that ſlaviſh kind of clientele and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency
they had upon the ſeculars; Whence may bee inferr'd
what monſters of ingratitude thoſe men ſhew'd themſelves to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
by exaſperating and poyſoning the hearts of the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their ſoveraigne in their virulent and ſeditious preachments, and
inviting them to armes. Not long after, when the poore husbandman
and owners of corn were bound to pay tithes to lay perſons call'd
there the Lords of the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rection, were much incommodated by them, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe
they could not take in their corn till the Parſon had fetch'd away
his tithe, who ſometimes to ſhew his power or ſpleen peradventure
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:111941:9"/>
would defer of purpoſe the taking in thereof, whereby the whole crop,
by not taking advantage of the weather, would oftimes ſuffer: His
Majeſty for the redreſſe of this grievance, appointed Commiſſioners
who found a way to purchaſe thoſe tiths, and bring the impropriators
to take a pecuniary certain rent counterveylable unto them: Hereupon
the Laie Lords and Gentlemen finding that the reſpect and dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
wherby the Miniſters and owners of corn were formerly oblig'd unto
them to be hereby leſſen'd did tacitly diſcover much animoſity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure:
Moreover his Majeſtie when he went thither to be crown'd
having conferr'd honours upon ſome whom he had found induſtrious
to promote his ſervice, envie (which is alwayes the canker of honour)
began to raign among divers of them which did turne viſibly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to diſcontentments.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the conceal'd and private grounds, now the open and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed
cauſes were the introduction of our Liturgy, the booke of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
Ordination and Conſecration with the high Commiſſion Court
among them: and it hath bin found ſince that thoſe things were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd
by the cunning of thoſe diſcontented ſpirits, that thereby there
might be ſome grounds to ſuſcitat the people to riſe, which plot of
theirs tooke effect.</p>
               <p>Adde hereunto that after the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> death divers Scots
Commanders came over, and made a floriſh in our Engliſh Court, but
being Souldiers of fortune, and finding no trading here, they went to
<hi>Scotland</hi> and joyn'd counſells with thoſe diſcontented ſpirits to beget
a warre that they might be in action.</p>
               <p>The only pretence they tooke for their riſing then, was our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayer Booke, hereupon his Majeſty ſent a Proclamation to be
publiſhed wherein he declar'd that 'twas not his purpoſe to preſſe the
practiſe of that book upon any ones conſcience, therefore he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to diſcharge them from the uſe and exerciſe of it, and to aboliſh
all acts that tended to that end and that all things ſhould be in <hi>ſtatu
quo prius.</hi> But this would not ſuffice, for they went on to fiſh in theſe
troubled waters, having a deſigne to drayne all the Epiſcopall <hi>ſees</hi> in
the Kingdome, and turn them to laic land: Hereupon they entred
into a holy league which they term'd Covenant, without his
Majeſties privity, and this was point blank againſt an Act of
Parliament 1585. which utterly prohibits all leagues, covenants
or bands whatſoever without the Kings conſent: Hereupon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of an Army was raiſed, and one <hi>Leſley</hi> was made Generall,
ſo they marched to <hi>Dunce</hi> Hill within five miles of <hi>Berwicke</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:111941:9"/>
Where the rendevouz was: They gave out they came with
a petition to his Majeſty, though they brought it upon the
pikes point. There were many noble Engliſh hearts which
ſwell'd high at this inſolency of the <hi>Scot,</hi> and therefore went
with wonderfull alacrity to attend his Majeſty to <hi>Barwick,</hi> but
there were others who were luke-warme in the buſineſſe, and
thoſe of the greateſt Ones, which the <hi>Scots</hi> knew wel enough,
for there was nothing tranſ-acted or ſaid in the Kings Cabinet
Counſell or Bed-chamber, but there was intelligence given
them: Hereupon a pacification was ſhuffled up, and ſo both
the Armyes were diſperſed. The King being returned to
<hi>London,</hi> grew more and more ſenſible of theſe indignities of
his Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and having called a Parliament ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
for that purpoſe in <hi>England,</hi> ſome of the cheife Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
thereof were ſo intoxicated by the <hi>Scot,</hi> that they did not
only not reſent this bravado he had done to <hi>England,</hi> but ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to approve of his actions. His Majeſty finding the pulſe of
his Parliament beat ſo faintly for enabling him to vindicate
theſe indignities upon the <hi>Scot,</hi> diſſolv'd it, and propos'd the
buſineſſe to his privy Counſell, who not only advis'd him, but
ſupplyed him with noble ſummes to repaire his honour by
War; hereupon the former Forces were rallied, and made up
into the body of an Army: The <hi>Scot</hi> was not idle all this while,
but reunited his former Army, whereof there was a good part
undisbanded (contrary to Article) and chooſing rather to
make another Country the theater of the War then his own,
he got over the <hi>Tweed,</hi> and found all paſſages open, and as it
were made for him al the way til he came to the <hi>Tine,</hi> &amp; though
there were conſiderable Troupes of Horſe and Foot at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi>
yet they never offer'd as much as to face him all the way;
at <hi>Nea<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>burg</hi> there was a ſmall diſpute, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Infantry
would not fight, ſo <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> gates flew open to her inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Enemy, without any reſiſtance at all, where he had more
Freinds than Foes, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Generals rather then to be
put to unworthy compoſitions retired in diſorder: Whither
this happened either by ſecret faction, or want of affection in
in the Souldier, or by the faults of the Generall, I will not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:111941:10"/>
determine; but ſure I am it was diſhonourable enough to poor
<hi>England,</hi> who was bought and ſold in this expedition. This
was the firſt entrance the <hi>Scot</hi> made into <hi>England</hi> ſince theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Wars; but this invitation was private, the laſt was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
being voted by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commons, and they ruſh'd in,
in the dead of Winter; notwithſtanding that his Majeſty had
taken a toylſome journey not long before to ſit amongſt them
himſelfe in Parliament, where he condeſcended to every thing
they could imaginably deſire, and they acknowledging his
unparaleld Grace, deſired that Act to be reviv'd whereby it was
Treaſon in the higheſt degree that could be, for any of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of <hi>Scotland</hi> of what degree or condition foever to levy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Mlitary Forces without his Majeſties expreſſe Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and this they did to expreſſe their gratitude: as they ſaid.
But the yeare came ſcarce about before they had moulded ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Army, not only without, but expreſly againſt his Royall
Commiſſion, and Counter-command, and would intrude
themſelves to be Vmpires twixt him and his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects
whither he would or no; ſo in they ruſh'd againe in dead of
Winter, and for Martiall exployts, the little credit they got
by ſtorming of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> was nothing countervaylable to
that which they loſt before <hi>Hereford,</hi> where the <hi>Welſh-men</hi>
bang'd them to ſome purpoſe from before the town, and made
their Generall to truſſe up his pack and away, ſending him a
fat Sow with Pigs after her, and a blew bonnet upon her head
for his break-faſt.</p>

            <p>THus have I run over, and faithfull related by collation of
many Authors, with their concurrent teſtimonies, thoſe
trave<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of warre which have paſſed betwixt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Scots</hi> ſince the Conqueſt, having omitted many circumſtances
which might have tended further to the glory of <hi>England,</hi> to
avoyd prolixity, for I intended at firſt that this Diſcourſe
ſhould be like a skein of Silke wound up cloſe upon a ſmall bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
which a freer hand might put upon the loom and draw
to a large peice.</p>
            <p>Any man of a clear and unpaſſionate judgement will hence
inferre that the <hi>Scots</hi> have been alwayes farre inferiour to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> (except in theſe latter unlucky Invaſions) in poynt of
true proweſſe, and National Power: In ſome examples you may
finde how the <hi>Engliſh</hi> carryed away more Captives then they
were Souldiers of themſelves, driving them as ſheep before
them moſt of the Battails they fought were in <hi>Scotland</hi> herſelf,
when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had been tir'd with long marches, over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth,
and ſtrange places, being ignorant of the advenues, and
advantages of them.</p>
            <p>Indeed in <hi>Edward</hi> the Seconds reign they got three battails,
and one at the fag end of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. wherein Sir <hi>Ralph Evers</hi>
was ſlaine, but it was more by ſtratagem than ſtrength, and
beſides the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might have been ſaid to have fought rather
againſt the Heaven and Elements then men, having Wind and
Sun in their faces, but that might have been tearmed more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a petty defeat then Victory, for there fell not above 200.
But what uſe did the <hi>Scot</hi> ever make of thoſe Victories, though
the North parts have many places of faſtneſſe, and tenable, yet
I reade not of any place they kept except <hi>Barwick;</hi> all the reſt
of their Warres were but tumultuary ſallies, and predatory
devaſtations, and pilfrings. But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have taken foure
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:111941:11"/>
of their Kings captives, killed two of them in the Field, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away their Crown (which they give out to be greater and
more weighty than that of <hi>England</hi>) their <hi>Ragman-Roll,</hi> the
<hi>Blacke Croſſe,</hi> with other inſtruments of Soveraignty, and did
ſundry acts equivalent to a Conqueſt. They pierced the very
heart of the Kingdom, and the <hi>Scot</hi> may be ſaid to have onely
trod upon <hi>Englands</hi> toe, for they never came farther than the
Walls of <hi>Yorke,</hi> till the reigne of this thing that cals it ſelfe
Parliament. But if one ſhould aske me why the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made ſuch firme Invaſions from time to time into the
very bowels of <hi>Scotland,</hi> did not reduce it to a vaſſallage and
perfect provincial obedience, as well as to make their Kings
fuedetary in which ſtate they continued towards <hi>England</hi> near
upon five hundred yeares?</p>
            <p>My Anſwer ſhall be the ſame that <hi>Suetonius</hi> gives in behalfe
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who notwithſtanding they lorded over the
reſt of <hi>Brittany</hi> four hundred and odde yeares, yet they never
went about to conquer <hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe they knew the prize
would not have countervail'd the paines, by reaſon of the
craggineſſe of the Countrey and incommodity of habitation,
therefore they thought it enough that <hi>Adrians</hi> Wall which
extended from <hi>Tinmouth</hi> to <hi>Solway Frith,</hi> near upon fourſcore
miles ſhould be the Weſterne Bounds of their Empire.</p>
            <p>Out of the precedent Examples we may alſo gather, that
the <hi>Scot</hi> hath been alwayes of a genius apt and forward to ſtir
againſt <hi>England</hi> upon any the leaſt occaſion. For of thoſe
five and twenty Kings and Queens that have been ſince the
Conqueſt, onely five have been free of their inſolencies: yet
did <hi>England</hi> never begin with them till ſhe was juſtly provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
thereunto, nor could Alliances nor Leagues, or any tyes
of Treaty confirmed by Solemne Oathes (which are thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Bonds that paſſe 'twixt God and the Soul) detain the
<hi>Scotiſh</hi> Kings from puzling and diſturbing <hi>England,</hi> when her
Kings were moſt diſtracted in Warres with <hi>France,</hi> and the
better halfe of her ſtrength imployed abroad, ſo that the <hi>Scots</hi>
may be ſaid to have been from time to time as goads in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
ſides, or a thorne in her toe; and <hi>France</hi> leaguing meerly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:111941:11"/>
for his own advantage with them, may be ſaid to have made
uſe of <hi>Scotland</hi> as the Fox did of the Cats foot to pull the
Apple out of the Fire for his own eating: yet for all theſe
eager and irrefragable Combinations 'twixt the <hi>French</hi> and
Her againſt <hi>England, England</hi> ever bore up, and made her
party good, and that in a victorious way againſt both, and for
<hi>Scotland</hi> ſhe may be ſaid to have given Her blowes for phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips.</p>
            <p>But it ſeemes that <hi>Italian</hi> was well verſed in the <hi>Scotiſhmens</hi>
humours, who underſtanding of the late Vnion between the
two Kingdomes, ſaid that <hi>England</hi> had got no great catch by
the addition of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhe had onely got a Wolfe by the
eares, who muſt be held very faſt, elſe he will run away to
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some there are who much magnifie and cry up the <hi>Scots</hi> of
late yeares, for great Souldiers, tacitly derogating thereby
from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as if they ſhould ſtand in ſome apprehenſion
of fear of them; but I cannot imagine upon what grounds
they ſhould do it; true it is, that ſince the Revolt of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
and theſe ſeventy yeares Tumults in the Netherlands,
ſome of them are much improved in the Art of Warre, and
knowledge of Armes from what they were; they have alſo
puſhed on their Fortunes in the Warres of <hi>Denmarke, Sweden,
Ruſſia, Germany;</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> for <hi>Poland,</hi> their Profeſſion
there is to truſſe Packes rather than traile Pikes. By reaſon of
the quality of the Soile and Clime they have tough and hardy
bodies, and it may adde to their courage that they venture
for a better Countrey, in regard they cannot go to a worſe
than their own. Now it muſt be granted that the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
wherewith Nature doth recompence a mountainous
and ſterile Soile above a luxurious and eaſie, is, to make it
produce ſuffering bodies; which made the <hi>Romans</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

yeares conquering of <hi>Spain,</hi> when they were but nine
conquering of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, 'tis anſwered, that if the <hi>Scot</hi> hath made
ſalſies abroad into other Countries of late yeares, the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
alſo have done the like, and are in ſome places in greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:111941:12"/>
as in the Low-countries, where at this day they treble
the number of the <hi>Scots,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Netherlands</hi> may be ſaid
to be a Military Yard for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as well: and he that is
never ſo little verſed in the Moderne Stories will finde that
the Foundation of that State hath been chiefly cimented with
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Bloud.</p>
            <p>For the Eaſt countrey, 'tis true, there are many able <hi>Scots</hi>
Leaders, and there are alſo many <hi>Engliſh</hi> of abilities and fame.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond, if the <hi>Scots</hi> are a hardy People becauſe of their
cragges and mountaines: I anſwer that the <hi>Welch</hi> and <hi>Corniſh</hi>
with them that dwell about the Northerne Alpes in <hi>England,</hi>
are as mountainous as they, and I believe have as ſuffering
and ſturdy bodies; which makes the world yield it for a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime,
that no Prince of Chriſtendom hath a better choice to
make Souldiers of than the King of Great <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will conclude with certain Propheſies the</hi> Scots <hi>do much
ſpeak of. The firſt is out of</hi> Polychronicon, <hi>where the Authour</hi>
Ranulphus Cistrenſis <hi>relates the words of a certain Anchorite
who lived in King</hi> Egelbert <hi>his time, now near upon</hi> 900.
<hi>yeares ago, and the words are theſe,</hi> Angli, quia proditioni,

deinde per Normanos, tertiùm per Scotos, quos viliſſimos ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent,
conterentur: varium erit ſaeculum, &amp; varietas mentium,
deſignabitur varietate vestium. 1. The <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> for that they
wonneth themſelves to treaſon, to drunkenneſſe, and wretchleſneſſe
of Gods Houſe; firſt by the <hi>Danes,</hi> then by the <hi>Normans,</hi> and
laſtly by the <hi>Scots,</hi> whom they holden leaſt in eſteem, ſhallen be
overthrown, 'twill be an inſtable Age, and the variableneſſe of

            <p>The <hi>Daniſh</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt have happened ſince,
and the third is to follow in the ſame manner, ſay they, not
by Succeſſion, but by the Sword.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond are thoſe Propheſies of <hi>Merlin,</hi> who much
tampers with the ſingle Lion, and of the Feats that he ſhould
do, which they ſay, is meant of their Lion within a double
Treaſure Rampant, <hi>Mars</hi> counterflowred.</p>
            <p>3. Then come they to the Stone wherein they ſay, the Fortune
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:111941:12"/>
of their Kingdom is fixed, which hath lain in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
now near upon five hundred yeares.</p>

            <p>Which they interpret alſo muſt be by the Sword not by Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>

which they ſay, ſhall be at laſt the Seat of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire,
to be erected there by them.</p>
            <p>But I am none of thoſe that afford much faith to rambling
Propheſies, but will conclude with a late much cried up
Wiſe-man, (Sir <hi>W. R.</hi>) that <hi>Propheſies are as ſeeds ſown in the
