            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>FIFTEEN SERMONS PREACH'D upon Several Occasions, AND ON <hi>Various Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By JOHN COCKBURN, D. D.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LONDON,</hi> Printed by <hi>I. L.</hi> for <hi>William Keblewhite</hi> at the <hi>Swan</hi> in St. <hi>Paul's Church-yard,</hi> MDCXCVII.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>PRefaces are employed commonly to give the Reasons for publishing the Book: And it doth seem needful, that what is prefixed to this should be of that Nature, seeing there is no want of Sermons; the Booksellers Shops are already filled with them, and they lie upon their hand as a heavy Drug. And when there are not only many Sermons, but also Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of them, preached by known, learned, and able Men, it may seem strange to some, what Reason or Encouragement there could be for Printing these, which are liable to divers Prejudices, some drawn from the Author, and others less reasonable and just, upon the account of his Country and its Dialect. But Prefaces stuff'd with Reasons and Excuses for Writing and Printing are, methinks, so fulsome and useless, that rather than write such an one, tho' it be common, I will leave the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive to guess what they please, and will run the hazard of a Censure for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so.</p>
            <p>A Book becomes not either more intelligible, or more useful, by knowing the private Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb facs="tcp:93003:3"/>
of the Author for publishing it; and therefore an Enquiry into them is to very little Purpose, and the Knowledge of them in very few cases material. It was long since observed, by the wisest of Men, That of making of Books there is no end, which slews, that Mankind in this as well as in other things, has been always much the same in all Ages and Parts of the World. This humour of Writing, which flowed from different Motives, tho' it has had several ill Consequences, yet it has had also this good Effect, That by this means Truth has been preserved and propagated; and many useful Instructive things amongst the Ancients conveyed down to us. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in some thing relative to the Subject of the following Sermons, if it were not for the Writings of those in former times, how could we prove the Antiquity, and Constant, Catholick, and Uninterrupted Tradition, of the most material Points of our Holy Religion, which some have the Impudence to brand with Novelty?</p>
            <p>I will both own, and stedfastly maintain the Doctrine of these Sermons, as Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox and necessary to be believed: But I will not promise that all the Words and Phrases are currant in this Nation. I cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Dialect of my Country, where I
<pb facs="tcp:93003:3"/>
have lived so long: And they must be very peevish who will make a Quarrel on that Head. Neither did all the Grecian Authors write by the Standard of <hi>Athens,</hi> nor the Roman by that of <hi>Rome:</hi> There are interspersed in the Writings of the best, particular Idioms of their native Soil, which yet is no matter of Prejudice to the Wise and Iudicious, nor doth it lessen the Esteem which is due to them. The Idioms of a Language ought to have the Reception of Money amongst Merchants and Traders, which they do not reject, though it bear a foreign Stamp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it be good in it self, and of full weight: So neither ought the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of another Country to be despised, if it be Expressive and Emphatical.</p>
            <p>Indeed, when things are well expressed, they are heard and read with Delight: But there always ought to be a greater Regard to the Sence and Meaning than to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; which yet cannot be complained of justly, if it clearly deliver the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of him who speaks or writes, for then the true end of Speaking or Writing is observed. And I am of Opinion, that he who understands his Subject thorowly, and has a clear and deep Sense of it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be straitned much how to express him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self clearly and convincingly. Obscurity
<pb facs="tcp:93003:4"/>
(except when it proceeds from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity of the Matter) generally is a shrewd Sign of confused and indigested Notions: I say generally only, because of the Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which may be given in the learned Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> and other eminent Men: Which Defect in them perhaps was occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their great Retirement, and the confining their Thoughts altogether to one particular Study. For Conversation and Acquaintance with divers Subjects are a great help to Discourse, furnishing one not only with Copiousness of Words and received Expressions, but also with various Similitudes and Allusions for clearing his Sentiments, without which one can never be very eloquent.</p>
            <p>The Stile and Eloquence proper for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are not so easy as most imagine, nor have we many perfect Examples of them, and therefore if I fall somewhat short, it is no great wonder. It is hard to observe at once, all the Rules and Measures which are necessary in every Sermon, to gain it a just Commendation, that is, to make it useful and edifying to all who hear it.</p>
            <p>The Design of Preaching, is to teach the Truths of God, the great Mysteries of the Gospel, the wonderful Contrivance of Divine Wisdom for Man's Salvation,
<pb facs="tcp:93003:4"/>
and all that is necessary to it: And he who preacheth, that he may answer this Design, ought to express his own Zeal, Passion, and Concernment for these things; and he should so frame his Discourse, that it may be suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Gravity, Sublimity, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the Subject, and so accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the different Capacities of the Hearers, that at the same time it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct, convince, and perswade both the meaner and better sort. He who speaketh only to the learned, the wise, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that is, he whose Language and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions such only can understand, forgetteth that he ought to preach the Gospel to the poor, and he does exclude from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven those who were first called to it: Again, he who has no regard to the nice and delicate Understandings of the learned, of Persons of good Sence and Quality, and only uttereth mean, sorry, and coarse things, he begets a Prejudice in them, and so becomes the unhappy occasion of their not entering into Life, because of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Means that are necessary to it. Ill daub'd Sign-posts can never allure Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Iudgment and Skill; they are only taken and pleased with what expresses Art, Beauty and Life, and what doth shew these, will also be admired and preferred
<pb facs="tcp:93003:5"/>
by those of the least Skill. The Christian Religion, which is the only proper Subject of Sermons, is so perfect, so just and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, so august and venerable, that a due Representation of it, deserves the most respectful Attention of the greatest in the World, either for Learning, Wisdom, or Quality: And yet the same Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be intelligible by those who have any Degree of Understanding and common Sence. Indeed, there are Mysteries in our Religion, which the wisest cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; but as we are only required to believe them, so the Truth and Certainty of them is most evident: There are others also which are inexhaustible, that is, the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est search cannot get to the bottom of them, and the more one searches into them, he still doth find the more matter of Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but then these are like deep Wells, which are also top-full, so that the weakest may draw good, pleasant, and refreshing water out of them. Our Religion was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd for all, and it is fitted for all sorts of Men: And seeing the Auditories, either in City or Country are neither all of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er sort, nor yet all of the better, but mixt with both, therefore the Art of preaching is to captivate both to the Obedience of the Faith; and who hath this Art is truly Master of his Profession.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93003:5"/>The Subject of most of the following Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons is peculiarly Christian, that is, the things treated of in them are only delivered by the Gospel. We should study these at all times, but rather now, considering the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of Atheists, Deists, and others, who endeavour to dwindle away the Christian into Natural Religion, by divesting it of its Peculiarities, which, to them who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, are not only admirable and excellent, but also matter of greater Comfort and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction than what is possible to be drawn from Nature, Reason, or any thing else. As these things are only discovered by the Gospel, so they are only discernible by the Light of it: Philosophy and humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son do but obscure them: And certainly nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Truth of them had been so much questioned, nor had there been so many He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Notions about them, if some arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and presumptuous Men, both in this and former Ages, had not endeavoured to accommodate them to the several Systems of that vain Philosophy which they espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Philosophy and humane Reason are not proper Standards for divine Wisdom, by those we can never know the Perfection of this; and yet the Christian Religion does not require us to lay aside our Reason, but rather calls us to use it: Nor can our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb facs="tcp:93003:6"/>
be improved by any Study or Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so much as by that of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>How I have handled those important Points of Christianity, which are the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of some of the following Sermons, I leave others to judge. The required Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of a Sermon, and the confining my self to the particular Argument of the Text, have caused me to give only short hints of that which may satisfie any reasonable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son about these Matters: But what is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, shall be made up, and more fully extended in the third part of the Enquiry into the Nature, Necessity, and Evidence of Christian Faith.</p>
            <p>This, which I promised before, would have been published before this time, if some unforeseen Accidents had not hindred it: And it must yet be delayed a little long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to give way to another Task which is imposed upon me, which is thought fit to have the Preference, not because the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is better or more important, but because it is believed that none has undertaken it. He, who gave an Advertisement of this, is (notwithstanding of his Complement) more capable of performing it, as appears by his accurate and laborious Treatise, in<note place="margin">Snake in the Grass.</note> which he hath fully discovered the gross Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Delusions of the QUAKERS,
<pb facs="tcp:93003:6"/>
which were hitherto much neglected and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle enquired into: And that was one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why they spread so fast: But I hope in God they shall spread no more: And that his Labours shall be blessed to be the happy Means both of preventing their further Growth, and also of drawing off some of the more honest of that deluded Party: And I have good Reason to hope for this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was engaged into this Affair by a visible Providence. The Province given me is somewhat of the same Nature, to lay open the Errours and Delusions of another Party, but which are a little more subtile and refined, and therefore the less discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible: By these I mean the Enthusiastical Delusions of Madam <hi>Antonia Bourignon</hi> and her great Disciple. Monsieur <hi>Poiret,</hi> who have not many Admirers and Followers in their own Country, but too too many in this Island. This contagious Distemper hath seized several Persons, especially in <hi>Scotland,</hi> whose Iudgment, Learning, and Sence (one would have thought) might have preserved them. But alas! What are the Wisest and Greatest when left to themselves? They are as soon and as easily seduced as others, when they do not hold by the certain and stable Rule of Truth, the Scriptures, but grasp at other things
<pb facs="tcp:93003:7"/>
which it does not propose. There is so much Disposition at present to the entertaining of Errors both Ancient and Modern, that it would seem these Nations are lying under that fatal Doom threatned, <hi>2 Thess. ii. 11.</hi> When temporal Iudgments are ineffectual, God inflicteth spiritual, and then his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is kindled to a high Degree. The final Ruine of that People is not far off who are delivered up to Lyes and Delusions; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all who have any Concernment either for Truth or their Country, should contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute their utmost Endeavours to suppress and extirpate those manifold Errors, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies and Delusions, which have been sown amongst them. I am not so vain, as to think that my Labours may be more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual than others: But seeing I am engaged to give the two Treatises presently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I will do all I can to hasten them, if God grant me Health and Life: Both which were lately in Danger: Nor am I yet well recovered.</p>
            <p>The first Seven of the following Sermons were never printed before: The rest were published at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> some six Years ago. I heartily wish, that they, who are at the Pains to read them, may receive some Profit and Advantage by them.</p>

Then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us, and to the hills cover us, for if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry. <hi>p. 123</hi>

               <q>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words are worthy of all acceptation; they ought to be listned to most earnestly, and deserve our most serious Consideration, if either we regard the Person who ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them, or the Matter contained in them. For here is promised what all Men seek after; here is a free and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Invitation to what all Men would be at, to that which they toil and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for with all their might. The Wise and the Unlearned, the High and the Low, and all the World pursue this; tho' they entertain different Sentiments, and follow various Courses, yet still they agree in this, that they all would be at rest. Rest to the Soul is a common End which all aim at; for without this there is no happiness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93003:10"/>What is the true way to this has been the Enquiry of Philosophers, and of all wise and thinking Men in all Ages. The several Sects of Philosophers pretended to teach it; and the same is done by all the Parties who now divide the World: One alledgeth the way to rest and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness is with them; another saith it is with them. But we may trust him who speaketh here; we may safely rely on his Word, and have reason to believe him with an implicite Faith; for he neither can be deceived himself, nor will he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others. He who giveth this Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and maketh this Promise of Rest is the Blessed Jesus, that is, the greatest Person who ever appeared in Human likeness, the very eternal Son of God, Wisdom and Truth it self. No False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood can come from him; and he is willing that all come to the Knowledge of the Truth. He loves us, and wisheth our happiness more than we our selves do. He had no other Errand to this World, but only to procure our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to direct us in the way to it. We ought therefore to receive his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and when he promiseth rest, we have all reason to expect it, and no cause to fear the missing it. O! with what
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93003:10"/>
joy should we hear these words from him; <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>First, you see the Invitation is general<note place="margin">A General Call to all Persons.</note> to all Persons whatsoever. Jesus Christ excludes none from his Mercy who do not exclude themselves by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, hardness, and impenitency. As his Benefits are highly to be valued, and most desireable, so they are freely and kindly offered to every one; he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that all partake of them. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Kings and Princes are reserved to a few special Friends and Favourites, either because they would exhaust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves if they bestowed many, or because they are afraid of rendering them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, if they make them common. But as Jesus Christ is an inexhaustible Treasure of all desireable riches, as he is a Fountain which can never be drained; so he doth not shut himself up, he freely communicateth of his fulness to us. If we be miserable, we have only our selves to blame; if we lack any thing, it is because we do not ask; if we cannot rest, it is because we do not apply unto him. We find him complaining of Mens back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness to their own happiness, but there was never any instance of his hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedness.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93003:11"/>
               <hi>Ye will not come unto me</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 40.</note> 
               <hi>that ye may have life.</hi> And to give all Confidence and Encouragement, and to manifest his free and unlimited Goodness towards all, therefore it is written by the Prophet, <hi>Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath</hi>

               <hi>the Bride say, come, and let him that heareth say, come. And let him that is a thirst come; and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely.</hi> So here it is, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour,</hi> &amp;c. The adding this, doth not restrain the Invitation, or make it less general: for this Epithet may be made of equal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with Mankind it self; for (saith the Son of <hi>Sirach) great travel is created for every man, and an heavy yoke is upon the Sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of their mothers womb, till the day that they return to the mother of all things,</hi> Ecclus. xl. 1.</p>
            <p>By the words of <hi>labouring and being</hi>
               <note place="margin">Why all Men are said to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and to be heavy Laden.</note> 
               <hi>heavy laden,</hi> our Lord pointeth at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent miserable condition of Mankind, and designeth to represent not only his own mercifulness in offering them rest so free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93003:11"/>
but also the great need they stand in of it, that they may be the more easily perswaded to accept his offer. Rest is very acceptable to them that are weary; to them who are lying under any great weight of pressure, ease is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. O how desirous then should Men be of ease to their Minds? How glad ought they to be of rest to their Souls? Seeing they are now by their very Birth put into a state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which obligeth them to Labour and be heavy laden, that is, they are all of them miserable, and do either actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally groan under their misery, or they have abundant reason to do it. If any do it not, it is not because their state is singular and so much better than others, but because their misery has stupified them; their Senses are benummed, which makes their condition worse and more dangerous, because not so easily cured. Now, because Men use to value things only according to the sence of their own need of them; therefore, that we may not slight Christ's offer here, that we may not contemn his rest, but be very desirous of it, and be thankful for his Kindness, I shall in the next place shew the Misery, which (as Men) we labour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93003:12"/>
under, and are laden with, and which should make the very News of Rest and Ease most welcom and acceptable.</p>
            <p>First, The blessed Jesus addresseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> Because of Afflictions.</note> to Men, and calleth them to him under the title of them that labour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Afflictions and Calamities with which they are visited. Afflictions and Calamities are call'd Burdens in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are esteemed such in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Judgment of the World. The Judgments with which God threatned the Nations, are by the Prophets called the <hi>burden</hi> of those Nations. Crosses and Afflictions go under the Name of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>labour,</hi> 1 Tim. iv. 10. and Rev. xiv. 13. It is said, <hi>Blessed are the Dead who die in the Lord, for they rest from their labours,</hi> thereby meaning the Troubles and Difficulties of Life. Now as they may be said to labour and be heavy laden who are in a state of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Affliction; so all Men, as Men, are in such a state, none are exempted from it. <hi>Man</hi> (saith <hi>Eliphaz</hi>) <hi>is born to trouble, as the sparks flee upwards.</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> tells us, That <hi>man who is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble,</hi> Job v. 7. xiv. 1. The truth of this will be attested by every Man's Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93003:12"/>
For (as an Ancient hath it) <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant omnes, loquantur cuncti,</hi> &amp;c. <q>Let all appear and speak, let every one come and give in his Verdict; let old Father <hi>Adam</hi> rise up with all his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; ask them all and they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that, in this Life, they have not found Joy without Sorrow, Peace without Strife, Quietness without Fear, Health without Infirmity, Light without Darkness, Laughter without Mourning.</q> Some have more than others; but none are without some kind and degrees of Troubles; neither the highest nor lowest condition of Life can secure one altogether. An uninterrupted Comfort, and a perfect Satisfaction of all things relating to this Life never any had, nor is it to be expected. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, because all have some burden of external Trouble and Affliction upon them, therefore all do <hi>labour,</hi> and may be said to <hi>be heavy laden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Secondly, Even abstracting from<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> The Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Vanity of Life.</note> supervenient Troubles and those acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Crosses, Man is truly miserable in this World, because he constantly labours under a burden of Emptiness and Vanity. Not only the infliction of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Evils, but the abstraction of any
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93003:13"/>
real and positive or necessary Good will render one miserable, and make his Life wearisome.</p>
            <p>As Diseases, and an external weight and pressure upon the Body will cause pain, and force groaning, so also will the want of Food and necessary Sustenance: They who have felt it say, that Hunger, Thirst, and Famine, are of all Troubles the most grievous; they render the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit very impatient, and are ill to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured. How restless then must the Soul of Man be in this World? how impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient? how discontented when it finds it self deprived of the Good it craveth? Its desires are never answered, its long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is never satisfied, nor is its Appetite ever full, but is always tormented with Emptiness and Vanity. There is no State, or Enjoyment, or Work which can give true Contentment or solid Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: but after much Travel and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Experiments the Soul still returns unsatisfied; she only <hi>wearies</hi> herself with <hi>Lyes,</hi> as the Prophet speaks. Something<note place="margin">Ezek. 24. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

               <hi>but he awaketh, and his Soul is empty: Or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he drinketh; but he awaketh, and behold he is faint, and his soul hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.</hi> What Profit hath a Man of all<note place="margin">Eccl. 1. 5. 9.</note> his Labour which he taketh under the Sun? <hi>All things are full of labour, man cannot utter it; The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</hi> Therefore (saith the Wise Man) <hi>I hated</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>life, because the work that is wrought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit. I prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>the dead which are already dead, more than the living which are yet alive. Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the Sun.</hi> He tried all States, considered every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and tasted every Enjoyment, but was never satisfied with any; for he found Vanity and Vexation intermingled with all. The Book of <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his Observation, drawn from his manifold Experiences, which if we read seriously, and take pains to compare what is said there, with our own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, we will soon be perswaded of the truth of all which that Wise Man saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That Man all the days of his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93003:14"/>
Life laboureth under Vanity and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit: That our Souls live in a Famine of true Satisfaction; and where-ever we turn our selves, we find a want of that Good and Solid Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we would be at, and which is necessary to keep the Mind and Soul from Languishing. The wiser Persons are, the more they allow themselves to think, the more they are perswaded of this; Therefore Wife and thinking Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons usually contemn and undervalue all worldly Pleasures and Enjoyments; nor do any set a price upon them, or are fully satisfied with them, but such as are degenerated into a brutish Nature, who do not exercise their Reason, nor give themselves to thinking, but like the Beasts are at rest, when their Bellies are full.</p>
            <p>But to go on: A Third Misery and<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> The fear of Death.</note> Burden which Men laboured and groaned under, was the Fear of Death; <hi>their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of things to come, and the day of death trouble their thoughts, and cause fear of heart,</hi> said the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> Eccl. xl. 2. And the Apostle tells us, that <hi>through fear of death they were all their life-time subject to bondage,</hi> Heb. ii. 15. They saw <hi>it was appointed for all men</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:93003:14"/>
               <hi>to die;</hi> they understood that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death was passed upon all Men; and none knew how soon, or after what manner this Sentence was to be executed upon himself, so that they stood in jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy every Hour: Neither Youth, nor Health, nor Strength, nor Vigour, nor any natural or acquired Vertue and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment could secure Men from Death: and what was to come after it, they knew not; their hopes of another bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Life were faint; for it was not yet revealed. Therefore, as they were daily liable to Death, and had cause continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to apprehend it; so the fear of it, and the uncertain consequence of it (as every one's Experience witnesseth) damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Joys, and filled them with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and embittered their Life. The terrours of the Mind are more burdensom and grievous than outward weights and pressures upon the Body. Now, nothing is so terrible to Men as Death; it is called <hi>the King of terrours, Iob</hi> xviii. 14. And again it is said, Chap. xxiv. 17. <hi>they are in the terrours of the shadow of Death. My heart</hi> (said David) <hi>is sore pained within me, and the terrours of death are fallen upon me,</hi> Psal. lv. 4. <hi>Aristotle</hi> and other Heathens
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93003:15"/>
have declared, that it is of all things most terrible; and certainlv it is, and shall be, and must be so to all who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not in Jesus; who are Strangers to him, his Doctrine and Promises: until Men come to him, take his Yoke upon them, and learn of him, the fear and terrour of Death must make them to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and be heavy laden.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The great Evil which Men<note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> Sin.</note> labour under, and which is the Cause of all other Evils, is Sin. As this lyeth upon all Men; (for there is no Man who hath not sinned, except the Man Christ Jesus) so this indeed is a heavy burden, and most grievous, whether we consider it in it self, or in its Consequences. The load of Sin which is upon us is great enough to press us down to Hell, and to crush us in pieces. It is Sin which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us to travel all our days with pain; the guilt of this is uneasie to the Mind, and disturbeth its rest, and also maketh us liable to the Wrath of Almighty God, which is a weighty burden, too heavy for the strongest Shoulders. This bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Sin, tho' it be of all others the heaviest, yet few are sensible of it, many do not feel it, tho' it be ready to sink them, because the weight of it has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93003:15"/>
their Senses and stupified their Spirits. But they who are sensible of it, complain most heavily, <hi>O wretched man, that I am,</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>who shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from the body of this death,</hi> Rom. vii. 28. And <hi>David</hi> upon this account uttereth this grievous Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; <hi>Thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore; there is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger, neither is there any rest in my bones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of my sin: for mine iniquities are</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 38. 2.</note> 
               <hi>gone over mine head as an heavy burden, they are too heavy for me. I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly, I go mourning all the day long, Fools make a mock of sin;</hi> but who have a due sence of it, find it is not to be sported with, or set light by: for certainly it is the greatest and saddest of Evils: No Misfortune which befalls us, is so great as that of Sin. He that is not sensible of this, let him take a view of our Saviour in the Garden, and repair to a dying Person, and consider what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Agony and Torment such suffer for Sin? And if this do not affect him, he must be very insensible. The guilt of Sin is unsupportable, no Man has suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient strength to bear it. Therefore, (saith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>the spirit of a man may</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus you see, that all Mankind is lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a fourfold Misery: Four several Burdens are lying upon every Man that cometh into the World, <hi>viz.</hi> The Burden of Affliction, the want of true Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in things relating to this Life, the fear of Death, and the guilt of Sin; each of which is enough to bear down the Spirit of Man, and to crush or break it. O then how heavily are they laden, when they have the weight of all these upon them? how weary may they be? how much stand they in need of Rest and Ease? how desirous should they be of it? And how thankful to him who offers it unto them?</p>
            <p>And thus I come to consider the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious<note place="margin">How Christ giveth rest.</note> Promise which our Lord here makes to miserable Men whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites to himself, <hi>come to me,</hi> and <hi>I will give you rest.</hi> Rest is very desirable; but no rest so desirable as this. An ease of those Burdens which were presently set before you, would exceedingly lighten the Mind, and quicken and cheer up the Spirit. But none can give this Ease, but Jesus who here promiseth it. Some Philosophers have proposed some Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93003:16"/>
against Afflictions; but for the most part they talked impertinently when they spoke of the other Three. But as the greatest and truest Comfort under Afflictions cometh from Jesus Christ, so it is he only who can satisfie the large Cravings of the Soul; who can take away the Fear of Death, and the Guilt of Sin. And as he can, so he will; for he hath promised it here; <hi>Come, and I will give you rest.</hi> This rest must certainly imply a full and perfect Ease of all Misery which lieth upon Men: For if all were not taken away, if any part of it did remain, the Soul could not be at rest. Now, because the very News of Rest is Matter of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and it is yet more comfortable to be assured of it, I will confirm this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and comfortable Promise by other Places of Scripture, and also shew the Reasons why we may expect and look for Rest from Jesus, with a Respect to that Fourfold Misery which is upon us.</p>
            <p>I will invert the Order which was<note place="margin">

Burden of our Sins shall be taken away by Jesus, is evident from his Name and the Reason why he got that Name; for he was called Jesus, <hi>because he was to save his people from their sins,</hi> therefore also he is called <hi>the Lamb of God which taketh away the Sins of the world,</hi> when one sick of the Palsie was brought unto him, he said to him, <hi>Son, be of good</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 9.</note> 
               <hi>chear, thy Sins be forgiven thee.</hi> And he said, so that they might know the Son of Man had power to forgive Sins. <hi>This</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>is a faithful say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and worthy of all Acceptation; that Iesus Christ came into the world to save sinners of whom I am the chief,</hi> 1 Tim. And if the chief be saved, others have no cause to fear. <hi>The blood of Iesus Christ</hi> (saith St. <hi>Iohn</hi>) <hi>cleanseth from all sin.</hi> 1 Joh. i. This is that Fountain which was opened to the House of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and to the Inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for Sin and Uncleanness. The Reason why Jesus can ease us of the Burden of Sin, and take away the Guilt, and free us from the Punishment of it, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath in his own Person born our Sins, and satisfied for them; <hi>he was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our Iniquities, and by his stripes we are</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:93003:18"/>
               <hi>healed, and God laid on him the Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of us all.</hi> Isa. liii. <hi>The Iust died for the Unjust; and he who knew no sin was made sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God through him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, as Jesus Christ taketh<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> From the fear of Death.</note> away the guilt and burden of our Sins, so he freeth us from the fear and terrour of Death. <hi>For asmuch</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>as the Children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same, that through Death he might destroy him that had the power of Death, that is, the Devil; and deliver them, who through fear of Death, were all their life time subject to bondage,</hi> Heb. ii. 14, 15. Jesus Christ hath brought Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to Light; he hath discovered a Life far better than this, a State in which there is fulness of Joy and Rivers of Pleasure for evermore; a Life which admits neither Hunger, Thirst, Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Cold nor Heat, and where all Tears are wiped away: And he hath made Death the necessary Passage to this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed State; so that instead of fearing Death, Men desire to Depart: And whereas before it was reckoned a loss to die, now it is counted <hi>gain. O death where is thy sting! O grave where is thy</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:93003:19"/>
               <hi>victory! The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law: but thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. XV. 55, &amp;c. He hath purchased to himself the Keys as of Hell and Death, so of Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and has Power to admit whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he pleaseth. It is he that hath <hi>the key of</hi> David, <hi>that openeth and no man shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day,</hi> saith Christ. And again, <hi>I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, tho' he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Thirdly, Jesus Christ not only<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> Under the Vanity of this Life.</note> giveth rest to the Soul and ease to our Minds, by begetting in us a lively hope of future Bliss, but also he greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresheth us at present, by settling our Minds in Peace, and giving them a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Pleasure which cannot be uttered. The Happiness of a Christian is not all in Reversion, he has some in hand, that the deferring of his hope may not make him faint, he has a present Possession given him, which yields abundant Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to stay the longing of the Soul,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93003:19"/>
and to prevent its languishing. That Contentment which Men do in vain seek among the Creatures, is only to be found in him; therefore St. <hi>Paul counted all things but loss and dung to the knowledge of Iesus Christ:</hi> He is a Fountain of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Waters; and none but he can quench or satisfie the thirst of the Soul. <hi>Whosoever shall drink of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever shall drink of the water that I shall give, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of water springing up to eternal life,</hi> said he in his Conference with the Woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> Joh. iv. 13. <hi>My flesh</hi> (saith he) <hi>is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed,</hi> that is, true Meat and Drink which both nourish and satisfie; for it is proper and well suited to our Natures. Every Creature has its proper Food; nothing but that can satisfie it; when that is wanting it languisheth. So our Souls, which are of a spiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Nature, cannot feed upon earthly things; nothing can be Food to them, but <hi>that bread which came down from Heaven.</hi> The Contemplation of Christ and his Doctrine can only cheer them up. <hi>These things have I spoken unto you,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:93003:20"/>
               <hi>that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full, which</hi> (St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> saith) <hi>is a joy unspeakable and full of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, Jesus Christ giveth his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples<note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> From Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Afflictions.</note> rest under Afflictions. Indeed, he doth not promise them an exemption from Trouble and Affliction; nay, on the contrary they are forewarned to look for this more than others; but he makes them very light and supportable by the Strength and Instruction which he gives. <hi>He doth not suffer them to be tempted above what they are able, and with every temptation sends a way by which they may escape, that they may be able to bear it,</hi> 1 Cor. X. he abates the Grief and Molestation, which Troubles and Afflictions were wont to procure, by clearing the Divine Oeconomy in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensing them, by shewing the Nature and Use of them, and by giving Rules how to improve them to our Perfection and Happiness. So that what was wont to fright Men, is now become matter of Joy and Gladness. <hi>Count it all joy</hi> (saith St. <hi>Iames</hi>) <hi>when ye fall into divers temptations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you see what a blessed and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Rest may be expected by coming
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93003:20"/>
to Christ. <hi>O fortunatos nimium!</hi> O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py we, if we knew our own Happiness! Here is the place where we may put off all that burden which lieth heavy upon us. Here is an opportunity of being eased of all the Misery, which we are born to, Bodily or Spiritual, Temporal or Eternal. Here we may refresh our wearied Minds, and get that perfect rest we would be at: there is nothing to let or hinder us; there is nothing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct this Happiness, but our own care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness and contempt. We are freely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited; and shall we refuse? Do we sit still unconcernedly? Will we delay so great Happiness? Shall we be so ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him who makes the offer as to slight it? Shall we be so cruel to our selves as to neglect rest when it may be had? <hi>Will ye thus requite the Lord, O O foolish people and unwise? O ye sons of men, how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leesing?</hi> How long will ye spend your Labour for that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth not? How long will it be e're ye have pity on your own Souls? <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?</hi> Why will ye weary your selves in a vain and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Chace? The World, where you have been all this while hunting, is a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93003:21"/>
dry and barren Wilderness, in which you may perish before you catch any thing that can recompence your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Come hither therefore, solace your selves and take your rest. I hope none of us is so Unwise, as not to know how precious and desireable rest is; therefore, let us be so Wise as to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Call. <hi>To day, while it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to day, let us hearken and not harden our hearts,</hi> lest the opportunity pass away, and God <hi>swear in his wrath that we shall not enter into his rest.</hi> I will not trouble you with any Exhortation to accept Christ's offer; for there will be no need of it, if we be sensible of Misery, or feel our burden, because then we will be forward enough; this sense and feeling will prompt us, and our Exhortation would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, if there be no sense or feeling of these things as yet.</p>
            <p>But as I hope, we all desire rest, and<note place="margin">The neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to the rest Promised.</note> are ready to embrace it, so that we may not be disappointed, let us qualifie our selves for it, by embracing the terms and complying with the Conditions, on which it is promised, which is the last thing here to be considered. Some of these are only implied here, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93003:21"/>
as necessary; others are expresly required.</p>
            <p>I shall begin with what is supposed necessary in order to the receiving rest, and that is, the being sensible of our own Misery, and the groaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. This is implied in the Desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Persons invited; <hi>ye that labour and are heavy laden:</hi> For these words not only point at the natural condition of the Persons Called, but also at their sense of it, and carriage under it. The Conjunction <hi>And</hi> is to be taken causally here, as frequently it is used. So, <hi>labour and heavy laden,</hi> is, to labour and grieve, because being so laden; it is to be wearied, because burdened; it is to groan by reason of the Misery which is felt: In a word, it is to have a deep sence of all that Misery we are born to, and involved in, whether Sin or Punishment. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this there can be no Expectation of this blessed Rest, nor will Christ bestow it; for then he would contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict his own Precepts, which forbid <hi>to give what is holy unto Dogs, or to cast Pearls before Swine.</hi> When the worth of a thing is not understood, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued and slighted; and Men will
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93003:22"/>
not be sensible of the worth of this offer Christ makes, until first they be sensible of their own Misery without it. A Physician is welcom and acceptable to him who feels himself Sick: but he, who feels it not, cares not for him. When one's Brain is infected, he not only doth not perceive his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, but he is in love with it, and doth think himself happy in that, for which others think him miserable. Mad and Melancholy Persons love their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, and spurn at those who would cure them. Without therefore a sense of our Misery, we are neither capable of Relief nor worthy of it. What, do you think Christ will bestow the rest, which cost him so dear, upon those who undervalue all he has done and suffered, who think he troubled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to no purpose, as wicked worldly Men must do? Shall we think, that Christ will entertain such as glory in that which brought him to shame, who hug and cherish those Sins which pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Soul, which filled him with Agony, and which created him a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and bloody Passion. Let us not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ourselves: the hardned, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, and insensible Sinner shall
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93003:22"/>
never enter into God's rest; nor yet they who mind Earthly things, and aspire after no greater Happiness: all such shall be kept out. But you who are sensible of your Misery, and who groan under your trouble; you who are wearied at the Vanity of the World, and long for some other Happiness than what can be had here; you who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of your Sins, and who earnestly desire to have them pardoned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; you whose hearts are broken upon that account, and whose Spirits are rendered contrite; for you, and for you only is this rest prepared; you are the Persons invited; it is you whom Jesus means by them that labour and are heavy laden. Come ye therefore unto him, and he will give you rest. <hi>Take his yoke upon you; learn of him; for he is meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest to your souls.</hi> And for your Encouragement, you shall find his <hi>yoke easie and his burden light.</hi>

            <p>IF it be true, that the full Soul loaths the Honey-Comb; that Men use to despise that which they have no need of, or are not sensible that they have, then this gracious offer in the Text will not be much regarded by the World; they will slight it: for if we may take our measures from Mens out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Behaviour, if by that we may adventure to guess at their inward state; then we may conclude, that the most are happy enough, or at least think themselves so. Few complain, the most are merry and well pleased, if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93003:24"/>
with their own outward condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and circumstances, yet at least with themselves. They do not labour under spiritual Infirmities; they do not groan, because their Soul loatheth the Pleasures of the World, and longeth and languisheth after better Dainties than what this World can afford. Sometimes indeed, they may be heard to grudge, that the World goes not so well with them as they could wish, and expressing fears of a change of their condition: But help the one, and guard against the other, and then they would be at ease, they would sing a <hi>Requiem</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, their Souls would be at full rest, and they would be as well satisfied as if perfectly happy. Except when out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward trouble is upon them, few Persons are weary, they are not sensible of other Misery, they are not laden with their Sins, nor born down with the dreadful Consequences of them. The burden of Sin is commonly thought no burden at all; Men bear it easily; nay, they can take on the heaviest load of it, and walk as sturdily as if it were a light thing, as if its weight lay merely in fancy. This never troubles them, nor upon this account would they seek rest to their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93003:24"/>
Souls. The Charms of the World lull Men asleep, and render them insensible; the noise and hurry of Affairs divert them from serious Reflections on their Misery, even as Company keeps the Sick and Pained from the actual sense of their Disease and Pain. But as Company doth not cure, it only seemeth to give ease; so when it is gone, when the Night comes that the Sick is left alone, then the Person grows weary, because he feels his Trouble, and is sensible of his Pain, and gets nothing to divert it. Just so, if Men would retire from outward Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions, if they would seriously look into themselves, and consider their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they should find themselves very loathsome, they should see in themselves great Cause of Grief and Sorrow; this would make their Souls restless and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: then would they turn from side to side, and cry out of their wretchedness; then the words of Rest and Ease to the Soul would be acceptable and heard with delight; then our Text would be received as a Sovereign Cordial; and indeed, it is prepared only for such. It speaks of rest, shews where it is: but none are invited but such as are sensible of their Misery, the weary, they who
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93003:25"/>
labour and are heavy laden. And if such please to listen, if such will receive these words and obey them, their Minds shall presently be disburdened, they shall be eased of all their Grief. For the Words of Jesus cannot fail; his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice cannot chuse but be Proper and Effectual, and he hath said, <hi>Come unto me, take my Yoke upon you, learn of me; for I am meek and lowly, and ye shall find rest to your Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the former Discourse on this Text I shewed what was meant by labouring and being heavy laden, and upon what account this Appellation may be given to all Mankind. I shewed, that all are under the Burthen of a four-fold Misery, <hi>viz.</hi> Affliction, Vanity, and Dissatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the Fear of Death and the Guilt of Sin. As also that a due sense of this Misery was required as a Disposition to the Cure, and a necessary Preparation to the obtaining true Rest and Ease to our Souls.</p>
            <p>I intend, at this time, to consider the other Conditions required, which you see are Three, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Coming to Christ. 2. Taking his Yoke. 3. Learning of him. The Conditions are not many, and they are very reasonable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:93003:25"/>I will begin with the First, which is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> Coming to Christ, is</note> Coming to Christ. None can be so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant as to understand this of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of our Bodies towards Christ; for they to whom he spake, could not come nearer unto him: And we now cannot approach him with our Bodies. The Rest to which we are called is a Rest of Soul; and therefore to obtain this, the Motion of the Soul and not of the Body, is requisite and proper.</p>
            <p>By this First is meant, the giving our<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1st.</hi> To fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Counsel.</note> selves up entirely to his Counsel and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement. The Sick are bidden go to the Physician, and they who are injured and oppressed to the Lawyer. The meaning of which, is not that they should gaze upon their Persons, look them in the Face, and hear them talk; for what Ease or Relief can that be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the one or the other? But there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is understood the receiving their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and following it: And it is Folly to make Application, if one be not resolved to take Advice. What good can the Physician do, if the Patient be willful, if he will only receive the Potions which relish with his vitiated Palate, and not what the Physician judges best and most proper. If one desire to be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93003:26"/>
cured throughly and speedily, he ought to yield himself absolutely to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician's Skill. Even so, if we would have our Souls cured, if we would have them eased of all the Trouble with which they labour, we ought to apply our selves to Jesus Christ, who is the true and only Physician, who only can restore Health, and give Peace. But then our Application ought to be an entire Resignation to his Conduct, and should be attended with a full Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be guided by him in every thing. We ought not to carry towards him, as some peevish and humoursome Patients to their Physician, who judge his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, approve and condemn them, as if they had studied the Art, and did understand all the Rules of Medicine as well as he. Alas! Many are of the same unreasonable Temper, and do behave themselves thus toward Jesus the great Physician of Souls! They come to him, but they bring their Humours with them, which they will not part with: And if his Advice and Prescriptions agree not with their Humours, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and condemn them: And hence it is, that they are not the better by coming to Christ. Indeed, when we
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93003:26"/>
have to do with Men, there is no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that we should altogether lay aside our own Judgment, and follow them in every thing; for the most knowing is fallible: But Jesus is Infallible, he cannot be mistaken. Can he err in whom are all the Treasures of Wisdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? And can any doubt of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for our Health? Will not he love us, who hath done so much for us? Will not he seek our good, who spared not his own Life for our sakes? He has all the Skill, and Knowledge, and Affection, and Concernment which can be desired. Therefore we ought to come to him, and to come without Reserve; we ought to lay aside all Prejudice, and should yield our selves wholly to his Conduct and Management, that we may the sooner be sensible of his Skill, and feel (to our Comfort) that he is a Physician of great Value.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, By coming to Christ<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2d.</hi> To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him.</note> is meant believing in him; for so we find it expounded in Scripture, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by these Places, <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 6. <hi>He that cometh to God, must believe that he is. I am the bread of life; he that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth in me shall never thirst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>

And as by this and other places, it appears, That coming to Christ, is to be understood of believing in him: So the absolute Necessity of Faith in Christ, in order to the Participation of his Benefits, may be made evident many ways.</p>
            <p>First, From express Texts of Scripture. I shall instance but in a few of some Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds which might be produced. Thus, <hi>Iohn</hi> iij. 14. <hi>As Moses lifted up the Serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</hi> ver. 16. <hi>For God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, but have everlasting live.</hi> ver. 18. <hi>he that believeth on him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> 1 John v. 12. <hi>he that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son, hath not life. To whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? so we see, that they could not enter in because of Unbelief.</hi> Heb. iij. 18, 19. There is not a Chapter in all the New Testament, in which the Necessity
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93003:27"/>
of Faith, and the Danger of Infidelity is not held forth. It is the express Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all the Promises; and without Faith it is declared, That we cannot look for Mercy, Pardon, or eternal Life. And this is not a new thing introduced by the Gospel.</p>
            <p>But the Divine Oeconomy, from the beginning of the World, did require Faith, which is a Second Proof of its being absolutely necessary now. As it appears now to be the chief Condition required of Men under the Gospel, so it was under the Law, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. Nay, before the Law, as appears from <hi>Abraham</hi> and the other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs. Of <hi>Abraham</hi> it is said, <hi>That he believed in the Lord, and he counted it to him for righteousness,</hi> Gen. xv. 6. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Faith was exacted of Man even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fall, while he was in a State of Innocence. For the two Trees of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and of Life, which God set apart in Paradise, and the Interdiction of the First by that severe Sanction, <hi>in that day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die,</hi> was to try and exercise Man's Faith. Thus the Divine Oeconomy, before the Fall, and ever since; before the Law, under the Law, and by the Gospel, hath
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93003:28"/>
always required Faith as a necessary Condition to the obtaining God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. In respect to the certain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Order and Method of which Oeconomy, it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> 
               <hi>faith it is impossible to please God.</hi> And tho' the Counsel of God be secret, and his Methods for the most part un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable, yet the Reasonableness of this doth appear from this, that without Faith, in this present State, we neither can acknowledge all the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, nor yet worship him with all our Faculties. His Veracity, Truth, and Faithfulness, cannot be owned otherwise than by Faith, by believing his Word, assenting to his Declarations, relying on his Promises, and trembling at his Threatnings. And as all those Divine Attributes can only be acknowledged by Faith, so it is only by Faith that we worship him with our Understandings. It is reasonable that we worship God with the whole Man, all our Faculties ought to pay him Homage. But how can he have Homage from our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, unless we believe? It is only by Acts of Faith that we declare the Submission of our Judgment to God; for if we will admit or receive nothing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93003:28"/>
but what is demonstrable, and what we can clearly comprehend, then we deny God's infinite Wisdom and Knowledge, and refuse to own his Reason to be above our own, which is intolerable Pride and Insolence. For this Cause, even to try our Faith, and to give us occasion to pay him this due Homage of our Reason and Understanding, it is that God proposeth to us Mysteries which are incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; and hence it is also that he often absconds himself, as it were, he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not always in a God-like manner, that is, in a splendid, glorious, or such a visible Way as may force Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Men, but often after a secret and covert manner, under the Shadow of Means and Instruments of divers sorts, that hereby it may be proved, whether we believe him Almighty and the wise Disposer of all things, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all Events. In the other World Faith shall cease, there will be no place for it, because there will be a present, immediate Intuition of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Attributes; but now that we are absent from the Lord, we walk by Faith. Thus, you see, that as Faith is required here, so it is necessary; and why it is so, I have also briefly laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93003:29"/>
you. And as the Text obliged us to speak of this, so the times, we live in, make it necessary; for Atheism and Infidelity are setting up their Heads; and some have the Impudence (in this licentious Age) to dispute both the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness and Necessity of what God has clearly revealed. As for you, <hi>My beloved, I beseech you, build your selves up in your most holy Faith,</hi> and let not the weak Efforts of insolent Wits shake your Faith. Stand up, and strive vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously for the Faith of the Gospel, which has been confirmed by so many Miracles and Prophecies, by such evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Demonstrations of the Spirit and Power, that if it be hid, <hi>it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, least the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God, should shine unto them. Take heed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Brethren,</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>lest there be</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 12.</note> 
               <hi>in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</hi> When we let go Faith, and entertain an Heart of Unbelief, we depart from God, lose the Promises, forfeit Heaven, render our selves uncapable of Mercy, and give our selves to a reprobate Mind
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93003:29"/>
here, and to Damnation hereafter. He, that layeth aside Faith, may also put off the Name of a Christian; and all the Pretensions which that Name may give to Blessings earthly or heavenly, bodily or spiritual, temporal or eternal: For Faith is necessarily implyed in that Name, and as requisite to him that would deserve it, as the Skill of Law or Physick to one that sets up for a Lawyer or Physician, or Philosphy to a Philosopher. Seeing therefore we own our selves to be Christians, that we may be worthy of so sacred a Name, let us evermore pray God (with the Man in the Gospel) Saying, <hi>Lord, encrease our Faith, and help our Unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now it may be very pertinently<note place="margin">
                  <hi>3d.</hi> What Faith is.</note> asked, what this Faith is which is thus required? In answer to this, St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us the first and lowest Acts of Faith, when he saith, <hi>He that cometh to God must first believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him.</hi> We must begin with the Belief and Perswasion of God's Existence, Power, Wisdom, Providence, and what else Reason and the Light of Nature teacheth of him. But then, that our Faith may be perfect, we must add to it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93003:30"/>
Knowledge and extend it to all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations which God hath made of himself from time to time, we must embrace all the Divine Revelations, and what they contain. All the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Laws, Promises, and Threatnings in God's Word are proposed as Objects of Faith, and by Faith we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, that is, we must own and acknowledge them to be of God, and by a constant regard to them in all our Actions testifie the Firmness and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Belief and Perswasion.</p>
            <p>More particularly, our Faith must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the Person, Offices, Doctrine, and Actions of the Lord Jesus Christ, we must receive him as the Person who was promised to <hi>Adam, Abraham,</hi> and the Patriarchs; who was foretold by the Prophets, prefigured by the Law, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Jews, and even waited for by the Gentiles; we must receive him and rely upon him as the Son of God, and Saviour of the World: we must embrace him as the Person whom God hath set forth to be a Propitiation for Sin, and the Mediator, by whom and through whom only we have access un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. <hi>I am</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>the way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:93003:30"/>
               <hi>into God but through me. Ye believe in God, believe also in me. Him hath God the Father sealed;</hi> And therefore, he who doth not receive him nor believe in him, giveth God the Lye. <hi>If</hi> (saith St. <hi>Iohn</hi>) <hi>we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. For this is the witness of God, which he hath testified of his Son. He that believeth on the Son, hath the witness of himself; he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not God, hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.</hi> And again, <hi>Who is</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 5. 9.</note> 
               <hi>a liar but he that denieth that Iesus is the Christ? Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father.</hi> To deny<note place="margin">Chap. 2. 22, 23.</note> Jesus Christ, will inferr a denial of God himself; the same Prejudices against the one, will obstruct a sound and sincere belief of the other. They who have not had the Gospel offered unto them, are not in the like Circumstances: But they, who do not believe after it has been duely and fairly represented to them, are shrewdly to be suspected of Atheism as well as Infidelity. Meer Deists are not far from Atheists. The Truth of the Gospel and its Doctrine concerning Jesus Christ, is almost, if not altogether, as demonstrable as the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93003:31"/>
invisible things of God, from things visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And to say, That this vast frame of the World, its various Parts, and the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Creatures inhabiting those Parts, was all the Effect of blind Chance, and the Product of a confused jumbling of senseless Atomes; to say this, is no more absurd than to say that the admirable Harmony betwixt the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament; Books which were written by different Men, at very distant times, that the wonderful correspondence which the Life and Actions of Jesus Christ had to what went before, that the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and their Accomplishment, that all these, I say, were only the Dreams and Contrivances of Men: the one choaks Reason as well as the other. <hi>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Iesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of his majesty. For he received from God the Father, honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:93003:31"/>
               <hi>that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts: Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost,</hi> 2 Pet. i. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>Having thus spoken to the First thing required in order to the obtaining rest, <hi>viz.</hi> The coming to Christ; and shewed both what it is, and why it is exacted. I proceed to</p>
            <p>The Second Condition or Means of<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> Taking the Yoke.</note> Spiritual Rest, which is said to be the taking Christ's Yoke upon us. By Yoke, in a Metaphorical sence, is understood that Service which Superiours and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours impose upon those who are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected unto them. Thus, 1 <hi>King.</hi> xii. 4. The Service, which <hi>Solomon</hi> imposed upon the People, is called their Yoke. So the Yoke of Christ is his Laws, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and Injunctions which he gives to his Disciples: These are scattered up and down every where through the Gospels; but most copiously set forth in the Sermon on the Mount; to which we must add the Epistles of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93003:32"/>
which are infallible Commentaries upon the Divine Laws of their Master Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>In a word, The New Testament is the <hi>Codex,</hi> or <hi>Corpus Iuris Christi,</hi> the Body of the Christian Law, which must be carefully studied by all who would know the Will of their Lord concerning them, and the Duty which he requires of them. And by this it clearly appears, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus has reinforced the Natural and Moral Law, cleared it from the misprisions of Men, discovered its full Latitude, and brought it to all the Perfection which it is capable of: So that to some it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, as if he had superadded to it, and commanded Duties which Men were not obliged to formerly: Whether it be so or not, I will not debate it now. But, by the Laws of Jesus Christ, all Sin what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is forbidden, the Sins of the Heart and Thoughts as well as the outward Man; because both the one and the other fall under the Cognizance of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and are known to him. And Sin is so peremptorily and severely Prohibited by the Christian Law, that to shun it, we are bid <hi>cut off our right hand and our right foot,</hi> and <hi>pluck out our right eye,</hi> that is, to chuse to deprive
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93003:32"/>
our selves of the Nearest or Dearest, or greatest Satisfaction, rather than to run our selves into the danger of Sin, by adhering to the same. As all Sin is thus strictly forbidden, so all Vertue and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness are expresly required. The Laws of Jesus call for the greatest and most ardent love to God, for an entire Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to his Will, a chearful Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Providence, an active Zeal and Concernedness for his Glory, and an anxious Care to please him. They require a contempt of all Earthly things, and the minding Heavenly things; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment with every Condition, and a Patient bearing of every Affliction: Nay, they exact the taking up the Cross, that is, that we suffer rather than Sin, and freely undergo any trouble, rather than either decline our Duty, or offend God. By the Precepts of Christ, we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to love our Neighbour, that is, all Men as our selves, and <hi>to do to others as we would be done to.</hi> We must abstain from all Injuries either to Soul or Body, to Name or Estate, and must lay our selves out to do all the good we can: we must wrong no Man, and Pardon those who have wronged us. Whatever may seem to be the Voice of Nature, or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93003:33"/>
the Sentiments and Practices of Men, Christ saith to us, <hi>Love your Enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitefully use you and persecute you.</hi> And certainly Revenge is every way as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Christianity, as Theft, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or Adultery; and Whoremongers and Adulterers shall as soon enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, as the Revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: And unless the Gospel be a mere Sham, or to be read backward, neither the one nor the other shall be saved, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they have reconciled themselves to God, by serious Repentance. In a word, the Doctrine of Jesus Christ teacheth us <hi>to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.</hi> And <hi>finally, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoevor things are just, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, if there be any vertue, and if there be any praise,</hi> the Gospel of Christ requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth us <hi>to think on these things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Yoke of Christ, and to put on his Yoke is to observe these things. It is to give Obedience to those his Laws, which you see is made a necessary means
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93003:33"/>
to rest, that is, to true Happiness. He saith here to them that labour and are heavy laden, who would have rest to their Souls; <hi>take my yoke upon you.</hi> He says not, take my Name, my Profession, but my Yoke; and he bids them not consider it, talk of it, or keep it by them, but put it on, that is, wear it; which we then only do, when we give all sincere Obedience to his Laws, and make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of observing all his Precepts. We mistake it, if we think it sufficient to make us Christians, or to obtain the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of the Disciples of Jesus Christ, to be Baptized, to take up the Name and Profession of Christianity, to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the outward Ordinances, and to contend for the Truth of the Gospel, or the Purity of its Doctrine. All this is good, and must be done; but we must do more, else we do not enough. We must moreover add Obedience; <hi>for why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things, I say?</hi> Luke vi. 46. <hi>Not every one, who saith to me Lord, Lord, shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven. Every one</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>that heareth these sayings of mine, and doth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:93003:34"/>
               <hi>man, who built his house upon the sand, and the rain descended, and the wind blew, and floods came and beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it,</hi> Matth. vii. 21. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>There is indeed mention made of a Christian Liberty, and we are required <hi>to stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free.</hi> But this is not a<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note> Liberty to Sin, it is not an Exemption from the Moral Law; it is not a Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation from the Duty which that Law requires of us towards God and Man: it is only a Liberty from the bondage of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, from the curse of that Law which was given to our first Parents; a Liberty from the bondage of Satan, and the servitude of Sin. The Liberty given us is, the Liberty of the Sons of God: but the Liberty of Sons does not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from honouring and obeying the Parents. <hi>Ye have been called unto liberty</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>only use not liberty</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 13.</note> 
               <hi>for an occasion unto the flesh. As free</hi> (saith St. <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>and not using your liberty for a</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</hi> So we are still the Servants of God, and therefore bound to obey him; there can be no Dispensation from that: neither God can give, nor is it our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93003:34"/>
to seek it. <hi>Think not that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets, I am not come to destroy but to fulfil: for verily I say unto you,</hi> &amp;c. Let no Man deceive himself and think, that all may be compensated by believing: for tho' Faith be necessary, <hi>yet faith without works is dead,</hi> and will not avail a Man. That Faith which is acceptable to God, and which will avail to Salvation and Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is a Faith which <hi>worketh by love,</hi> and which <hi>keepeth the Commandments.</hi> True Faith and Obedience are insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; for Obedience is the necessary Consequence of Faith, the proper Fruit and Effect of it; and the only Evidence which can be given of it. As the Tree is known by its Fruit, so Faith by its Works. <hi>Shew me thy faith without thy works?</hi> saith St. <hi>Iames;</hi> which is as much as if he had said, how is it possible to shew Faith without Works? Can the sick Man believe the Physician to have both skill and honesty to cure him, when he neither will use his Remedies, nor commit himself to his Conduct. And how can Men be said to believe in Christ, when they will not regard his Word, nor observe his Injunctions? And what doth he enjoin us? Nothing, but
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93003:35"/>
what himself hath practised. He is not like the Pharisees, who did bind heavy Burdens, and lay them upon other mens Shoulders, but they themselves would not touch them. He lays no heavier burden upon us than what himself hath born; he puts us to no harder task than what himself hath wrought. Can the Servant expect to be greater than his Lord? If he then fulfilled the Law, ought not we also to set our selves to do it? If he could not be exempt from Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, how can we expect it? Jesus is not like the Rulers of this World, who do not observe their own Laws: The Laws they make and Pass, are for the People, and not for themselves. But Jesus observes his own Laws; he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self did bear that Yoke, which he here commands us to take up: And we may learn all our Duty from his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, as well as Doctrine. Which leads me to</p>
            <p>The Third and Last thing required<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> Learning of Christ.</note> in the Text, in order to the obtaining rest of Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> Learning of Christ. The word in the Original signifies to become a Disciple in general: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is joined here with two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Vertues of Meekness and Humility;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93003:35"/>
therefore, by the current consent of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, it is to be taken in this place for the imitation of Christ, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after a conformity to his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, particularly in these two Instances here made mention of. The thing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined here, is not that we should learn his Doctrine or conn his Sayings by heart, but that we should study his Life, imitate his Practice, and labour to be like him. The Necessity and Usefulness of this Duty, is set forth in many places of Scripture. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. Ye call me Master and Lord, and ye say well, for so I am. I</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 13. 15.</note> 
               <hi>have given you an example that ye should do as I have done unto you. Let the same mind be in you which was in Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> saith St. <hi>Paul;</hi> And St. <hi>Peter, If when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God: for even hereunto were ye called; because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow his steps,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>Men are better taught, and more easily led by Example than by Precept. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample both giveth greater encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and also teacheth more clearly.

                  <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
               </gap>
conformity to him is the Character of God's chosen ones, and without this we cannot claim, either the Title of the Sons of God here, or the Glory which is prepared for them hereafter. For, as the Apostle saith, <hi>whom God did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren,</hi> Rom. viij. 29.</p>
            <p>O what an excellent thing is it to be like Jesus! for he is the brightness of the Father's Glory, and the express Image of his Person; so that to be like him, is to be like God.</p>
            <p>By the Imitation of Jesus, we recover what our First Parents lost and forfeited to themselves and us, even the Image of God. Therefore the Imitation of Jesus brings more Honour and Glory, than any, or all earthly Dignities. Likeness to God is the highest degree a Creature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of; therefore if we understood our selves and our interest, we should be more ambitious of this, than of all the Titles and Dignities, which either Kings or People can bestow. If the Imitation of Christ were impossible, it would not have been enjoined us: but neither is it so difficult as some at first may imagine:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93003:36"/>
besides, that the Difficulties may be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted through the Grace of God, the thing will become both easie and pleasant, if we will but converse with Christ, contemplate and meditate on him frequently. They who converse much together, we see use to slide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly into the Manners, Fashion, and Behaviour of one another. Even so, if we take this Method, we shall soon find our selves changed into a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with Jesus Christ. <hi>But we all</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>with open face, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. iij. 18.</p>
            <p>But now as it is our Duty, our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, our Interest to follow Christ, and to labour to be like him. So it is fit to consider wherein we should follow him. Some Imitations are indiscreet, unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and so far from obliging that they provoke. A King loves to be imitated by his Subjects, because it is a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their Love and Respect, and the greatest Honour they can put upon him: But he would not have them to imitate the Peculiarities of Royalty and Sovereignty. Imitation should not be
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93003:37"/>
in things peculiar, but in these things which are common, which may agree to, and suit with both. So we must not attempt to follow Christ, in what was peculiar to him as the Son of God and the Saviour of the World; we must not imitate the Acts of his Almighty Power, or what was proper to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory Office. It is no part of our Duty to imitate him in his Miracles, in his walking on the Water, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Winds and Seas, casting out Devils, fasting Forty Days, and the like. What we ought to imitate is the Divine Vertues which shined forth in his holy Life, and which appeared in all his Actions. Wherefore (he saith) <hi>learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Words may also be considered as an Encouragement, for coming to Christ, taking up his Yoke, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him; because he is a meek and lowly Person, gentle and easy, no wise rigid and severe; therefore Men may come to him readily, and ought to come willingly; for they need not fear hard Usage; he will not treat them roughly, nor impose grievous Tasks upon them. He is a kind and loving Master, who consults the Good and Ease of his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93003:37"/>
Disciples, and who will not exact any Service, which is not both reasonable and also for their Interest, as is clearly insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated in the last Words, <hi>my yoke is easy and my burden is light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But seeing Jesus requires us to imitate him, and is frequently proposed as an Example to us; and seeing in this very place, in which he bids us come and learn of him, he recommends himself as a meek and lowly Person; therefore we ought to consider those Vertues of Humility and Meekness as particularly proposed for our Imitation. Jesus Christ had all other Vertues as well as these, he was a true Pattern of Love to God, of Zeal, Submission, Obedience and heavenly Mindedness; of Charity, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulness, and good Will towards Men; of Chastity, Purity, Sobriety, Patience, and Contentment; and in a Word, of every thing which is Praise worthy in the Sight of God or good Men. By his Life as well as Doctrine, we may learn how to behave our selves in all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances and Conditions, in Poverty and Affliction, under Contempt and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, when we are hated and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And though he possessed not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Plenty and Grandeur, yet several
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93003:38"/>
of his Actions shew the true end and use of these, and do teach those who possess them to imploy them more for the Glory of God and the Good and Comfort of others, than for their own private Satisfaction. From his Practice and Example we may learn our Duty to Superiours, Inferiours, and Equals. But tho' he be a Pattern of all Vertue and Goodness; yet he instanceth only in Meekness and Humility, either because these comprehend all other, or are the chief and first to be learned, and which, if they be learned, will draw all other after them. All Vertue and Religion either respects Man or God, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Meekness and Humility it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to carry our selves aright towards either of them: But he that is truly humble and meek, will certainly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to please both. Nay, the very Exercise of these two comprehends all our Duty to God and Man, as we may learn from <hi>Micah</hi> vi. <hi>He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but that thou shouldest do justly, and love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Meekness cannot be either better or more briefly described, than in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93003:38"/>
of Charity given by St. <hi>Paul: It suffereth long, is kind, envieth not, vaunteth not it self, is not puffed up, doth not behave it self unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</hi> For these Characters belong to Charity, because it softneth our Natures and rendreth us meek; Meekness is a Branch of Charity, and naturally flows from it. These two are inseparable, and we may certainly conclude the one is not, where the other is wanting. Love smooths our Natures, and carries off all Ruggedness of Temper; it disposeth us both to please others, and also to be well pleased with what they do; it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Persons and Actions of others acceptable, and even when any thing is amiss in either, it excuseth or censureth gently. If Christian Love did abound more, there would be more of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and good Nature in common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation: But because that is very much wanting, therefore there is so little ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Complaisance to be seen. The most are very selfish, and have but very little Concernment for others, and this is the Cause why they are so surly and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93003:39"/>
morose, so peevish and wrathful, why their Temper is so stiff and uneasie, and their Behaviour so rough and blustering; they love themselves too much, and others too little, and therefore they can hardly condescend to gratify others, and are but seldom satisfied with what is done to themselves. As Meekness pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Love, so from Humility, and therefore they are fitly joined together here; a proud Man can never be meek, and he who is lowly in Heart cannot be of another Temper. So if we would learn Meekness, we must study Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</p>
            <p>And we may soon be perswaded into this if we but hearken unto Reason, for that demonstrates that we have nothing to be proud of, because we have no good but what we have received; and therefore if we glory, we should glory in the Lord. Humility is not to undervalue ones self, but not to think above what we ought to think: And if the Thoughts of our selves be just, not higher than they ought, they will not be high nor lofty, nor will they shew others at the distance of Contempt and Scorn, for we all stand upon the same Level, have the same
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93003:39"/>
Original, Nature, Frame, Constitution and End. And as this makes the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of every Man much the same, so it does not afford Matter of boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any; our Extract and Original is from the Dust, and to it we must return; our Frame and Constitution is frail, and easily disordered; our Strength and Beauty, like the Flower of the Field, is withered before Noon; We carry our Breath in our Nostrils, and it goes out as a Vapour. We are Children a Third part of our time; and the other Two parts are consumed in Sin and Vanity; all our Actions are either grossly Evil, or to little Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; our Righteousness is as the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Cloud, and as the early Dew that passeth away, not being able to endure the Heat of the Sun. <hi>Men of low Degree are Vanity, and Men of high Degree are a lye;</hi> lay both the one and the other in the Balance, and they will be found altogether lighter than Vanity. Surely every Man, (even the best of Men, in their best State) is nothing but Vanity and Emptiness, when set in the Sight of God. Sin is indeed Matter of true Humiliation; but the deepest and truest Humility arises
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93003:40"/>
from the Contemplation of the Infinite Nature and Perfections of God. He, who proposes himself as a Pattern of Humility and Lowliness here, knew no Sin; he had all the Weakness of Flesh and Blood; he was surrounded with the Infirmities of our Nature, but he was altogether free from the Corruption of it, and never did any thing amiss; and yet he was lowly in Heart, because of his intimate Union with God, and did bear about with him a full Idea of his glorious Attributes: For as the Glory of the Sun extinguishes the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Stars, so all created Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies must disappear, upon a View of the uncreated Glory of God, whose Perfections can never be found out. When even the most perfect and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Iob</hi> does see this with his Eye, he abhorreth himself, and doth repent in Dust and Ashes. <hi>Iob</hi> xlii. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>If we have these two Vertues, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Humility, we will not murmur at the Commands of Christ as if any of them were grievous; then we shall be sensible of the Reasonableness and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them; then we shall find his Yoke easy and his Burthen light: For besides the new Strength and Vigour
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93003:40"/>
that we shall receive from above for the bearing of it, we shall then clearly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that it is most just and reasonable, admirably adapted to our Nature, and well accommodated to our Interest, wisely contrived, to give us all Peace and Satisfaction at present, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for perfect and Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hereafter.</p>
            <q>Now the God of Peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Iesus Christ, that great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the Blood of the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant, make you perfect in every good Work to do his Will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his Sight, through Iesus Christ, to whom be Glory for ever and ever.</q>

            <p>THERE are in our holy Religion two Sublime Mysteries, which, as they can never be fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, so they can never be too much, or too frequently thought upon:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93003:41"/>
For nothing can make more for the Glory of God, nothing can be of more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Profit to our selves: they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the Understanding, warm the Heart, add vigour to all the rational Faculties, and so cherish and strengthen the Spiritual Life, that by these means we may become able to walk straight, and to run with Patience, without faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Race that is set before us. By these I mean, the Mystery of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Son of God, and that of his Passion and Death, both which are jointly spoken of in the Text; as the Day and the Action we intend to set about call us to consider both; the Day being, by the Appointment of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, the Anniversary of our Lord Jesus his Birth; therefore the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation is a proper Subject for it. But some of us intending at this time, and others against the next day, to make that solemn Address to God, by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lord's Supper; this also makes it fit to think upon his Death: Nor is it Unsuitable to commemorate his Death upon the Festival of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; for the one was the End and Reason of the other: His Birth was in order to his Death; and if he had not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93003:42"/>
died, his Birth could not have profited us. This Sacrament is a proper <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mass</hi> Feast: to feast devoutly by Faith upon the Sacrifice which Christ offered upon the Cross is the best Entertainment we can give unto God, or make for our selves. This will put more Joy into our Hearts, than either Wine or Oil, or any of the Delicacies of richest Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets.</p>
            <p>By this it appears, that the Text is<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> The Scope and Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Text.</note> suitable: but before I enter upon the Explication of it, it will be fit to shew you the scope of the Apostle in this place, and upon what occasion he utters these words. In this place, the Apostle sets himself to perswade the <hi>Philippians</hi> to Humility and a generous Charity, or such a mutual concernedness for each other, as might make every Man ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to serve his Neighbour as himself, and even to prefer others to himself. This is an excellent temper of Mind, and the very height of Vertue: but withal the Practice of it is hard, and the Attainment very difficult. This gives a true resemblance and conformity to the Divine Nature; and therefore is not easily arrived at, seeing now by the corruption of our Natures we are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93003:42"/>
to a great distance from God. The things, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires here, are directly opposite to the Nature of Man, in his present Natural or Corrupt state; for in this state the Soul of Man hath no generous Expansion or Enlargement towards others, but is almost altogether pent up in it self, and is become so pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishly selfish, that it cannot move but by the narrow springs of Self-love. Now, all Persons and Things are only consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with a relation to one's self, and a Concernment for them is more or less, according as they are found more or less useful. Consider Men in their present Natural state, before the Grace of God and true Religion inspire and enable them, all their Actions are performed only with a respect to themselves and their own particular Interest; they look only to their own things, and providing these things be well, they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned how it fare with others; nay, are so far from thinking themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to those Vertues the Apostle is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending, so far from looking upon this humble and charitable serviceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as commendable or praise-worthy, that they are ready to condemn it as a mean silly officiousness; some think it
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93003:43"/>
far below them, that it is a debasing of themselves and their Quality and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, to serve Inferiours, to bestir themselves for their Advantage, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if their former Carriage and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour has been a little provoking, and not so obliging. Wherefore, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to take off Mens prejudice against these Vertues of humble Charity or chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Humility, to perswade them to the practice of them, he shews they are Divine and God-like; and for a proof of it, he proposeth the example of the Lord Jesus Christ. Nothing readily will more convince, enflame, and animate, than the Example of some great Person. And if the Example of Men have a powerful Influence, what ought the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of God himself to have? And if it be not below the Deity; if it has not been thought unworthy of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to condescend to serve Man; nay, if the God-head has accepted the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for furthering its Glory, and upon that account has been employed in very humble Offices, how ambitious should Men be of this temper of Mind? how ready and forward to embrace the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of shewing it? Can Men act more honourably than to act like God? Can
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93003:43"/>
any thing more become them, than to imitate and resemble him? Now, that by humbling themselves to serve others, to give them true Pleasure or Profit, that this way they come to resemble God, doth eminently appear from the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>who being in the form of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus you have a view of the Words with a reference to the Scope and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the Apostle in this place.</p>
            <p>We proceed next to consider them ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> The Truths contain'd in the Text.</note> and so they hold forth those Three very important Points of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. <hi>First,</hi> The Pre-existence and Godhead of Jesus Christ, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> His Incarnation and Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> His Humiliation and Ignominious Death, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. So that from the Text alone all the Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Enemies of our Blessed Lord and Saviour may be clearly baffled, and all those damnable Heresies which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divest him of his God-head, or deprive us of the comfort of his powerful Mediation and meritorious Death; I say, such damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies may from this Text be plainly refuted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:93003:44"/>So pat is this Text against the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuity of the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in their Explication of this Text.</note> that they are exceedingly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled with it, and use a great many Subterfuges to shift the force of it: by which they discover their own disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, and shew, that their not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the Truth, proceeds not from want of sufficient Conviction, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they bear not love and good will to the Truth. Thus, say they, the word which is rendered <hi>Form,</hi> in the 6. <hi>v.</hi> imports never any reality of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but only a mere semblance and appearance; and so Jesus being in the <hi>form of God,</hi> is no more, than that there appeared some Rays of Divinity in him, and about him; that he was vested with some shadow of Divine Power, while in the mean time he was in himself, and in his Nature, only a weak Man as others. Thus they play with the word <hi>Form,</hi> as if it were exclusive of all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: And by this means, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith here of Jesus, might be with as great truth said of some of the Prophets, and especially of <hi>Moses.</hi> To this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Criticks, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is never used for an external or accidental appearance, but for such visible tokens
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93003:44"/>
as flow from, and are the Effects of a real Essence; and so according to the common acceptation of Authours, the word which we have for <hi>Form,</hi> is all one with Nature, or it doth signifie the external or visible appearance of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and real or natural Essence. I shall not trouble you with Instances to prove this. But even the Unlearned may see this from the Text; for as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the <hi>form of God,</hi> so of the <hi>form of a Servant,</hi> and sets those two in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition: If therefore the one was real, why not the other? If by the one all acknowledge the Nature of Man, why should not the Nature of God be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by the other? And seeing the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth not ascribe to Jesus Christ the <hi>form of a Servant,</hi> more positively than the <hi>form of God;</hi> therefore unless we turn the whole Gospel into a Sham, and all its Mysteries into imaginary Dreams and Visions, and make the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, who published them, so many Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionaries, we must say, that Jesus Christ was as really in the <hi>form of God,</hi> as in the <hi>form of Man;</hi> that is, was God as really as Man, and did partake of the real Essence and Nature of the one no less than the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:93003:45"/>Again, to give you a further instance of the <hi>Socinians</hi> Dis-ingenuity in this place. As they dwindle the other words <hi>(he thought it not robbery to be equal with God)</hi> into just nothing, and endeavour to put this gloss on them, <hi>viz.</hi> That he would not boast himself equal to God, nor retain those Rays and Appearances of Divinity communicated to him, to the prejudice of the God-head, which is to pervert the Apostles plain words, and to put a contrary sence on them. So they contend, that all this <hi>6th.</hi> Verse is to be understood of Jesus Christ after he was Born, and had made his appearance among Men, that is, he was Man before he was in <hi>the form of God,</hi> or in that state in which it was no Robbery, or no Presumption and Usurpation in him to pretend an Equality with God: And if this be not to wrest the Apostles words, to make him speak Nonsence, and to give the Lye to his plain Assertions, I know not what may be said to do it. When I consider how the <hi>Socinians</hi> treat this, and other Passages of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how they rack their Invention to do force and violence to the plainest Texts: and rather than own or receive the Truth, they will father Nonsence,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93003:45"/>
Absurdities, and palpable Contradictions upon the Pen-men of Scripture: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but look upon them as willful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisters of the Truth, who are without all excuse. If one search for the Truth, but cannot find it, he is to be pitied; if he shew good will, and only holds off, because he wants sufficient Instruction, or that the Truth appears not to him with clearness and evidence, there is place for Charity; for in that case the defect is in the Judgment and not in the Will, the Head and not the Heart is to blame. But there is no place for Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it self, when one will not lay aside his Prejudices against the Truth, when he employs his Wit to raise Objections, and to find Shifts, when the plainest Assertions will not prevail, but rather than yield, will do violence to his own reason and other Mens. Such were the Scribes and Pharisees of old; they would not receive Jesus as the Messias, tho' he came at the time appointed, and with all the Evidence that could be desired. The <hi>Socinians</hi> now are rather more guilty; they also wilfully resist the Truth and the holy Spirit of God who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, and therefore deserve to be abhorred; they are among the Number
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93003:46"/>
of those false Teachers, <hi>who privily bring</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 1.</note> 
               <hi>in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them; and therefore bring upon themselves swift destruction,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks. I wish what he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins there may not hold true of these times we live in, especially amongst our selves, <hi>viz. That many shall follow their pernicious ways.</hi> There is a time, of which it is said, that every Man doth whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is right in his own Eyes; and there is a time not much unlike the other, in which Men take liberty to speak what they please, to teach and vent whatever Fancies come in their Head. When the Order and Unity of the Church is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, when its Pastors and Governours cannot exert their Authority; then the Enemy steps in, and sowes his Tares, then false Teachers arise and diffuse their Poisonous Doctrines. We have not only reason to fear this, but cause enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to bewail and lament it; for it is actually done.

                  <hi>IV.</hi> Of Iesus Christ his Pre-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, and Deity.</note> and Comfortable Truth, I need not go beyond the Text; for there it is plainly and fully asserted. For, 1. You see that here the Apostle declares Jesus Christ to have pre-existed, or to have had a Being before he was Man: for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93003:47"/>
unless he had subsisted before, it could not have been said that he took upon himself the <hi>form of a Servant;</hi> and that in so doing, he <hi>made himself of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi> for what is not in being, cannot assume to it self an Existence, nor make choice of the manner and condition of its Existence. 2. It is clear by what the Apostle saith, that the state in which he pre-existed was preferable to, and more glorious, than that, in which he was made or found in the likeness of Men; otherwise it could not be true that he made himself of no reputation when he became Man. By which expression also it appears, that the Apostle evidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs to some pre-existent state; for unless he debased himself, by submitting to be Born, he cannot be said to debase him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by any after Act; for neither his Birth nor first Years were so glorious as his last, in which he appeared as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet at least, and a very eminent one too, full of Power and Authority. 3. We see clearly here his Divinity and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, in that it is said expresly, <hi>he was,</hi> or subsisted <hi>in the form of God,</hi> and in that state thought it not Robbery to be equal with God. By subsisting in the form of God, there must be understood, 1. A
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93003:48"/>
real participation of the Divine Nature and all its essential Attributes, as Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power, Goodness, Eternity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the form of a thing is its Essence; and to partake of the form of any thing is to have the Essence of that thing. 2. This comprehends the Majesty, Glory, Authority, Splendor, and Dignity which agrees to the infinite and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Nature of God, and all those Acts, Signs, and Tokens by which the great God manifests himself to the heavenly Inhabitants: for the form of a King is not the Name or Simple Right to hold that Name; but it comprehends the Marks, Badges, and Emblems of Royal Dignity, as the Purple, the Scepter and Diadem, the Throne and Guards, and what else the Laws of Nations, or the particular Custom of Kingdoms make declarative of Majesty and Kingly Power. This is the form of a King; and he who doth not possess this, cannot be said to be in the form of a King. So the form of God, is the Glory, Dignity, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and Greatness which is due to so high a Name: And by ascribing to Jesus Christ the form of God, is declared, that he not only in himself did partake of the Divine Nature, but also that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93003:48"/>
his Incarnation he appeared in the Heavens, invested with all the Glory and Majesty proper and peculiar to God; as Creating the World, Upholding and Governing it, receiving Worship and Adoration from Angels, and the like. I might confirm this by several other Texts, but I shall only mention two. The First is, <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 3. Where it is said, that he is <hi>the brightness of God's glory, the express image of his person, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth all things by the word of his power.</hi> The other is, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 5. Where Jesus Christ maketh mention of a Glory, which he had with the Father before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World.</p>
            <p>Now, that we may know, that he held all this of right, and by vertue of his Nature, and not otherwise, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle adds, <hi>that he thought it not robbery to be equal with God,</hi> that is, he did not reckon it Usurpation, Arrogancy, or Presumption to hold an Equality with God, and consequently he is truly God. For if Jesus Christ was not by Nature God, if he was a mere Creature, though never so excellent, it would be great Robbery, and the highest Presumption and Usurpation for him to entertain the least thought of an Equality with God:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93003:49"/>
And it would be no less than Blasphemy, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> or any other to talk so of him. But seeing not only here, but every where throughout the Scripture, we find such high Speeches of Christ, which exalt him above all Creatures, even to an Equality with God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is an evident Demonstration that he is God in the strictest Propriety of Speech: For it is contrary to the Scope and Tenour of the Scripture to magnifie Men, or Angels, or any other Creature above what they are in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whatever Excellency God hath bestowed upon them: The Scriptures teach to set all Creatures, even the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, at an infinite Distance from God; It representeth as Idolatry, the exalting Creatures to a Partnership of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the conferring on them the Names, Titles, Attributes, and Worship which belong to God: It sheweth, That God will not <hi>give his Glory unto another,</hi> and is Jealous of others doing it, that he cannot endure the Appearance of it: Therefore, the Doctrine and Purpose of the Scripture is thwarted and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by those Expressions we find con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Jesus Christ, if they be not founded upon his Nature, that is, if he be not God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:93003:49"/>Consider, I pray you, that all the Revelations which God hath made were design'd to reclaim the World from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, one great Instance of which was the Deifying of Men. If therefore Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus be not God, if he be only Man (as the Socinians hold) then there is ground to impeach this last and greatest Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as destroying the Design of the former, at least of not being so wisely managed as to serve the common end of all: For in the other Dispensations, the Men whom God used as his Instruments, were carefully represented to the People to be Men of like Passions and Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with themselves; nay, their Sins and Failings are put upon Record, that none might be ensnared to conceit them Gods. But as to Jesus, there are such Representations of him, such Speeches concerning him, as may perswade and incline both learned and unlearned to think him God, and every Scruple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved which may obstruct such a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Either therefore the Design of the Gospel is, That we should receive him as God, and consequently he is such, or it doth not sufficiently prevent the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into this Error (if it be one) but on the contrary layeth a Snare for it,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93003:50"/>
and tempteth to the Belief of it, and so doth not suit with its own Design, it is not adapted to its own end; for it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snareth to the committing of Idolatry in the Person of Jesus, which is very absurd. To conclude this Point, I would fain know of any who call this Truth in Question, what would satisfie them? Supposing Jesus is God, what Evidence would they have of it? What Proofs or Demonstrations? Could Reason ask more than plain and simple Assertions, the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing to him the Name, Titles, Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and Works peculiar to the true God, and finally, the enjoining all the Worship of the outward and inward Man, which is only due to him; and therefore let us conclude, That Jesus is God, blessed for ever.</p>
            <p>Having thus fully evinced the Deity<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> Of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of Jesus, I proceed to speak of his Humanity or Incarnation, which is declared in the <hi>7th.</hi> and <hi>8th.</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. He whom we have declared to have been in the <hi>Form of God,</hi> and to be equal with God, was pleased to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Man, not by ceasing to be God, but by taking to himself the Nature of Man, a Body and a Soul as other Men, with the common natural Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93003:50"/>
and Properties of both. He did not exchange the Nature of God, for that of Man; but he assumed to the God-head the humane Nature, and became strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united with it, so that in the Person of Jesus Christ there was an Union of two Natures, the divine and humane. <hi>In him dwelt the fullness of the God-head bodily,</hi> Col. ii. 9. <hi>The word</hi> (saith St. <hi>Iohn</hi>) <hi>was made flesh,</hi> and <hi>dwelt among us.</hi> In former times this same Son of God assumed to himself a visible Shape, by means of which he appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Prophets, which he also laid aside again, when he left off talking with them. But now he has taken the humane Nature to him in Reality and Truth, and is become so personally uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it, that he is never more to lay it aside, but is to abide so for ever and ever. This is a stupendous and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible Mystery, but the Truth of it is as evident as Scripture can make it. For as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in this place, doth evidently assert the Deity and God-head of Jesus, so he sets forth the Reality of his humane Nature. <hi>He took</hi> (saith he) <hi>the form of a servant,</hi> that is, the Nature of Man, and all that is essential to it. And lest any should imagine a Difference
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93003:51"/>
betwixt him and others, he adds, <hi>he was made in the likeness of man, and found in fashion as a man,</hi> that is, he was in all things just as other Men, except Sin, which is an adventitious Quality, and not essential to our Natures. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would be as other Men, and demonstrate the Reality of his humane Nature as others; therefore he came not to the World by immediate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as <hi>Adam,</hi> but derived his Being from others. He was conceived in the Womb of a Woman, and shut up in that dark and narrow Cell, all the time which Nature has prescribed to others. He was brought forth after the ordinary manner, and treated like the Children of Men, swadled in Cloaths, laid in a Cradle, and put to suckle at the Breast. He did not grow up hastily, and ripen after an extraordinary manner, but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Stature of a Man, after the usual Years of Infancy, Childhood, and Youth. He was not nourished by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, nor was his Body exempt from the Frailties and Sufferings of other Mens: For he was no less than others subject to Hunger and Thirst, Cold and Heat, Fainting and Weariedness, and all the other things which Nature or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93003:51"/>
has made us liable to. As he espoused our Nature, so he espoused it with all its Weakness and Infirmities, and with all the Trouble which ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily attends it. Nay, which is more, he not only submitted to all the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable Infirmities of our Nature, but also to all the Misery which attends the meanest Condition of Men, which the Apostle points at by the Form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The form of a servant</hi> implies some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than the Nature of Man simply; for every Man is not a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Jesus Christ has carried his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature to Heaven, but he is not there in the Form of a Servant, for he is exalted above all. When therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, he took upon him the Form of a Servant, he remembers us of the low and contemptible Condition in which he appeared. For he came not to the World in Pomp and Splendour, in the Form of a King or some great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: Nor did he aspire after a State of Grandeur, Power, and Command over others, but chose to be born of mean and poor Parents, who were totally divested of the Glory which by their descent they might have pretended to.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93003:52"/>
He was lodged with a Carpenter, brought up in his House, learned his Trade, and wrought with his own hands for his Bread: And though it be lawful for Men to endeavour to better their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if they take honest means; yet he never made a Fortune to himself; <hi>the foxes had holes, and the fowls of the air nests, but the Son of Man had no place or possession</hi> of his own <hi>where to lay his head.</hi> When he entered upon the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of his Ministery, his Retinue was a dozen of poor Fishermen, instead of splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Walls and Schools, he taught in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarts, on the Tops of Mountains, and from the sides of small Ships and Boats. He was born under the Law, and subject to it; he wore the heavy Yoke of <hi>Moses,</hi> and religiously observed all his Laws. He was also subject to the Romans, and obliged to pay them Tribute, though he owed them none. In a word, while he was in the World, his outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was base, ignoble, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible; and in that Condition he was treated like a Slave, forced to endure more Hardship and Misery than ever any Slave was put to. He was mocked, beaten, and cruelly and unmercifully used; he was loaded with Contempt,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93003:52"/>
Injuries, Reproach, and all the Evils which Men or Devils could invent. And yet, like a good and faithful Servant, he never declined his Duty, nor shifted the Commands which were laid upon him; but <hi>humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the last Point of the Text. But I cannot enter upon it now; I must pass it till another time. The two Points I have handled are sufficient for the present; to add more would perhaps be too great a burthen to our weak Minds.</p>
            <p>I have laid before you a Mystery<note place="margin">
                  <hi>VI.</hi> Inferences from the Nature and Quality of Iesus Christ.</note> which was hid from the Foundation of the World, but is now revealed by the Gospel; a Mystery which the longest and most profound Meditation can never exhaust: A Mystery which may give to all Eternity matter of Admiration<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1st.</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> both to Angels and Men: A Mystery which (as our Apostle saith) to all that are Perfect, sheweth both the Wisdom and Power of God. These Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes were never so admirably mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested. The Power of God is clearly seen, and evidently set forth in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the World; the erecting such a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93003:53"/>
vast Fabrick out of Nothing, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conjoining its Parts, so that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interfere nor breed Confusion, and the adorning those various Parts with an infinite Variety of Creatures to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit them, is a great instance of Divine and Almighty Power. So is the Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Man, the Contrivance of his Body, the Faculties of his Soul, and the Union of two so different Species, as Matter and Spirit into one Composition. But yet it is more astonishing, and more incomprehensible to see the Creature Deified, the God-head Embodied, and the Humane and Divine Nature united together in one Person. And as the Power of God is hereby seen, so his Wisdom in contriving this Way, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Satan, to destroy Sin, to save Mankind, to declare his own Justice, and to keep up the Authority of his righteous Laws. Lord, what Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may this breed! How ought the Contemplation of this to transport us!</p>
            <p>But Admiration ought not to be the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2d.</hi> Love.</note> only Effect of this Contemplation; it should also engender Love: and indeed, if our Hearts be not hard as an Adamant, and as insensible as a Stone, it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame them with ardent love to God,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93003:53"/>
who hath so highly regarded us, as to dignifie us beyond the Angels, and any Creature in Heaven or Earth. He is infinitely above us, and standeth not in need of us, and yet he hath had a particular Concernment for us, and hath honoured us beyond Expression: And that too, when we were Rebels, and Apostates, and guilty of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Indignities done to the Deity. If he had cast some Pity upon us, or shewed some Commiseration, after we had crouched and humbled our selves, and bewailed our Sins with weeping and sorrowful Hearts, it had not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle shewed his Goodness, even in this Case his Mercy would have been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly declared. But what superabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Mercy was it, to seek us first, nay, to court and wooe us, when we hated him, and were running away from him, and that too, by no meaner Person than his own Son. <hi>God, who at sundry times, and in divers manners, spake in time past to the Fathers, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.</hi> Lord, how little did Man deserve
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93003:54"/>
this! And what Obligations doth this lay on Man, to love, fear, and serve God!</p>
            <p>Again, how should our Hearts cleave to Jesus Christ? What a strong and passionate Affection should we have for him? Who, for us, and for our sakes, made himself of no Reputation: Who, to serve us, and procure our good, laid aside the Glory which he had before the Foundation of the World, and being in the Form of God, and in a State in which he thought it not Robbery to be equal to God, did yet take upon him the Form of a Servant. All this was his own proper deed, and the meer effect of his free Love. You see all is ascribed to himself, and indeed there was no Force to constrain him; wherefore so great and so free Love in him, requires the greatest Measure of Love from us. Do you think what he has done nothing? Seems it little to you, to exchange the Form of God for the Form of a Servant? The Glory of Heaven for the Miseries of Earth? Is it nothing think you, for Omnipotency to be confined to the Weakness of a Child? For the Lord of all things to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93003:54"/>
toil like a Slave, and to wander up and down as a Beggar? For him whom the Angels worshipped, to be reproached, injured, and ill treated by Men?</p>
            <p>What stupendous Humility was here! What wonderful Condescension was this! Especially when the profit did not redound to himself, but to others who little deserved it at his hands. Has not Jesus by this, shewed himself a kind and loving Lord? Is not he that careful Shepherd, who, to get the strayed Sheep, left the Ninety and Nine who never went astray? Is it not time now to ask, what shall we render to the Lord for all this Love and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? Alas! We cannot requite him, though we give our selves, and endure the greatest Hardships for him, it is but a small and a sorry Recompence. Yet such is his Goodness, that he will accept of any sincere Returns of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from us. And we cannot make a better Return to him than by preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Dignity of our Natures, which he hath now consecrated by this Assumption of it unto the Divine. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this layeth indispensible Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on us, to sanctifie our selves, to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93003:55"/>
put away all Filthiness of the Flesh and Spirit, and to adorn our selves with all manner of Holiness. To walk in sin, to give way to Ungodliness and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lust, to pollute our selves with Excess, Uncleanness, and other Vices, is, not only to debase our selves, but to dishonour Christ. These Sins are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come now more sinful. To let the Devil, the World, and the Flesh reign in us, and as it were, incorporate with us, by the entire Possession of our Hearts, is to rob Christ, and to give away what is his Right: For though the Son of God be only united perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to one, yet he has thereby pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased a Right to all Mankind. <hi>And will ye thus requite the Lord, ye foolish people and unwise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, The Incarnation of the Son<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> Comfort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Afflictions.</note> of God may afford great Comfort to us, both against Temptation to sin, and all the Afflictions which in this Life we are liable to. He who has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our Nature upon him, and by that means is become our Kinsman and Brother is the Almighty and all-sufficient Lord, who can help us in the time of our need. He knows, by becoming Man,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93003:55"/>
our Weakness, and will pity our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and will not suffer us either to be tempted or afflicted <hi>above what we are able; but with both will send a way whereby we may escape, that we may be able to bear it.</hi> If we do not sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render our selves to Sin, it can now never prove our Ruine; if we do not yield basely, no Temptation can prove over strong; if we do not betray our selves into the hands of the Devil, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt us, for Christ is stronger than he. Ye who are afflicted consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That Jesus the Eternal Son of God, knows by his own Experience what such a State is, and cannot but have a fellow-feeling with all that are in it, and therefore will not fail to afford suitable Comfort and seasonable Relief: And if he suffer any, who love him, to fall under the hand of their Enemies and Persecutors, let us not therefore conclude, That he has deserted them, it is only that they may have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Conformity with himself, and be more capable of triumphing with him in the Kingdom of his Father. He may suffer his Servants to die, but he will not let them perish; for he has
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93003:56"/>
Power to raise them up at the last Day. Now unto him who was in the Form of God, and who for us made himself of no Reputation, and took upon him the Form of Man, even to Jesus Christ the Eternal Son of God, with the Father and Holy Ghost, be Eternal Praise and Glory.</p>

            <p>WHEN Men reflect on their own Souls, and seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider them, they are sensible that they stand in need of some better Support and Comfort, than these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things of this World; for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of these things are not adapted to the Spiritual Nature of Man, and are not sufficient to procure quiet and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the Mind. In reference to Man's inward Peace, which is true Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, <hi>Haman</hi>'s Verdict holds certainly true of all that is in the World, <hi>all these things avail me nothing.</hi> But what the World cannot give, the Scripture disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and shews the way to; therefore the Psalmist saith, <hi>in the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts only delight</hi>

               <hi>my soul;</hi> that is, his Soul neither had, nor could find true Delight, but in that light and instruction, those Divine Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Promises wherewith his Word abounded: and if the Word of God was so Useful, and of such Advantage to the Psalmist, it may be yet much more to us; for its light is brighter, it shines more fully and clearly, abounds with greater Discoveries, and reveals what was then kept hid. The Divine Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of the World and the Redemption of Mankind are now clearly revealed, from which only we have clear Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions about our Nature and Happiness. It is the Contemplation and Belief of these, which only can ease the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and pull out the sting of Sin; it is this, which can only disburden the Heart of Cares and Fears, ballance the Soul, and keep it equal, and strengthen it to endure the toil, labour and trouble of Life, without fainting and wearying. In a word, who would have at present, Peace of Mind, and the Comfort of a good Hope against the other World, should enlarge his Knowledge of these things, and Confirm his Faith in them.</p>
            <p>For this end, I am resolved to entertain you at present, both with a Discourse of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93003:57"/>
what is so very profitable and necessary, and also with sensible Signs and Tokens of it, which alas! now adays we have seldom occasion to receive. And I pray God, upon whom the success of all things depends, to grant us his Blessing, that the present Ministry of his Word and Sacraments may prove Effectual for our present Peace and future Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>As the Text is suitable to the Design and Occasion of our present Meeting; so that it may be handled more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, I shall first shew you the Person of whom the Text speaks, with the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter which is here given him. Secondly, I shall consider what is here said of him, that is, his Actions and Sufferings. Thirdly, I shall endeavour to set before you the End and Reason which moved him, and the Good which we may draw from the Consideration of what he is here said to have done.</p>
            <p>As to the First, It is evident, from<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> Of Iesus Christ, his Person, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Quality.</note> the <hi>5th.</hi> and <hi>9th.</hi> Verses, that the Person here spoken of, is none other than Jesus Christ: it is of him, that it is here said, he was found in fashion as a Man, that is, he was truly and really a Man, by all the Evidence, Proofs, and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93003:58"/>
that others appear to be Men; having a Soul and Body, of the same Nature, Qualities, Properties, and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions with others, liable to the same things, and standing in need of the same Support: And in a word, like to others in all things, except Sin; so that he may be justly and in strict propriety of Speech, stiled the <hi>man Christ Iesus,</hi> and well deserves that Epithet, which is often given him in Scripture, <hi>viz. the Son of man.</hi> As also his Actions and Sufferings are to be considered as the Actions and Sufferings of a Man. We must not (with the Ancient Hereticks) deny the Humanity of Jesus, or Fancy that all his Actions and Sufferings were only in appearance, and no wise real: for he did partake of the Humane Nature as much as any of us, and was of the like innocent Passions and Infirmities with our selves. But then again, least we think meanly of this man Christ Jesus, least we reckon no more of him than of other ordinary Men, we must remember all his Character, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that he who was at this time found in the fashion as a Man, was formerly in the form of God, and thought it not Robbery to be equal
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93003:58"/>
with God. This Son of Man was also the Son of God, the God-head dwelt in him, and both the Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature were personally united in him, and that too after such an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate manner as we see Soul and Body for composing the Person of a Man. Therefore as in respect of his God-head he is called the <hi>eternal Son of God, the only begotten of God the Father, over all God blessed for ever.</hi> And as in respect of his Man-hood or Humane Nature, he is called the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> the <hi>Son of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> the <hi>seed of Abraham,</hi> and the <hi>seed of the Woman:</hi> So because of the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Union and Conjunction of these two Natures into the one Person of Jesus Christ, he is said to be <hi>God manifested in the flesh, the word made flesh. When</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> 
               <hi>the fulness of time was come</hi> (saith our Apostle) <hi>God sent forth his Son made of a woman; made under the Law.</hi> Hence also it is, that the Attributes and Works, peculiar to the one true God, are ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to Jesus; thus he is said to have created the World, to uphold all things by the Word of his Power, to know the secret Thoughts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what was done by him is attributed to God, tho' it was only proper to the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93003:59"/>
Thus <hi>Act.</hi> XX. 28. St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>God purchased the Church with his own blood.</hi> Upon this account all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, which went before, pointed at both his Divinity and Humanity. As for instance, the very first, calling him the <hi>seed of the woman,</hi> shews his Humane Nature, and his Divinity is declared by the other Clause, which saith, that <hi>he should bruise the serpents head. Behold,</hi> (saith <hi>Isaiah</hi>) <hi>a virgin shall conceive, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 7. 14.</note> 
               <hi>bear a son:</hi> that is, a Man: but it being added, and <hi>shall call his name Immanuel,</hi> which signifies <hi>God with us,</hi> this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that he was also to be God. So his Humane Nature is set forth in these<note place="margin">9. 6.</note> words, <hi>Unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given:</hi> But his God-head no less by what follows, <hi>viz.</hi> His <hi>name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this cause also the Divine Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy towards him, after his appearance in the World, was so ordered as to attest both his Humanity and Divinity. He was conceived in the Womb of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, but by the Power of the Holy Ghost, that this Holy One which was Born might be called the Son of God. After
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93003:59"/>
his Birth he was swadled and laid in a Manger, to hold forth the quality of a Man: but at the same time Angels were sent from Heaven to declare his Birth, who sung Divine Hymns for it, that thereby might be represented his quality as God. In his Baptism, like a Man, he is dipt into Water by <hi>Iohn the Baptist:</hi> but to bear Witness of his Divinity, the Heavens open, and a voice crieth, This is my beloved Son. When he is in the Desart as a Man, he suffers Hunger and Thirst, but as a God the Angels minister unto him. And as his Death shewed him to be Man, so the darkening of the Sun, the rending of the Veil, the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the Earth, the opening of the Graves, the rising of the Dead, and his bestowing Paradise upon the Thief who died with him, were Signs that he was God. Moreover, the Truth of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Human Nature is declared and set forth by most of his Actions, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his Miracles; as the Blessing the five Loaves and two Fishes, and by that making them to multiply to the feeding of Five Thousand. The bidding the Sick take up his Bed and walk; the weeping over <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Grave, and yet raising him after he had been Four Days in it; the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93003:60"/>
sleeping in a Tempest and Storm, and the making it Calm when he was awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened.</p>
            <p>By these, and many other instances, it is evident, that the Person our Text speaks of, Jesus Christ, is both God and Man, that in him both the God-head and Humane Nature were personally united. Which (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith) is <hi>without Controversy a great Mystery,</hi> 1 Tim. iii. that is, a wonderful and an ineffable thing, which passeth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Man either to explain, or fully to comprehend. We shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to comprehend this fully till we come to the other World, where all Mysteries will end in clear Visions, and where we shall not see as it were through a Glass darkly, as at present. But yet, if at present we take a view of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, with a reference to the end to which it was adapted, we shall discover convincing Instances of the admirable and unsearchable Wisdom of God. The Design was to save lost Mankind by the means of a Mediator, who was to make an Atonement for their Sins, and so to make up the breach betwixt God and Man, as that Man might be saved, and yet neither the Honour, Justice, or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93003:60"/>
of God or his Laws impaired, so that it might be thought there was any force or necessity upon God to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to Man, as the Kings of the Earth are obliged to make Peace with their Rebellious Subjects. It were a little too bold to say, that God had no other way to compass the Salvation of Men: But sure this way is admirably contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, both for the Glory of God and the good of Mankind: Man could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire or devise a better, a more equal, a more easie Method; and it is every way honourable for God; it is made Effectual for Man; and not only the Mercy and Goodness of God do hereby abundantly appear, but also his Wisdom, Power, and Justice; and all those Attributes which may excite Fear and Reverence, or procure Love, or oblige to Obedience. Who so proper to ransom Mankind, as one of the Race, who did participate of the Humane Nature, and who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from the same Parents? Who but Man could bear the Punishment inflicted by the Law, or make that Satisfaction which the Honour and Justice of God required? Angels could not; for their Spiritual Nature makes them incapable. And what Man could have made an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93003:61"/>
for the rest? Seeing every Man was guilty in the sight of God. What Man was sufficient for, or worthy of the office of Mediator? Suppose one had all the Advantages and Excellencies which Nature could bestow, and free of Sin too, which must necessarily be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in this case; yet it would have been too much Presumption, even for such an one, to take upon him to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate betwixt God and his Rebellious Creatures. Mediators and Arbitrators ought to be either Superiour to both Parties, or at least equal to the offended Party, and independent in some manner from it, for without this Qualification they have not sufficient Authority, nor a powerful enough Influence to oblige the Parties to agree and accept of Peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this requisite Qualification excluded, not only all Men, but Angels and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from being Mediator and Umpire betwixt God and Man. As therefore it behoved our Mediator and Saviour to be Man, that he might do and suffer what was proper and incumbent, and have the Interest, good Will, and Concernment necessary to such a Person; so it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to be God, that he might be worthy of so high and honourable a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93003:61"/>
Function, and to the end his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be meritorious and effectual. And as it behoved our Mediator and Peace-maker to be thus and thus quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, so the Wisdom and Goodness of God has provided us of one with these Qualifications, and so contrived it, that he, who thought it not Robbery to be equal with God, should be made into the Likeness of Men. For this end, the Eternal Son of God became Man, who is this Jesus the Text speaks of, by whose Name we are all called. <hi>O! the Depth of the Riches both of the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge of God! How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable are his Iudgments, and his Ways past finding out!</hi> Rom. ii. 33.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Socinians,</hi> who reject this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and deny the Divinity of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and the Union of the Divine and Humane Nature in the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ, which I have made most evident from Scripture, now, and at the last Occasion, they make the Oeconomy of the Gospel to signifie little or nothing, either for the Glory of God, or the Comfort of Man: And as they give God the Lye, who has attested the Truth of this so clearly and fully, so they rob him of the Praise
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93003:62"/>
which is due to the greatest Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Goodness, and to the most wonderful Contrivance of his Wisdom. From which, and such damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies good Lord deliver us.</p>
            <p>Having considered who the Person is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> His Actions and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> of whom our Text speaks, and what is his Character, it follows next, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Method proposed, that we take into Consideration what he did and suffered, which is here represented in these Words; <hi>he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which Words we may First ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,<note place="margin">They were voluntary.</note> That all which happened to Jesus Christ in this mysterious Oeconomy, was his own Choice. His Sufferings as well as Actions are the pure Effect of his own Will; there was no force or necessity upon him to oblige his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Subjection to these things. We must not think it was with Jesus Christ as with other Men. The Birth and Quality, the State and Condition, the Death and Exit of other Men fall not under their own Cognizance, nor is the same any part of their Choice: But all is unknown to them, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon them by Nature or Providence,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93003:62"/>
or those to whom Nature and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence have subjected them: And the greatest Praise due to any Man, is that he can bear his State and Circumstances thus imposed, patiently and chearfully, though he neither would have desired them, nor yet made Choice of them, if it had been in his own Power. But as to Jesus Christ, all was his free Choice, his voluntary Act and proper Deed: The meanness of his Birth, the Contemptibleness of his State, the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of his Life, and the Shame and Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness of his Death, were all known before-hand to him, and set before him, and he freely and willingly submitted himself to them; and therefore, there is more Merit and Praise due to him than can be to any from meer Patience or Passive Obedience. <hi>Therefore, doth my father love me</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>but I lay it down of my self; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</hi> And again, he said to <hi>Pilate, thou couldst have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:93003:63"/>Secondly, It is to be considered, that<note place="margin">What his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion referrs to.</note> the Humiliation of Jesus Christ in this Verse referrs to some other thing than that which is made mention of in the former. When before it is said; he made himself of no Reputation, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs to his Pre-existent State, and God-head, and thereby is set forth his Debasement by his Incarnation: For by becoming Man, his God-head was put under the Veil of Flesh, and the Majesty and Glory which belonged to him were for so long time eclipsed; which was certainly a stupendous Debasement, and an astonishing and most wonderful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his Love to those for whom he was thus debased. But the Humiliation in the Text, is posterior to the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and referrs to what he did after he was become Man; therefore, it is said, <hi>being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is meant by <hi>humbling himself</hi> is<note place="margin">His great Obedience.</note> explained by what follows, <hi>viz. That he became Obedient unto Death,</hi> that is, he entirely subjected himself to the Will of God; and all the Methods of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and all the Contrivances of his Wisdom for manifesting his Mercy and good Will to Mankind, and for effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93003:63"/>
their Redemption and Salvation, to which he was not otherwise obliged than by his own voluntary Undertaking. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, by his Divine Nature, being equal to God, was therefore free, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and subject to none: And though, as a Man, he owed Obedience, yet being altogether free from Sin, he was not liable to the Curse of the Law, nor obnoxious to those Evils, Troubles, and Calamities which for Sin are inflicted on other men. Therefore, it was a great Act of Humility in him to submit to those things, who might have pleaded an Exemption from them. It was great Humility in him to put himself into a State of Subjection and Obedience, who by Nature was subject to none, but as God himself, supream Lord over all in Heaven and Earth. What Humility would it be in a free-born Prince, one whose Birth gave him Right to a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Crown, and Sovereign Command, and whose State and Circumstances put him in a Condition of keeping the same against all Rebellion, Encroachment, and Usurpation; I say, what Humility would it be in such a Person, for the good of his Subjects to divest himself of Majesty, to lay aside the Pretensions
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93003:64"/>
to Royalty and Sovereignty, and to put himself in the State of a Subject, in which he should be obliged to obey the Laws and Orders which he had Right to give, and which were in force only by Virtue of his own Authority! How would men stand amazed at this? And yet such, and greater Humility has Christ shewed for us men; for while he was Heir of all things, he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self empty and poor for us. When he had a sovereign Authority over all in Heaven and Earth, he became subject and obedient both to the Laws of God and men. And it was for this very end that he became man; therefore it is said of him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. <hi>mine ears hast thou opened or bored,</hi> alluding to that Custom of boring the Ears of those who resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be Servants for ever. Which St. <hi>Paul</hi> (in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews, Chap.</hi> X. 5. to render the thing clearer) hath expressed thus; <hi>a body hast thou prepared for me:</hi> And in both it is added, <hi>Lo I come, in the volume of thy Book it is written of me, to do thy will, O God, I take delight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as Obedience was the end why he became Man, so from his Birth he payed a ready, sincere, and punctual
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93003:64"/>
Obedience to the Laws of Nature, the Decrees of God, the Acts of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the Statutes of Men. In his Infancy, he was subject to his Parents; when he was grown up, he was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient both to the Roman Governours and Jewish Magistrates; he observed all the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> and was both, in Civil and Religious Matters, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Example of a chearful and universal Obedience, which ever the World saw. He did all things without murmuring, without Reluctancy; he never disputed the Reasonableness of the divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or the Justice of his Providence: But knowing, That God has an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Authority over Men, and that he can command nothing that is not just; therefore having put himself in the Condition of other Men, that is, in a State of Subjection to God, he obeyed his absolute Authority without Reserve: Nay, rather than give Scandal or Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to any to refuse Obedience, he would render it, when it was not due, and where it could not be (without Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour) exacted; nay, when he could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily have avoided it. Thus he would be baptized of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, for <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of all righteousness,</hi> though <hi>Iohn</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:93003:65"/>
refused it, and that there was no need of it for him. Therefore also, after he had convinced <hi>Peter,</hi> that he ought not to have payed Tribute; notwithstanding (said he to him) <hi>lest we offend, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened its mouth, thou shalt find a piece of Money, that take, and give unto them for me and thee,</hi> Matth. xvii. 27.</p>
            <p>It was his <hi>meat and drink to do the will of God:</hi> Nor did he take Pleasure therein, only when it was easie and about pleasant Matters, but also when the Commands were severe, heavy, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, such as Nature struggled with, and was averse to. When his Soul was exceeding sorrowful even unto Death, upon the sad Apprehensions of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, he went and prayed, <hi>O my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be possible let this Cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> And again, <hi>O my Father, if this Cup may not pass away from me, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less I drink it, thy will be done.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times free and independent Princes have subjected themselves to others; but then it was for some noble Employment, and general Command under them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they had a Prospect of getting to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93003:65"/>
themselves Glory, Praise, and Renown in the Earth. But behold, Jesus sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himself to the Condition of the meanest Servant, to Misery, Pain, Shame, Reproach, Disgrace, and all the evil, vile, and unjust Usage which the most barbarous and most wicked could invent, and which an ingenuous and noble Soul would abhorr. He yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself to be a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief; to be smitten of God, and afflicted by Men; to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised, set at nought, oppressed and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: And yet he never opened his Mouth; <hi>he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter; and as a sheep before his shear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was obedient to the death:</hi> And<note place="margin">His Death.</note> that we may the more admire this Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his, the kind of Death to which he submitted is set before us, <hi>even the death of the Cross.</hi> This was a Death well known in those times, in which the Apostle lived, and wrote this Epistle. And it was known to be the very worst kind of Death that the Laws of Men could inflict on the greatest Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors. It was a painful Death, and the more painful, because it was linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: It was so vile and shameful, that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93003:66"/>
by the Laws, none could be put to it, except Slaves, not a free man, or any of honest Birth, whatever might be their Crime. This was the Death to which Jesus surrendered himself, and he yielded to this Death, not only when there was no Mitigation of the usual Pain, Shame, and Bitterness, but also when extraordinary Pain, Shame, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Agony were superadded. Let any take a View of our Lord his Death and Passion, what went before, and what accompanied his Cross; what Treachery and Ingratitude he met with; with what Malice and Cruelty he was pursued; what base Calumnies he was loaded with; what horrid Crimes of Blasphemy, Sedition, and Conspiracy against Church and State, were falsly charged upon him; how he was deserted by his Friends, mocked by his Enemies, and despitefully used by every Body, it will be found that never any Sorrow was like unto his Sorrow, nor any Cross so grievous as his. He sustained the Wrath of God, the Weight of Sin, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Devils, and the Spite of Men. His Death was both base and bitter, sad and shameful beyond all Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: But withal it was voluntary.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93003:66"/>
Which leads me to the last thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
            <p>Which was to shew the End and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> Why Iesus abased and humbled himself.</note> why Jesus, who was the Son of God, thus abased and humbled himself, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cross. In Prosecution of this it cannot be expected, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I can mention all, or insist at large on any; for the time allowed will not suffice for such a Task. I shall propose briefly some few, which may satisfie, and leave the Prosecution of them to your private Meditations.</p>
            <p>In general then all this was done, for<note place="margin">For the Glory of God and Man's Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note> setting forth the Glory of God, and for effectuating the Redemption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; therefore it is called the Mystery of Redemption; and the Gospel which declareth it, is called the <hi>word of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> And for this cause that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Person (of whom we have been speaking) is called <hi>our Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Behold</hi> (said the Angel to the Shepherds) <hi>I bring to you tidings of great joy, which shall be to all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Unto you is born this day, in the City of David, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord,</hi> Luke ii.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:93003:67"/>But to be more particular. This was<note place="margin">To demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate God's Love and Mercy.</note> done, to declare and demonstrate the infinite Love and Mercy of God, who rather than that Mankind should perish, would suffer his own Son, and his only Son to be thus abased and humbled. <hi>God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son unto it, that the world through him might not perish, but that those who believe might have eternal life.</hi> John iii. 16. and <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 8. It is said, <hi>That God commendeth his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.</hi> Mankind is but one part of the Creation: And though he make a considerable Figure in this lower World, yet if we knew all the other parts of the Creation and their Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, perhaps we should find him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and inconsiderable; he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly inferiour to the Angels; what a Demonstration therefore is it of the Mercy of God to his Creatures that he would not suffer such inconsiderable ones to perish? But to prevent their eternal Ruin was pleased to give his Son to do and suffer so many things for us. And how doth it heighten his Love to us the Sons of Men, that he has shewed more Kindness to us than to the Angels, who
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93003:67"/>
by Nature are so much better than we! He passed by the Angels, and has had pity on us; he has left them to perish in their Apostacy and Disobedience, but has sent his Son to save us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Hereby God hath declared<note place="margin">His Iustice and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> his Justice, his uncontroulable Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the Vigour of his Laws, and the Certainty of his Threatnings. By this it appears, that God is just, and will not clear the guilty; that he will not suffer his Authority to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor his Laws to be broken; and that what he peremptorily threatens to the breakers of them shall come to pass. Heaven and Earth may pass away, but one Jot or Title of the Law shall not fall; and rather than the Transgression of it escape unpunished, he will make his own Son an Example. Like that King, who having threatned the Loss of both Eyes to such as should be guilty of Adultery: And his Son having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that Crime, he, (to keep his Royal Word, to maintain the Vigour of his Laws, and to strike Terrour into his Subjects, but withal to shew some Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to his Son) pulled out one of his Son's Eyes, and gave another of his own. God would not remit the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93003:68"/>
of Sin, but to save Sinners he laid the Weight of the Punishment on his own Son.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hereby is declared the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous<note place="margin">The heinous Nature of Sin.</note> Nature of Sin, how odious it is in the Sight of God, how impossible it is to be reconciled to him, or to expect his Favour, unless it be expiated. Let Fools now make a mock of Sin if they dare. Let Men consider what the Son of God hath done and suffered to take away the Sins of the World; let them call to mind what Obedience, what Agony, what Shame and Pain the Holy and Innocent Jesus hath been put to; what it hath cost him to take away the Guilt of it, and to free Men from the Punishment of it: And when they have seriously considered all this, let them say (if they can) whether Sin be to be sported with, whether it may be safely cherished and indulged.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This setteth forth the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity<note place="margin">The Dignity of Humane Nature.</note> of the Humane Nature. How high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is that to be esteemed, which God has thought worthy of so strict an Alliance with himself, and to save which, the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God, the Second Person of the blessed Trinity, he who thought it not Robbery to be equal with God, even he
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93003:68"/>
was pleased to make himself of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, to take upon him the Form of a Servant, to humble himself, and to become obedient unto Death. This is Immortal Honour unto Mankind, which the Devils envy, and which the highest Angels admire, and therefore it is said that even <hi>they desire to look into it.</hi> This is the Glory of Man, and that which sets him farthest above all his Fellow Creatures in this World: The Bodies of other Animals are not much inferiour to ours, for they are all of almost the same Nature, Composition, and curious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance; and whatever be the inward Principle of their Life and Actions, whatever it be that guides them, their Actions are more regular than ours, and certainly the Effects of greater Reason, Knowledge and Wisdom, than what we can by Speculation, Study, or Experience arrive at. But neither Cherubim nor Seraphim, nor any of the Celestial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Intelligent Beings can boast a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege above, or even equal to what Man hath by the Incarnation of the Son of God, and what followed upon it. <hi>He took not on him the nature of Angels, but the seed of Abraham.</hi> God has espoused our Nature, and thereby made us more
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93003:69"/>
honourable than other Creatures; and as we have by this the highest Honour, so all the Happiness that can be desired: For what greater Happiness! What can we desire more, than what the Love and Friendship and Favour of God can bestow?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, As this shews the Dignity of<note place="margin">The Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it.</note> the humane Nature, so wherein the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it consists; even in a perfect Obedience unto God, such as we shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Jesus Christ did pay unto him. <hi>Adam</hi> ruined the humane Nature by his Disobedience, Jesus Christ has repaired it by being entirely obedient even unto Death, and no Man can arrive at Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but by the Imitation of Jesus in a perfect Subjection to the Will of God. To make Provision for the Flesh to fulfil the Lusts thereof, is never to aim higher than Beasts and inferiour Animals; to walk by Sense, will stifle our Reason; to follow the Imaginations and Devices of our own Hearts, or only what our own Reason suggests, we shall never surmount a natural imperfect State, nor have any other Perfection than what cometh from our selves: But if we give our selves up to the Conduct of God, if we will follow his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93003:69"/>
Will and Providence, and never dispute or cavil at his Pleasure, we shall far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow our natural State, our minds shall receive the Light of Divine Illumination, our Spirits shall be fortified by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Spirit of God, and we shall at last become Partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is as high as any can aspire.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I will only give one Instance<note place="margin">The Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iesus Christ.</note> more, which is that the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, his Obedience and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, were appointed to the end that he might merit the Glory, Honour, and sovereign Power which God had design'd for him before the Foundation of the World. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (as it follows our Text) <hi>God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every Name, that at the Name of Iesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that Iesus Christ is Lord to the Glory of God the father.</hi> And for this Cause, let us not with some rebellious Spirits, quarrel at this Divine Oeconomy; let us not dispute the Reasonableness of his eternal Purposes, nor abdicate him to whom God has given sovereign Power; let us not speak against his Person, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93003:70"/>
or the Acts of his supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: But as Interest and Duty oblige us, let us be subject unto him, let us love, fear, worship and obey him. This is the way to work out your Salvation, and if you follow this Method, God will work in you to will and to do of his good Pleasure.</p>
            <q>Now our Lord Iesus Christ himself, and God even our Father, which hath loved us and hath given us everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Consolation and good Hope, through Grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good Word and Work.</q>
            <closer>Amen.</closer>

            <p>THERE is in many too great an Inclination after such Shews and Sights, and such kind of Conversation, as may divert. them with Mirth and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93003:71"/>
Laughter: Whereas the Contemplation of that which doth affect the Heart with Grief and Sadness is more profitable. For (saith the Wise Man) <hi>it is better to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>go to the house of mourning, than to the house of feasting. Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, the heart is made better.</hi> And from hence he observes, <hi>That the heart of the wise is in the house of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</hi> The Spirit of Fools is Light and Frothy, and only fond of Airy things; whence it is that they are in love with the House of Feasting, where ordinarily there is more Noise than good Sence, more of foolish Jesting and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Mirth, than of solid Instruction: But the Wise preferr the House of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; because it adds to their Wisdom, rendring them serious, and giving them a right sense both of themselves and other things. Now to make us thus Wise, the Reasonable Custom of the Ancient Church appointed this Season to be a time of Mourning and Sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Practice of the Catholick Church at present proposeth to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration this Day, that which may, and will (if any thing can) affect our
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93003:71"/>
Hearts, and move the Passions of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Grief: for that Soul must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be stupid and senseless, and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Grief, who doth not shew it upon the representation of the Cross of Christ, his sad Death and Sufferings, of which this Day is the Anniversary.</p>
            <p>It is indeed, long since this was done, but yet it is never to be forgotten. The Death and Sufferings of Jesus should carefully be kept in Memory; for tho' these things happen'd many Ages ago, yet we shall find that we our selves were Accessory to them; and therefore if not upon Jesus's account, yet at least upon our own we ought to lament and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail his Death and Passion, that the shedding of innocent Blood may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and not charged upon us. Some can look upon the Calamities and Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of others, and never be concern'd; they are only mov'd, when Trouble and Misery draw near themselves. Now even Persons of this temper may see it their Interest to mourn on this occasion; for sad and heavy Judgments are ready to fall down upon those who are guilty of the Blood of Jesus, and who do not repent of it. So that if there be any who have such hard Hearts, that they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93003:72"/>
cannot be affected with the Cross and Sufferings of Jesus Christ, if his Shame, and Sorrow, and Pangs will not pierce them, yet sure they must not only be hard but lifeless, without all sense and feeling, if they be Proof against their own Doom, and unmov'd at the sight of their own Calamities: who will not commiserate the Sufferings of the Holy and Innocent Jesus, may yet take Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on themselves; if we will not shed Tears for his Sake; Let us do it for our own, as he advis'd the Women who follow'd him to the place of his Crucifixion. <hi>Daughters of Ierusalem, weep not for me, but weep for your selves and for your Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cross of Christ has too large Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions to be commensurated all at once; his Sufferings were so many and so great, that we cannot take them up at one view, nor is it possible to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in one Hour the History of our Lord's Passion: wherefore I have fix'd on one particular Passage for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Meditation, which hath this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that it contains Instructions how to moderate our Grief and Passions on this occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:93003:72"/>For the more profitable handling of this Passage, and to make it work the better upon our Affections, these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars are to be observ'd. First, The Womens Behaviour, and the Reason or occasion of it. Secondly, Our Lord's Check to their Grief upon his Account. And Thirdly, His requiring it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it necessary for themselves and for their Children.</p>
            <p>As to the First: It is said of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</note> that they <hi>bewailed and lamented him.</hi> And it doth not appear that any other did so: or if any besides them were affected with Grief, they either conceal'd it, or made no such Publick and Remarkable Expressions of it. The City was full of People at this time, because of the approaching Feast, and (as is usual on such occasions) a very great Multitude followed our Saviour to the place of Execution; some out of Curiosity, merely to see what was done, others to glutt and satisfie their Malice and Revenge: But only these Women went out of Compassion. His Disciples had forsaken him; <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and other Persons of Quality, who believed in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, absconded themselves at this time, they dissembled their Sentiments, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93003:73"/>
would not appear for him, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aw'd by the fear of the Priests and Scribes, and the giddy furious Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude who were now gathered into Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuary Mobbs, demanding him to be Crucified; and who, in this their Rage, were ready to fall upon any that seemed to oppose it, as Enemies to the Publick Good of the Nation. None offer'd to Plead for him, nor did there remain any to commiserate him save these Women in the Text; who, by their Weeping and Lamentation did Remonstrate against the Madness of the People, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice of the Scribes, Pharisees, and Priests.</p>
            <p>None of the Circumstances of either<note place="margin">A Comfort to Women.</note> our Lord's Birth or Death are acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, but were, ordained before-hand by the Infinite Wisdom of God, to give us either Comfort or Instruction: So this Constancy and generous Publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of the Women must not pass unobserved. For as the Revealing of his Birth to the Wise Men in the East, was a Comfort to the Gentile World, and a sign that they were to be called to a share of that Salvation which he brought with him; So God ordered the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of these Women for a Comfort to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93003:73"/>
all their Sex; God gave them this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Love to his Son, which prompted them to wait upon him, even to the last minutes of his Life, when he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted by all the rest of the World, to bewail his Sufferings when Men were mocking and scoffing him; and finally, to seek him early the Third Day at his Grave, that they might do him honour there: They were made Compassionate Witnesses of his Death, and the first Messengers of his Joyful Resurrection, to assure the Faith of Women, and to confirm their Hope of Salvation by Christ, tho' it was by Woman that Sin entered amongst Men. The Devils who were the Authors of Sin are Reprobated, and are never to find Mercy: but Women have found Grace in the sight of God: And tho' <hi>Adam was not deceived, but the Woman being deceived was in the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, notwithstanding she shall be saved</hi> (by him that was Born and died) <hi>if they continue in faith, and charity and holiness with sobriety,</hi> 1 Tim. ii. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>Again, This passage informs us of<note place="margin">An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in dangerous times.</note> the wise Providence of God, who never leaves himself without a Witness amongst Men: but always, even in the times of greatest Defection, either from Truth
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93003:74"/>
or Holiness; in the midst of the greatest corruption of Doctrine, and greatest wickedness of Manners, he preserves a Remnant pure from the publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, and also moves some, more or less, to reprove such General Apostacy from the Principles or the Practice of Religion, either directly by open and plain Rebukes, or indirectly by their own manifest Stedfastness. At this time the Rulers, Priests, and People were combined in a Conspiracy against the Lord, and against his Anointed; they were all of them persecuting him to Death, as an Enemy to God, Church, and State, and the common Interest of the Nation. So bent was the Multitude upon this Wickedness, that to shew their Inclinations, and to press the <hi>Roman</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours to it, they gathered themselves together tumultuously, and not only officiously consented to his Death, but sought it as a favour to themselves and the Nation. Such was the Malice and Prejudice against Christ, that like a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent it carried all away with it, some few only excepted (and they were but very few) who kept their Integrity, and detested this Villany. But the few, who did so lurked in private, and as they
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93003:74"/>
did not concur, so neither did they oppose the Multitude nor their wicked Designs. But behold, while Courage and Integrity failed amongst Men, some few Women appear, abhorr the Villainy, and by publick bewailing and lamenting testifie against it. Fear might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them, if they had considered their own weakness, and the madness of the Multitude at this time; they might have apprehended that their tears would have provoked the Multitude to trample them under foot: but Love knows no Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; nor did these Women consider the Difficulties they run, by paying their Just respects to their hated and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but very Innocent Lord. And from the Example of those Good Women, let us learn how to behave our selves in times of Danger and Difficulty; let them teach and encourage us to a stedfastness in the Truth, and to a constant adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that which is Just and Right, tho' all the World about us take a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary course, and that Error and Iniquity have the common Vogue. Politicians will tell you, that <hi>Dum furor est in cursu cedendum est furori,</hi> that it is Wisdom to yield to the Evils which are not in our power to remedy; that it is safer to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93003:75"/>
comply with Peoples inclinations when violent, tho' Unjust and Unreasonable, than to resist them; for by opposing them we provoke their Fury, and hazard our own Ruin, whereas by complying we leave our selves in a capacity of recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying things at another occasion. And so by these, and the like Maxims, Men are taught to turn with every Tide, to serve different and contrary Interests, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of particular ties and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and to give way to the greatest Injustice for pleasing Men, and diverting the Wrath and Fury of a prevailing Party. But these Maxims are calculated with a respect to Mens temporal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, rather than for keeping a good Conscience; for they who would do that and please God, must resolve never to turn their Back upon that which is right, or to consent to that which is Evil. Indeed every one has not a Call to resist a wicked Course, or to punish the Authors and Promoters of it; nor is it in the power of private or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Persons to do it: but it is in every Man's power to withdraw his consent and refuse his concurrence. Tho' we cannot hinder others, yet we ought to keep our own hands clean; and as Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93003:75"/>
directs us, according to the Nature and Importance of the thing, we should own that which we are perswaded is right and good; which if we cannot favour otherwise, we should at least (with the Women here) bewail and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the loss, and miscarriage, and the wickedness of Men which occasions it to be so; though by this we incurr a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Odium, and run other Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies. <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells of a certain Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that being questioned how she could attempt a thing Prohibited by the Tyrant under whom she lived, and which would highly incense him? She answered reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, <hi>It pleaseth the Gods, with whom I intend to live longer than with the Tyrant.</hi> If our Design be to live with God for ever; if Eternal Life or his Favour be our Expectation, we should search out his Good, Perfect, and Acceptable Will, and cleave to that, whatever the World think of it. And if the fear of Men begin to prevail, we should consider how much wiser it is to fear God. <hi>I say unto you, my friends, be not afraid of them which kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom you shall fear; fear him who after he hath killed, hath power to cast</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:93003:76"/>
               <hi>into hell; yea, I say unto you, fear him.</hi> Luke xii. 4, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Women who are<note place="margin">The Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Womens Sorrow.</note> said to bewail and lament Christ as they followed him. The words in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal import the greatest measure of Grief and Sadness, and are never used but when the very height of it is expressed: the Consternation of Sinners at the Day of Judgment, their sad Apprehensions of the Terror of that Day, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Effects it worketh in them, are set forth by the same words, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxiv. and <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 7. So that it seems, the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of these was not small, nor the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of it mean; their Hearts were swelled up with Grief; their Souls were inwardly pierced with excessive Sorrow, which abundantly appeared by all the ways by which People use to express their sorrowful Thoughts, and sad Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions; smiting their Breasts and rending their Garments, which the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, signifieth; howling and mourning with the Voice, which is the signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Now, it will be worth the while, and<note place="margin">The Cause of it.</note> very proper for the Day, to consider what it was that moved them to all this. Indeed, the Hearts of Women by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93003:76"/>
are soft and tender, and their Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are sooner, and more easily moved than those of Men: but if we view the Object of their Grief, we will not think it strange, that these Women did thus bewail and lament; it will be much more strange, if we can restrain our Passions, and refrain from weeping at the account of it: and yet all know, that the sight of a thing toucheth more sensibly than the hearing of it doth. These Women had seen all which our Lord had hitherto suffered at the hands of wicked and sinful Men, and had lively Apprehensions of what he was yet to suffer; for the Death he was going to, was known and ordinary, but known only to be a vile, shameful, and most painful Death, as upon other accounts, so upon this, that it was not a speedy but a lingering Death. If they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were not Witnesses, yet they well enough understood, how he was seiz'd in the Garden as a Thief, when he was most serious in Devotion and Prayer, and dragged from thence to the High-Priest's Palace, which ought to have been a Refuge to Innocence, and a Safeguard against Indiscretions and an Unmerciful Threatment: But alas! even there they
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93003:77"/>
saw him unjustly used, and most indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly Handled; falsely Accused, ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally convicted of Blasphemy and other Crimes, and all the rules of Discretion, Civility, and Good Manners broken in treating him. He was Spit upon and Buffetted, Blindfolded and smitten on the Cheek, with a, <hi>Prophesie who it was that smote thee?</hi> By the break of Day he was hurried away to <hi>Pilate,</hi> from him to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> and back again to <hi>Pilate,</hi> every one making their Sport of him. After some Mock-Formalities of Law and Justice, these Women saw him delivered to the Roman Soldiers, (a sort of Men who took Pleasure in Blood and Cruelty) and then they beheld him dressed like a Fool, with a Crown of Thorns, a Purple Robe, and a Reed instead of a Scepter, because he was said to be the King of the <hi>Iews.</hi> They saw him strip'd of these Ornaments of mocked Majesty, and unmercifully Whipt and Scourged by the same Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, with Cords, till Furrows were made in his Back, and the Blood ran down his innocent Body: And when all this would not satisfie the Malice of his Enemies, they saw him given in exchange for a Villain and Notorious Robber, and against all Law and Reason, meerly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93003:77"/>
upon the importunity of an unreasonable Multitude, condemned to a Violent and Cruel Death; and contrary to all Equity, denied any respite or breathing time, but instantly forced away to the place of Execution, and made to bear that Cross on which he was to hang and pine away his Life in Pain and Torment.</p>
            <p>Represent all this to your selves, and consider if it be not sad and doleful; who would not shed Tears at such a Sight? May not this force Tears either from Man or Woman? Suppose Jesus had been as bad and criminal as his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would have made him, yet such cruel and unmerciful Usage called for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion. <hi>Quod non homini, detur humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati.</hi> Even when it is necessary to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Law, and to execute Justice, Pity should be shewn to the Offender. But if Pity and Compassion be due to Calamity and Misery, even when there is guilt to deserve it, what should be shewn when there is no Guilt at all? If it should touch our hearts to see any of our Fellow-Creatures suffer, though it be no more than the just Punishment of their Sins, how should we be affected? How should our Passions be stirred, when unspotted Innocence and Vertue suffer?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:93003:78"/>These good Women knew, that Jesus had no Crime, they saw his very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could not fix any upon him, and that they were baffled when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to prove any against him. Nay, he was not only innocent, but also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly righteous; he not only was guilty of no Ill, but also he was one who went up and down doing good, and had done many great, and good, and wonderful Works. The Malice of his Enemies was not occasioned by any Fault of his, but only by the Truth, and Purity, and Powerfulness of his Doctrine, and by the Holiness and Integrity of his Life, both which reproved their Errors, their false Teaching, their Hypocrisie, and their Covetousness.</p>
            <p>Add to all this, his Quality, which was the greatest in the World: For tho' these Women were not yet instructed fully about his eternal Generation, nor yet perhaps believed him to be the true Son of God, equal with the Father, (as the Catholick Church doth teach, and hath always taught, and which must be believed, if the Scriptures be true and genuine) yet they believed him a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and knew him to be a good Man, mighty in Word and Deed; they were
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93003:78"/>
perswaded that he was the Messiah, <hi>and trusted that it was he who should have redeemed Israel.</hi> Judge, I pray you then, what cause of Grief was here? The greatest Dignity trampled upon and affronted! The greatest Innocence condemned! The greatest Righteousness punished! The greatest Meekness re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled! The greatest Charity and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence persecuted! The Man who preached the Word of God with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; who shewed them the true way to Life; who comforted them in their Affliction; who cured their Diseases; who restored their Children and Friends to Life; who fed them with Miracles; and from whom they expected the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation promised by all the Prophets; to see this Man mocked, scourged, and put to Death before their Eyes! Lord, what matter of Grief was this! What Occasion for Weeping, Mourning and great Lamentation!</p>
            <p>But though all this was more than sufficient to afflict and grieve the minds of these Women, yet there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than all this, which Jesus suffered, which they knew not; he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in his Soul and Spirit, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Hand of God, which none was
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93003:79"/>

Inward Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Disturbance of the Soul is much more sad and weighty than Pains and Torments in the Body. <hi>The spirit of a man may sustain his Infirmity, but a wounded spirit who can bear?</hi> Jesus was at this time drinking the Cup of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Wrath and Displeasure against Sin, and the Sin not of one or two, but of all Mankind. What it was that he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in his Soul, on this Account, we do not know; but that he did suffer in that part is certain; and that he suffered heavily, appears from his sweating Blood in the Garden in a cold Night; from his praying three times, <hi>Father, if it be thy will let this Cup pass from me;</hi> and from these disconsolate Words which his inward Sorrow and Anguish extorted, while he hanged upon the Cross, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!</hi> The Sufferings of Jesus cannot be reckoned up; no Man can describe, no Tongue can express all the Particulars of his bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Agony, and bloody Passion, and cruel Death. The Words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet are applicable to him; and as they were spoken prophetically of him, so in him only they were fully accomplished. <hi>Is it nothing to you all ye that pass by?</hi>

               <hi>Behold, and see, if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.

            <p>This is not a total Prohibition of weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">The Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition not absolute.</note> for Christ; the Negative Particle (<hi>Not</hi>) is not always to be taken so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily;

            </p>
            <p>However, we should so bewail his<note place="margin">The glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Effects of Christ's Death.</note> Death as to keep within a certain Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: Not as those good Women, in the Text, who apprehended that all their Hope, and all their Comfort would have perished in his Death. The Death of Christ is not to be lamented like the Tragical end of <hi>Pompey, Caesar,</hi> and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93003:80"/>
other Heroes of the World, whether Ancient or Modern, whose Deaths were sad and convincing Instances of the Changeableness of Fortune, of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the World, and of the Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of humane Affairs. When they died, their vast Designs and Projects were defeated, and the Expectation of their Friends frustrated; in that very Day all their Thoughts perished; they instantly ceased to be either the Hope of their Friends, or the Dread and Terrour of their Enemies, and left nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them save a faint Memory and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Conjectures. But the Death of Jesus Christ is quite another thing: As our Lord still liveth, so he reigneth, and it was by his Death that he advanced and secured his Kingdom. His Death was glorious, and the Issue of it was eternal Praise to God and himself, and everlasting Advantage to all the World. Never any Triumph was so illustrious as the Death of Christ: The greatest tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the World, was only over Beasts and weak Men, and set forth with the Spoils of earthly Kingdoms: But Jesus at his Death triumphed over Devils, he conquered Hell and the Grave, made Spoils of Principalities and all the Powers
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93003:81"/>
of Darkness. By his Death he quenched the Fire of God's Wrath, blunted the Edge of the Law, weakned the Strength of Sin, loosned the Bands of the Grave, ransomed Sinners, and opened the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven to Penitents and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. His Death gave Life to the World, and renewed Nature; so that the Face of things is altered ever since. Thus, as upon one Account there is Reason to lament the Death of Jesus Christ, so up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, there is no less Reason to rejoice; for by it God is glorified, Jesus exalted, and Mankind saved.</p>
            <p>But when we leave off to mourn for<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> Why Iesus Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth us to mourn rather for our selves than him.</note> Christ, we should continue to mourn for our selves: So you see here, that our Lord biddeth the Women moderate their Grief upon his Account, but still requireth it for themselves, which was the third thing proposed. <hi>Weep not for me, but for your selves.</hi> And very good Reason; alas! There is more than suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cause for this Mourning: For tho' Jesus Christ has merited Salvation for us, yet our natural Wretchedness, our Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and Actual Guilt is no less than it was; both which are deplorable, and neither of them can ever be enough la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. And if we are not sensible of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93003:81"/>
the heinous Nature of these, let us look upon the persecuted, reviled, mocked, buffetted, scourged, and crucified Jesus; let us call to mind his bitter Death and Sufferings, and these will instruct us: For all these things befell him for our sake, and upon our Account. The Jews, who crucified him, and put him to so vile and shameful a Death, were only the Instruments: But otherwise every one of us, as well as they, were the Cause and Occasion of all that evil which befell him. They are to be considered only as the common Executioner, who executeth the Law and the Will of the Judge, and consequently our Rage and Indignation should not be against them, but against the Crimes which caused and required so heavy a Punishment. Now, they were not his own Crimes for which he suffered; for he knew no Sin, neither was Guile found in his Mouth; he was a Lamb without Spot and Blemish: But he was made Sin for us. <hi>Surely</hi> (as the Prophet speaks) <hi>he hath born our griefs, and carried our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Is. 5. 3, 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement of our peace was laid upon him, and he received stripes, that we might be</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:93003:82"/>
               <hi>healed.</hi> Let us not go about to clear our selves of all Accession to the Death of this good and righteous Person, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are come to the World so long after it fell out, and are not of the Race of those who laid wicked and violent hands on him: For though Jesus died but once, yet he did bear the Sins of all, and was charged with the Sins of all that went before, or shall come after. From the time that he was set apart to be the Sacrifice for Sin, he bears the Iniquity of Men; and that is from the beginning; wherefore he is called <hi>the Lamb slain from the Foundation of the World,</hi> that is, appointed to be slain. And therefore our sins come in among the rest; and consequently we have all Reason to deplore his Death, and to bewail our own Wretchedness and Sin, which was in part the Cause of it. O ye Children of Men, ye of the sinful Race of <hi>Adam,</hi> come and behold the wretched and deplorable State of your Nature; look upon the Cross, and let thine Eyes see Jesus bleeding and dying on it, and then consider that Blood was shed to wash away thy natural Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and his Life taken, to redeem thee from Death. O how unreasonable!
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93003:82"/>
How insolent a thing is Pride in Man! Art thou Proud, who hast an evil Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease cleaving to thee, and inherent to all thy race, which cannot be cleansed but by the precious Blood of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God? Art thou vain, who art born such a slave, that nothing could have ransomed thee, except the Death and Sufferings of the Lord of Life and Glory? Pride, Arrogance, and Boasting are no wise suitable to Persons of our Condition, but Mourning and Weeping are very proper, especially considering the guilt we have contracted since our coming to the World; the heinousness of which the Cross of Christ will also shew us: for that heavy Cross was laid on him to take away the guilt of those Sins which we daily commit. The Son of God was humbled and Crowned with Thorns, to make atonement for our Pride and Ambition; he was stript na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, because of our Covetousness; he was unmercifully treated, that he might bear the Punishment of our Revenge and Cruelty towards our Brethren. The inward agony of his Soul was occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our wanton Mirth and Lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; and that he might be a Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our Excess and Riot, there
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93003:83"/>
was nothing left him but Vinegar and Gall to drink. His Bowels, his Hands and Feet were pierced upon the account of our Oaths and Blasphemies; In a word, he was mocked, had no pity shewed him, was Scourged and put to Death, contrary to Law, Justice, and Equity, because we are false and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous, and have no respect to the Commands of God. Ye Fools, who make a mock of Sin, and who think it but a Sport to commit Iniquity, come hither, be instructed, and learn to be Wise. Is the Shame and the Pain? Is the Agony and Grief? Is the Death, and are the unspeakable Sufferings of Jesus the Son of God only a Sport? Are these things only matter of Laughter? Has any the Impudence either to say it, or to think it? No, sure. But then, if these be bitter Sport, what shall we think of our Sins which produce it? for the Sufferings of our Lord are only the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of our Sins. Doth it not trouble every honest and thinking Man, when he is so unfortunate as to be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of any Evil and Mischief to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Casual Murther or Manslaughter by an accidental Rencounter, the throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Stone, the shooting of a Bow
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93003:83"/>
or Gun, or the like, do not infer guilt, the Actors are innocent when they have no design of that Nature in their head; and yet no Man, who hath not lost Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, but will be affected when any such Misfortune falls in his hands, and his Grief will be so much the greater as the Person whose Death is occasioned is worthy and deserving. What cause of Grief then have we? who not acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, but wittingly and willingly, by our deliberate Sins and Transgressions have drawn Death on the Innocent and Righteous Jesus; and that too the worst of Deaths, the most shameful, the most painful, and the most bitter Death of the Cross? Have we not reason to weep for our selves? Can we ever bewail enough either our misfortune or wretchedness by Nature, or our guilt through our actual Transgressions? Certainly we should la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our condition on all occasions, should set apart times for it, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at occasions of this Nature, when our guilt and the sad Effects of it is represented to us, we should mourn and weep. This is the only way to clear our selves, to lessen our guilt, and to keep innocent Blood from being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon us. <hi>Blessed are they that</hi> thus
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93003:84"/>
               <hi>mourn, for they shall be comforted. They who sow in tears, shall reap in joy.</hi> Jesus shall bear the Iniquities of those who regret his Death, and their own guilt which caused it, and made it necessary; his Blood shall wash away their guilt, and his Death shall prevent their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death, <hi>for he who knew no sin, was made sin for us, that we might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the righteousness of God through him,</hi> 2 Cor. v.</p>
            <p>But as the Death and Sufferings of Jesus Christ procureth Mercy to the humble and Penitent, so his Blood cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for vengeance upon the hardned and impenitent. Which leadeth me to<note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> The dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effects of the death of Iesus Christ upon the Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</note> the last thing in the Text, for upon this account he added, <hi>and weep for your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for behold the days are coming,</hi> &amp;c. by this intimating that the Imprecations of the People were ready to light upon them: for as they cried out and wished, <hi>his blood be upon us and our Children;</hi> so to revenge it, sore and heavy Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities were impending over the City and the whole Nation. Jesus spoke not these words from any Spirit of desire of Revenge, nor out of any complacency at those sad Evils which were to befall them for the Injuries done to himself. It
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93003:84"/>
is a fault which too many are guilty of, when they think themselves wronged, and cannot at present either revenge or remedy it, they delight and please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the thoughts of God's reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their quarrel. But Jesus was far from this temper; for we find in the <hi>19th.</hi> of this Gospel, That <hi>when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the City, he wept over it,</hi> out of Compassion of those Evils which he saw would come upon it. And they who have the same Mind in them which was in him, will neither desire the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Enemies, nor rejoice at it; but will both pray against it, and fear and tremble when they see it unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But our Lord uttered these words to testifie his Divinity and Godhead, and his Love and good Will even to those sinful Men; his Divinity in that he knew what was to come; for none knoweth future things but God alone; his Love and good Will in that he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned them of their Danger, that being forewarned they might (if possible) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prevent it, or obtain a delay and suspension of it.</p>
            <p>When he bids them weep for their Children, he doth not mean the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of these Women only or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93003:85"/>
but the whole Generation of the <hi>Iews;</hi> for he speaks to those Women in the Name of the whole Inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or rather of all the People of <hi>Iudaea;</hi> therefore they are called <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Ierusalem,</hi> which is as much as to say <hi>Israelites;</hi> for <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was the Chief or Mother-city, and to be stiled after it did import their relation to, and interest in that state. The word <hi>Behold,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the certainty of what he foretells, by saying, <hi>the days are coming,</hi> he lets them know that the Calamity approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth and is not far off, as indeed it fell out within Forty Years. The greatness and dreadfulness of that Calamity he holds out, by telling that it shall be then said, <hi>Blessed are the barren, and the womb that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</hi> For these words are not to be taken absolutely, but with a respect unto these Evil days. In times of Peace, in the days of Prosperity it is a great Blessing and Comfort to have Children; and especially it was thought so among the People of the <hi>Iews:</hi> But in times of grievous Trouble and sad Calamity, when War, or Famine, or Pestilence rageth, they who have Children, are more heavily afflicted than those who
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93003:85"/>
want them: for besides the Evils which they suffer in their own Person, they suffer also in the Persons of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and are affected with their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. Moreover, Women who are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Child, or who have young Ones sucking at their Breast, cannot so easily escape Calamities, or provide against them as others. Some also do think that this may have a particular reference to what afterwards fell out at the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> viz. That during the strictness of the Siege, some were reduced to that strait, that to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their own Lives they Eat the flesh of their own Children, which could not but be very grievous to Parents. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is to be interpreted not with any relation to Peoples Spiritual or Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal State; for in respect of that, there is no difference betwixt the having and wanting Children: but it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood wholly as to this Life, and that too, only in relation to Times of great Trouble and sad Calamity.</p>
            <p>As to what follows, <hi>that then they shall begin to say to the Mountains, fall on us, and to the Hills, cover us:</hi> This is a further intimation of the dreadful Calamity of these Days, for People shall
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93003:86"/>
then be in such Consternation and Fear, that they shall wish Death rather than Life, and any kind of sudden Death, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to live to see, and feel such unspeakable Misery. And as all this was foretold here, and <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. so whoever is pleased to read <hi>Iosephus</hi> his History will find, That all was actually accomplished upon <hi>Flavius Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> his Son their Invading <hi>Iudaea;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieging and Sacking of <hi>Ierusalem. For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in a dry?</hi> As it is a Proverbial Speech, so it is here used by our Lord, both for a Proof of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and also as a Reason why such Evils are inflicted. Green Wood is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper nor profitable fewel: but sure if they be forced to cut it down and make use of it, they will not pass by what is dry, and withered, and good for nothing; so seeing God has suffered his own Son to be thus treated, who never displeased him, they might assure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that such gross and notorious Sinners would not escape. As St. <hi>Peter</hi> says, <hi>If the Righteous scarcely are saved, where shall the Wicked and Ungodly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</hi> Our Lord, by comparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self here to a green, flourishing, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93003:86"/>
fruitful Tree, doth point out the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Sin, who thus treated him, and persecuted him to Death with such Malice and Cruelty: And he also clearly intimates to them, that for this Cause all these Evils would come upon them. A little before this time, he laid it more plainly home to them, by the Parable of the wicked Husband-men, who, when they saw the Son, said, <hi>This is the Heir, come, let us kill him, and seize on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</hi> And accordingly they caught him, and cast him out of the Vineyard, and slew him. The Doom of these Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-men, the <hi>Iews</hi> pronounced with their own Mouth: for when our Lord asked, <hi>when the Lord of the Vineyard cometh, what will he do unto these Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-men?</hi> They replied, <hi>He will mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably destroy these wicked men, and will let out his Vineyard to other Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which shall render him the fruits in their season.</hi> Upon which, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly added, <hi>Did ye never read in the Scriptures, the stone which the Builders refused, the same is become the head of the corner. This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes. Therefore I say unto you, the Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:93003:87"/>
               <hi>bringing forth the fruits thereof. Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder.</hi> The Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication was so plain, and the meaning so obvious, that it is said, that the Chief-Priests and Pharisees perceived that he spoke of them. <hi>Matth.</hi> xxi. 38, 39.</p>
            <p>These Predictions, and the Event<note place="margin">Iesus may be Crucified again.</note> which in all things answered them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, what a heinous Crime it is to be guilty of shedding the Blood of Jesus, and what a Provocation it was to the great God to see his Son crucified by Men. But some may perhaps say, what is all this to us? This was the Sin of the <hi>Iews,</hi> long since committed, and which can never be acted over again, seeing Jesus the Son of God has his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in Heaven, and so is out of the reach of Men: and therefore it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to insist now upon it. They, who say or think so, must give me leave to say, that they are mistaken, and do deceive themselves; for Christ may yet be Crucified, and with as great Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to God, nay, with greater than was before. Doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> tell us, <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 6. of some <hi>who crucifie to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Son of God afresh, and put him</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:93003:87"/>
               <hi>to open shame:</hi> and both by that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the <hi>10th.</hi> we are made to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand who they are that do it, <hi>viz.</hi> They who Sin wilfully after they have received the Knowledge of the Truth; They that undervalue the Death of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and are not so affected with it as to hate and forsake Sin, which was the cause of it; but on the contrary, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, indulge, and love it: for they who do so, by an after Act, consent to his Death, and are guilty of his Blood.</p>
            <p>Not to speak what Jesus suffers in his Servants and Members, by the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions which they meet with, for his Sake, and for their Observance of his Laws: Jesus still suffers immediately in himself, when his Doctrine is despised, his Authority affronted, and his Power resisted. They who question the vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his Doctrine, confirmed by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Prophecies, laugh at the Truth and Mysteries which he hath revealed, and quarrel at his Ordinances and Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, these Persons do violence to his Prophetical Office: They who lessen the Merits of his Death, and the worth and price of that Sacrifice which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; they who advance their own Righteousness, and put little or no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93003:88"/>
in his Mediation, and make the Mediation of others as necessary, they affront and do violence to his Priesthood. They who dispute the Justice, Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness, and Necessity of his Laws; they who refuse to walk by them, and who resist the Motions of his Spirit, even they do violence to him as King. All of this Spirit and Temper would have concurred with the <hi>Iews</hi> in crucifying him; they are Enemies to our Lord, and (as the Apostle saith) crucifie him afresh, and put him to open shame, And who do thus crucifie him, their Sin is rather more grievous and more provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king than that of the <hi>Iews</hi> before. For St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>that through ignorance</hi> they did it. And St. <hi>Paul, that if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of life and glory.</hi> But now he has appeared with such Light and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he cannot but be made known to all who have Eyes to see, or Hearts to understand, or a desire to be informed. And therefore great is the guilt now of crucifying him, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him again to shame. <hi>He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised Moses Law died without mercy, under two or three witnesses: Of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:93003:88"/>
               <hi>be thought worthy who hath trodden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of Grace?</hi> Heb. x. 28.</p>
            <p>What then shall we think of these<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> The Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> Nations and of our selves, who are Chargeable with this very great Sin? What cause of Mourning, and what cause of Fear have we upon this very account? I may say, where has there been more clear, and more frequent Instruction? And where has it been less observed? What contempt of God and Religion? What open Profanity, and avowed breach of the Laws of God have been among us? How often, and how horridly has the Sacred Name of God been Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med both Publickly and Privately? How little regard has been shewed to Jesus Christ, or to any thing he did or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us? To what purpose has his Blood and Wounds, his Agony and Passion been declared and set forth to us? Whose hearts have they touched? How few have been prevailed upon by these to forsake Sin? but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, even in spite of them, they go on and continue in it. And all the use
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93003:89"/>
which some make of them is, to take occasion from them, to forge New and Different Oaths for setting off their Prophane and Idle Discourse. Have not some run up to that height of Impiety, as not only in common Conversation, to mock the Doctrine and Institutions of Jesus Christ, to droll upon his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Actions, but also deliberately, in Writing, to publish Blasphemies that could not be tolerated amongst Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans? How many Scandalous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets have been written of late, which either by plain Assertions, or clear In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuendo's, divest him of his Godhead, spoil him of the Merits of his Death, represent him as an Impostor, and all the System of his Gospel as a Cheat, tho' the whole contrivance is not only highly worthy of God, but doth as fully and as evidently set forth his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wisdom and Power, as the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Frame of this Material World. But tho' all have not been so grosly wicked, yet all Ranks and Orders of Men, Rulers, Pastors, and People have, one way or other, less or more, been guilty of grieving the Holy Spirit of God, and the Righteous Spirit of Jesus Christ: And therefore we have reason
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93003:89"/>
to fear, that his Anger will break forth and fall down in some heavy Judgment upon these Nations, as it happened to the <hi>Iews.</hi> I do not pretend to any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Privacy into the Secret Councils of God, nor to be acquainted with his Purposes towards the publick state of these Kingdoms; wherefore I shall not denounce any particular Judgments in the Name of God, having no special Warrant for it: but I must say, that if his Word, and the Methods of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence be a Rule; if we may take any measures of Conjecture either from his Nature or his Threatnings, or the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of others, there is too much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to look for some grievous Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities to these Lands, unless a speedy and Universal Repentance prevent it. We are not the safer that we are secure: Nay, our Security is a sign that our Ruin and Calamity are not far off. At this time, when our Lord gave this Warning, the <hi>Iews</hi> were very secure; they thought of nothing less than the utter destruction of their Nation and State. When God has been provoked to determine the Ruin of a People, he useth to possess them first with a Drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, and to cast them into a Slumber,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93003:90"/>
that they may be incapable to prevent it. <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes, least they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert and be healed,</hi> said the Lord to <hi>Isaiah,</hi> Isa. vi. 10.</p>
            <p>God hath been of a long time pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing Nations and Kingdoms about us; but the voice of the Rod upon others hath not awakened us, for all this we have slept on in our Sins. Wherefore he hath drawn a little nearer, and he hath laid his Judgments at our own Door; he hath shaken the Foundation of our State, and with that shake, tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled many Persons from their Honours, their Preferments, their places of Ease, Comfort and Subsistence: and yet still there is little or no awakening. As with Men who are suddenly interrupted in their rest, and whose Sleep is hastily broken, there is so much sense as to fret, repine, and complain of Uneasiness, and to be angry with those who disturb us: But there is no awakening to true Repentance, no Rouzing up to Provide for our Safety, and to prevent the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger threatned. He that mocked God, and laughed at Religion before, doth so
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93003:90"/>
still; He that uttered Oaths and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, continues to do so; the Drunkard continues his Drinking; he that was Filthy, Unjust, or Unholy, is so still; every one continues his former wicked course, and few break off their Sins by Righteousness, or their Iniquities by shewing mercy to the Poor. <hi>Surely it is meet to say unto God; I have born Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will not offend any more; that which I see not, teach thou me; If I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> But who saith this? Alas! there be Few to stand in the gap to deprecate God's Wrath, but too too many who by their hardness and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent heart treasure up to themselves and to the Nations Wrath even in this day of Wrath. If I had time, I could draw a Parallel betwixt our selves and the <hi>Iews,</hi> our Temper and Behaviour and theirs, before all those Evils came upon them. But, God forbid, that our End be as theirs, or as some other Churches of the East, who as they followed them in their Sins, so they were Partakers of their Judgments.</p>
            <p>But whatever be the Publick Fate of these Nations, and tho' all may escape Temporal Judgments in this Life; yet how do Impenitent and Incorrigible
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93003:91"/>
Sinners think to escape the eternal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the other World? The Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was a Type of the Day of Judgment: the Calamity of the <hi>Iews,</hi> the Horror and Consternation they were in, when the <hi>Romans</hi> utterly ruin'd them, tho' it had no Precedent, nor has any thing fallen out since like it; yet all was but a faint Shadow of the Day of Judgment, but a sorry figure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of that. Then it is that Men will cry most Pathetically, and with the greatest earnestness, to the Hills and to the Mountains to fall on them, and to cover them from the sight of the Lamb. They had better meet with a Bear rob'd of her Whelps, or a Lion roaring, than the Lamb of God that Day: for then he will be Terrible, and nothing can shelter them from him. None shall find Mercy then, or be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, save such as have Jesus for their Advocate, and who are sprinkled with his Blood. But do incorrigible and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Sinners expect this? Or dare they ask it of Him? Will they, or can they employ Him, whom all their life they have affronted, and grieved, and resisted? Or, Suppose that they should have such Impudence, would it prevail?
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93003:91"/>
Will He plead for them; nay, He will plead against them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his Blood will speak no other thing in behalf of them, than that of <hi>Abel's;</hi> it will even call for Vengeance. Jesus Christ, in that Day, will only take part with the Penitent Believers: All others shall be left to the Wrath of God; which, as a Consuming Fire, shall devour them. <hi>O consider this ye that forget God, lest he tear you in pieces, when there shall be none to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?</hi> Now is the day, now is the acceptable time. <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near.</hi> O know and consider, in this your day, the things that belong to your Peace, lest they be hid from your eyes. And may the Merciful God add his Enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Converting Grace to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and these Instructions, that they may prove Effectual to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, for the magnifying of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the Saving of our selves from the Wrath that is to come.</p>

            <p>THESE Words are a Form of Thanksgiving proper to be used on such Occasions as this, which hath now brought us together; and a due Consideration of them may be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to excite in us most grateful Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God's Goodness to us, and of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93003:92"/>
our Obligations to him. They were first uttered in Behalf of the dispersed Jews, but only upon the account of their being Christians, and called to the Hope of Glory, which Privilege is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to us; and therefore the Text is no less applicable to us than it was to them. Even upon our account it may be said, <hi>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. In which words we may take notice of these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. First, the Author of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, <hi>viz. God and the Father,</hi> &amp;c. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Motive which induced him to bless us, his <hi>abundant mercy.</hi> Thirdly, the special Benefits conferred on us, which are, <hi>the begetting us again unto a lively hope, an inheritance,</hi> &amp;c. Fourthly, the means by which the same is wrought and assured to us, <hi>viz. the resurrection of Iesus Christ from the dead.</hi> All these are important things, worthy to be known; and therefore (God willing) I shall speak to each of them: And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you to lend an attentive and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Ear.</p>
            <p>To begin with the First. As Nature<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> The Author of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, God.</note> teacheth us to be thankful; so that we may acquit our selves of this Duty, it is necessary to know, whom we are
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93003:93"/>
obliged to; for if we make an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment to any other than to him who bestowed the Benefits, we defraud him who bestowed them, and act as foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly and unjustly as he who payeth a Debt to another than the Person to whom it is owing. Now, we are directed here to pay our Thanks to God; and indeed he is the only Author of all the good we have of whatsoever Sort, whether Spiritual or Temporal. <hi>Do not err, my beloved Brethren, every good and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning.</hi> We have nothing but what we have received from him. It is true, all things are not given us immediately by the Hand of God himself; oftentimes Blessings are dispenced by the means of his Creatures: But whatever way, or by whomsoever Good comes to us, God is, and ought to be acknowledged the Author thereof. Good comes not to us by chance, nor from any other than God; if any other thing be used in the bestowing it, it is only as an Instrument in his Hand: Neither Devils, nor Men, nor any other Creature can do us hurt, unless God give them leave: Nor can
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93003:93"/>
any do us good, but as they are prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted and empowered thereto by God. If Medicines cure, it is because he bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them; if our Industry and Diligence enrich, it is because his Providence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth it; if Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are beneficial, it is because he putteth it in their Heart and enables them. Does the preaching of <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollo</hi> convince thy Conscience, work in thee Faith and Repentance? It is only because God worketh with them; it is his Spirit only which makes their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry effectual; for what is <hi>Paul?</hi> And what is <hi>Apollos?</hi> The one may plant, and the other may water, but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease is from God. Let none therefore <hi>sacrifice unto their net,</hi> or <hi>burn incense unto their drag,</hi> though by them <hi>their portion is fat,</hi> and <hi>their meat plenteous:</hi> Neither let them boast of Men, and make all their Acknowledgments to them, for either spiritual or temporal good which comes by their means; but both for the one and the other, let all look up to God, who giveth to all liberally; let us give Thanks and Praise to him; for it is he, and he only who maketh us glad by his Work: As he made us, and not we our selves, so from him are

all our present Comforts, and the Hope of what is to come.</p>
            <p>But as all our Acknowledgments are<note place="margin">God and the Father.</note> due to God, so that it may appear they are directed aright, to the one true God, we ought to address them in, and by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, to <hi>God and the Father of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth us here. When he saith, <hi>God and the Father,</hi> &amp;c. He doth not mean distinct Persons; the Conjunction (<hi>and</hi>) here is explicative, and thereby the Apostle points out whom he meant by God, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Iesus Christ,</hi> that is, he who sent Jesus Christ into the World, and has ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested himself to Men by him. This Manifestation is the fullest and most glorious, and so particular, that it is a certain Mark to distinguish the true God from false Gods, and the Worshippers of the one from the Worshippers of the other. Jews, Turks, and Pagans, and all those (who worship their own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations) will readily say, <hi>Blessed be God:</hi> But none will add, <hi>the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> but such as know and own the true God indeed. Ever since this Manifestation of the true God, he hath stiled himself by it, and will have all to acknowledge him under this
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93003:95"/>
Title: And they who own it not, not only dishonour God, and rob him of a great deal of Glory, which thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to him, but also they may be said to revolt from the Knowledge and Acknowledgment of the true God. <hi>He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father which hath sent him,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> viij. 23. And St. <hi>Iohn</hi> himself tells us, <hi>Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father, but he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also.</hi> 1 Epistle ii. 23. <note n="*" place="margin">Qui <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

               </note> Wherefore such Acts of Worship as do thus particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly discriminate the true God, and are so appropriate to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that they are applicable to none other are very necessary: For this Reason our Initiation into the Worship and Service of the true God is, by baptizing <hi>us into the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost:</hi> And for the same Reason we ought often to receive the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord's Supper, for hereby we make an express and peculiar Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment

of this one true God, <hi>viz.</hi> the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. By this also it appears, how suitable a part of Christian Worship the usual <hi>Doxology</hi> is, and how proper to annex it to the Psalms of <hi>David,</hi> whereby they are adapted to the New Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gospel, and rendered so much Christian, that neither Jews, nor any but Christians will join in the Use of them.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> The Motive which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced God.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus considered the Author of our Happiness; the Motive which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to bless us comes next to be considered. The Obligation which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth by the conferring a Benefit is more or less, according to the Motive or Cause which prompted it; if it was extorted by Force and Compulsion, if one be so driven to it that he cannot shun a Courtesie, scarce any Obligation accrueth thereby; if it be done out of respect to after Requitals, it is but a mercenary Kindness, and tho' it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth somewhat, yet the Obligation is none of the greatest, it only bindeth us to make some Recompence, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that which the Person might have an Eye to, if it be reasonable, as
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93003:96"/>
the Services of Servants bindeth to the paying their Wages, which is all they have before them; and when that is done, the Obligation of their Services ceaseth. But if a Favour be conferred freely, out of pure Love and good Will, the Obligation is both perpetual and of the highest Nature: Such a Favour ought never to be forgotten; and if it be great in it self too, it bindeth to the utmost Love and Thankfulness. Now, such is our Obligation to God; for as he hath blessed us with the highest Blessings (as shall be seen afterwards) so he hath done it most freely, meerly <hi>out</hi>
               <note place="margin">His abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Mercy.</note> 
               <hi>of his abundant mercy,</hi> as the Text saith: And the same is intimated every where throughout the Scripture. <hi>Through the tender mercy of our God the day spring from on high hath visited us,</hi> said <hi>Zachary, Luke</hi> i. 78. <hi>Of his own will begat he us,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul; Titus</hi> iii. 5. and <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 15. <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,</hi> and <hi>I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion,</hi> so then that <hi>it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy:</hi> Therefore in the same Chapter, they who are saved and prepared unto Glory
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93003:97"/>
are called <hi>Vessels,</hi> not of Justice or of Righteousness, but <hi>of mercy,</hi> to teach us, that if it had not been for Mercy none would have been saved<note n="*" place="margin">Posset Apostolus (<hi>saith</hi> Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentius) vasa mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordiae potius vasa justitiae nuncupare.

            <p>And indeed to what can our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ascribed but to the Mercy of God? It cannot be said, that he was constrained thereto by some external Cause; for who can compel the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty? Who can prescribe Laws to the absolute Sovereign of Heaven and Earth? It was not the Hope of Profit that moved him; for (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> said) <hi>Can a Man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self? Is it any Pleasure to the Almighty that thou art righteous? Or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect? My Goodness extendeth not to thee,</hi> saith <hi>David; for if thou be righteous what gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest thou him? Or what receiveth he of thine hand? Thy wickedness may hurt a Man as thou art, and thy righteousness may profit the Son of Man.</hi> But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make God either better or worse: He
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93003:97"/>
stands in no need of us; nor is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any either in Heaven or Earth to add, or take from his Greatness, Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, or Glory; for what can be added to, or impaired from an infinite Being? Suppose God was obliged to give those celestial Mansions to such as could me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit them, yet who could claim them even on that Account? <hi>His Angels he chargeth with folly, What is Man then that he should be clean? And he which is born of a Woman, that he should be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous? If he did enter into Iudgment, who could stand? What Man could be justified in his sight?</hi> Whatever God would have been obliged to, if Man had continued innocent, yet sure considering us in our lapsed State, it must be acknowledged that it is Mercy only which saves us, unless we say, that he is obliged by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, Treachery, impious Affronts, wicked Insolencies and continued Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations: But being these can only be thought to irritate his Anger; therefore we ought to conclude with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that <hi>it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed:</hi> And that we are not only not consumed, as we deserve, but moreover called to Glory and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, is not Mercy simply, but <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:93003:98"/>
yea <hi>superabundant mercy,</hi> as our Text speaks. Would you but take a View of your Hearts and Actions for one Day, and consider not only the lesser Follies and Impertinencies you are guilty of, but the grosser Faults, the unclean and wicked Thoughts which arise in your Hearts, the rash and evil Words which proceed from your Mouth, what Sins are committed, and what Good is left undone, in how many things you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend altogether, and how light the best Actions would be if they were weighed in the Balance? I say, were those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially examined, the Guilt of one Day would be found exceeding great; and then what would it be if the Sins of all the Days and Years we lived were added? And seeing our Case is such, tell me, is it not Mercy only which tieth the Hands of Divine Justice, nay, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Mercy which maketh God to pass over so many and so great Offences, and not only to spare us, but to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make us happy. Thus we see how free God's Love is to usward, and that nothing but his own abundant Mercy could move him to set his Heart upon us, and to do us good, which partly encreaseth the Obligation of his
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93003:98"/>
Benefits, though they be in themselves too, as great as can be, as will appear by taking a View of this Summ of them that St. <hi>Peter</hi> gives us here. Which was</p>
            <p>The Third Point proposed. The<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> The Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</note> Apostle designed not to give a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of all God's wonderful Works to us the Children of Men; this would have swelled his Epistle much beyond what it is. He passeth by the many Thousand Mercies he hath done, and daily doth for our Bodies and bodily Life, and only takes notice of what he has done for our Souls; because on their Welfare our Happiness mainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. The good of the Body and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Life would yield small Content if the Soul were lost: And if the Soul be saved, if it have those things which are agreeable to it, and which perfect it, there is abundant Matter of rejoicing, tho' the Comforts of the Body be much wanting. Wherefore we see the Apostle here teacheth those to whom he writes, (who were Strangers scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad, and often persecuted) to rejoice notwithstanding; because <hi>through the abundant mercy of God they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten again to a lively hope,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:93003:99"/>The first Benefit reckoned up here is,<note place="margin">Begotten again.</note> that we <hi>are begotten again;</hi> and indeed it is the Foundation and Beginning of all our Happiness; without this, it were simply impossible to make us not mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Now, by this is meant the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us a New or Second Birth, a put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us into another State than what we are in by our present natural Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. If any ask, what needed this? Were we not well enough before? It might suffice to answer, That there was great need for it, seeing God thought fit to do it, and that his doing it is made an Instance of his great Mercy; for <hi>Deus &amp; Natura nihil faciunt frustra.</hi> But if this satisfie not, the Necessity of this and the Greatness of the Benefit will evidently appear to such as view the Wretchedness of our State by ordinary natural Generation; I say, ordinary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Generation and not our first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for Man as he came first out of the Hands of God was in a good State, he was like his Maker, Wise, Holy, Pure, and Innocent. If he had kept this State, there would have been no need of renewing it, or of making him over again. But he kept not this first State, but fell into a State of Sin and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93003:99"/>
Corruption; he lost the Favour of God, incurred his Wrath and Displeasure, and became liable to his Wrath and Curse; and all the Miseries of this present Life and that which is to come. And as all Mankind are descended from those first Parents since they fell from their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Righteousness and Purity, and have been propagated in a State of Sin and Corruption, so all are generated Sinners, filthy and corrupt. The sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Leprosie of <hi>Adam</hi> is inherent in all his Children, and the Curse he brought on himself is entailed on all his Posterity. <hi>Behold,</hi> saith <hi>David, I was shapen in Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and in sin did my Mother conceive me,</hi> Psal. li. 5. And our Saviour tells us, <hi>That which is born of the flesh is flesh;</hi> for if the Fountain be corrupt, what flows from it must be corrupt too; who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean, not one? It is said, <hi>Gen.</hi> v. that <hi>Adam</hi> was made after the Image of God, but that he himself begat a Son <hi>in his own Likeness, viz.</hi> in a State of Sin and Corruption. And as this befalls all of us, for Sin is an inseparable Consequent of ordinary natural Generation, so that it renders us most ugly and loathsome. Sin is the Disease of the Soul, and causeth
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93003:100"/>
as great Deformity and Vileness to the Soul, as the worst of Diseases to the Body. If any be not sensible of this, it is, because it is so common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and is, in a manner, natural to them; for so we see long Custom and Familiarity will lessen the Horrour of things which ought to be abhorred. But whatever they think, whose Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are benumm'd with Sin, yet others nauseat and abhorr Sin as the worst of Evils. Sin is so abominable in God's Sight, that his Eye cannot behold it. Saints, and such as are begotten again, complain heavily of this Defilement of their Nature, and look upon it with Grief and Indignation. <hi>David</hi> sets it forth under the Similitude of a most filthy bodily Disease, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxxviii. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> xvi. This our natural State is elegantly compared to an exposed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant of wretched Parents, lying wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its Blood and natural Pollution, and wanting those good Offices which are necessary to make it live.</p>
            <p>But as there is Filthiness in this State, so likewise much Pain and Misery: All the Anguish and Trouble of our Spirits proceed hence; from this Corruption and Depravation of our Natures come
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93003:100"/>
those inward Torments and Vexations of Mind which we feel; were it not for this we could draw Contentment and Satisfaction from any external Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; as a Man in perfect Health can sleep soundly upon any Bed: And if one be pained with the Gout, Stone, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Disease, how unreasonable were it to cast the blame of his Trouble and Uneasiness upon the Bed he lies, or the House he dwells in! So the Cause of our Grief and Trouble is more within than without us, it is more to be ascribed to the Disorder of our Minds by Sin, than to the outward Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of our external Condition in the World. But besides the inward Pain of Sin, which is the Result of its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is loaded with external Misery; for it is prosecuted by the Wrath of Almighty God, and his Displeasure falls heavy upon it. <hi>Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire, and brimstone, and an horrible tempest, this shall be the portion of their cup,</hi> Psal. ii. 6. Now this Wretchedness of our first natural Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration shews both the Necessity and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of being regenerated. How happy a thing is it to be washen from the Guilt, and cleansed from the Filth
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93003:101"/>
of Sin, to be delivered from the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and freed from the Power and Dominion thereof? That is, to be begotten again in the Language of the Text; for all that is implied in these Words, <hi>Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the Man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose Spirit there is no guile,</hi> Psal. xxxii. 1.</p>
            <p>But though this be considerable, ye<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it is not all. God hath not only deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us from the Miseries of a sinful State, but he hath also designed for us greater Glory and Felicity than what we lost by Sin: The actual Possession hereof is not till hereafter; for at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent we are in the State of Children or Heirs while they are Minors; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now only we have Hope; but it is a <hi>lively hope,</hi> as the Text expresseth it.<note place="margin">A lively Hope.</note> It is Hope which enliveneth the Soul, it quickeneth the Spirit, and rejoiceth the Heart; but without Hope the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit flags, and the Heart faints and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth. It is Hope which stirreth up to all Endeavours; Hope is the Wheel which moveth all Designs, it sets them on and keeps them a going. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer plougheth and soweth, because
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93003:101"/>
he hath Hope; the Merchant ventureth to the Sea, and the Souldier to the War out of Hope; and it is this which makes others follow the Court. But these Worldly Hopes are much inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to this Christian Hope to which God hath now begotten us. This is far more than any or all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And there is more Reason to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice and be glad of this Hope than of these other: For neither the Object of them is so great, nor the Ground of them so certain. What worldly Men hope, or what any Man hopeth of these things which relate to this World, when narrowly examined, amounts to no great matter, oft times we are as well without these things as with them, and sometimes better. And however how uncertain a thing is worldly Hope, and how soon and how easily is it blasted? What Men trust to for effectuating their Hope is vain, and deceitful, and withal weak and unable to resist and overcome those Difficulties which fall in, in the Prosecution of our Designs. So that we see daily many ashamed and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of their Hopes, and not only come short of them, but also to meet with the quite contrary. Thus Shame
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93003:102"/>
and Wounds fall to the Souldiers share instead of his fansied Booty and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; the Labourer expected a rich crop, and is reduced to Cleanness of Teeth; the Merchant turns Bankrupt, who was blown up with the Hopes of great Wealth; the Courtier is forced away with Disgrace instead of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Command he promised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and that Alliance which was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with such Earnestness, and was begun with so fair and big Promises pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth nothing but continued Vexations and Grief. This is oft the end of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hope, and therefore it may be called a dead Hope; but the Hope of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is a lively Hope; for it never dieth till it end in Fruition: And in the mean time it hath more Life and Vigour in it to quicken and animate the Spirit of Man. <hi>The hope which we have,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, is an anchor of the Soul both sure and stedfast,</hi> Heb. vi. 19. for it is founded upon two immutable things, <hi>viz.</hi> God and his Promises; his Power can never fail, and his Word as little; but as he is still able, so he is ever willing to accomplish what hath gone out of his Mouth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:93003:102"/>But let us see what is our hope; it is,<note place="margin">An Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> saith the Text, <hi>to an inheritance.</hi> This is more than the World giveth to her Children: All in this World are not born to Inheritances, even those Fathers, who have Lands and Possessions, bestow not the Heritage of them on all their Children, one only of the Sons gets it: but our heavenly Father giveth to every one of his Children an Inheritance. <hi>Fear not, little flock,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>it is your Father's will to give you a Kingdom.</hi> And as we have an Inheritance, so an Excellent one, for its Kind and Quality. Some Kingdoms and Inheritances are petty and inconsiderable, and afford small matter to brag off: but this Inheritance is so great, that there is none greater, nor any comparable to it.</p>
            <p>For, First, It is said to be <hi>Incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.</note> this respects the duration of it, and the like cannot be said of any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. The Psalmist tells us, <hi>Mens inward thoughts is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations,</hi> and that <hi>therefore they call their Lands after their own names,</hi> Psal. xlix. 2. but who sees not the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this thought? What Chapping and Changing of Inheritances is daily
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93003:103"/>
made? How do they run away, that no Foresight, nor Law, nor Wit can secure them? How many famous Kingdoms, and Monarchies, and Noble Families are extinct, that there is no memory of them, except in some old dark Records? It must therefore add much to the worth of this Inheritance, that it is Immortal and Unchangeable.</p>
            <p>But yet the next quality is better, for if a Possession is little worth, it is no great matter though it pass away: but if it be good and excellent, the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of it is much to be desired; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that this Inheritance is incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is matter of great Joy, seeing it is also <hi>undefiled:</hi> by which is meant, that<note place="margin">Undefiled.</note> it is so pure as to yield nothing to give the least disgust to the Inheriter. O rare and singular quality! No perfectly pure Enjoyment is here to be found; all are full of unpleasant mixtures, or attended with troublesome inconveniencies which damp and spoil the Pleasure and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of them. No Rose is to be found but upon a Thorn, nor any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light without some Molestation; what takes one Sense, grates another: neither in Company or Retirement, Solitude or Publick Employment, Celibacy or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93003:103"/>
high Stations or low Places, City or Country, nor in any condition of Humane Life is matter of full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Contentment to be found, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pleaseth one way, displeaseth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is the Property only of this Inheritance, here spoken of, to afford perfect Satisfaction to the Soul, because neither its Pleasures are gross to cloy the Mind, nor are they mixed with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and disagreeable Ingredients to give any disgust. It is altogether pure and Undefiled, and so the joy it yields must be both full and pure. <hi>In thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is fulness of joy, and at thy right hand are rivers of pleasures for evermore,</hi> Psal. xvi.</p>
            <p>But to proceed; it is further added, that this Inheritance <hi>fadeth not away.</hi> In the Original it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which<note place="margin">It fadeth not away.</note> is the Name of a Flower that never wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth, but keeps always fresh and green; and by naming this Inheritance so the Apostle designed to hold forth the continued Vigour and Flagrancy thereof. As it lasteth long, so it never waxeth old: the Infirmities and usual Appendages of Age never overtake it; it never suffereth any decay in its Strength, Beauty, Glory, or Vertue.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93003:104"/>
There be many things which at first, and while they are New, are taking and splendid, but within a while they fail, and answer not Mens expectations as at first: But it is not so with this Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it fades not; when Thousand thousand Ages are past, it is still gay and flourishing, never diminished in its quality. As it is Eternal in its Duration, so its Pleasures, Riches, and all other Advantages are Eternal. You will ask, where lieth this Inheritance? If you<note place="margin">In the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</note> look for it in any of these lower Regions, you will meet with a disappointment; neither this, nor any other Country, the Old, nor the New found World can yield it. Many Discoveries have been made of late of Plants, Stones, Minerals, and the like, which were not known before, but no place is found with the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of the Text. This is only to be looked for above; it is, saith the Text, <hi>reserved in the heavens;</hi> and that it is there, we are the surer of it; for no destroying Fire ariseth there; no boisterous Wind bloweth there; nor doth Subtilty, Malice, Cunning, and Oppression take place there; it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the reach of Men and Devils; and therefore we need not fear either to be
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93003:104"/>
put by it, or to be justled out of it. O happy Inheritance! How blessed are they who are called to such an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance! The very hope hereof doth give greater joy than the actual Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of all Earthly things. How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle may one be cast down with the loss of Temporal things, who hath this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance ensured to him. Let not thy Crosses and Sufferings over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm thee with Grief, seeing so great and so glorious an Inheritance awaits thee.</p>
            <p>But then it will be enquired, how<note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> The ground of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Iesus his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> came I to know it, and by what means may I be assured of it? Truly this is no Delusion, there is undoubted Evidence of the Truth thereof, <hi>viz. the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Iesus Christ.</hi> All this is done, saith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the Dead. Though the Resurrection be only mentioned, yet all the former acts of Jesus Christ are included, as his Incarnation, Birth, Life, Sufferings, and Death. But because the Resurrection was the last act of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorship upon Earth, gave a lustre to the rest, did demonstrate the Merit of them, and was an evidence of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, therefore it is put here alone
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93003:105"/>
instead of all the rest. Jesus Christ, by coming in the Flesh, and by what he did in the Flesh, hath wrought a perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for us; <hi>he was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our Iustification,</hi> Rom. iv. 25. And as he died to become a Propitiation for our Sins, so he arose to witness that he had made a perfect atonement, and that there is <hi>now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit: for as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift is upon all men unto justification of life,</hi> Rom. v. 18. I say, to all who believe: for as Jesus Christ by his Death and Resurrection hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased Salvation for us, so it is necessary that we have Faith in him, his Death, and Resurrection, to the end we may partake of his Merits. Faith in his Death takes away the guilt of our Sins; and Faith in his Resurrection begets us to a lively Hope, and entitles us to this Inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and which fadeth not away. He, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, has as great assurance as the Word of God can give him; <hi>If thou shalt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess with thy mouth the Lord Iesus, and</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:93003:105"/>
               <hi>shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth Confession is made unto Salvation,</hi> Rom. x. Faith unites us to Christ, and brings us where he is; if we believe, we shall also rise with him, and sit down with him in heavenly places at the right hand of God. Our Thoughts therefore should much run upon the Death and Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Jesus Christ; and in particular we should frequently make remembrance of them by this Ordinance of the Lord's Supper; which was appointed for this end, both because those means wrought our Salvation, and that the Effects of them are conveyed to us through Faith in them, and the serious Meditation of them. Men use to produce their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and Rights to their Earthly He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritages, and diligently to consider them when they are brangled or like to be justled out of their Possession. Now, the Devil, the World, and the Flesh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy this Happiness which hath befallen us, and seek daily to put us by it, by filling us with doubts and fears, and making us question the greatness or certainty thereof. Is it not fit, nay,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93003:106"/>
necessary, then to view the means by which this was effectuated, and thereby strengthen our Faith in them, that we may not lose our Hope, but maintain it, and assure to our selves this blessed Inheritance.</p>
            <p>There is no place for doubting a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, of which there is some publick Monument, attested by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted Tradition, and to Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate which certain Days and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are observed. He who doubts after this, is not to be convinced; It is in vain to reason with him, for he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts both Sence and Reason, by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his consent to reasonable things. Things past cannot be seen, they can be proved only by Tradition or History, or some visible Effects; He is most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable who asks another Proof, or who is not satisfied with this. Now as there is an Universal uninterrupted Tradition of the History of Jesus Christ, as it is witnessed by the Testimony of both Friends and Enemies to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion; so the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper which we have this day Received, is a solemn, publick, visible and authentick Memorial of it: for no other account can be given of its Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93003:106"/>
no other Reason for the devout Celebration of these Sacred Rites from the beginning, but the Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Jesus Christ; and his Death had never been so devoutly commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the Apostles and Primitive Christians; nay, they had been ashamed of it, if there had not been clear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and Undoubted Proof of his Resurrection. By this then, it appears that the Gospel is no cunningly devised Fable, that the History of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is certain and true: and if this be true, our Faith is not in vain, nor is our Hope ill grounded; then it is certain, that we have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance incorruptible, undefiled, and which fadeth not away.</p>
            <p>Why then do we stagger through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief! why are we faint and wearied in our Minds? why do we suffer Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to overwhelm us? why are we so backward to run the Race which is set before us? why do we loiter so much about the things of this World? and why are we so afraid of Death which is a necessary Passage to that blessed state to which we are called. That we may not marr our own Happiness, that we may not deprive our selves of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93003:107"/>
the greatest Consolation even of this present Life, that we may have courage to encounter Afflictions and Death it self, and that at last we may obtain the Possession of that Inheritance to which we have a Right and Title, let us not doubt but believe; let us entertain a full assurance of Faith, and look unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith, who for the Joy that was set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, endured the Cross, despising the Shame, and is set down at the right hand of God: Finally, let us be stedfast and unmoveable, always aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Work of the Lord, for our labour is not in vain.</p>
            <q>Now the God of Peace that brought again from the Dead our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, that great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the Blood of the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant, make you perfect in every good Work to do his Will, working in you that which is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing in his sight, through Iesus Christ; to whom be Glory for ever and ever.</q>

            <p>THE Yoke of Christ is so far from being heavy and troublesome, that on the contrary, it is very Light and Easie: His Commands are so far from being Grievous, that they are very Profitable; and in keeping of them there is great Reward. It is no less our Interest than our Duty to become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: and we cannot shew our selves more Wise, more Careful of our own Welfare, than when we give our selves up to be the Disciples of Jesus Christ, and to follow him whithersoever he leads us: For, by doing so, we secure to our

            <p>The Meditation of these words can never be Unseasonable, it may always be Useful and Profitable: but it is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially very proper and pertinent for the Day and Work which we are now set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about. I pray God we may so clearly understand these words, and so seriously consider them, that we may not, from any constraint, or formality only, but chearfully and heartily join our selves to the Lord Jesus Christ, and resolve to maintain, not only an Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Communion with him in his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Ordinances, but an Internal one also by Faith, Love, and Obedience; that, by so doing, we may obtain that Life, and all the Blessed Fruits and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of it, which is in and through him.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:93003:108"/>As to the First: By the Son of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> Iesus Christ is the Son of God.</note> we are to understand here the Lord Jesus Christ, the History of whose miraculous Conception and Birth and Death and Resurrection and Ascension we have fully Recorded, and plainly set down in the Four Gospels; that this is the Person which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> designs and points at here is so Evident, that it needs not to be proved: who Reads the Epistle, or but takes notice of the 1, 5, and 20 Verses of this Chapter, will find it past all doubt. In this Epistle Jesus Christ is not only frequently stiled the Son of God: but the Necessity of believing it is also clearly held out by the Apostle thus, Chap. ii. 23. <hi>Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father; but he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also.</hi> And a little before our Text; <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the Record which God gave of his Son.</hi> And This St. <hi>Iohn</hi> insists the more upon, because, even in his time, there were some (<hi>Cerinthus</hi> and <hi>Ebion</hi> by name) who began to spread Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heresies, denying the Divinity of Jesus Christ, and giving him out to be
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93003:109"/>
only a meer Man: In Refutation of whom, it is said also, that he wrote his Gospel at the desire of the <hi>Asian</hi> Bishops: And in it indeed he sets himself more, than any other of the Evangelists, to advance this great Truth, That Jesus is the Son of God, not by Adoption, or upon the account of his Sanctity and Divine Mission, which hath given the Title to other Men, but after a peculiar and ineffable manner, so that None other is, or can be the Son of God as he is; for he doth evidently hold him out to be the only begotten Son of God, and declares his Eternal Generation and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, by clear and Undoubted Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth not only with the other Evangelists, Record such Actions and Speeches of Jesus Christ, from which his Deity may be inferred and deduced, they speaking out both an Omnipotency and Omniscience: But he expresly calls him God, and brings in our Lord fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently asserting his Oneness and Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with the Father, in plain and clear terms, and both suffering some, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon others to pay him equal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and Worship with the Father, which he would never have done, but would have guarded against, if he had
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93003:109"/>
not been the Son of God in that sence, which the Catholick Church hath belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it: for then it would have been Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and a downright robbing of God. Jesus could not be Ignorant whether he was the Son of God or no, neither can we suppose him to swerve from the Truth, or to go about to perswade Men to believe in the least what was not True, for if he had not been Truth, God would not have born Witness to him by so many Prophecies before he came to the World, by so many Audible Voices and Wonders when he was in it, by raising him from the Dead, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by confirming the Preaching of the Gospel, both with Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and with diverse Miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost. <hi>If we receive the witness of Men, the witness of God is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and this is the witness of God which he hath testified, That Iesus Christ is his Son:</hi> And who will not believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Testimony; which God hath given to his Son, maketh him a Liar. He, who refuseth this, opposeth himself to the Truth of God, and so reproacheth and dishonoureth him who hath so posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and so many ways testified of him. And Therefore it is said by this Apostle,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:93003:110"/>
as we cited before, <hi>Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father.</hi> And in the following, <hi>Whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Denying of Jesus Christ to be the Son of God is a Reproaching the Truth of God, so also it is a Despising of his Wisdom, and an Endeavouring to baffle and Undervalue all the admirable contrivances thereof, and all the Wise and Wonderful Dispensations of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the Eternal Purposes of his Counsel. For as <hi>all things are of Christ,</hi> and <hi>through him,</hi> so all things were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed with a respect to him. The Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of the World, the permitting of Man to fall, the Miraculous Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, and the no less wonderful Preservation thereof for so many Years, the Shame, Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Banishment, which that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple suffer now, the Calling of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> all God's Dealings with Men and Angels, and in a word, all that hath hitherto fallen out, and all that is to be any time hereafter, and the End and Consummation of this visible Frame at the last Day; all these things, I say, and more than we know, were designed for
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:93003:110"/>
the Glory and Honour of Christ: And as they have all a reference to him, so the Beauty, and Wisdom, and Goodness of those Divine Transactions are not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be seen, but by Establishing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of the Son of God; and There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to reject this great Mystery is to set at nought the Eternal Purposes of God, and all those Glorious Designs which his Infinite Wisdom and Goodness have Devised. This is to smother the Divine Wisdom and Goodness which is conspicuous in these things, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and deprive him of that Glory which so much Wisdom, and so much Goodness, and so many and so great Expressions thereof, do bring unto him. Wherefore, not to acknowledge Jesus to be the Son of God, our Lord and God, as it is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unaccountable Obstinacy, there being so many Irrefragable Testimonies and unquestionable Proofs thereof; so it is inexcusable Impiety and downright Rebellion against God. He who doth not receive the King's Vicegerent, nor will own him whom he Deputes and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusts with the Government, both af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts the King's Authority, and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth his Conduct, he reflects alike on his Prudence and Authority: And is he
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93003:111"/>
not guilty of the same Crime? Is he not equally wicked against God who reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth his own Son whom he hath sent into the World? for to this purpose <hi>God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name, that at the name of Iesus every knee should</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip. 2. 9. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>bow, of things in Heaven, and things in Earth, and things under the Earth, and that every tongue should confess that Iesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, this owning and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> What is meant by Having the Son.</note> of Jesus Christ, the receiving him as the Son of God, is what the Apostle calls the <hi>having the Son;</hi> as appears from the following Verse, where he expounds it by believing on him. And in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Epistle, <hi>Verse</hi> 9. he makes it to be the abiding in his Doctrine. He then hath the Son who believes in him, who receives his Gospel, who gives a full and hearty assent to the truth of all that is said of him, either as to his Nature or Offices, the Dignity of his Person, or the Power and Privilege he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Father: In a word, he hath the Son, who stedfastly believes whatever he has Revealed concerning God or Man, our present Condition or
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93003:111"/>
Original State, our Duty here or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hereafter: for if we believe him to be the Son of God, we will believe also whatever he hath delivered, and will not fail to adhere to this Belief and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion.</p>
            <p>Thus we see, That it is Faith in Christ<note place="margin">True Faith described.</note> to which Life is here promised: But we deceive our selves, if we think it any kind of Faith, a bare knowledge or naked Speculation of Gospel Truths, a mere and simple assent to them, which rests in the Brain and Understanding, and goes no farther. No; this is not that Faith which is so magnified in Scripture, and to which so many glorious things are promised. Many may have all that this comes to; and yet fall short of Life. <hi>Many will say to me in that day</hi> (saith<note place="margin">Matth. 7. 22.</note> Christ) <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied in thy Name, and in thy Name cast out Devils, and in thy Name done many wonderful Works? And then I will profess unto them, I never knew you, depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</hi> True Faith is always Lively, Active, and Operative; it is not barren and Unfruitful; it ever worketh by Love and keepeth the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; it purifieth the heart of Pride and Lust, and <hi>casteth down Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cor. 10. 5.</note>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:93003:112"/>
               <hi>and every high thing that exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it self against the knowledge of God, and bringeth into Captivity every thought to the Obedience of Christ;</hi> it rectifies all inward Disorders, and makes us New Creatures, framed according to the Image of God in Christ; it so renews us to the Spirit of our Minds, and so conforms us to the Son of God, that our Thoughts are his Thoughts, his Ways our Ways; we love what he loves, hate what he hates, believe what he Promises, and obey what he Commands, so that our Life is hid with Christ in God. And of every true Believer it may be said as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himself, <hi>I am Crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I but</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Christ liveth in me, and the life which I live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for me.</hi> Look what those Saints and Worthies, recorded in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> did through Faith, <hi>they subdued</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Kingdoms, wrought Righteousness, obtained Promises, stopt the mouths of Lions, quenched the violence of Fire, escaped the edge of the Sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the Armies of Aliens,</hi> &amp;c. Was not this a strong and a noble Faith? Now, such
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93003:112"/>
must our Faith be; for as our Apostle tells us Verse 4. of this Chapter, it must overcome the World; <hi>he that believeth that Iesus is the Son of God, he it is that overcometh the world, and all that is in the world,</hi> viz. <hi>the lust of the Flesh, the lust of the Eyes, and the pride of Life.</hi> Thus you see what Faith is, that it is no mean and silly thing, that it is no dull, lazy, unactive Principle, but that it is strong and mighty, quick and powerful in its operation. Be not deceived then, my Friends; Examine well whether you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Christ, whether or no you have the Son of God dwelling in you by Faith, and do not flatter your selves with the conceit, unless it be so indeed. Consider, O Man, and tell me, Art thou sensible of thy Misery by Nature? of thy guilt thrô thy manifold Transgressions? Dost thou feel the Necessity of a Saviour? Dost thou run to that Fountain which is opened to the House of <hi>David,</hi> and to the Inhabitants of <hi>Israel</hi> for Sin and for Uncleanness? Dost thou hope in the Mercy of God, and rely upon the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Christ? And art thou therefore humble and penitent, and ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and resolved to amend thy Life? Dost thou, or art thou sincerely resolved
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:93003:113"/>
to resist the Devil, and wrestle against all Temptations, not in thy own, but in the Name and Strength of Christ? Can'st thou despise the Vanities of the World, all sublunary Riches and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, can'st thou freely quit them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than offend thy God? Is thy Heart with God, and can'st thou confidently trust him with thy self and all thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, and wait for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Promises? Is thy Care<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are thy Thoughts and Endeavours chiefly employed about the Kingdom of God, and the Righteousness thereof, how to grow in Grace and the Knowledge of Christ? how to abound in good Works, and to bring forth Fruit unto Holiness, that thy End may be Eternal Life? Can'st thou answer to those things positively? Dost thou find thy self thus disposed, thus inclined, thus resolved? And is this any ways to be seen in thy Life and Conversation? Then be of Courage, thou hast true Faith, and see thou take heed to preserve what thou hast, to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and encrease it. But if thou can'st not shew thy Faith by such Works and Fruits as these, thy Faith is vain, it is dead and life-less, and will not avail thee; for these Works and Effects do
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93003:113"/>
as necessarily flow from true Faith, as Light and Heat from the Sun: And as our Lord saith, ye may know the Tree by its Fruit. <hi>Every good tree bringeth forth good Fruit, but that which beareth no fruit is barren and useless, it cumbereth the ground,</hi> and is only fit for the fire.</p>
            <p>This, some will say perhaps, is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Doctrine, but it is true; it maketh many Christians to be nothing but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels; which is sad indeed, but who can help it! We must not alter the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Faith to make Men Believers, but ought rather to exhort them not to deceive themselves with Shadows and Appearances, with mere Fancies and Conceits, but to seek seriously after that Faith which is true and unfeigned. In all other things Mens Perswasions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by their Actions; and why should not Faith in Christ do so too? He who is inwardly affected and delighted with Honour, is always seeking after Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he who thinks it a fine thing to be rich, is ever catching at Gain; he who is perswaded of the Evil of any thing doth certainly forbear it, and who apprehends any thing to be good will not fail to endeavour the getting it.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93003:114"/>
Must then Faith in Christ, the Belief of the Gospel, be the only Idle, Dull, and ineffectual Perswasion? No certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is impossible but this will be active as well as the other. Consider, I pray you, and you cannot but acknowledge that Barrenness in good Works, and especially the Habit and frequent Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Sin is inconsistent with a true Faith and hearty Belief of the Gospel: For I ask if any Person should pretend a Kindness and Affection for you, and yet neither defend your Interest, nor Reputation, nor any way bestir him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in your behalf, when he had fair Occasions for it, would you believe him? And if he should be easily drawn to pick a Quarrel with you, to side with your Enemies, to molest and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you, would not you challenge him of Falshood and Hypocrisie? Now make Application to the Case in hand, and tell me then how can he be freed of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie who pretends to believe in Christ, and yet refuseth to be directed by him, never minds what is pleasing to him, but is, with every small Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, carried to the Transgression of his Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:93003:114"/>Let me therefore beseech you not to rest in a lazy, sluggish, unactive Faith, if such a thing should be called Faith: But rather seek after that true Faith which will abide the Test, and hold good, though never so narrowly search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and examined, and whose Fruits are not Words and an outward Profession only, but Obedience and a sincere Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with all the parts of the Gospel also. If you ask, how this is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. I answer (with St. <hi>Paul) faith</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> 
               <hi>cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> Give a diligent Ear to the Word of God, read and meditate on the Scriptures frequently and seriously, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider their inward Evidence and those unquestionable Testimonies have been given for evincing their Authority; lay aside all Prejudice, hearken attentively to Christ himself; for he is Light and Truth, and none can deeply contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate him, but shall be convinced and constrained to believe in him. But this we must do often and seriously; for, by short, light, and inconsiderate Thoughts, we cannot learn the Truth of any thing almost. Let us love the Truth and be desirous to know the Truth, and it shall not be hid from us;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:93003:115"/>
               <hi>For God is willing that all men come to</hi>

               <hi>the knowledge of the Truth. If the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God, should shine into them.</hi> Be not selfish, nor wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any Lust, pray to God for the Spirit of Grace, cherish and be tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to its Motions, and then no doubt he will remove from you all Infidelity, work in you Faith, and make that the Word of Christ shall richly dwell in you in all Wisdom.</p>
            <p>Thus we have seen what the Apostle means by having the Son, that it is, to believe in Christ, to have him dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in our Hearts by Faith, and that the necessary Fruits and Effects thereof is the living to him and for him, the doing all things for his Glory, and the studying carefully to demean our selves always according to his holy Word.</p>
            <p>It follows next that we consider what that Life is which is here promised and assured to every one who hath the Son.</p>
            <p>Life hath divers Acceptations in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> Life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note> Sometimes it is taken for our natural Life, and the Comforts and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:93003:115"/>
thereof in this World. But though it be true that he who hath the Son hath this Life, yet this is not the Apostle's Aim here. This Life is neither the End nor the Reward of our Faith; Christ came not to the World to be a Provisor for it. It is true, to free us from immoderate Care and Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he hath given us some Assurance of necessary Supplies: And as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Godliness hath the promise of this</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> 
               <hi>life.</hi> But these things are given in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Wicked and to the Godly, to Believers and to Infidels; yea some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their Share is greater: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the same Apostle saith, <hi>If in this</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 19.</note> 
               <hi>life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable;</hi> and that not only upon the Account of those many Crosses and Persecutions which our Faith and sincere Profession of Christ sometimes expose us to: But also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Faith raiseth our Thoughts higher than this Life; it begets in us a disgust of this World and all that is to be found in it, and even to despise Life it self, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that it affords the Occasion and Capacity of better things. What a poor, mean, silly thing is it for one to live only that he may eat, drink, and walk
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:93003:116"/>
abroad, and behold a great deal of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent noise and stir about Trifles and things of no Moment? What is there here to be seen, but a dull ill acted Tragedy, a constant Scene of Folly, Impertinency, and Sorrow? How languid and grievous must such a sight be? And especially when we cannot be simple Spectators and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, but are often necessitated to be Actors and Partners also. A mere Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, thro' natural Philosophy and the Improvement of his Reason may bring himself to despise and undervalue this present Life, and much more a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, who sees by a better and clearer Light. The present Dispensation of Providence in making Man's Life so much shorter now than what it was at first in the Patriarchs timse, is so far from being a Matter of Complaint, that it is indeed a great Blessing. He who must run will not complain of the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Race, especially if the way be not good but rough and uneven. The shortest Life is long enough if it be well employed. If we can be so wise as to live well, it is our Happiness to die soon; for then Death is but the ending of our Misery, and a wafting us over to eternal Bliss.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:93003:116"/>And this is it which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> here calls Life, it is that glorious and happy State in the other World, which God hath prepared for all true Believers. That it is this which is here meant, we need no further Proof than to look to the Verse before and after our Text; for there he names it expressly Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>This is indeed the End of our Faith, the Completion of the Promises, the great and last Design of Christianity. All other are subordinate to this. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else is given is either to further the Attainment of this, or to cherish the Hopes of it. For this end Christ was born; for this end he died and rose again; for this end the Gospel was preached, and thither tend all the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations of the Divine Providence, even to bring Men to Eternal Life, which also is called by other glorious Names in Scripture, as Heaven, the Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Glory.</p>
            <p>If you ask why the Apostle should call<note place="margin">Why Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the future State of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous is called Life.</note> this State, Life simply, when Men do live who are not in this State? The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is; he calls it Life by way of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and Excellency, no State being
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:93003:117"/>
comparable to it. It is deservedly called Life, if we either consider the Felicity or Duration of it. First, it deserveth the Name of Life upon the Account of the Felicity and Happiness it affords: for Life and Happiness are often used as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal Terms, as Words of one Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, according to that Saying, <hi>non est vivere, sed valere vita;</hi> to live merely to have a being and no more, is not worth the Name of Life: A Man would chuse to be dead rather than mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable. Wherefore it is also that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth this Life <hi>a dying daily.</hi> He only<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 31.</note> is said to live truly who liveth happily: And there is no true Happiness but in this Life which the Apostle here speaks of.</p>
            <p>What, and how great this Happiness is, is not yet known. Some late En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasts<note place="margin">Mad. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignian, <hi>and some others.</hi>
               </note> and Visionaries have taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to describe this future State, as particularly as if they had already lived some time in it: But St. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>It doth not yet appear what we shall be;</hi> and we have Reason to believe, that there was as much revealed to him as to them. What he says is certain, what they add ought to be rejected as presumptuous Dreams and Delusions. God has revealed
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:93003:117"/>
clearly that there is another Life, and has assured us, that it is more than a sufficient Recompence for all our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Services, and that it will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford perfect Contentment and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: But the particular Circumstances of that Life are yet kept secret, partly because we could not conceive or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them: We are not capable of a full Discovery of that Life, for it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds our highest Thoughts and best Apprehensions. <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, neither have entered into the</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> The Scripture speaks to us of Rivers of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, Kingdoms, Scepters, and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Crowns: But we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this no otherwise than as Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes representing something of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Worth and Value. As our greatest Thoughts of God fall short of what he is, so also all our Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Heaven; for the Happiness of Heaven is infinite like the Nature of God. Kings and Princes study to have their Courts answerable to their Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence and Dignity. How Glorious and Magnificent then must Heaven be, the Court of the great King? Whose Power
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:93003:118"/>
is Almighty, whose Wisdom is Infinite, and all whose Perfections are past find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, either by Men or Angels. Surely God shall there display himself and his Attributes, most clearly and most fully to all Beholders. St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who had a clearer Prospect of Heaven than ever any mortal Man, tells us, That there is no manner of Imperfection there. <hi>The city,</hi> saith he, <hi>had no need</hi>

               <hi>of the Sun, neither of the Moon to shine in it; for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. And there is no night there, and they need no candle, neither light of the Sun; for the Lord God giveth them light.</hi> There is also (he tells us) a Freedom and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Exemption from all Misery, Pain, and Trouble; <hi>they who are there shall</hi>

               <hi>hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the Sun light on them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any heat; for the Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne shall feed them, and lead them to living fountains of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and God shall wipe away all tears from their Eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There we shall not be clogged and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to a weak, infirm, sickly Body, as now; <hi>for then this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:93003:118"/>
               <hi>and Christ Iesus shall change this vile body, that it may be fashioned like</hi>

               <note place="margin">Philip 3. 21.</note> 
               <hi>even to subdue all things to himself.</hi> And if our Bodies shall suffer such glorious Changes, what think you shall be done to our Souls those precious and better parts of us? It is not to be doubted, but they also shall be highly exalted and perfected; we shall not be liable to Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Error, but shall be enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Knowledge of all Truth; for (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith) <hi>Now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face; now</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 12.</note> 
               <hi>we know in part, but then shall we know even as we are known.</hi> There shall be excellent, choice, and most desirable Company, not only all Saints, and the Spirits of just Men made perfect, but Angels and Arch-Angels, Cherubims and Seraphims: And we shall not only have the Pleasure of their Company, but shall be <hi>equal unto them,</hi> as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour<note place="margin">Luke 19. 36.</note> tells us. Nay, which is yet more, there we shall enjoy Christ and God; and not only enjoy them, but be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into their Likeness. <hi>Beloved</hi> (saith St. <hi>Iohn</hi>) <hi>now we are the Sons of God, and it doth not appear what we shall be, but this we know, that when he doth</hi>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:93003:119"/>
               <hi>appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</hi> Seeing this doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, what needs more, there is no climbing higher. God is the Height of Perfection, and the Fountain of all Happiness: And it is impossible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive greater Felicity, than what this Enjoyment of God, and Likeness to him amount to. The highest Creatures are not capable of more. The aspiring to be as Gods was the Sin of our first Parents, and did tempt them to eat the forbidden Fruit, and was the Occasion of all that Misery which came upon them and us both. But behold we are now to become as God, in a higher, better, and truer sense than what they aimed at, or could have come to by any Fruit, tho' it had not been forbidden. <hi>Behold what manner of Love is this, wherewith the Father hath loved us, that we should be called the Sons of God!</hi> What ineffable Glory! What high Dignity is this that Man is now exalted to! Lord, what is Man that thou art so mindful of him? And the Son of Man that thou visitest him? Thou hast made him but a little lower than the Angels here in this World, and hereafter thou designest to make him equal to them, yea like unto

thy self! How astonishing are the Thoughts of this! What Admiration may they breed!</p>
            <p>Especially when all this Glory and Honour is not for a Day, a Month, or a Year, but to all Eternity. The Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this State is another Reason why the Apostle calls it Life. What is short and momentany deserves not the Name of Life; and therefore our Life in this World is reckoned, in Scripture, but as a Breath, a Vapour; it is to be esteemed but as a Puff of Wind. But that Life above suffers no Changes; it is unalterable, it never hath an end; it lasts not only a thousand thousand Years, but for ever and ever. Here we think much if we have a few Days Peace and Contentment: But they who are in Heaven are eternally happy.</p>
            <p>Thus we see what sort of Life it is<note place="margin">Iesus Christ the Discoverer of this Life.</note> our Text speaks of. If you ask, to whom are we indebted for it? Look to the preceeding Verse, and there you will find it. <hi>This is the Record, that God hath given to us Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son.</hi> It is to Jesus Christ only that we owe the Obligation; it is by him, and through him, and for him that we come to Life; for he only
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93003:120"/>
is the Discoverer of it; he only is the Author of it, and only hath the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and giving of it. First, he is the Discoverer thereof; <hi>he hath brought Life and Immortality to light through the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 10.</note> Before the Gospel was published, Men were ignorant of this Life; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Certainty nor Nature of it were known. The Wise Heathens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had some Notion of a Life after this; they judged it reasonable, that the Soul should survive the Body. But however, all they talkt were mere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures; they had no Assurance of the Truth. And tho' it be certain, that the Jews had the Promise of Eternal Life, as well as temporal good things; and that all the pious and holy Men among them lived in Expectation of it, yet it was so darkly revealed even to them, that you know, there was one Sect amongst them who denied the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection altogether, and even those who believed it had no very right and worthy Thoughts thereof, or else they might have soon refuted the Sadducees gross Apprehensions. But whatever Knowledge either Jews or Heathens of old had of another Life, it is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to Christ; for <hi>he is the Light</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:93003:120"/>
               <hi>which lighteth every man that cometh into</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 1. 7.</note> 
               <hi>the World.</hi> And now he hath put this Matter clearly out of Doubt. Neither the Resurrection from the dead nor the Life hereafter needs now be disputed as doubtful Problems; for Jesus Christ hath given evident Demonstrations of the Truth of them, by his plain Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and express Promises, and his own Resurrection.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, Christ is not only the<note place="margin">And the Author of it.</note> Discoverer of Eternal Life, but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof also. There was more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the attaining this than the mere Discovery of it. This was above humane reach: It was too great a height for Man of himself to climb to. If any had attempted this, trusting in his own worth, he had been certainly baffled and defeated: His Boldness as it served to be laught at, so it should have been punished. But as Christ hath shewed us this, so he hath purchased it for us. It is the Merits of Christ which have opened the Kingdom of Heaven; and it is by his Strength that we perform the Conditions of entering into it. And when we have performed the Conditions it is even he himself who bestows it on us; <hi>for he is that holy one who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:93003:121"/>

            <p>Which leads us to the last particular; namely, to shew, That all who have the Son have Life. This is a Point we need<note place="margin">

Members will not be divided; where the one is, the other will be also. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will that they also whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me.</hi> And we are sure, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heareth the Son. Believers also have good ground to hope for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life; for Faith is the very Seed and Principle from which it flows. The Life of Faith is the beginning of the Life of Glory; the one is but the Perfection and Completion of the other. Blessed is he therefore who believeth; for there shall be a Performance of those things which are told him from the Lord. It is Faith then, and Faith only which giveth us a title to Eternal Life; such a Faith, I mean, as was formerly described. <hi>He that so believeth on the Son hath everlasting life,</hi> and <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> They who do not, and will not embrace Christ here, shall not be Embraced by him hereafter. They who refuse his Yoke in this World, shall in the World to come be cast out of his glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and thrown to that place of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, where there is weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of Teeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:93003:122"/>Now, that we may draw to a close;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> Practical Inferences.</note> what an Influence should these Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations have upon our Souls? What a<note place="margin">1.</note> holy disdain should they work in us of those Sublunary and perishing things? How much should we despise and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value those empty and fading Vanities, seeing we have such infinitely better things prepared for us, and waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us? Doth he, who is called to a Kingdom, mind Sticks and Straws, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles and petty inconsiderable things? Remember (O Christian) what thou art, and what thou art called to; keep up the Decorum that is suitable to the dignity of thy Person, and walk worthy of the Vocation whereunto thou art called. Do not creep upon thy Belly, and lie groveling upon the Ground; lift up thy Head, and let thy Heart be where thou seest thy Treasure is. Be not like the foolish <hi>Indians,</hi> who sell their Gold, and their Pearls and other precious things for Brass, and Iron, and Glass Beads. Do not seek to fill thy Belly with Husks, when thou mayst have fulness of Bread in thy Father's House. Do not grasp so fast, but let go those painted Vanities, those mere sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Delight, and make sure to thy
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:93003:122"/>
self that fulness of Joy, and those Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Pleasure, which are at God's Right hand for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Consider those things, that<note place="margin">2.</note> thou mayst have Comfort in thy Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that thou mayst bear up, with a chearful Spirit, under all the Crosses that are laid on thee. The hopes of Heaven do lighten the burthen of Affliction; they take away the heavy pressure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. How light should we consider our Affliction, which is but for a moment, seeing it is followed by a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and Eternal weight of Glory? <hi>Look unto Iesus the author and finisher of our Faith, who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the Cross, despising the shame, and is now set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi> Now, <hi>if we suffer with him, we shall be also</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> 
               <hi>glorified together with him:</hi> And <hi>I reckon</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that the sufferings of this</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18.</note> 
               <hi>present time are not worthy to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the glory that shall be revealed in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Consider what a mighty En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement<note place="margin">3.</note> this Blessed life is, and what a powerful inducement it should be to Prayer, Meditation, to all Holy Duties, and, in a word, to a hearty compliance
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93003:123"/>
with the whole Gospel? We are not commanded those things in vain, for naught; all the pains we are at this way shall be well rewarded. Do we toil and sweat for the Bread which perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? And shall we not labour for that which endureth to Eternal Life? Do Men venture upon Merciless Seas? Do they throw themselves upon the Points of Swords, and before the mouths of Cannons for a little Gain or some small piece of Honour? And shall we refuse to walk Circumspectly, to live Soberly, Righteously, and Godly, for Heaven and Eternal Life. Be ashamed (O Christian) of thy Sloth and Laziness; blush to see some taking more Pains for Earth than thou art for Heaven, for Perishing thant hou art for Eternal Riches. You see your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is not in vain; be stedfast therefore and immoveable, and always abounding in the Work of the Lord; run with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the Race that is set before you, and run so that you may obtain. Do not faint and weary in well-doing, but persevere therein to the very End. <hi>Be thou faithful unto the death</hi> (saith Christ)<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and I will give thee a Crown of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, Let what hath been said raise<note place="margin">4.</note> your Appetite, and stir up in you a
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:93003:123"/>
Holy and Sincere Desire of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord's Supper, which strengthens your Faith, cherishes your Hope, gives you the Encrease of Grace here, and is to you a sure Pawn and Pledge of Glory hereafter: For this Holy Sacrament is the Body and Blood of the Lord Jesus, not the Sacred Symbols and Representations thereof only, but the conveyance of the Merits of his Death and Sufferings also. Now, <hi>Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</hi> Eat therefore (O Friends) Drink, yea Drink abundantly, O Beloved, that your Souls may be satisfied and live for evermore.</p>
            <q>Now unto him who hath loved us, and given himself unto the Death for us, and who hath opened the Kingdom of Heaven to all Believers, even unto Iesus Christ, with the Father and Blessed Spirit, the Glorious and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible Trinity, be all Praise, Honour and Glory, for ever and ever.</q>

            <p>WHAT the Church Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morates in this great <hi>Festival</hi> of <hi>Easter,</hi> solemnly celebrated by <hi>all Antiquity,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> evidently proves in this Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> That important Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our <hi>Creed, the Resurrection of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> And from this, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily he deduceth another most mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Point, which is <hi>the Certainty of our own Resurrection.</hi> The <hi>firm Belief</hi> of both these Points, are not only <hi>absolutely Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> but also the <hi>serious</hi> and <hi>frequent Consideration</hi> of them is most useful, that we may be strengthened and encouraged in our <hi>Temptations,</hi> comforted in our <hi>Troubles,</hi> and animated to a <hi>chearful Labouring</hi> in <hi>every work of the Lord.</hi> The certainty of an <hi>after state,</hi> as well as <hi>the Quality thereof,</hi> is only known by
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:93003:124"/>
the <hi>Gospel,</hi> it is <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> only who hath <hi>brought Life and Immortality to Light through the Gospel;</hi> The <hi>Heathens</hi> had some knowledge thereof, but it was very faint; It was only as a Dream and Imagination: for when our <hi>Apostle</hi> taught it at <hi>Athens,</hi> he was counted a <hi>Babler,</hi> and was mocked there even by the Philosophers themselves. And among the <hi>Iews</hi> there was the Sect of the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees</hi> who believed neither <hi>Resurrection</hi> nor <hi>Spirit.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> attacks these <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean</hi> and <hi>Sadducean Principles</hi> in this Chapter, for it would seem that some of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> were corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them, and said, That <hi>there is no Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> though the belief of this point be so essential to a Christian, that he ceases to be one who denies it.</p>
            <p>The words of our Text are one of those Arguments, St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes use of, for evincing the Truth and certainty of our Resurrection, and it is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken <hi>ex absurdo;</hi> which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a demonstration even in the strictest Science; for there be many Propositions of the Mathematicks which cannot be otherwise demonstrated, than by shewing the absurd Consequences of their being false.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:93003:125"/>I shall endeavour to demonstrate the strength and force of this Argument of St. <hi>Paul</hi> for another Life: But first let us consider the Truth of his Assertion here, <hi>that we,</hi> that is, Good and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Christians, <hi>would be of all others the most miserable, if there were no more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected than what this Life doth afford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> saith here, that if Christians<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> Misery and Trouble not peculiar to a state of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note> had no hope but in this Life <hi>they would be of all Men most miserable:</hi> He doth not say, they would be the only mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Persons, whereby he clearly insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates, that others as well as they are liable to Misery in this World. As some Ignorant and Unjust Men charge Religion, with Commotions and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs in the World, and make it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to Commonwealths and Civil Societies, though its Principles, if truly understood, and candidly received, and heartily obeyed, would certainly tend to their Peace, Settlement and Security; So there be some who count Religion a great obstruction to the Happiness of private Men, that it imbitters our Lives, that it only damps our Pleasures, and that it doth render Men wretched, by obliging them to much inward Sorrow, and Contrition, and exposing them to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:93003:125"/>
much outward Trouble and Affliction. There be who think and alledge, that Men would have an uninterrupted Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and a constant Pleasure and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, if it were not for the restraints that Religion and the Laws of God lay upon them. But we may see the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, from daily Experience, they who are farthest from God, and the observing his Laws, are not the farthest from Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and Trouble; Nay, oft-times Men, by forsaking God, and his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, have involved themselves into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable Trouble, and brought upon them Misery and Punishments, less sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable than what has befallen any for their strict adherence to God, and the Laws of Christianity. It is true, the way of Religion is narrow, and set with Thorns; but the broad way has its uneasiness too, and in it Men meet also with mischievous and hurtful Accidents. <hi>The wicked man travelleth with pain all</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 18. 20.</note> 
               <hi>his days,</hi> saith <hi>Eliphaz.</hi> And <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 57. 20.</note> compares <hi>the wicked to the troubled sea, which is still casting forth mire and dirt.</hi> The Distempers and Diseases, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low intemperance and excess in Meat and Drink, are more troublesome, even to the flesh, than Fasting and Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93003:126"/>
and the other Severities which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion prescribes. I shall not name that shameful Disease which is the ordinary Reward of unclean Persons; but only observe, that as it is dishonourable, even among the Devil's Votaries, so certainly it is more grievous to be born, than Persecution or Martyrdom for the Name of <hi>Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not to insist further on these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> They are Common to the state of Mankind in this World.</note> Evils, which follow Vice and Sin; let us consider Men in general in this World, and we shall see, that they are liable to many Temporal Miseries, and that though they would renounce Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, they could not secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from Trouble and Sorrow. <hi>Iob</hi> speaking of Mankind in general, saith, <hi>That man that is born of a woman, is but of few days, and full of trouble.</hi> Which is a Truth, that all the World will assent to, from their particular experience: Our Bodies are subject to Diseases, our Goods are exposed to Violence and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, the Country we live in is liable to be infested with Wars, Pestilence and Famine. It were too tedious for me to reckon up all the particular Troubles, Crosses and Afflictions, which Man's Life is exposed to in this World, and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:93003:126"/>
some one or other of them, every Man is daily encountering. <hi>Great travel is created for every man, and an heavy yoke is laid upon the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of their mothers womb, till the day that they return to the Mother of all things;</hi> says the wise Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> upon which account <hi>Solomon praised the dead, which are already dead, more than the living which are yet alive; Yea,</hi> saith he, <hi>better is he than both they</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 4. 23.</note> 
               <hi>which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work which is done under the Sun.</hi> So that it seems, he thought it better not to be born, than to be born and to live only to see and feel the Miseries of this Life, which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, if Men be only destinated for this present temporal Life. What S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of Christians, <hi>that of all others they will be the most miserable,</hi> may be said of Mankind in general, with a respect to other Creatures, if all after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopes shall be taken away, and that they be not considered with a relation to the other World. The Beasts and brute Creatures; are more happy than we, they are brought forth with less pain, and brought up with much less care; they come sooner to perfection, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93003:127"/>
at the sensible Pleasures, proper to their several beings with more facility and less travel; they are liable to fewer Calamities, and are not so much inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in their Enjoyments; they live easily without Reflection, and die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regret or trouble; so that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if there be no respect to another World, Man is a more vain and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature than Brutes, and still the more Miserable, as he is, the more Wise and Good. Wherefore it is that the Apostle saith here of Christians, That <hi>if in this life only we have hope,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For first, Besides these general Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> Christians and Good men more liable to be miserable in this Life than others. And the Reason why it is so.</note> which, as Men, they are liable unto; Christians are exposed to many particular Troubles and Afflictions, upon the account of their Profession: For the Doctrines they teach and believe, the Rules which they follow themselves, and prescribe to others, are so contrary to Flesh and Blood, and so opposite to the Interests and common Sentiments of corrupt Men, that they are still draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon themselves Storms of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. Our Saviour not only forwarns his Disciples of these Persecutions that would arise, for the Gospels sake, but he makes the cheerful undergoing of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93003:127"/>
them, the indispensible condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Disciple, and prescribes it as the first Lesson to be learned of them; <hi>If any man</hi> (saith he) <hi>will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his Cross and follow me.</hi> As the <hi>Iews</hi> were greatly mistaken in their expectation of a <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi> thinking he was to establish a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Kingdom and to bestow Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Rewards; So Christians will be much mistaken if they think by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christ, to secure themselves of Wealth, Honour, Riches, Preferments, and other Worldly Advantages: For oftentimes they who cleave to Christ are forced to part with These, and who cannot let them go on some occasions, must part with him; for both cannot be kept together. As in one place, our Saviour saith, <hi>He that loveth father or</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 37.</note> 
               <hi>mother more than me, is not worthy of me, and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me; And he that taketh not his Cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.</hi> So in another place, he saith plainly, <hi>If any man come to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 14. 26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife and children, and brethren and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my Disciple, and whoso doth not bear</hi>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:93003:128"/>
               <hi>his Cross and come after me, cannot be my Disciple;</hi> which our Apostle and his other fellow Apostles, and the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians found to be true by their own Experience; for, by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Disciples of Jesus Christ, they not only forfeited the common Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and Conveniencies of this Life, but they also suffered all the Torments, Indignities, and Cruelties, which enraged Men could inflict, They were <hi>tortured, and had tryal of cruel mockings and scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging;</hi> yea, and of <hi>Bonds and Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> they were <hi>stoned, sawn asunder, tempted, and slain with the sword, they wandred about in sheeps skins, and in goats skins, being destitute, afflicted, and tormented.</hi> And though <hi>the World was not worthy of them, yet they were made to wander in Deserts, and in Mountains, and in Dens, and Caves of the Earth.</hi> Now this being the Condition of Christians, St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, they would be, of all others, <hi>the most miserable, if they had hope only in this present life,</hi> for he speaks this with a relation to the Persecutions and Afflictions they were then made to suffer, as appears from the 31. and 32. Verses of this Chapter, where he tells <hi>of being in Ieopardy every hour, of his dying</hi>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:93003:128"/>

            <p>But then it will be alledged, that this Speech of St. <hi>Paul</hi> holds not always true. It might be true that Christians were most miserable in the days of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and sometime after, when Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution raged against them. But the like cannot be said at other times, when they are allowed to live at Peace, and in Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness. To which we reply that there is always reason to pronounce this of Christians, even upon the Account of the Crosses and Afflictions, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to more than others: For in all times, Sufferings of one kind or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attend either the Profession or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Christianity. <hi>All that will live</hi>

               <hi>In the World</hi> (said our Saviour to his Disciples) <hi>you shall have trouble.</hi> There will still be Trouble, though not always of the same kind, nor in the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. From the beginning, <hi>He that was born after the flesh, persecuted him that was born after the spirit, and it is even so now,</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) and it will be so still to the end of the World. God suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not the Hatred and Malice of the wicked, to rage alike hotly against his People, nor does he let the storms of Persecution fall always down in a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous violent manner; but he gives his People some respite, lest they should faint. However these Storms are always breeding: And it is the Duty of all true Christians to expect them, and to be preparing for them. The World in its calmest Mood, is to be regarded, as the Mariners do the Sea, which, though it sometimes puts on a fair and smooth Face, yet of it self it is a dangerous and uncertain Element, easie to be disturbed and apt to rage, so that they, who are upon it, are never secure, they move in continual danger, and every hour are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a thousand Hazards and Mischan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which oblige them to be always on their guard: Thus the Life of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93003:129"/>
in this World, is more a Warefare than that of other Men, they struggle continually either with actual Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or with the Fear of them, which may prove no less incommodious and prejudicial to their Peace and Quiet.</p>
            <p>But here it may be asked, if such be the Life and Condition of Christians, how is this consistent with those Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Promises which the Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with? Doth not the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle say, <hi>that godliness is profitable to all</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> 
               <hi>things, having the promise of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come?</hi> For answer hereto, you must know, that Religion and Godliness do, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, directly and naturally tend to procure us temporal Happiness, but the Disorders which sin hath raised, and the general Wickedness of the World, do interrupt this natural Order and Course; as in a well ordered Civil State and Common-wealth, Innocence, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and righteous Dealing is ones best Security from civil Punishments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in a corrupt and degenerate State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where there is no respect to Justice, or Equity, that will not save a Man; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Favour, Interest, and base Deeds, will prevail more than the greatest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:93003:130"/>
Moreover, God gives the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Promises, to take us off from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Care and Anxiety for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things; and to confirm our Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on him, by assuring us, that he will provide what of these things he sees convenient. But we are not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret them as Assurances of an Affluence of Worldly Enjoyments; nor must we accuse him of Breach of Promise, when we do not flow in Earthly Pleasures. He may very well keep his Word, tho' these outward things do not so much abound, if with a little external Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure he give much inward Peace and Contentment, as he doth always to his own Children: <hi>For, he maketh the little</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 37. 16.</note> 
               <hi>of a righteous man to be better than the riches of many wicked:</hi> Under the Law God's Favour was expressed much in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Blessings and Advantages; But it is otherwise now under the Gospel. It is true, there are temporal promises in the Gospel, but they have an express Clause of Reservation of the Cross and Persecution, as you may see, <hi>Mark</hi> X. 30.</p>
            <p>However, the Text still holds true. Consider, true Christians, whatever way you please; let them be never so well sheltred from Persecution, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93003:130"/>
Crosses; let them have this Life, and all its Advantages, yet if they have no ground of Hope beyond it, they are still miserable and more miserable than others, who come short of their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Perfection: For by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel they are made sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the Vanity of all sublunary things, are taught to despise and contemn them; they have their Desires raised after a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler Felicity than any here below, which yet they can never obtain, but must still despair of, if so be there be no Life after this: And therefore they can have no true Pleasure in this, because they see themselves in an Impossibility of getting that good which their Souls crave. He cannot chuse but be discontented, and consequently miserable, who can never have that State and Condition suitable to the Greatness of his Mind: What a Torment is it to a Great Spirit, and one of an Heroick Mind, to stoop to mean silly things? how uneasie would it be to one who has improved himself in all Wisdom and Learning, and other Moral Endowments to be confined always to Boyish Exercises. Now the Plays of Children are not so far below Men of Age and Understanding, as the best State
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93003:131"/>
and chiefest Imployment of this World, is below a true Christians Mind, who is improved to a Capacity of a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God; and whose holy Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aims at no less.</p>
            <p>Who considers this Life only as a Place of Improvement for that better Life above, may be contented and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in every State, because there is no State which doth not afford abundant Occasions of recommending ones self to God, and acquiring those Qualifications necessary to Eternal Life: But abstract from this, what a dull thing is Life, and how tedious and irksome must it be to every wise and good Man? if it were not in order to another Life, this would not be desireable, and the shortest Life would be preferable to the longest; to be condemned to <hi>Methusalem</hi>'s Life, would be no small Affliction; to be obliged to live for Nine Hundred Years in a Bedlam, and to dwell always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Fools and Knaves, for the World generally is no better, where there is daily repeated the same Scene of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence and Villainy: This I say, would be very grievous to wise and thinking Men. Wherefore it clearly appears that if there were no hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:93003:131"/>
this Life, the best and wisest men would of all others be the most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and that in this case, Knowledge and Vertue would not at all be desireable, because they would serve only to beget in Men a disgust of this Life. The most brutish would then be the most happy, because as they aim no farther than the present Life, so they want the sense to perceive the Meanness of it.</p>
            <p>Now the Truth of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Assertion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> The Force of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Argument for the Proof of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Life.</note> in the Text, being thus cleared, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed next to shew the Forcibleness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for evincing another Life. That Men should be more miserable than other Creatures; and the best Men the most miserable Men, is a gross Absurdity. And who asserteth it, fixeth an Imputation upon God, which cannot be mentioned without the horridest Blasphemy. Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodness are essential Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of the Deity: But neither of them would appear, if Men were less happy than Beasts, and the best of Men more miserable than the rest. What a vain thing were Man, if he were altogether mortal? And how unlike the product of an infinite Wisdom? Where were infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wisdom, if a Creature, capable of Immortality, made only some short Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93003:132"/>
upon a Stage of Vanity and Misery, and then removed and turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing. If the Faculties of an Angelical Life, and the Capacities for the highest Perfection, were given to one who could never step beyond the Meanness of an Animal and Sensual Life. And where were Divine Justice and Goodness, if there were no difference betwixt good and bad? If it fared alike with the worst and with the best; if they who feared, loved, and served God, should not partake more of his Favour than they who had no regard to him, nor to his Laws. If then it be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Wisdom and Goodness of God to make Men less happy than Beasts, and to suffer the best of Men to be more miserable than the worst, and that it would be certainly so, if there were no other Life, then certainly there must be another better Life, to make the vast Difference that should be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Man and other Creatures, and good and bad Men. Therefore, the Miseries of Mankind in this World, but especially of good Men, are an evident Proof, that there is another Life to come. <hi>Quod erat demonstrandum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:93003:132"/>Having thus laid before you the solid<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> Inferences.</note> ground of a Christian's Hope, and the strong reasons why we should look for a better Life to come, I will next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to draw some necessary Inferences from this great important Truth.</p>
            <p>And first, we may learn hence the<note place="margin">First.</note> true Rules of measuring our own, and other Mens Happiness, which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, not always things present, but that which is to come. It is no great matter to discern who hath the greatest Wealth, the highest Honour, and largest Possessions: But from these we cannot conclude, who is the happiest; for Man's Happiness <hi>Consists not in the abundance of these outward things, which he possesseth,</hi> but in the sure and well grounded Hopes of that better life to come. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things of this World, can neither secure the present Life, nor make it comfortable to a truly wise considering Man: It is only the hope of Heaven and Eternal Life, which yieldeth true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and Satisfaction to the Soul: Who wanteth this Hope is miserable, how splendid soever his outward State be. And though one possess nothing of this World, but live in the want of all outward Comforts; Yet if he be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:93003:133"/>
with this inward Consolation, if he be filled with a lively hope of that Life which is above, and demean himself so, as that he certainly shall come to it. There can be none more happy, his happiness is beyond Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> This sheweth that the wicked<note place="margin">Second.</note> and ungodly are truly miserable, and the good and upright always happy; for the last have what the other cannot have, a hope beyond this Life. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith here, that he, and such as himself, would be of all others, the most miserable, if their hope were only in this Life; so they must be of all others, the most happy, because their hope is not confined to this Life, but reacheth far beyond it. Wherefore look not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together upon Mens outside, neither let your selves be deceived with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Prosperity and Success of the wicked, nor scared with the Crosses and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Godly, let not these things tempt you, to say, That <hi>it is vain to serve God, and what profit is it to have kept his ordinances, and to have walked mournfully before the Lord of Hosts?</hi> Call not the proud happy, neither magnifie them that work Wickedness; nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:93003:133"/>
the Good as Fools, and mean spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Persons; suspend your Judgment until you have seen, and considered the end of both; For what <hi>Solon</hi> said to <hi>Croesus,</hi> is most true, no Man can be counted happy before Death. <hi>Then shall ye return and discern betwixt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the wicked, between him that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth God, and him that serveth him not, for they shall be mine saith the Lord of Hosts, in that day when I make up my Iewels, and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. But behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts; that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the good and upright have not only the Advantage of the wicked in the other World, they have it also in this; for the Prospect of Eternal Life, and the sure Hopes they have of it, give them greater Joy and Satisfaction, than the wicked can receive from their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and Enjoyments: What results from the one is dull and insipid in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the other. And as the wicked have less Joy and Satisfaction even here,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:93003:134"/>
so they are disquieted with many vexing Cares and tormenting Fears, wherewith the Souls of the righteous are never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: For not to speak of the Terrours of Hell, which sometimes seize them; they place all their Happiness in these outward things, which are daily liable to a Thousand Hazards; and therefore it is that they are never at rest, but miserably tossed with Cares and Fears. The difference betwixt the godly and the wicked, may be compared to that of two Persons at Sea in a most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Storm, where there is Hope of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Life, but nothing else. But the one has a goodly Inheritance, to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he comes to Land, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be much cast down; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the other having lost his whole Stock and Substance, is not only miserably damped with Grief for the Loss of that, but also quite confounded with the Thoughts of his after Poverty and Misery.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This Doctrine of the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">Third.</note> of another better Life, serves greatly to comfort us under the Miseries and Calamities of this; and therefore that we may have this Comfort, let us both firmly fix the Belief of it in our Hearts,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:93003:134"/>
and also frequently meditate thereon. It is in vain for any to expect to pass thorow this World without Trouble and Affliction, and there is no true support under any Affliction, but the <hi>lively hope of that glory which is to be revealed;</hi> with this, one may bear the heaviest Cross chearfully; and without it, the lightest Affliction may overwhelm the spirit; <hi>For this cause,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, we</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 16.</note> 
               <hi>faint not, for though our outward man pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day; for our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> Cheer up thy Spirit whosoever thou art, that liest under the pressure of any Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if thou repentest of thy Sins, if thou lovest God, and be resolved to walk so as to please him, why shouldst thou be cast down? Lift up thine Eyes unto yonder Regions above, and consider what an Interest thou hast there? what a blessed Inheritance is there reserved for you? Is thy condition here uneasie and troublesom, and art thou still tossed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout? remember when thou comest there, thou shalt have all Rest and Peace. Art thou hated by Men, and persecuted with their Hands and Tongues, let not
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:93003:135"/>
that vex thee, seeing thou art Beloved of God, and hast Friends Above who will shortly receive thee unto their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Habitations, where are good things which neither <hi>eye hath seen, nor ear heard, nor can the heart of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.</hi> Take the spoiling of your Goods joyfully, <hi>knowing that ye have in Heaven a better and an enduring sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi> Dost thou here suffer the want of all things, bear it for a while pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, for when thou ascendest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and enter'st into the presence of God, thou shalt find <hi>fulness of joy, and rivers of pleasures for evermore.</hi> The bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this Life shall be abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced, by the sweetness and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the other; There it is where we shall be comforted for all the days wherein we have been afflicted: For there <hi>men shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the Sun light on them, nor any heat; for the Lamb</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 7. 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>which is in the midst of the Throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters; and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</hi> When <hi>Columbus</hi> set first out to Sea, in order to discover a New World, he suffered unspeakable Straits, Hardships and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:93003:135"/>
The very reading of them is astonishing, yet he still bore out, by the hope of discovering Land, which was very faint and uncertain; for he only conjectured that there might be such a thing. Now, if such a faint and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hope of an Earthly Country, could make one run upon so many Hazards, and bear up under such Disasters, what a support to our Minds, and a Comfort to our Spirits, should the hope of an Heavenly Country be? a Country whose Riches, and Glory and Felicity, we poor Mortals cannot conceive, much less ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press: And which is no Dream, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, but which is clearly demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, by the Word of God; And from which nothing can obstruct us, if we be but <hi>stedfast</hi> and <hi>immoveable,</hi> and always <hi>abounding in the work of the Lord.</hi> Death might have prevented <hi>Columbus</hi>'s Discovery, and robb'd him of that Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; but Death cannot impede our passage unto Heaven; for it is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means of entring into it; It is the very loosing of the Fetters, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the Cloggs, which detain us in this miserable Life, and a setting us at Liberty to return to God, whence we came, and to take possession of that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:93003:136"/>
glorious Life, which Christ hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased for us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and lastly; Is there a Life<note place="margin">Fourth.</note> after this, and a blessed Life too? Then certainly it becometh us to give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to secure it for our selves; 'tis no less our Interest than our Duty. It will not fall to our Lot by Chance, and without we use true endeavours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. It is true, Jesus Christ hath purchased this Life for us, and payed the <hi>price of it,</hi> without which no Man could ever have expected it: But still it lies on us to qualifie our selves for it, by the Performances of those Conditions on which it is granted, and these are Faith and Holiness.</p>
            <p>First, We must have Faith, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, saith the Scripture, <hi>it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to please God;</hi> And if it be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to please him without Faith, it is impossible to expect Heaven without it; for he will never admit one there who doth not please him. <hi>He that believeth</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 36.</note> 
               <hi>on the Son, hath everlasting life, and he that believeth not on the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you ask what Faith is. It is to believe the Existence of God, his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:93003:136"/>
Power, his Infinite Wisdom, his Incomprehensible Goodness, and his most Wise and Watchful Providence; It is, to give a most hearty assent to the Truth of his Word, to the Authority and Goodness of his Laws, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable greatness of his Promises, and to the Justice of his Threatnings; It is to receive, with Zeal and Affection, the Lord Jesus Christ, to own the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Nature and Dignity of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and to acknowledge the Necessity, Vertue, and Usefulness of his Offices of Prophet, Priest, and King: Finally, it is to admit, by a profound Humility, the Incomprehensible Mystery of the Trinity, and to depend upon the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Operation of the Holy Spirit, the third Person of the God-head. Our Faith must comprehend all this: And without this Faith no Man can be saved: For unless a Man believe all that God has clearly proposed, he not only does not honour God as he ought, but he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dishonours and affronts him.</p>
            <p>Now the true evidence of this Faith is Holiness, which is also the other Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required of those that would be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Faith without works,</hi> saith St. <hi>Iames, is dead;</hi> And <hi>without holiness,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:93003:137"/>
               <hi>no man shall see the Lord,</hi> Heb. xii. 14. How fit and proper unsanctified Persons may be for settling and propagating Christ's Kingdom upon Earth, I do not well know, but this I know, and am sure of, that none shall share of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom, but they <hi>who are pure as he is pure; Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The absolute necessity of Holiness, will, I suppose, be acknowledged by all, but I fear many mistake what it is, and wherein it consists. Some think, that it lies in varnishing a little the outside, the putting on a form of Godliness, like the <hi>Pharisees</hi> whom our Saviour resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to whited Sepulchers, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered rottenness and filth; Some think they are holy enough, if their Opinions be sound, and that they are in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with an Orthodox Party, and a Zeal to promote that Party which they think so, is all the Sanctity which others aim at. I heard of one who said of a certain Person, That she was a Saint indeed, because, she had the <hi>Vocabula Artis;</hi> What he meant thereby, I do not well know, except it was, That she spake the Dialect, and used the Phrases
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:93003:137"/>
peculiar to some People. Indeed he that is Holy, will take heed to his words; but I know no kind of Language suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to sanctifie one; and if there were, then there needed not great violence in taking the Kingdom of Heaven. But not to pursue these manifold sad Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes of Men, true Holiness regardeth God, our neighbours, and our selves. As it regards God, it consists in loving him sincerely above all things, being ready to part with any thing rather than offend him; In being zealously concerned for his Glory and Interest according to Knowledge and Equity: <hi>For evil must not be done that good may come, who doth so,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, their damnation is just;</hi> to drive on things <hi>per fas &amp; nefas,</hi> is so far from honouring God, that it occasions him to be Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed. Finally, he truly loves God, and is holy towards him, who makes Conscience of keeping his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>O that my ways were directed to keep thy Statutes! Then shall I not be ashamed when I have respect to all thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> Psal. cxix. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>But, Secondly; He that is holy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, will be holy also in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Conversation towards Men; these
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:93003:138"/>
two God hath joined together by his Word, and Men must not put them asunder: Now Holiness towards Men is to <hi>honour all men, and to love the brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;</hi> to deal with others as we would be dealt with, to be unjust to none, but to render all their due according to their several Places and Relations: And if I have not quite mistaken the Moral of the Christian Religion, it takes in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Obedience to our Superiours, and lawful Governours, in things lawful. Moreover, Holiness towards our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, comprehends Mercy and Charity. We ought to have Compassion upon him, to relieve his Wants according to our Ability, to forgive his Faults, and to cover his Infirmities as much as possible. A holy Man will not be hard-hearted and severe towards his Neighbour in his Transactions with him, nor will he Treat him with the utmost Rigour, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when it cannot be done without his ruin. And St. <hi>Iames</hi> tells us, <hi>He shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy,</hi> James ii. 13.</p>
            <p>Lastly, To compleat our Holiness, we must look well to our selves, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preserve our selves <hi>unspotted from this World,</hi> we must <hi>walk honestly as in</hi>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:93003:138"/>
               <hi>the day, not in chambering and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, not in gluttony and drunkenness, not in strife and envy, nor making provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.</hi> Frequent or habitual Excess and Rioting, Whoredom and Uncleanness, Lascivious Looks and Speeches, not only spoil the Beauty of Holiness, but quite deface it. As to our selves; Holiness is Chastity and Purity, Modesty and Humility, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and Sobriety, the taking care to suppress the Corruption of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to improve our selves in the exercise of every Grace. Thus I have given you a true Scheme of that Holiness to which Eternal Life is promised: And having such a Promise, let us therefore <hi>Cleanse our selves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. vii. 1.</p>
            <p>By these things we must study to qualifie our selves for that other better life, otherwise we do in vain expect it. Whether it be fit and proper to imploy. Wicked and Unhallowed hands in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up the Temple of God in this World, I shall not now determine; but sure I am, such shall never inherit the Kingdom of God in the other: Let Men be never so active and zealous for
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:93003:139"/>
Christ's Kingdom upon Earth, tho' they Prophesie in his Name, and in his Name cast out Devils, and do many wondrous Works; yet if they be workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, he will say unto them, <hi>Depart from me, I never knew you.</hi> As the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of an after happy state, is clearly demonstrated in Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so there is nothing more plain and evident, than that <hi>holiness thorough Iesus Christ is the only way that leads to it.</hi> What a strange thing then is it, and how unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that those who profess a Desire and Hope of this Life, do not walk in this Way thereto? We have at present a great deal of talk about Religion, but there was never less of the Practice thereof. There was never more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, nor was there ever so little of the fruit of Godliness to be seen. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Truth are in every Bodies Mouth; but very few endeavour a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to them. Some are altogether careless of Holiness, as if they knew some By-path<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or nearer or easier Way to Heaven. Others, as if they had no hope but in this Life, are only concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a present Temporal Interest; as if Christ's Kingdom were only in this World, they only lay themselves out for
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:93003:139"/>
advancing and establishing the external Policy of the Church: And this too <hi>Quovis modo,</hi> by any means whatsoever, they will do ill, that good may come, and do think that the end will hallow the means, tho' never so unlawful. But, my Friends, be not deceived, suffer not your selves to be cheated and deluded out of the hope of Heaven and Eternal Life: And that you may not fall short hereof, and lose this comfortable Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, let me intreat you to talk less, and do more: be less anxious about the outward Forms of Godliness, and be more careful to shew the power thereof in your Life and Actions; trust God a little more with the Care of his Church and Truth, and be somewhat more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to set up <hi>the Kingdom of Christ within you,</hi> without which, you shall both forfeit your part in that glorious Kingdom above, and also the honour and privilege of his Kingdom here on Earth: <hi>Therefore say I unto you, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a Nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi> This Judgment we have deserved, and we have great cause to fear it: Nothing will prevent it, but our timely and unfeigned Repentance,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:93003:140"/>
a serious turning to the Lord, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the fruits of Holiness and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. If we do this, God will yet have mercy upon our Nation, settle the State, preserve the Church, and render her illustrious in Order and Purity, and will make Religion and Truth to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, to our Praise and Renown Abroad, our Peace and Comfort at Home, and to further and facilitate our attainment of Eternal Life hereafter.</p>

               <q>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches: To him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, will I give to eat of the hidden Manna; and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth, saving he that receiveth it.</q>

            <p>THESE words were first directed<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> All Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are concerned in this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> to the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> but they were not intended for that Church only, for every one is required to give ear to them. We have all the same Vocation, the same Obligations are on us, and the same rewards are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to us, and therefore likewise we are all tied to the same Duty. The different Stations and Orders of the Church, do indeed call for some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in Persons behaviour; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:93003:141"/>
all Christians have the same task enjoined them, and what is spoken to one, is spoken to all.</p>
            <p>The first thing here called for, is, an<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> Of Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> Attention to the Voice of God, a list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to what his Spirit saith unto us, <hi>Let him who hath an ear hear,</hi> &amp;c. So likewise began the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; for their usual Preface was, <hi>Hear, O Israel.</hi> Hearing is a sign of a ready and willing Mind, and is necessary to prepare the way to those other Acts and Exercises required of us. It is, indeed, neither the only, nor the main thing we have to do, and therefore they who are only Hearers deceive themselves; as St. <hi>Iames</hi> speaks. As the Body would be deformed if it were all Ear, so that Mans Religion is mis-shapen, which is wholly exercised in Hearing. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,<note place="margin">Its Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> Hearing is necessary, it must not swallow up all other Parts of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Service; but neither must it be slighted and neglected. He who turns away his Ear and will not hear, shews an averseness to his Duty, and though he would set himself to it, he could not go rightly about it, for all our knowledge of Spiritual things comes by Hearing: This is not to be fetcht from within;
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:93003:141"/>
and therefore he, who heareth not, must continue in gross Ignorance. We should begin with Hearing, and we should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cease to hear, that we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of our Lord's Will, that we may be kept in Mind of it, and finally quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to it; as Servants wait daily on their Masters, to know their Pleasure, and to receive their Commands, so should we wait on God. <hi>I will,</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>hear what God the Lord will speak.</hi> This is every ones Duty, none are exempted from it; not the Ignorant to be sure, nor yet he who thinks he hath Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: The Man of leisure and he who is retired from the World can pretend no excuse, nor will the Man of business be excused if he neglect to hear: As many as have Ears and Faculties to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive are obliged and commanded to hear; for the words of our Text are, <hi>Let him who hath ears,</hi> which certainly comprehends all and every one.</p>
            <p>But as we are obliged to hear, so we<note place="margin">The manner of doing it.</note> ought to take heed <hi>how we hear,</hi> as it is <hi>Luke</hi> viii. 18. That we hear aright, else we had better not hear at all. Now he hears not rightly, who lets only the Voice or the sound of the Word strike his Ear: But who suffers it to pierce
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:93003:142"/>
thorow to his Mind and inner Man, and to leave an impression there. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we must hear, so we ought to have our Ears well purg'd of whatever may stop what is spoken from going to the Heart, or hinder its working there: For the hearing here required is, <hi>opus animi non auris;</hi> It's a pondering with the Mind as well as hearkning with the Ear. Wherefore, as St. <hi>Iames</hi> adviseth, we ought to <hi>lay aside prejudice and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness, and all superfluity of naughtiness, and to receive with meekness the ingrafted Word of God.</hi> And sure none can refuse this, who considers either the dignity of him who speaks, or the excellency of what is spoken: He who speaks is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> or any of the ancient Philosophers, whom many tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled far to hear speak. He is greater than <hi>Solomon,</hi> whom the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> was so desirous to hear. And what is delivered doth not tickle the fancy, but satisfies and ravishes the Mind; It is not airy Notions, and fruitless Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which we are bid hear, but a Word which is able to save our Souls.</p>
            <p>And that we may hear this joyful<note place="margin">Whom we should hear.</note> and comfortable Word, we must not listen to the dictates of our corrupt
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:93003:142"/>
Nature, nor to the Maxims of a dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate World, nor to the particular Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Elders; for these do often misguide us, and tho' sometimes they seem to speak fair, yet they only flatter, that they may the better deceive and ensnare us, to make void the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. Neither the Clamours of the People, nor the Calls of the Court, are always to be hearkned to; for the Psalmist tells us, that both the one and the other have sometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted and conspired <hi>against the Lord, and against his Christ.</hi> We must not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer every Voice, nor believe every Spirit, for there be many Lying and false Spirits in the World: But we must only hearken to what the Spirit of God saith, and then we are sure, not to be deceived. This holy Spirit sometimes speaks to us by inward Motions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations to Truth and Goodness, and would certainly do it oftner if we were rightly disposed, and careful to attend to them: but it always speaketh to us in the Scriptures; they are the Voice of God which we ought to hear; <hi>for no Scripture is of private Interpretation, neither did the Penmen of Scripture speak and write of their own Head, but</hi>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:93003:143"/>
               <hi>as they were moved by the Holy Ghost:</hi> So then it is not Man who speaks to us in the Scripture, but the Spirit of God: And seeing God is not like Man, that he should alter his Mind, seeing his Will, as his Nature, is unchangeable; therefore nothing is from God which contradicts what is said to us in the Scripture, and therefore also whatever Voice we hear, whether within us, or without us, we ought to compare the same, with what the Spirit saith to the Churches in the Scripture; If it agree therewith, we have reason to believe and obey it: But if they sound not alike, if there be no Harmony, but a perfect Discord betwixt them, then that is not from God. It is but a Cheat and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion which disagreeth with the written Word, and ought to be rejected, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever brings it. But it is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that the quoting Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the speaking in Scripture terms, is not a certain sign that they who do so are true Prophets, or that their Doctrine is true, and from God; for Men may, and often do wrest the Scripture, and use it ignorantly and impertinently. The Devil, when he tempted our Saviour, quoted Scripture;
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:93003:143"/>
but we ought to look to the nature and tendency of the Doctrine, and consider whether it agree to the Scope of the Scipture in its particular Precepts: for that is the true Standard and Measure; <hi>Ye shall know</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>the tree by its fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the sum of what the Spirit saith to the Churches, and to us by the Churches in the Scripture, is, what we have in the Text, <hi>viz. To him that overcometh,</hi> &amp;c. In handling of which words, we shall first explain, what is meant by <hi>overcoming;</hi> Then Secondly, what is the Reward here promised to him that overcometh.</p>
            <p>As to the First, seeing there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> Of Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming.</note> here of <hi>overcoming,</hi> that necessarily supposeth Fighting; for there can be no Victory without Fighting; and if there must be a Fight, there must also be Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; for we cannot fight, but against Enemies.</p>
            <p>And by this it appears that the Life<note place="margin">Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</note> of a Christian is a Warfare, and that by coming to Christ we become Soldiers, who are engaged to fight. Idleness and Ease is not the End of our Calling; nor are we listed merely for shew and osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for we are called to Wrestle and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:93003:144"/>
Fight, and that so stoutly and valiantly, so constantly and stedfastly, until we overcome. It is not enough to begin, to make ready, and present our selves to the Battel; nor yet to Fight a while, to hold out against two or three On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets, but we must never turn back, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yield, or give over; but must hold out to the end, and so too as to carry away the Victory, for the Promise is here only to him that <hi>overcometh.</hi> As in the Olympick Games, none got the Prize until he had first got the Mastery over his Antagonists; and as among the <hi>Romans</hi> a Triumph was granted, not to him that had essayed the War, but to him who had come off Victorious. So Christians are not to expect these glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things here proposed, unless they have not only enterprized the good Fight, but gained a Victory therein. <hi>If any man turn back,</hi> (saith God) <hi>my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But blessed is he who endureth to the end for the same shall be saved.</hi> Heb. x. 22.</p>
            <p>But then you'll ask whom we are to<note place="margin">The Nature of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</note> fight with, and after what manner? In the first place, our Text speaks not of Carnal Fighting; we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it of Mustering Human Forces,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:93003:144"/>
of Encamping Armies, setting of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, laying of Sieges, making Assaults upon Cities to take them, nor of using these, or any other Stratagems of War, where there is occasion of shewing Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Art and Valour, and where only Carnal and Material Weapons are used. The Rewards of these Earthly Victories are Conquests of new Dominions, the Submissions of the Conquered, acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of great Power and Riches, the erection of Trophies in the places of Victory, Publick Triumphs, and the result of all Vain-glory and false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, which reach not further than this lower World: But the Manna, the white Stone, and new Name, and the Glories signified by them, are true, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial, and eternal, and regard the life to come, which is Everlasting.</p>
            <p>And tho' doubtless some great War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors are in Heaven, some great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours will triumph with the Lord Jesus at the last Day; yet most of those who acquired Kingdoms in any Ages here below will lose that above, and be condemned at the last Judgment, as Thieves, Robbers and Murtherers for Plunder, and Rapine, and shedding of Blood. But as for those few warlike
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:93003:145"/>
Princes who have gone to Heaven, they have not got thither by their mighty feats of Arms, but by the Justice and Equity of their respective Causes for which they took up Arms, and by using of them with Mercy and Tenderness, and with a sincere intention for Peace; or else, if their Wars were Unjust, by true and serious Repentance for all the Violence committed in them, and by making Restitution and Satisfaction for all Injuries to their utmost power. But the Spiritual Conquerours cannot fail of Heaven; their very Conquest entitles them to it, and all the Glories of it; because it is a Spiritual Conquest, and the Weapons of their Warfare are not Carnal but Spiritual; and the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, the Enemies which they conquer, are Spiritual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, against which they Arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, with the whole Armour of God; with the Girdle of Truth, the Brest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of Righteousness, the Shield of Faith, the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God; because (as the Apostle saith) <hi>we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against Principalities, against Powers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Rulers of the darkness of this</hi>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:93003:145"/>
               <hi>World, against spiritual wickedness in High places.</hi> Eph. vi. 12.</p>
            <p>More particularly, if we do well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these Letters to the Seven Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which our Lord shuts up with these words, <hi>to him that overcometh;</hi> we shall find the Enemies he proposeth to be encountered, are such as go about to destroy our Faith, to defile our Worship, to extinguish our Charity, and to stain the Purity of our Christian Life and Conversation. Persecutions, and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the sake of the Gospel or any part of it, Idolatry and Superstition, Heresie and false Doctrine, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and inordinate Lusts within us, and the Pollution and wicked Practises of the World without us, are the things we have to struggle and wrestle with. And the word, <hi>overcome,</hi> in our Text, hath a reference to a perpetual War, which ought to be maintained against all and every one of them: For it is not enough to attack or resist stoutly any one of them, if we do not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand all; He doth not overcome accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Text, nor can he claim the Reward promised therein, who strikes in with any one of these, or meanly yields to it; though he stand never so
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:93003:146"/>
stiffly out against the rest: As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, He cannot be said <hi>to overcome,</hi> who resists Errour and false Doctrine, and yet suffers himself to be captivated by Vice or Sin, nor is he to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Victorious who meets Trouble and Persecution with Courage and Undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedness, and in the mean time is not careful to keep a sound Faith and a good Conscience; it is Treachery and Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to yield to, or make an Agreement with any Enemy whatsoever.</p>
            <p>But wherein, will you say, doth this<note place="margin">What Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory is.</note> Victory properly consist; Doth Christ require us to destroy the Superstitions and Idolatries of the World? to amend the Corruption of the Age we live in? and to stop Persecution and Trouble which come upon the Church? For, according to the usual way of speaking, he overcometh that gets the upper hand of his Enemies and ruins them. Truly, the Church of God should not suffer Idolatry and Superstition to creep into its Worship, and should guard its Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Constitutions from being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, and if it were in her power to deliver her self from Persecution by ways just and lawful, the Motions of Nature would induce thereto, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:93003:146"/>
in this, is not contrary to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. But of a Truth, Christ requires not of his Church and People, what is not in their Power. God only can pull down the Temples consecrated to Idols, and the Idols set up in Mens Hearts, and purge the World of its Corruptions, and suppress the Hatred and Boldness of the Enemies of the Truth, and bind up their hands that they persecute not those who make Profession thereof. But it is our own selves, and not others, we are commanded to conquer. The Victory of our Text is within us and not without. The faithful overcome when they keep themselves from being overcome with their Enemies: Their Glory is not to give way to any Temptation whatsoever. In War, he who is attacked is overcome, if he yield; but he who attacks is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, if he succeed not: To be thrust from an Enterprize; to be forced back from an Assault, is to be conquered by the Adversary. And on the contrary, not to suffer a Repulse, is to carry a glorious Victory. Even so as it is the Devil and the World who attack us, by endeavouring to draw us to the Service of false Gods, by alluring us with the Bait of filthy Pleasures, and by fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:93003:147"/>
us with the Horrour of Trouble and Persecution; so if we resist stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all these Temptations and maintain a sound Faith, a pure Worship, a holy Life, and Patience until the end, we have overcome, and our Enemy seeing all his Attempts upon us thus in vain, will be constrained to retire with shame. Wherefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>He had fought the good fight, because he had kept the faith,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 7.</p>
            <p>Thus you see what Enemies we are to fight with, <hi>viz. The Devil, the World,</hi> and <hi>the Flesh,</hi> the <hi>Temptations to Sin and Error,</hi> and <hi>all the hindrances of Vertue and Holiness:</hi> And that he obtaineth a Victory over them that keep the Faith, and a good Conscience maugre all these Oppositions. He overcometh, who notwithstanding the Devil's Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and that he lives in a crooked and untowardly Generation where Sin doth abound, where Vice is more fashionable than Vertue, where Error and false Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets prevail, and the Truth is born down, and perhaps persecuted; I say, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, who notwithstanding of this adheres to the Truth, neither swerves from the Belief, nor Profession thereof, but continues constant to both; he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercometh,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:93003:147"/>
who carefully keeps himself unspotted from the World, and who walketh uprightly in the ways of God, sincerely obeying whatsoever is his Will and Pleasure; Finally, he overcometh, who waits chearfully upon God, and preserves a firm Patience of Mind, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his own Trouble, or the Afflictions of other godly Persons, and the Success and Prosperity of the wicked.</p>
            <p>And as this is to overcome in the sense<note place="margin">No Victory so honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> of our Text; so he, who thus over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, gains a noble and a most glorious Victory. All other Victories are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so desireable as this; nor doth any Victory, over any Enemy whatsoever, speak out such Wisdom and Valour as this doth. It is more glorious to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Devil, than to subdue Men or Beasts, and it requires greater Art and Valour to oppose his Assaults, and to render his devices ineffectual, than to resist the Armies of Men, or to defeat the boldest and most cunning Stratagem of War. There is really more Wisdom and Courage shown in mortifying Lust, the bridling a Passion, and the resisting the Temptations to Sin and Error, wherewith the World abounds, than in defending or taking a City, the scaling
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:93003:148"/>
of Walls, the venturing thorow the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Forces, combating wild Beasts, or in any of those Acts whereby Men or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily gain Renown: For who have been strong and able enough for the last, have been too weak for the first. The <hi>Alexanders, Coesars, Antonys,</hi> and other famed Heroes, have often been led captive by silly Women, they wanted Courage to resist the Charms of Beauty, or to encounter with Affronts, Disgrace, or other Disasters. The Saints and Martyrs are more illustrious for their Patience, Constancy, Contempt of the World, and severe Vertue, than all the renowned Warriours for their Victories and Conquests. <hi>He that is slow to anger</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 32.</note> 
               <hi>is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that ruleth a city,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon.</hi> Those Heroick Acts so much spoken of in History, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as much to be ascribed to a hardy Temper of Body, as to true Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Spirit; and Mens Success pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds more from what we call Fortune or good Luck, or to speak more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Principles of Christianity, to some favourable Juncture and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Providence, than to their own Valour and Prudence. But this
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:93003:148"/>
spiritual Victory can never be carried on without the Knowledge of the Truth, and Acquaintance with true Wisdom, and a settled undaunted Resolution: Wherefore this Victory is certainly most preferable, it is most to be gloried in, and there is more Praise and Honour due to it, and also it is attended with a greater Reward, which leads us to the Consideration of what remains in the Text;</p>

It is an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion to the Custom of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and to what the Iews fed upon in the Wilderness.</note> of feasting Conquerours and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful Warriours. As they who gain Earthly Victories use to be treated sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuously: So the Lord Jesus gives us here to understand, that he will make an honourable Entertainment to such as obtain the spiritual Victory formerly mentioned; he will feast him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, with great, excellent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable Delights. What is to be set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them is here named Manna, with a Reference to what the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> fed upon in the Wilderness. By giving it the Name of Manna, either the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Nature and Quality of this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment here promised, is set forth, or
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:93003:149"/>
the Entertainment it self is particularly pointed at.</p>
            <p>First, hereby is set forth the excellent<note place="margin">The Nature and Quality of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment appointed for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours.</note> Nature and Quality of this Fare and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, as it is Heavenly: For as Manna was not produced out of the Ground like other Grain, but came down immediately from Heaven: so what Satisfaction is designed for our Souls, is not grounded upon Earthly Possessions; it ariseth not from these outward and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible things, but flows merely from God, and is the Result of an immediate Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with him: Which farther makes out the Solidity and Purity of this Joy and Delight. For earthly Pleasures are built on things vain, brittle, and which daily fade; wherefore, they are not true solid Pleasures, they are rather but sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Pleasure; but the Joy and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Text coming directly from God himself, it therefore must be most firm and solid. And as for Earthly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and Entertainments they are not pure, they have all some Allay in them, some Mixture of what doth disgust and displease, as every ones Experience wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth: But no such thing is to be found in that Entertainment which is from Heaven, because all things there are pure
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:93003:149"/>
and perfect. Again, as Manna was not only good for Food, but pleasant to the Taste, the Scripture saith, <hi>it tasted like honey,</hi> and the Jews have a Tradition, that it answered every Man's Taste, that is, it relish'd according to each Man's particular Appetite, affording every one that Satisfaction in his Taste which pleased him best: So the Joy afforded us upon the gaining this Spiritual Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry shall be most ravishing, it shall fully answer all the Desires of our Souls, and shall yield us that full Satisfaction they would be at; wherefore, it is called a Joy unspeakable and full of Glory; and our Lord tells us, that they, who taste thereof, shall not hunger or thirst any more; <hi>Whosoever shall drink of this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 4. 13.</note> 
               <hi>shall thirst again, but whosoever shall drink of this water that I shall give him shall never thirst.</hi> Moreover as there was Plenty of Manna, so we shall not have this Heavenly Joy in narrow and scanty Measures, but it shall flow and abound beyond all Expression. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is said in Scripture, <hi>to pass all understanding,</hi> that is, the heighth and greatness thereof can never be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehended. Finally, as Manna was permanent, it lasted all the while
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:93003:150"/>
the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, that is, so long as they needed it, neither was it possible for their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to hinder it; so this Joy shall never cease, our Enemies Malice and Power cannot reach it, but it abideth for ever: All earthly Goods are liable to Rapine and Violence, our Enemies may bereave us of them: But they cannot take away the Consolations of the Spirit of God here, these we may enjoy in the midst of Bonds, and Imprisonment, and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and much less can any stay that joy, and those Pleasures which shall be bestowed hereafter. And as these are the Reasons why the Joy prepared for those who overcome is called Manna, so it is called hidden Manna, alluding to the Pot of Manna laid up in the Ark, or else because the Nature, and Quality, and Excellency of this Joy is without the reach of Sense: Our bodily Sense, does not discern it, nor can humane Reason scan it. <hi>Strangers do not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with this joy.</hi> None understand it but they who possess it. <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard; neither have entered into the heart of Man, the good things which God hath laid up for them that love him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:93003:150"/>But I said by Manna, are not only<note place="margin">Iesus Christ is the hidden Manna.</note> set forth the Nature and Quality of those Delights, he, who overcometh, is to be feasted with; but also the particular Entertainment, which affords such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Joy and Delight is pointed at. And therefore by Manna here we are to understand Jesus Christ himself, for Manna was a Type and Figure of him, and he is expressly called Spiritual Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 3. And as a Pot of Manna was laid up in the Ark, so Jesus Christ is kept and reserved in the Heavens, which were figured by the Ark; and therefore he is called hidden Manna. Now they who overcome shall have Christ to feast upon, not after a corporal and carnal manner, eating his Flesh, and drinking his Blood, as some senselesly dream, they do in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; nor yet sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally as all true Believers do in this World, in the Elements of Bread and Wine: For hereafter in Heaven, which is here pointed at, there is neither place for, nor need of Types, Figures, and Symbols; which would not be suitable Entertainment for such a pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect State. But the meaning is, they shall feast on everlasting Bliss, the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:93003:151"/>
and Merits of his Blood, the Fruits of his Incarnation, Birth, Life, Death, Resurrection, and Ascension, and whatever he did, or suffered to purchase Eternal Happiness for us. There is no proper Food but this. He who wants it is utterly miserable; for nothing but the Enjoyment of Christ in Heaven can give Life or Pleasure to the Soul of Man: And the Soul that is entertained in his beatifick Presence, is entertained in the Fullness of Joy, and cannot but be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; for there is no Grief, or Sadness in that glorious Place, where he is, but perfect Delight, Joy, Pleasure, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, as will appear by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, which is the effect of this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment: He who gets to eat of this hidden Manna, shall also get a white Stone.</p>
            <p>When St. <hi>Iohn</hi> had this Revelation he<note place="margin">

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:93003:151"/>
Absolution and Justification, as the black betokened Guilt, and declared for their Condemnation, which <hi>Ovid</hi> has thus delivered;</p>

            <p>By the white Stone then is meant a Sentence of Absolution, and so our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour here promiseth, to absolve and justifie such as overcome, from all that may be laid to their Charge: He will take away their Guilt, wash them from their Sins, and deliver them from the Death that is due to them. And O what a Happiness is this! What matter of Joy is there in this Promise? It is as Health to the sick, Ransom to the captive, and a Remission to him who is ready to be led forth to Execution. If any be not affected herewith, it is because they are not sensible of their Guilt, and do not consider the heinous Nature of Sin, or the Misery which attends it: But they who have laid this to Heart will prize it exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. What would a troubled Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence give for the least Assurance or smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest Hope of this Comfort?

            <p>But there is here promised, not only<note place="margin">
                  <hi>VI.</hi> Of the New Name.</note> a white Stone, the Sign of Absolution, and a Deliverance from Death due to us, but also something more, which we could never deserve, and which exceeds all Expression. In the Stone there shall be a New Name, which is still an Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Custom of these former times, and Eastern Countries, where Letters and Words used to be written also upon the Stones, they cast into the publick Urn. What is the Importance of this New Name, we will know when we have found out whose Name it is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:93003:152"/>
of him who gives it, or of him who receives it? In the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>verse</hi> 12. There is express mention of Christ's New Name: By which we are to understand the new, clear, full, and perfect Manifestation of the Truth, and Importance of his Name, Jesus Christ; for as when God appeared to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Exod.</hi> vi. 3. He called <hi>Iehovah</hi> a New Name, not known to the Patriarchs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he executed the Promise made to them, and so manifested his Faithfulness and Unchangeableness signified by that Name: For otherwise it cannot be said, but that this particular Name was known before, as well as that of Almighty. So because hereafter there shall be a clear Discovery of the Signification of Jesus Christ, and of the Truth of that Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, because the Salvation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption implied in this Name, shall be fully revealed; therefore it is called his New Name. At present we call him Jesus Christ, our Lord, but hereafter we shall see and feel him effectually to be so; now the Salvation he hath purchased, is the Object of our Hope, but then we shall behold it with our Eyes, and be made to contemplate the Glory of his Kingdom, to our unspeakable Comfort
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:93003:153"/>
and Satisfaction. But seeing it is said, a New Name, and not my New Name; therefore it would seem, that we are to understand it of the Name of him who receives it; and seeing Names are the Marks of things, and are often taken so in Scripture, therefore, by New Name, we ought to understand the New State and Condition which the Saints, and those whom God honoureth, shall be put into. The Name given to the first Man was <hi>Adam,</hi> and it is common to us all, for it sheweth our Original and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be earthly; we <hi>came from the Dust, and to the Dust we must return.</hi> Our present State is corruptible, and makes us liable to Death. The Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality Man would have had in Paradise, if he had continued his Integrity, would not have been the Effect of his natural Force, but of a supernatural Vertue; for the natural Composition of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy tends to Corruption. But when this corruptible State is done away, there shall succeed another better State, even an Heavenly and Incorruptible one, which is implied by this New Name. <hi>As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy, and as is the heavenly, such are they also, that are heavenly; and as we</hi>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:93003:153"/>
               <hi>have born the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly, for this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality,</hi> 1 Cor. xviii. 48, 58.</p>
            <p>There remains no more to be explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,<note place="margin">VII. <hi>How these words,</hi> No man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but he who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it, <hi>are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</hi>
               </note> but the very last words of the Text, the sense of which seems not to be very obvious; for if the <hi>white stone</hi> and <hi>new name</hi> be to be understood of our <hi>Iustification</hi> and <hi>Glorification,</hi> as I have said, how then can it be said, that <hi>no man knoweth it, but he who receiveth it?</hi> For, will not our Absolution be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced before all the World? is not God to justifie us in the <hi>General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Angels and Men?</hi> Will not the Devil and Damned behold the Saints entrance into Glory, which will not a little aggravate their Misery. The <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of Iesus Christ</hi> is too glorious to be concealed, and the Glory which he will bestow on his <hi>faithful Servants,</hi> is too Splendid to be hid. But to this it may be replied, First, That indeed the matter of this Joy and Glory may, and will be known unto others, but none except those who possess it, can have a true sense of it, or understand it. The Sentence of our Absolution shall, indeed,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:93003:154"/>
be pronounced before all the World: The wicked, yea, the Devils themselves, shall hear these blessed Words which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from our Saviour's Mouth, <hi>Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you;</hi> but none, except those to whom they are spoken, shall understand or comprehend the fulness of the Consolation which they give. The outside of Mens Condition may be seen, and the external matter of their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness may be known; but no view of things can make any taste the sweetness of them, or be sensible of the Delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they afford; any who hath the use of Reason may perswade himself, that the state of the Saints in Heaven will be magnificent and glorious, even to Admiration: But without the actual possession of that State, it is simply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to conceive, or to have any true sensation of the Joy and Delectableness thereof; as none can have a true Idea of the Beauty of Colours, or the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Musick, or the Sweetness of Honey, but by Seeing, Hearing, and Tasting of them. Notwithstanding of what has been revealed of Heaven, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>It doth not yet appear what we shall be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:93003:154"/>But Secondly, Some put another gloss upon the words, and considering that they run in the Present Tense, and not in the Future; for it is, <hi>None knoweth it but he that receiveth,</hi> and not, none shall know, but he that shall receive; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they conclude, that the Receiving and Knowledge meant of, relate to something in this present Life, and not to that which <hi>is to come;</hi> and that so the meaning must be, that none at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent knoweth these things, or has any sense or apprehension of them, but they who have received, by the Grace and Spirit of God, an earnest of them, that they are unintelligible Mysteries to all, except to them who believe. None other do regard them, or are sensible of the worth of them. As the Cross of Christ is a stumbling-block to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and foolishness to the <hi>Greeks;</hi> so the Glory and the Happiness of the other Life, are reckoned Dreams and Ravings by the Men of the World, who are void of Faith; whereas Faith both discovers the certainty, and also gives some fore-taste of the unspeakable excellency thereof; <hi>For faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence (or Conviction) of things not seen.</hi> As God gave <hi>Moses</hi> a
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:93003:155"/>
sight of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> on the top of <hi>Pisgah,</hi> so Christians by Faith have a sweet and desireable Prospect of Heaven, and the Happiness of the other World. It not only assures them that there is such a thing, but also makes them sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that it excelleth all the Delights and Enjoyments under the Sun, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this World is worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto that which is to be revealed. As Faith is the chief Weapon and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be used in gaining this Spiritual Victory; so it ascertains us of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and convinceth us of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereof. If we have Faith, we shall easily overcome, and also be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that our labour shall not be in vain.</p>
            <p>Do you Believe? I hope you do, why<note place="margin">
                  <hi>VIII.</hi> The Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> then sit you still? Why go you not out to <hi>fight the Battles of the Lord?</hi> Arise, I pray you, and prove your Strength and Valour against his Enemies, and your own; they are now busy, and there is no Truce to be granted unto them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirr your selves therefore, suffer them not to catch any advantage over you, but be sure to carry away the Victory. <hi>If the Devil assault you, resist him till he flee from you.</hi> Are you persecuted, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:93003:155"/>
and afflicted? maintain a Christian Courage and Magnanimity, bear all with an invincible Patience, and suffer the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, rather than do what is dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, what may offend God, or wound your own Conscience. Doth the wind of false Doctrine blow from all quarters, let us take heed that we be not carried away therewith; let us search for the Truth, and never suffer Lyes and Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods to have any Impression upon us. And that other Errors may not find en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, let us shut out that great and gross <hi>one,</hi> and the <hi>Mother of many,</hi> viz. That it is no matter what Men think or believe, that Opinions are not dangerous, for the Apostle tells us, That there are some <hi>Heresies damnable.</hi> All Truths are not to be alike accounted of, nor are all Errors dangerous: But certainly some Truths are of such importance, and are delivered with such evidence, that to deny or question them, is to resist God, and question his Veracity; and there are some Errors which debauch the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing as much as Vice doth the Heart, and the one doth alienate from God, as well as the other. If we be tempted to mingle our Devotions with Idolatry and Superstition, that the Worship of God
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:93003:156"/>
may be splendid and magnificent, let us not yield; for God is not to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped with that which pleaseth him not, nor must we study to Honour him by ways which he has forbidden. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of a pretext of shunning this, let us be carried to the other extreme of Indecency, Irreverence, and of a nasty Familiarity. Whatever be in vogue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, let us both in publick and in private keep up that Worship which is grave, serious, and deliberate, which is suitable to the Majesty of God, and proper to beget in us great and worthy thoughts of him; which kindleth our Love to him, heighteneth our Reverence and Esteem for him, which instructs us in his Will, and quickeneth our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Commands. Finally, and particularly, let us with all care escape the Pollution that is in the World, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Lust; let us stave off Vice, and withstand the wicked Practices of this Age we live in, and study to be found the Children of God, without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke even in the midst of a <hi>crooked and perverse generation,</hi> whatever be the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of others, let us make it our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to <hi>deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly,</hi>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:93003:156"/>
               <hi>in this present world, looking for the blessed hope, and glorious appearance of the Son of God.</hi> If we do not strive to overcome in this last particular, our Victory in the rest will be to little purpose. What will it avail us to stand out against Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, to resist Errour and Heresies, Idolatry and Superstition, if we be Slaves to Lust, and suffer Sin or any manner of Impiety to reign in us. All our Zeal for Christ's Kingdom without will profit us nothing, if we do not set it up within us. Though we <hi>Prophesie</hi> in <hi>Christ's Name,</hi> and in his <hi>Name cast out Devils,</hi> and in <hi>his Name</hi> do many <hi>wondrous Works;</hi> yet if we do the works of Iniquity, he will say to us in that day, <hi>Depart from me, I never knew you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have seen your task, and what, as Christians, is required of you. Your task, indeed, is great; but your Assistances are as great: and if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to acquit your selves well, you must be active and diligent. There is no place for Idleness or Loitering. You have much to do; but however, do not despond; for there shall be strength given you from above. <hi>He that is with you is greater than any that can be against you.</hi> If you have the heart, be ready and willing.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:93003:157"/>
God will enable you to overcome the greatest <hi>Goliah</hi> of the <hi>Philistines.</hi> And if at any time you should faint, <hi>look unto Iesus the author and finisher of your Faith;</hi> let his Example direct and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage you: and as he did also look unto the Recompence of Reward, consider what shall be done to you if you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: You shall not be so meanly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they were who obtained the Mastery in Olympick Games, who only got Crowns of Flowers, Laurels, and Myrtles, nor yet as the <hi>Romans</hi> when they returned Victorious over their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who only had the Honour of a days Solemnity and Triumph; nor is it a Crown of Gold which shall be bestowed on you, which is the greatest reward to be expected in this World; but it is a Crown of Life, Glory and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>I have fought a good fight,</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>I have finished my course, and henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.</hi> Nothing is reckoned more August and glorious than a Crown; some have been at great Pains, and have run many Hazards to win one.

            <p>By <hi>the things which Christ saith,</hi> is to<note place="margin">What is meant by the things which Christ saith</note> be understood the whole Doctrine of Christ, as it respects both Faith and Manners. A true Disciple will receive
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:93003:158"/>
whatever his Lord saith, and will own all that his Authority is concerned in: But he is disobedient and rejects his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, who rejects either the Truths required to be believed, or the things commanded to be done. To do then what Jesus saith, is to frame both the inward Temper and Sentiments of our heart, and our outward Conversation according to the Doctrine of Christ, it is to receive by a Sincere Faith, all the Truths revealed by him, and to make Conscience of observing what he has commanded. The <hi>Credenda</hi> or things to be believed are summ'd up in that short summary and form of sound words, called the Apostles Creed: The <hi>Agenda</hi> or things to be done are contained in the Ten Commands given to <hi>Moses,</hi> that excellent Commentary thereon we have in the Sermon on the Mount, and may be learnt from his other Discourses, and the Epistles of the Apostles. All which in short teach us to forbear Evil and to do Good, to deny Ungodliness and Worldly Lusts, and to live Soberly, Righteously, and Godly in this present World: The Laws of Christ discharge all Sin and Wickedness both in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward Man, and do require
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:93003:159"/>
Purity of Heart and Life; they teach us to lay aside all Covetousness and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Desires, to despise this present Life, and to set our hearts upon the things above; they order the putting off Wrath, Malice, Anger, Envy, and to put on Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of Charity and Compassion towards our Brethren. To conclude, the sum of what Christ saith to us for directing our Morals is, that we should deny our selves, that is freely and heartily renounce any thing, though never so dear, than of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God; That we should take up our Cross, that is chearfully and willingly, patiently and contentedly submit to whatsoever Afflictions God is pleased to lay upon us, and to undergo the trouble which cannot be avoided without Sin. And lastly, that we follow him, <hi>viz.</hi> In the ways of Devotion, Zeal, Affiance and Love towards God; of Humility, Meekness, Forbearance and Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men, in which he hath gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; and that we labour carefully to imitate that perfect example of Lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Purity which he hath left unto us. This is the sum of what Christ hath said, and these are the things he would have observed by all who call him Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:93003:159"/>But what God hath joined together,<note place="margin">The Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Practice of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ought to go together.</note> Men have learned to put asunder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God hath united the Profession and Practice of Christianity, he hath commanded that all who call and own him for their Lord and Master, should also carefully do his Will: But this is not much looked to, these things Men separate from one another, how contrary soever the same be to the Divine Institution. In our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's time we read of some who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally believed in him, they were inwardly perswaded, that he was the <hi>Messias,</hi> but yet they would not profess him openly for fear of being cast out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue. But now the Scene is altered, and as there is no hazard in making a publick Profession of Christ, so many avowedly do it, yet withal they refuse to obey him; they own his Name, but never mind his Will and Pleasure; they confidently call him <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> but the doing what he saith, is the least thing in their thoughts. In These days, Christ wants not Followers, he hath Disciples enough, the number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians is not small; but they are such as are so only <hi>nomine tenus,</hi> only by Name and Profession, unless that they say so, it could not be well known that they
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:93003:160"/>
were the Disciples of Jesus Christ; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they were sometimes seen in the Church, and heard to cry Lord, Lord, they might readily be taken for <hi>Turks, Pagans,</hi> and the Enemies of Christ. Now the Church is indeed pretty numerous, but if the secret <hi>Atheist</hi> and the openly Prophane, if the impious Scorner and sneaking Hypocrite, if the Glutton and Drunkard, the Fornicator and Adulterer, the Covetous, Unjust and Dishonest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the Malicious, Revengeful and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Swearer; in a word, if the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and indifferent, and such persons were removed as are destitute of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Good Works,</hi> and such who are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily guilty of gross Scandalous Crimes, which are altogether inconsistent with the Sincere Belief of the Gospel, I fear the remainder would then be but few, and the Church would become as thin as now it useth to be throng. I shall not be so peremptory as to say that there should scarce be so many behind in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Parish, City, and Congregation, as <hi>Abraham</hi> desired to find righteous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in <hi>Sodom,</hi> but sure I am, the Number would be very small and inconsiderable!</p>
            <p>Now that they whose Lives are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Rules of Christianity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:93003:160"/>
who in their Works deny Christ, should yet profess him with their Mouths, and confidently pretend to all the Privileges of his true Disciples, is somewhat strange and unaccountable, for whatever doth perswade and excite us to believe in Christ, doth also oblige us to obey him; that which binds to the one, makes the other also necessary. And if our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience may be any ways dispensed with, it matters little whether or not we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Profession of the Gospel, as our Saviour intimates to us plainly in the words of our Text, <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words may be understood ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by way of Question, or as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulation. I intend to consider them both ways.</p>
            <p>And first, as it seems a Question, and<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> The Text considered as a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</note> taking it so, it is as much as if he had said, <hi>What mean you by professing my Name, and giving me out to be your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, when you do not my Will, neither offer to keep my Commandments? What end do you propose to your selves in this? What advantage do you expect thereby? Can you shew any reason for this behaviour of yours? If you be not ingenuous when</hi>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:93003:161"/>
               <hi>you call me Lord, what makes you flatter me? And if you really think I am your Lord and Master, why is not your Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice suitable and consonant to your Belief and Profession? Consider, I pray you, and think with your selves and see if ye can give any satisfactory account of this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, I say, is the sense and meaning<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> The true Motives to believe in Christ or to profess him, do also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige to pay Obedience to him.</note> of the Text when we construe it as an Interrogatory, the scope and design of which is to shew the great absurdity and unreasonableness of making a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Christ, without accompanying that Profession with a suitable Practice, seeing whatever doth induce us to the one, doth also oblige us to the other. We have the same obligations to both; and that this may more clearly appear, we will consider a little the True and Reasonable Motives which perswade us to the embracing of Christ, and shall shew that if we be ingenuous in own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and acknowledging them, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but stirr us up to pay him all due and holy Obedience.</p>
            <p>But in reckoning up these Motives,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> The Custom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is not sufficient to wise and reasonable Men.</note> we do not think our selves obliged to count that as one, which yet perhaps is the most common and general induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I mean, the Custom and Fashion
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:93003:161"/>
of the Country. The generality of Christians are so, only because Christ is believed and professed in those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where they have been born and bred; and they do profess the Christian Religion for the same reason that others do Mahumetanism and Paganism, because this was the Religion of their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and that generally those about them do the like; So that if it had been their luck to have been born in another Country, and under another Climate, they would have owned another Lord, and been of another Religion. I say, we will not consider this as any true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the receiving of Christ; Because it is neither sufficient nor reasonable, and he who embraceth Christ upon no other grounds than this, his Religion is little to be valued or regarded. Neither is it matter of wonder, that such an one yield to the prevailing Tentations of Sin, and refuse compliance with the Precepts of a strict and holy Living, especially when he perceives them fallen into desuetude, and that Vice and Ungodliness are more commonly practised; for he that in these things hath no other Reason or Motive than the Custom and Fashion of the place he lives in, will no doubt be
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:93003:162"/>
still carried away with the Tide: But what a shameful and unworthy a thing is it, to be guided and directed in Matters of so great moment, only by the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of others, and the Custom of the place we live in? The Apostle St. <hi>Peter</hi> commands us to be <hi>always ready to give an answer to every man who asketh a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the hope that is in us:</hi> And truly it is a very slender and poor one, when we have no other but that we were so Educated, and that this Faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were professed, and in fashion where we were Born and Bred. Indeed, it is no small Happiness to be Born within the Church, and under the light of the Gospel, and among those who may edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate us in the Christian Faith, because hereby we have an early occasion of acquainting our selves with those great and important things which concern our Eternal Salvation. And therefore we have always good reason to bless God for these excellent Advantages of our Birth and Education, without which, it's like we should have never come to the true Knowledge of Christ. But yet this doth not excuse us from a reasonable Enquiry and Search into the Truth and Grounds of the Christian Faith: when
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:93003:162"/>
we come to Age and the Years of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, we should be ashamed to pin our Faith upon our Grand-mother's Sleeve; we ought to fix it on a better bottom than mere Education, we should search into the Grounds and Reasons why we should rather be of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, than of any other; and should labour to understand what Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations are upon us to chuse Christ, and none other to be our Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: For unless we do this, we do not act like Men, our Faith is neither rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable nor divine, but unworthy both of Men and Christians, and which will never endure the Shock of any Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>That which should chiefly perswade<note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> The first great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess Christ, is his being sent from God.</note> us to profess Christ, and to become his Disciples, is, the Consideration of his being sent from God, and a serious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on those undoubted Truths and irrefragable Testimonies, we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thereof. Jesus Christ was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets, and when he was in the World, God bare Witness unto him by the Appearance of Angels, and several Voices from Heaven, and divers other astonishing Signs; he wrought many Miracles and did many things,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:93003:163"/>
not only beyond humane reach, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of Nature it self, and he gave others Power to do the like; his Death was accompanied with many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing Wonders, especially that of his Resurrection, so that the World was astonished at it. For Death had no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over him, for he rose from the dead and appeared unto many, and last of all, was seen to ascend up into Heaven. When he was gone, what he foretold his Disciples, came to pass, and as they preached the Gospel which he had taught them, so God gave Testimony unto them by Signs and Wonders and divers Miracles, and Gifts of the Holy Ghost, which followed them: So that the whole World was constrained to receive and believe their Doctrine. We have as great Evidence, and Certainty for these things, as is possible to be had, and is sufficient to reason any Man into the Belief of them. And by these things, it doth appear that Christ is no Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour, nor the Gospel, a cunningly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised Fable, but a certain Divine Truth; which teacheth us that God hath highly exalted Jesus Christ; and given him a Name, which is above every Name,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 9.</note> that, <hi>at the Name of Iesus every knee</hi>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:93003:163"/>
               <hi>should bow, of things in Heaven, and things in Earth, and things under the Earth, and that every tongue should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that Iesus Christ is the Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</hi> If we believe in Christ, if we own him to be our Lord, it should be for these Reasons, and upon these grounds, otherwise our Faith is not valid.</p>
            <p>This is the first and true Inducement<note place="margin">Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and universal Obedience.</note> to the receiving Christ, and if we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, and make him our Lord for this reason, because he is sent of God, and hath received all Power in Heaven and in Earth; then we cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an indispensible Necessity of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Obedience and Service: For God hath not made him a titular Lord, he hath not given Him a Name of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Power only; but he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted him such a Lord as must be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and obeyed, and the Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion which he hath received is not nominal, but real, actual, and effective: And consequently the Subjection which is required to be given him, must be something else than Words and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; it must be more than a barren and empty Profession, it must be real Deeds, faithful Services, and an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:93003:164"/>
and universal Obedience to his Laws and Commands; or else whatever we profess or say, he will never own or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge us to be his true Subjects and Servants. <hi>A son honoureth his father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and a servant his master, if I then be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where is my honour? And if I be a master, where is my fear?</hi> saith the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Malachy.</hi> If we do really acknowledge another to be Lord and Master, we must also acknowledge our selves to be his Servants: And Servants owe Obedience, therefore we reproach our selves so often as we call Christ our Lord; and yet refuse to obey him. Our Ingenuity in calling him Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appear so long as we do not heartily and readily obey him: For as God speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the fore-cited place. <hi>Offer it now unto thy Governour, will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person?</hi> Try, I pray you, and see if any Man will be put off as thou thinkest to put off Christ, when thou hast no mind to obey him. Will any Prince look upon those as good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who pay him no Homage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse him the Acts and Testimonies of their Allegiance? Will any Master count him his Servant, who never minds his Will, but doth his own? And how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:93003:164"/>
then art thou not to serve and obey him whom thou callest and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest to be thy Sovereign Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster? If we be perswaded that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to receive him, whom God hath sent, lest we be esteemed Rebels for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting the Ordinance of Heaven: We ought also to believe and be perswaded, that it is absolutely necessary to obey him; for it is all one not to own Christ, and not to obey his Will. Disobedience to a lawful Lord and Master is a great Crime, and passeth not unpunished. <hi>Ye</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 13. 13.</note> 
               <hi>call me Master and Lord,</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>and ye say well, for so I am.</hi> If he then be your Lord and Master, see that ye do whatsoever he hath commanded you, else he will be sure to punish your Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. <hi>These my Servants that would</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thes. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>not that I should reign over them, bring them hither to me, and slay them before mine eyes. The Lord Iesus Christ will one day appear with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, to take vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the Gospel of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> The Lord will accept of nothing instead of this, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prayers, nor Sacrifices, nor Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions will make Compensation for it: For as <hi>Samuel</hi> said to <hi>Saul, hath the Lord</hi>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:93003:165"/>
               <hi>as great delight in burnt-offerings and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams; for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath rejected thee,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xv. 22.</p>
            <p>Thus we see, That our embracing of Christ, and taking him for our Lord, because we are assured he is sent from God, and is ordained by him the Lord of Angels and Men, that the same doth in its Nature, also tie and oblige us to honour him, not only with the calves of our Lips, not only by professing with our Mouths, that he is our Lord and Master, but by doing him real and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Service, and rendring all due Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Will and Pleasure.</p>
            <p>But further, is it Love to Christ that<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> A second Motive to profess Christ, is Love.</note> ties us to him, and which makes us ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Profession of his Name? If so, then this will oblige us to serve and obey him. We read of some Servants under the Law, who so loved their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, that they would not part from them, and who though they might have had their Freedom, yet would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it, but suffered their Ears to be
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:93003:165"/>
bored through, that they might stay with their Masters for ever. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Christ is such a Master, as deserves to be thus loved: For never any did so much for gaining the Affection of their Servants as he hath done to gain ours: He hath first loved us, and that with an admirable and astonishing Love. <hi>Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter love than this hath no Man, than that a Man lay down his Life for his Friends;</hi> and he hath not refused this Expression of Love to us, for he laid down his <hi>Life, and shed his precious Blood for our sakes.</hi> There is therefore all the Reason in the World, that we should love him, and adhere to him. Besides what Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Commandment of God layeth upon us, to take him for our Lord, the Sense of his Love should oblige us to do it, we are very ungrateful if we do not love him, who hath so highly loved us, and who hath bought us at so dear a Rate, not with corruptible things as Gold and Silver, but with his own most precious Blood.</p>
            <p>Now if it be Love which moves us to<note place="margin">No Love without Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance.</note> call Christ Lord, Lord, to make Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Name, and Gospel, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this will excite us also to do his Will, and observe his Commandments.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:93003:166"/>
It is the very natural Result of Love, the proper Fruits and Expressions of it, to be observant of the Person who is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to take a delight in doing their Will and Pleasure. Love doth always discover it self this way, and it is simply impossible for it not to do so, and it is most certain they have little or no Love who cannot shew it this way: Hereby a Wife manifesteth her Affection to her Husband, and Children their Love and Respect to their Parents, and one Man to another, and when this Method is not followed, and these Evidences gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, do we not presently conclude that the Persons have little Kindness or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for each other? Now our Love to Christ must follow the same Course, and express it self in the same manner; <hi>If ye</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 14. 15, 21, 23, 24.</note> 
               <hi>love me,</hi> saith he, <hi>keep my Commandments.</hi> And again, <hi>He that hath my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; if a Man love me, he will keep my Words; but he that loveth me not, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not my sayings.</hi> And therefore, if Love be the Motive of our professing Christ, it will not rest there, it will carry us further, even to the doing whatsoever he hath commanded us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:93003:166"/>Besides the two Inducements already<note place="margin">
                  <hi>VI.</hi> A third Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is the Hope of Reward.</note> mentioned, there is one other Motive which may perswade us to come to Christ, and to yield our selves his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and that is the Hope of these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he hath to bestow. These Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices are much sought after which are honourable and profitable, and truly there is none which hath more either of Honour or Profit, than this of the Lord Jesus Christ: There is more advantage of having him our Master, than in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Kings and Princes, or the greatest in the World: For besides the Temporal Benefits and Spiritual Blessings, which he gives in this present Life, he giveth Glory and Eternal Happiness in the Life to come, and therefore we may with good Reason, say with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when our Lord asked him, <hi>Will ye also go away</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 68<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>from me? to whom shall we go? thou hast the Words of Eternal Life.</hi> The Hope of Reward then may reasonably excite us to own and profess Christ, but we do in vain look for his Reward, without paying him due Obedience.</p>
            <p>What, I pray you, is there any Man<note place="margin">Which the Disobedient cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</note> that will pay his Servant his Wages, when he hath not performed his Work, do we think our Lord will bestow upon us the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:93003:167"/>
Eternal Rewards of the other World, when we have done nothing for it? He told the Woman of <hi>Canaan, that it was not meet to take the childrens bread, and cast it to the dogs,</hi> and we may be sure he will never think it just to make the Children of Disobedience to share alike, as those that do sincerely obey him; <hi>Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven. Many will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy Name? and in thy Name have cast out Devils? and in thy Name done many wonderful Works? And then I will profess unto them, I never knew you, depart from me ye that work iniquity. He is a just</hi>

obey him; so none but those who keep his Commandments are capable of them. The Dignities and Enjoyments of this present World may be possessed by any: Both good and bad we see can be invested with them, but as for the Heavenly Glory none can enjoy it, but such as are worthy thereof. As the Eye is required to Seeing, and the Ear to Hearing, and the Palate to Tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; so the previous Dispositions of Holiness and Righteousness, are requisite and absolutely necessary to the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heaven and Eternal Life: <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14.</note> 
               <hi>holiness</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>no man can see God.</hi> Seeing it is certain that we keep in the other World the same Temper and Inclinations which we have in this, therefore he who is not prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and disposed before-hand by the Exercise of Vertue, and the leading a Life according to the Commandments of God, is no more capable of Heaven and the Pleasures thereof, than a Beast is of the intellectual and rational Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Men. Heaven is not to be considered so much under the Notion of some glorious Place, as of a State which brings us near to God, and makes us Partakers of his Divine Nature. It is a
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:93003:168"/>
Life of perfect Holiness and Purity. Wherefore they who seek for Heaven without the Desires and Endeavours to be truly holy, are wholly ignorant of, and do quite mistake the thing, and do not know what they would be at. Let any Object or Enjoyment be in it self never so good or excellent; yet if it be not agreeable to the Faculties, and suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Inclinations of him who hath it; it affords no Satisfaction or Delight: And if he hath any Aversion thereunto, it disgusts and procures Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Pain. The covetous Worlding, the lascivious and intemperate Person, relish no Pleasure in the Church, in the Exercises of Devotion, and in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of pious and devout Souls, who are wholly mortified to the World and the things thereof; these are irksome, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and wearisome things unto them. And we may be sure Heaven would be yet far more troublesome, because it would be a greater Violence to their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Therefore could we suppose a wicked Man translated into Heaven, he yet would find no Heaven of it, I mean he would not look upon himself as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py there, because he would find nothing agreeable to his mind, or grateful to his
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:93003:168"/>
Inclinations; he would taste as little Pleasure in all that that place could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him; as a Swine would do to be wrapped in Odours, and fine Linen, and decked with all manner of precious Ornaments: As that Beast would still count the Mire and Puddle more delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, so a wicked and ungodly Person would esteem the lowest, the most bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish and sensual Pleasures here to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Joys of Heaven it self. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven certainly is as much the natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of a holy and good Life, as it is the Reward obtained for our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: And Hell is no more the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Punishment of Sin, than it is the necessary result and effect of it. As a Weight naturally presseth towards the Earth, so Sin sinketh a Man necessarily into Hell, that is the outmost Misery. Whereas true Goodness and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness put him without the Reach of it, in that they elevate and raise him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, who is the Fountain of all Happiness. Holiness therefore, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Christ, is the true and only way to Heaven, he that treads not this Path shall never come there.</p>
            <p>Thus we have considered the Text as it seems the Proposal of a Question, or
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:93003:169"/>
interrogatory, asking the Reason and Cause why those who own and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Christ, to be their Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, do not sincerely obey Him, and keep his Commandments? From which Occasion hath been taken, to shew the unreasonableness and Absurdity of disjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these which should be conjoined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I mean the Profession and Practice of Christianity; seeing that which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and exciteth to the one, doth also call for the other. Now, before I leave this Point, allow me to ask you a few Questions, and to reason the matter a little with you. What is it that perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth you to call Christ Lord? Is it that you may please God, by receiving him, whom he hath so highly exalted? If this be the reason, do you not see that by the same reason you are obliged to serve and obey him? For this also is the Will of God. Is it Love to Christ which makes you adhere to him? You see Love and Obedience are inseparable, and that Love cannot be ingenuously professed, if Obedience be denied. Finally, do you embrace Christ on the account of that rich Reward which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised? But do you not see that this cannot be expected, without keeping his
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:93003:169"/>
Commandments, and performing that Work which he requireth, and hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted to you. What Reason can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for refusing an entire Subjection to the Doctrine of Jesus Christ. Is there any Motive or Inducement to believe, which doth not equally perswade to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey? It is evident then, that if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be laid home to Men they can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer nothing, but must stand speechless. Out of thine own Mouth thou shalt be condemned, O wicked and slothful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; for thou oughtest to have obeyed him whom thou knowest and believest, to be thy Lord? Shouldest thou not study to please him whom thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessest so much to Love? And oughtest thou not to have done thy Work if thou wouldest have had thy Wages? What a shameful and unworthy a thing is it for Men to act so unlike Men? To shew so little Reason; nay, to walk so contrary to all Reason, in these matters of the greatest Moment and Concernment? The Practice of Heathens and Infidels is not so absurd as this comes to; they do not obey Christ, because they do not believe in him, or they will not profess him, because they have no mind to obey him, So one tells us of the Men of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:93003:170"/>
               <hi>Congo,</hi> That at first they were easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by the <hi>Portugueze</hi> to embrace Christianity, and were baptized in great abundance: But afterwards, when they found it did require some Strictness, which they had no mind to bear, that they must leave their Heathen Practices, particularly their Multitude of Women, they came back to the Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd what they had done, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd back to their indulgent Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism. For they knew not how to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Christian Vow with living in the open Breach of it, being too honest for such Practices. And certainly it is far more reasonable to declare that we do not believe in Christ, nor yet own him; than to profess both, and in the mean time continue disobedient to him, if we lay aside our Obedience, let us lay aside our Faith and Profession too; for that but makes us the more guilty and liable to a greater Condemnation.</p>
            <p>And thus we are brought from consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering<note place="margin">
                  <hi>VII.</hi> The Text may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as an Expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or Reproof.</note> the Text Question-wise, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it as an Expostulation, or sharp Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof made to all empty and barren Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, and such as rest in a meer Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical Faith and speculative Knowledge of Christ, without offering to bring
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:93003:170"/>
forth the Fruits of Obedience and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Now taking the words thus (as it indeed appears they ought to be taken so) they may be thus Paraphrased; <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not those things which I say?</hi> That is, <q>Why should you take my Name in your Mouth, seeing you hate Instruction, and cast my Words behind you? How dare you be so bold, as to call me your Lord, seeing you refuse to obey me? Do you not know what a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption this is? And how highly it displeaseth me? I had far rather you'd disown me. And it would please me much better that you forsake my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice altogether, <hi>than to say, and not to do.</hi> What do, you fancy I am igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of your ways? Or, do you think I am altogether such an one as your selves; one who doth secretly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and approve of Vice and Sin? Do you think I will sit down with such an Affront? No certainly, I will not pass it; I will both reprove you, and punish you; either therefore do those things which I say unto you, or else cease to <hi>call me Lord, Lord.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the sence and meaning of the words, and we need not think it very
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:93003:171"/>
strange, that Christ should so passionately reprove, and expostulate with such Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as are unobservant of his Will, and negligent to keep his Commandments: For their carriage and behaviour is very provoking, it throweth a great deal of dishonour and reproach upon our Lord, and is very prejudicial to his Interest; because it doth very much obstruct the Advancement of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>First, I say, the Disobedience and the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>VIII.</hi> The Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Christians very provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</note> naughty Lives of those who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Christians, cannot but very much provoke the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ:</hi> For he being really a Man as well as God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must think, he hath all the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which are natural unto Men, and which are not the effects of the present Corruption and Disorder of our Nature by Sin: and it's not only natural even to the best to be grieved and irritated, when they consider how unworthily they are dealt with by those who are strictly obliged unto them: But also to be so provoked and grieved upon such a just occasion, is consistent with the most perfect vertue. Unless therefore we make a Stoical Apathy to be true Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it is impossible but that Jesus Christ must be displeased and troubled when
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:93003:171"/>
his own Disciples slight and neglect him. No Man can take it well to be slighted and abused by any: But the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and undutifulness of Servants and Children, is an insolency which none can patiently bear with. The wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the rest of the World is indeed grievous; but that the Disciples of Jesus Christ should commit Sin and prove Ungodly, cannot but be thought highly offensive. The Heathen know not what they do, and therefore they deserve Pity and Compassion: Our Lord doth not expect Obedience from them, or any regard to his Will and Pleasure, because he is not yet made known unto them; which doth somewhat excuse them. But I pray, what excuse can be pretended for those to whom he hath manifested himself, and to whom his Majesty, Power, and Glory have been revealed? That they should resist the Power of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, despise his Laws, and work Wickedness; and run into all Excess and Riot, is a most irritating, insolent, and inexcusable thing. This cannot but stir up his Anger, vex and grieve his Spirit.</p>

                  <hi>IX.</hi> It doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</note> place, what reproach and dishonour he receives thereby. It's well known how
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:93003:172"/>
much the carriage of Servants and Friends tends either to a Man's Credit or Disgrace. He hath honour whose Family is kept in good order, whose Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Children behave themselves vertuously and discreetly; but when they are vicious and unruly, he is put to shame affronted. Thus the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> said to his Sons <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their Cruelty committed upon the <hi>Shechemites, Ye have troubled me to make me stink among the Inhabitants of</hi>

               <hi>the Land.</hi> And certainly corrupt and bad Christians do the same dis-service unto Christ their Lord; they occasion him to be dishonoured and lightly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by such as are Strangers unto him. God told <hi>David,</hi> That the Murther and Adultery he had committed, had given great occasion <hi>to the Enemies of the Lord</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 14.</note> 
               <hi>to blaspheme.</hi> And the same Enemies, (I mean the Heathens) do still Blaspheme our God and the Lord Jesus Christ, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of those and the like Enormities and Abominations, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound among us who call our selves his Servants, and do profess to worship him: For by these things they cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that he is the <hi>true God,</hi> more than those they serve; and are tempted
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:93003:172"/>
to think as well of their <hi>false Gods</hi> and <hi>petty Deities.</hi> Some tell us, that in some places it is ordinary for People, when their Honesty and Integrity is called in question, to vindicate themselves by Swearing and Professing they are no <hi>Christians;</hi> which is a most horrid shame and disgrace to us and our holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. It is well known what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and reproach the <hi>Spaniards</hi> brought upon the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> when they first discovered <hi>America,</hi> the poor <hi>Indians</hi> saw their Covetousness so exorbitant, their Cruelty so horrid, and all their Practices so filthy and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that they could not but loath and disgust them, and upon that account they abhorred the God whom they ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the Religion which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed; and one of them peremptorily refused <hi>to go to Heaven, because the</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards <hi>said they were to be there:</hi> For he could not think that a good place into which such bad persons were admitted. And now tell me, I pray you, what can be imagined more offensive and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing unto God, than the making him liable to be thus blasphem'd and evil thought of? That he should be thought a Friend to, and favourer of the most
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:93003:173"/>
wicked and wretchedly debauch'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Sure the Wounds which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour receiv'd upon the Cross, were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so deep nor so sore as those which such Reproaches give him; and we may be sure he will resent them. The Wounds he received upon the Cross, he suffered willingly, but these are against his Will; The first he forgave freely, for they made for his Honour and Glory: But we cannot think he will forgive the other, which cast such a stain upon his Holiness and Purity. <hi>He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised Moses Law died without Mercy, under three witnesses: Of how much so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, who hath crucified him afresh, and put him to open shame, who hath counted the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant wherewith he was sanctified an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy thing, and doth despite unto the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace? Know ye not that Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance belongeth unto the Lord, and that he hath said, he will recompence it.</hi> Heb. x. 28.</p>
            <p>But Thirdly and Lastly, when these<note place="margin">

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:93003:173"/>
Sin and the lusts of the Flesh; I say, this is prejudicial to his Interest, and obstructs the Advancement of his Kingdom in this World: It doth both keep it from being further extended, and also from arriving to its true height, where it is established. <hi>Evil communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations corrupt good manners;</hi> and one wicked perverse Servant may debauch the rest, draw them from their Service, and the faithful and punctual Attendance upon their Master: So a very few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons professing the Name of Christ, but careless to do his Will, may have a very bad influence upon other Disciples. This tendeth to beget in them a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion that they may belong to Christ, though they be Wedded to the World, Slaves to their Lusts, and drowned in Sensual Delights. Ever since the Church Doors became so patent, that one might have the Name and Rank of a Christian, without giving Proofs of a Sincere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, or shewing the Testimonies of an Holy and Upright Life, all Zeal and Care for Serving of God have been very much cool'd and slackned: And ever since too, Religion hath been at a stand, and made no further progress in the World.

Christians, made their light to shine before Men, whilst their good Works and holy Life were clearly seen, many embraced our holy Faith and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified our Heavenly Father: The Holy and Innocent Lives of the Apostles and Primitive Christians, were so taking, that it allured the World, and made Men ambitious and desirous to embrace that Religion, which taught and enabled Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to live so well: But now that the lives of Christians are so mean and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, so corrupt and prophane, no body enquires after our Religion, they search not into the truth and certainty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; they neither concern themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout its Author, nor do they enquire what Advantages it offers beyond the other Religions of the World. The wickedness of Christians has drawn a bar upon the progress of Christianity, by raising and nourishing such Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices in those who are Strangers to it, so that it is now a very rare thing to see one leave his Native Superstition, and come over to embrace Christ and his Worship. Perhaps there are more Apostates and Renegadoes from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, than there are Converts to it: And however the one is as ordinary as the other.</p>

And O, how few among us can plead not guilty! Let me use a little freedom with you, be not angry if I ask, (would to God you would seriously ask your selves) what you are, what you Profess, in whom you do believe? I know what the answer will be, all will say, we are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, we profess and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ; but, I pray, how do ye shew it? What signs and proofs give ye thereof? Can you make out this by the Works of Obedience? Is it evident that ye do those things which he saith? If so, you have all reason to call him Lord, and you speak but the truth when you call your selves his Disciples, but not
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:93003:176"/>
otherwise. Be not deceived, think not external Baptism, frequenting the Church, hearing Sermons, or making Prayers, are sufficient for holding the Dignity and Privilege of Christians, or for laying Claim and Title to the Lord Jesus Christ: Indeed, they are not Christians who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not shew these, but they may have them and yet not belong unto Christ; The veriest Hypocrites may go thus far, and such as Christ will never own in the great Day of his Appearance: For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, he will reckon none his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, nor will he reward any as such, but those who heartily and sincerely obey him. <hi>I know my sheep,</hi> saith he;<note place="margin">Joh. 10. 27.</note> and that we may know them too, he tells who they are, <hi>My sheep,</hi> saith he, <hi>hear my voice and they follow me.</hi> Now can you say, that you have hearkned sincerely to the voice of this Shepherd? Have you followed whither he leadeth you? Have you indeed performed the Commandment of this your Lord? O that you could all answer Affirmatively. But then, as <hi>Samuel</hi> said to <hi>Saul, What meaneth this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</hi> What means the ridiculing of the Doctrine, and Mysteries of the Gospel?

Whence is it that Whoredom and Uncleanness, Gluttony and Drunkenness, Pride and Wantonness, Falshood and Dishonesty abound so much and are so frequent?

It is Zeal for God, and Charity to Men. It is Self-denial and Innocency, Purity and an Universal Holiness; it is fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in all manner of good Works, which
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:93003:177"/>
only can shew us to be true Disciples of Christ: These are the Badges of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, who putteth on these is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian indeed; but he who lacketh and despiseth these, he who hath neither love nor regard unto them, may as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Profession. Let me intreat you therefore to examine and try your Hearts, and when you have done that, declare your Sentiments and Resolutions. Why do you halt and hover so much? Speak your Mind freely, be plain and ingenuous. Are you for God? Will you accept Jesus Christ to be your Lord and Master? Declare it, and let it be seen by your works and Conversation; If you think him a hard Master, one who imposes a Burthen you cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; If you think his Laws grievous, rigid and severe, I pray you renounce your Covenant with him, quit his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and go serve some other Lord. For why do you stay with him you cannot Serve? Why do you own him you resolve not to Obey? Why do you call him Master whom you cannot agree with, and with whose will and pleasure you can never comply? You who are covetous and wedded to the World, why come you to him who

If therefore you have no Mind to comply with the Will of Christ, that is, to be truly Just and Honest, Sober and Temperate, Good and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, Holy and Upright before God and Man: You had better not own Christ, not pretend to have any thing to do with him; otherwise you shall draw greater Guilt and Punishment upon your selves: for you have seen how much this doth provoke him, and what dishonour and prejudice it doth to him.</p>

Men to embrace Christ, and to be reconciled unto God, we are sent out upon this very Errand, but if Men will not be perswaded to leave their Sins, nor to turn Holy and Righteous, we must intreat them not to embrace Christ; we must desire them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess Atheism, Infidelity, any thing they please except the Christian Religion: And sure, next to a hearty and real Compliance with the Laws of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, this is the best Service can be done unto God; For so long as Men deny Christ, and will not own them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be his Disciples, their fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness in Sin, and their barrenness in Good Works, disappoint neither God nor Man, nor is the occasion of any reproach unto the Christian Religion. But when Men call themselves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, it is still expected they will walk as such; while they call unto Christ <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> it's hoped and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved they will do what he saith; Even as Christ looked to have found Figs upon the Tree which brought forth Leaves; and therefore, if this Fruit be wanting in them, they both mock God and delude Men.

If ye do him no good, I pray you, do him no wrong; If you will not glorifie him by your good Works, I pray you, do not dishonour him by your evil Deeds; If ye will not serve him your selves, do not hinder others that would: His Love, the laying down of his Life for you, ought to melt you into Love, and to engage you to Obedience; but if you think him not worthy of such a Return, I hope you will not think it just, to render him Evil for Good, Hatred for Love: He deserves better usage at your hands, than to have his Spirit wounded and grieved by you; his Name reproached and calumniated, and his Interest weakned and prejudged. And yet all these things ye do unto him when ye call him Lord, and do not those things which he saith. Oh, far be it from us to be guilty of such mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Ingratitude, and to deal so inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely with the Lord Jesus Christ, who hath shewed us such astonishing Love and Kindness, and who is most desirous of our good and happiness: Wherefore let us sit down, and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

what we will do, whether we will adhere to the Profession of Christ, and join thereto Obedience to his Laws; or if we shall renounce both together. The First certainly would please him best, but the Second would please him better than a bare barren Profession of his Name with the practice of Sin and Wickedness. Chuse you then this day whom ye will serve, whether Christ the Lord, or the Devil, the World and the Flesh? Ye cannot serve him and them too: <hi>No man can serve two Masters.</hi> If you cleave to him, you must forsake them: If you will adhere to them, let him go. I know you will answer as the people did <hi>Ioshua,</hi> when he put the like question unto them, <hi>God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods.</hi> But remember and consider what <hi>Ioshua</hi> said again unto them, <hi>Ye cannot serve the Lord, for he is an holy God, he is a jealous God, he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.</hi> That is, he will not connive at them, or bear with them; he will by no means be induced to indulge you the practice of them; <hi>If ye forsake the Lord and serve strange gods,</hi> that is, if while you profess your selves his Servants, you obey any other, and do

            <p>But what, shall sin separate us from God? Shall any thing be dearer to us than the Lord Jesus Christ? Have we greater ties to the Devil, the World and the Flesh, than to him? Shall we think our selves happier in their Service than in his? God forbid: Was it not by these that we were brought into misery and thraldom? Shall we deliberate then to whom we shall yield our selves Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>whether of sin unto sin,</hi> or <hi>of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto righteousness?</hi> Is the balance equal?

            <p>THese Words are an Inference or<note place="margin">The Scope of the Text.</note> Conclusion drawn from a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine formerly delivered, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the illative Particle [<hi>Therefore</hi>] in the <hi>19th.</hi> Verse: And there you have also the Summ of the Doctrine it self, viz. <hi>That there is now free access unto God through Iesus Christ,</hi> which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle declareth in figurative Expressions,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:93003:181"/>
with an Allusion to the Jewish Temple, not only because he was writing to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> but also because that Temple, and the way of entering thereinto, was a Type of this great Truth, which is revealed by the Gospel. <hi>That Iesus Christ is a true, and the only Mediator betwixt God and Man,</hi> that by him Men may confidently draw near to God, and hope for Acceptance, St. <hi>Paul</hi> has assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and endeavoured to make out in the former part of this Epistle; and indeed he hath proved and made it most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, so that there can remain no doubt thereof, except in those who obstruct their own Conviction, not desiring to be convinc'd. Now the proper and practical Improvement of this certain, important, and most desireable Truth, is what you have in the Words of our Text: For they contain an Exhortation to lay hold on this gracious Privilege; and with all they shew us how, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner we should do it, so as to obtain it.</p>
            <p>I shall first speak to the Exhortation it self, next of the Qualities here required of such as design to comply with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and lastly make Application of all to the present business of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:93003:182"/>To begin then with the Exhortation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> The Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Let us draw near.</note> which is in these words, <hi>Let us draw near.</hi> To what or whom we should draw near, is not here express'd, but is to be gathered from what goeth before, whereby we understand that it is God to whom we are here desired to draw near. And seeing it is so, by drawing near here cannot be meant any Motion of our Body towards God; for as to his Glorious and Majestick Presence in the Heavens, we cannot approach it though we would; and as for his other Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Presence, neither can we avoid it though we would too, for he fills both Heaven and Earth. <hi>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? Or whither shall I flee from thy presence</hi> (said <hi>David</hi>). <hi>If I ascend up into Heaven, thou art there: If I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.</hi> To draw near to God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is a metaphorical Speech, and must be understood not of any natural Action of the Body, but of some moral Action of the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> The Desires and Endeavours after Peace, and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God. For, because those who are Enemies and at variance together, use to keep a Distance, and shun each other's Company; therefore in Scripture,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:93003:182"/>
they who never think of God, take no Care to please him, and those who make no Difficulty to offend him, are said to be far from God, and to go a whoring from him: And on the other hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those who lay aside their Enmity, and are desirous to be made Friends, usually meet and resort to one anothers Company, therefore <hi>drawing near to God</hi> in the Scripture Language, is put for the Inclination of our Souls toward him, the seeking to have all manner of Enmity betwixt God and us quite remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that a true, firm Peace be made up with him.</p>
            <p>Sin is the Cause and Occasion of that Enmity which is fallen out betwixt God and Man: And one would have thought that all the Difficulties of Reconciliation with God, should have been on his part; That his Justice, his Honour, his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity should have interposed, and not only not suffered him to accept of Peace, but also to have obliged him utterly to destroy those despicable, silly Creatures, who had the foolish Insolency to rebel against him, and to counteract his Will and Pleasure. But behold Jesus Christ, hath removed all Difficulties on God's Part, he hath found out means to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:93003:183"/>
the Justice, and to salve the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Authority of God, though Man be not destroyed, though his Sin be passed over and pardoned; God's Wrath is pacified; he now looks favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably upon Man, and is willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him into Favour, and to renew a Covenant of Grace and Peace with him, whereby he obligeth himself to deal with Man as if he had not sinned, as if he had never rebelled against his Maker. Now could it have been expected that such a gracious Offer should not have been readily embraced: But which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Man stands out, and will not be reconciled to God. God hath made great Condescension, and Man will make none; God wooes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats, and Man draws back and runs away; God calls and sends Message af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Message, and the other will not hear, he stretcheth forth his Hands, but no Man regardeth; he waits, but they will not come or draw near. Thus each acts as 'twere, not his own part, but what in all Appearance doth more properly belong to the other: God acts as if he were in Man's stead, and Man behaves himself as if he were in the Place of God; for as if God were the poor, the needy,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:93003:183"/>
the inferiour, and miserable Party, he sues and humbles himself first, and as if Man were an independent Sovereign and All-sufficient Being, who needed no Aid from any, he rejects all the Treaty, and disdains this proffered Friendship. O! Wonderful Condescension of God? And O the Stupidity, and Foolishness, and Madness of Man? What Words are sufficient to hold out either of these? And how hard is it to determine which of the two is most astonishing? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God's Behaviour towards Man in seeking him, offering Pardon and Peace, or Man's Behaviour towards God, in refusing and slighting the same? <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish People and unwise? O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leesing!</hi> Do ye slight God, set at nought your Maker, and court the World? Are ye taken up with Toys and Trifles, and will ye despise Life, and cast behind you eternal Bliss. <hi>Be astonished, O ye Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens at this! And be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate saith the Lord, for my People have committed two great evils; they have forsaken me, the fountain of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters, and hew'd them out Cisterns,</hi>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:93003:184"/>
               <hi>broken Cisterns that can hold no water.</hi> O! that Men were wise, O! that they did understand, O! that they would but seriously consider this!</p>
            <p>Come, I pray you, let us reason to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, call in your Thoughts, consult your Knowledge, advise with your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and then tell me what you have ever found preferable to God? Is there any thing more worthy your Thoughts or Care: What is it that doth equal his Favour and Love: Or, what can compensate the Loss thereof? Will Riches, will Honours, will Pleasures, or will any thing else be profitable as God? Can we expect to draw from them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther separately or jointly, as much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Satisfaction as from him? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold every Day lets us see that all these things are frail, brittle, and uncertain; and that there can be no fast hold of them: But though they were more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and stable, yet being unsuitable to the Nature of our Souls, 'tis impossible to draw from them alone that good which our Souls crave. It is indeed somewhat hard to convince Men, but though they should act over all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and prove what good is under the Sun, they could not
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:93003:184"/>
draw another Conclusion than what he has left us, <hi>viz. That all things are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and vexation of Spirit,</hi> and that Mans chief and only good is to seek God, and to delight themselves in him. <hi>The Lord is my portion, saith my soul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lam. 2. 24.</note> 
               <hi>therefore will I hope in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O consider what an Honour it is to be admitted into Favour and Fellowship with God. The Psalmist falls into Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration when he beheld Man but a <hi>little lower than the Angels,</hi> and invested with <hi>Dominion over the Fowls of the Air, the Beasts of the Field, and the Fish of the Sea.</hi> And whatever Reason there be for Praise and Admiration in that Case, yet Angels being but Fellow-Creatures, and the other destitute of Reason and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and so far below us, this is nothing so considerable as to be advanc'd into Communion with God himself, this is indeed a Heighth and Dignity which may both amaze the Behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and those on whom it is conferred <note n="*" place="margin">O anima rationalis mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilis creatura, quo te de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jicis, terram diligis, &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior es, coelum contemplaris &amp; altior es, solo tuo crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore tu inferior. <hi>Saith St.</hi> Augustine.</note>. To be made the Friends of God, is truly an Honour to our Nature, nothing else can give any Lustre or Glory to us, but this is the highest can be aspir'd to, either by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:93003:185"/>
or Men, and therefore we have great Reason to cry out, <hi>Lord, what is Man, that thou shouldest be so kind to him?</hi> And so kind too after he had turn'd Rebel and Traytor is indeed beyond Expression. <hi>Behold, what manner of love the father hath bestowed on us, that we should be called the sons of God. Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> had good Reason to say, that he gloried more in being a Member of the Church, than in being Head of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, for to be a true lively Member of the Church doth unite us to God, and so is more to be desired than the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Dominion, or an universal Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. For hereby we are not only high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured, but greatly enriched; we have not only an honourable Title and Relation conferred on us, but also the largest Emolument. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> advised <hi>Iob</hi> to seek unto God, that he might be relieved out of all his Trouble, and if he got him his Friend, he told him he should be <hi>in League with the stones of the Field, and the beasts of the Field should be at peace with him;</hi> for God will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly oblige all his Creatures to keep Peace, with those with whom he is at Peace, as a King maketh Peace not only for himself, but for all his People, or if
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:93003:185"/>
he let any of them break Peace, it is that he may make those his beloved and peculiar Friends to be the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious by gaining a Victory over them. He that draws near to God is sure of his Hearts wish; <hi>Delight thy self in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.</hi> What can any wish for more, than what an infinite Wisdom can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive, an infinite Power act, and an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Bounty bestow? Now he who hath God his Friend, is allied to infinite Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Wisdom, and Goodness, which will ever interess themselves in all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. <hi>Happy are the People whose God is the Lord; blessed is the Man who chuses God for his Inheritance, for he will give grace and glory, and will with-hold no good thing from him. All things shall work together to the good of them that love God:</hi> Trouble as well as Prosperity, and the saddest Affliction as well as the greatest outward Plenty. <hi>Many say, who will shew us any good?</hi> But saith <hi>David, Lord lift thou up the light of thy Countenance upon us. Thou hast put gladness in my heart more than in the time that their Corn and Wine increased.</hi> They who draw near to God have Joy which the World cannot rob them of: the Ground
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:93003:186"/>
of their Happiness and Comfort is not liable to Rapine or Violence, nor doth it ever decay. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my Peace I give unto you,</hi> saith <hi>Christ, but not as the World giveth give I unto you;</hi> that is, he gives neither so incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, nor yet so brittle and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Peace as what the World gives, but what is more solid and substantial, wherefore he adds, <hi>let not your hearts be troubled neither be afraid.</hi> If we have Peace with God through Christ we need not startle at any thing, neither at pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Personal Disasters, nor at publick Calamities: <hi>Because God is our refuge and present help.</hi> The Children of God cannot be without Crosses and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but God will not suffer these to marr either their present inward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or after Happiness, their Joy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken from them. He will let them be tossed up and down with the Waves of Trouble, but they shall not be swallowed up, they shall have a joyful exit. <hi>Mark the perfect, and behold the upright, for the latter end of that Man is Peace,</hi> Psal. xxxvii. When Men draw near the end of their Life, when their Days are near a Period, whether through Age or by any Accident, they have
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:93003:186"/>
need of some comforting Cordial to keep them from fainting; and nothing is possible to administer this, but the Hopes of Peace with God. The Sense of God's Favour and Love will make Death appear without a frightful Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, though generally it is esteemed the King of Terrours; this will make one to be so far from abhorring Death, as in many Cases to be even glad of it, because it opens a Door to eternal Rest, unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Joy, and Fullness of Glory. Is it not then good for us to draw near to God?</p>
            <p>But if so much real good, as thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues by drawing near to God, be not Motive enough to engage us to do it, I pray consider the Danger of neglecting it, which is no less than utter Misery and certain Destruction, for <hi>lo they that are far from thee shall perish</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</hi> It may certainly be matter of Astonishment, how Men can rest, be merry, or enjoy any Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness while they live in Enmity with God, and have no Assurance of Peace with him. Men are troubled if they understand any Alteration of their King's Favour toward them, nay if but some
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:93003:187"/>
Difference fall out between them, and some Favourite of the Court, though the King's Anger may be many ways avoided, and that before the Sun hath finished his Course twice, the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite may be turned out of Court, and put in a Condition which obliges him as much to depend on others, as others now on him: But however, is the Wrath of frail mortal Man so much to be feared? Is their Displeasure so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be avoided? And should the Wrath of God be little regarded? How much more Reason have we to fear God than Man? There is no concealing ones self if he search out, nor is there any resisting his Power, if he be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to punish, and <hi>who may stand before him if his anger be kindled but a little.</hi> Ye who will not be perswaded to draw near to God, how think ye to save your selves, <hi>how can ye escape if ye neglect so great Salvation</hi> as is now tendered you? Can you muster Forces equal in Strength and Number unto God's? And if you cannot, why do you not seek Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he come in Wrath to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, for the Affront you have done him in rejecting so great Love and Kindness, as he hath proffered by his own Son?
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:93003:187"/>
Ye <hi>Atheists</hi> and Prophane, who now laugh at Religion and make a mock at Sin, what will ye do or say for your selves when God enters into Judgment with you? Do you think to put on then your present Boldness, and unmannerly Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? or will you make God retire by your Prophane drolling and jesting, as you use now to affright all sober and modest persons from your Company? Then your Tongues will be bound up, your Wits will fail, <hi>shame shall cover your faces, you shall stand trembling, and shall feel that power to your confusion, which at present you scorn and little regard;</hi> Ye, who cannot find time to seek God, who have no leisure to Pray, to read the Scripture, or to attend God's Publick Worship or Ordinances, how do ye think to come off? will ye say that ye had your Business to wait on, that ye were taken up with the pursuit of Honours and Riches, that ye were drawn away with Pleasures, with Gaming and Sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? That is, to tell him plainly, you loved him not, you preferr'd all things before him, and thought it time enough to seek him when you had nothing else to do. Or, do you imagine to bribe him, but he will not be brib'd; and tho'
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:93003:188"/>
he could, what would you give? you have nothing, you leave all behind you, you pass naked into the other World: There is no Remedy then, but submit you must, and you can expect no Mercy for it is out of time, and when it was offer'd, you contemn'd it. <hi>O consider this, ye that forget God, lest he tear you in pieces, when there shall be none to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver!</hi> Now is the acceptable time, now is the day of Salvation, now you may have Peace; be wise therefore, and let not such opportunities slip, but <hi>seek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near.

God will not value the Bowings and Prostrations of Mens Bodies, their sad Looks, mournful Tone, fair Words and Professions, if these proceed not from the Heart, and be not the real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations of the inward Purposes and

               <hi>unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me, therefore,</hi> saith God, <hi>in vain do they worship me.</hi> There is no true Friendship where there is not an Union and closing of Hearts: Indeed, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Enemies will meet, shake hands, and make many fair Protestations, and yet their old Grudge and Quarrel will continue, which cannot be reckoned a cordial reconciliation, it's only a patcht agreement to please some third Person, or to shun some present inconvenience, which will never last. But as there is nothing to oblige God to patch up a Peace with us, against his Will, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Honour; so there is no Peace with him who is the Father of Spirits, but when it is with the Heart, neither will he look favourably upon any heart, except a true heart, that is a sincere heart, free of Hypocrisie and Deceit, he who draws near to God
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:93003:189"/>
must be like <hi>Nathaniel, a true Israelite in whom there is no guile;</hi> that is, who sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and in good earnest loves and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires that which he professeth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to seek. One Man may deceive another, he may make him believe what is not in his Mind; for the East is not more distant from the West, than some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Heart of Man is from his Mouth, his Intention and Affection from his Words and Actions. But be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, God will not be mocked, there is no deluding of him into a belief of what is not really true, he knows well enough whether we be ingenuous; and if Ingenuity be wanting, he will have nothing to do with us. As false deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friends are more odious than profess'd Enemies, so God hates Hypocrites as much, nay, more than Prophane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: For in Scripture the portion of Hypocrites is mentioned as the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest Punishment, <hi>they shall have their portion with hypocrites,</hi> as if that were the very height of Misery. If then ye draw near to God, see that it be with true hearts, for <hi>he desires truth in the inward parts.</hi> Now, what one seeks sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and in good earnest, he values and prizeth highly, he will spare nothing
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:93003:190"/>
within his Power to the obtaining it, and will labour to remove whatever may obstruct it: Thus he who sincerely seeks and desires Health, will be at any cost or pains for it, will cautiously guard against that dyet, and weather, places, or what else may prejudge it. And he who is covetous reckons little of the greatest toil and drudgery if gainful, nothing is sordid to him which brings Profit, and he avoids and hates all actions and places which call him to lay out Money; the like may be said of other things. And hereby we may know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we seek God with a true heart: Do we in our hearts love God, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue him aright, that is, above all things? Can we prize God as a chief Treasure, and count all things else in comparison <hi>as but loss and dung?</hi> Are we ready to part with any thing rather than lose him or his favour! Do we hate whatever offends him, and is inconsistent with fellowship with him? Can we freely embrace his Will, his Ways, his Word, which are inseparable from him? In a word, do we love what he loves, and hate what he hates, and are his thoughts our thoughts? If so, then our hearts are true to God, but otherwise they are
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:93003:190"/>
not right, they are not according to God's Heart, and while they continue so, no Peace and Reconciliation can be expected. Many draw near to God, as the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> came out of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> they came forth with their Bodies, but they left their hearts behind them; and, though they were necessitated to move forwards, yet it was still with reluctancy, and they would fain have return'd to the Onions and Flesh-pots of <hi>Egypt;</hi> so many draw near to God, but not cordially, 'tis somewhat unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, for they would be content to be freed of the necessity of seeking God; and in the midst of their Religious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices they remember the Pleasures of Sin with some delight, they cast favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable glances upon them, and wish for a freedom to enjoy them. God knows this, and do you think he will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? Will he accept of such Persons? No certainly, the fate of these <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> tells us their Doom, for as those whose hearts were so glewed to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and who in their heart despised <hi>Canaan,</hi> were never suffered to enter it, or to taste the Pleasures thereof: So Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, such as do not willingly and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially draw near to God, shall never find
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:93003:191"/>
Grace in his sight, they shall never be admitted into the Holy of Holies, but shall be for ever thrust out.</p>
            <p>The second Thing required in those<note place="margin">2. Full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Faith.</note> who draw near to God, is, That they approach <hi>in full assurance of Faith.</hi> In the Original it is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which Phrase is Metaphorical alluding to the Practice of Mariners, who when they are bound towards any Port, use so to order their Sails that the Wind may extend and fill them, to the end they may have a pleasant and speedy passage, for when the Sails flap and are not filled with the Wind, the Ship nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes speed, nor keeps an even course. Now seeing it is Faith which brings us to God, and makes our Union with him; for <hi>without faith it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to please God, for he that cometh to him must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him,</hi> as the same Apostle tells us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, <hi>Chap.</hi> xi. 6. and in the Third of this Epistle, he plainly declares, that to have <hi>an evil heart of unbelief,</hi> is <hi>to depart from the living God,</hi> and that <hi>some could not enter into God's rest because of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:</hi> Now, I say, seeing it is so, seeing Faith is thus necessary to lead us to God,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:93003:191"/>
therefore in the Text 'tis required that we be <hi>full of Faith,</hi> that we let Faith actuate all the Powers and Faculties of our Souls, and enliven all our Actions, that like a Ship whose Sails are full blown, we may hold a steady and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Course, and at last obtain a safe and happy Arrival at that high and holy Port we would be at: <hi>We are justified by Faith, and have Peace with God through our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> Rom. v. 1.</p>
            <p>If you would know particularly what<note place="margin">A Belief of the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Gospel.</note> this Faith is, it comprehends two things. <hi>First,</hi> A Belief of the Mysteries of the Gospel. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Belief of our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God. First, Our Faith must respect the Mysteries of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, these we are to look upon as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and undoubted Truths; and that they are so, might be easily made out. If I were speaking to Infidels, I could clearly shew that the Gospel is no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Device, no cunningly devised Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but a thing most sure and faithful, as it is worthy of all acceptation, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every way agreeable to the Nature and Majesty of God, and having clear Prophesies going before, and manifold undoubted Miracles following after, to
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:93003:192"/>
testifie that it is from God: But seeing my Auditory is <hi>Christian,</hi> there is no need of proving what they already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to believe, at least such a Discourse would not be pertinent at this time: But we ought not to consider the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the Gospel as Truths only, but as Truths of the greatest Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Concernment, <hi>Great</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is the mystery of godliness;</hi> 'tis not only true, but a great weighty Truth, in which the Wisdom, the Power and all the Attributes of God are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and which shews to Sinners the way how they should recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and be saved from the Wrath that is to come. <hi>This is life eternal to know thee, the only true God, and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi> Wherefore if we believe this, our thoughts should be much taken up therewith, we should frequently contemplate these Mysteries, and be over-joyed with the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. I believe the Wars of <hi>Iulius Coesar,</hi> the Discoveries of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> those Transactions of Foreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces reported in our <hi>Gazettes</hi> and <hi>News-Letters,</hi> and many other things, but I think it not worth the while to rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate much on these things, I do not
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:93003:192"/>
make it my Business to consider them, and to talk of them, because I do not look upon them as matters of such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in themselves, or of such concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me: But believing the Truth of the Gospel, and knowing the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of what is revealed therein, I find it my duty to esteem it as my necessary Food, and that it is as proper and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to refresh my Soul with serious and daily Meditations thereof, as to give my Body those repasts which Nature daily calls for: This made our Apostle <hi>desire to know nothing save Iesus Christ and him crucified,</hi> and to say, <hi>doubtless I count all things but loss, for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the knowledge of Christ Iesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as such a Faith is required in all the Mysteries of the Gospel, so more particularly in the Mystery of the Cross, the Death and Sufferings of Jesus Christ, and that Satisfaction he has made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by for Sin: These we should have an Eye to all in our Addresses to God, and more especially such solemn Addresses as those we are now to make. For he who believes this relies thereon, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:93003:193"/>
thereof draws near to God, does confess himself a great Sinner, that it had been just for God to have damned him eternally, that it is only for the sake of Christ he is saved, and that the Wisdom and Mercy of God is highly to be magnified, in finding out such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Means and Methods for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Man, and by such Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments the greatest Sinner endears himself to God, and conciliates his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Kindness: But he who denies this, or has no respect thereto when he draws near to God, must either not own himself a Sinner, or not think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to satisfie God's Justice, or to repair his Honour which is provoked and affronted by Sin, or he must not believe that Jesus Christ hath done this for us, and that he is the only Mediator betwixt God and Man, but must fancy he can come to God by himself, or through some other besides Christ, and which soever of these perswasions he has, he is so far from finding accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that he at once both exasperates God, and provoketh him who had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to make his Peace, and who only could do it: <hi>I am the way, the truth and the life; no man cometh to the Father but</hi>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:93003:193"/>
               <hi>by me;</hi> therefore it's said, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I told you the Faith here<note place="margin">A Belief of our own particular acceptance with God.</note> required must also have a respect to our acceptance with God; that is, we must not only be firmly perswaded of God's Mercy, and his good Will to save Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: But that we our selves in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular shall find Grace in his Sight, if we approach as we ought, and bring no Impediment along with us, and 'twould seem the Translators of our Bible have chiefly respected this act of Faith in the Translation of this Text. Christ requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all those who came to him to be cured of their bodily Distempers, Faith both in his Power and good Will. And<note place="margin">13. 58.</note> St. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us, <hi>He did no mighty works in his own countrey, because of their unbelief.</hi> St. <hi>Mark</hi> saith further, <hi>that he</hi>
               <note place="margin">6.</note> 
               <hi>could not do it;</hi> Which we are not so to understand, as if our Lord's Power could be restrained by any, or that he depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon Men for the exercise thereof, but only that the want of this Faith rendred those Men unworthy of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and indisposed them for receiving
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:93003:194"/>
them. And as these temporal and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Benefits were not commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred without this precious Faith, so neither will spiritual and temporal Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, as Mercy and Salvation, be granted except to those who are disposed for them by earnest Desires, and a sincere belief of God's being ready and willing to bestow them, or at least if they be given to any other, 'tis not according to those ordinary Rules and Methods of the Dispensation of Grace which we ought to walk by; For this Faith is always required as a necessary condition, <hi>All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 22.</note> 
               <hi>believing, ye shall receive,</hi> saith Christ. And St. <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>Let not that man, who wanteth Faith, think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</hi> This Faith is requisite both to animate our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after the means of Grace and Salvation, and also to excite God's love, and to encline him to be merciful to us. 'Tis natural to love those who put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in us, and he has no spark of generosity who will not do his utmost for those who altogether rely on him; if a Sinner can confide in God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that he hath offended him, if he throw himself at his Feet, and can
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:93003:194"/>
but believe that God has so much Mercy as to forgive him all his Sins, and upon his Repentance to receive him into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for the sake of Christ: He by this act so honoureth God, and so obligeth him to Mercy by his trust in him, that he will not, he cannot abandon him. This is set forth to us in the Parable of the Prodigal, for when the Penitent <hi>Son was yet a great way off, his Father saw him, and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.</hi> And as this Faith enclines God to Mercy, so it animates our Endeavours, it excites and quickens us to a cheerful Performance of all the Means and Conditions of Salvation. The Husbandman soweth when he has Hope, and the Merchant Tradeth when he has Hope of Gain, and every Man plyeth heartily what he believes will succeed: but Men are discouraged, and made to give over their Endeavours, when they take up a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion that they shall but labour in vain. <hi>A double minded man</hi> (saith St. <hi>Iames</hi>) that is one who hangs in suspence, who is tossed with Doubts and Fears, <hi>he is unstable in all his ways.</hi> Such an one is inconstant, he pursues not his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, but desists; <hi>he is not steadfast</hi>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:93003:195"/>
               <hi>and unmoveable, and always abounding in the work of the Lord,</hi> as every one ought to be, and as he will be who knows and believes that his Labour is not in vain.</p>
            <p>When therefore we draw near to God, let us do it in this full Assurance of Faith, that we may do it heartily, so as to please God; let us not entertain Doubts and Fears which but disquiet our own Minds, and cast dishonour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God. Would not a Servant reflect either upon the Ability or Honesty of his Master, if he questioned his Reward for the sincere Performance of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? If ye who are evil and sinful, think your selves oblig'd to love and be faithful to those who seek to please you, will not God, think you, be more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and just to forgive us, and to receive us into his Favour if we approve our selves unto him? Is there any thing surer than his Word? Are not all his Promises Yea and Amen? Why art thou perplext? Why art thou cast down, O my Soul? Wouldst thou be reading thy Destiny in the hidden Books of Fate? Wouldst thou fain know what these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Decrees say of thee? O foolish Soul Why so curious to know things too high for thee, which are hid from
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:93003:195"/>
thee, and therefore hid because the Knowledge of them is of no Use to thee, nor would it give thee any Satisfaction? Whatever be the secret Decrees, they do not, they cannot contradict those Eternal and Immutable Purposes which are revealed, <hi>viz.</hi> That they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe, and obey the Gospel, shall be saved; this Sentence cannot be reversed. Believest thou this? if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, do accordingly, and there is no Cause of Fear; whatever come of others, you are surely predestinated to Eternal Life. If thou canst believe, all things are possible. <hi>Blessed are they who believe, for there shall be a performance of those things which are told them of the Lord.</hi> Some are not contented with this Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, That God has certainly declared his infallible Purpose of accepting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Sinners, but they would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly assured that they themselves are actually accepted and justified, which I confess would be a great Comfort, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I doubt but some Men have this Infallible Assurance, but it is an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and preposterous thing for any to expect it at their first Approaches to God; or in the beginnings of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version. This were to ask Fruit before
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:93003:196"/>
the due time, as if one should seek Fruit on the Tree he hath but newly planted. This Assurance never goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Reconciliation to God, though sometimes of his extraordinary Mercy it may follow after; and therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect it, let us desire it never so much until we have really performed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions here required. If thy Assurance be built on another Foundation, 'tis not to be trusted to; and if thou knowest that this Foundation is laid, if thou canst say that in all Sincerity thou hast done what was sought of thee, what makes thee not to have a rational and comfortable Assurance? All Doubts of our Salvation should only arise from our Doubts of performing our part: And if upon a strict and impartial Examination of our selves, we find that we have performed our part, then we ought to have such a comfortable Degree of Assurance as may quiet our Consciences, and support us against our natural Fears, because God cannot but perform his most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promises. But that particular, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible sort of Assurance, which some Men cannot be satisfied unless they have, is an extraordinary Gift, which God is pleased sometimes to give, tho'
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:93003:196"/>
he is not bound to give it. He hath sometimes refreshed the Souls of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and Confessors with it, to support them in the midst of their Torments, but it is not of ordinary Dispensation, and therefore not to be expected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a miraculous Gift, which is not to be asked, but with great Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the Will of God, who knows when it is fit for the Support and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation of a pious Soul. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>The Third Qualification here, is that we have <hi>our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience,</hi> which with what follows is the inseparable Effect of the two former; they cannot be first, and the other can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without them; we must have true and believing Hearts, before we can be <hi>sprinkled from an evil conscience,</hi> or <hi>have our bodies washen,</hi> but once having this, the other will follow, for Light and Heat may be as well disjoined from the Sun, as Purity of Heart and Holiness of Life from true Faith and a sincere Mind to God. Many pretend Faith, but <hi>the tree is known by its fruit,</hi> hereby may it be known whether thy Faith be good, if so be thy <hi>heart be sprinkled from an evil conscience.</hi> In this Speech the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:93003:197"/>
Apostle alludes to the Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies under the Law: 'twas the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom then to sprinkle both the Priests and the People in their Solemn Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to the Lord, sometimes with Blood, sometimes with Water, Oyl, or Ashes: But now these legal Ceremonies are laid aside, yet the thing signified by them is still required, <hi>viz.</hi> What the Apostle makes mention of here, that our <hi>hearts be sprinkled from an evil conscience.</hi> By the <hi>heart</hi> is meant the Soul, or inner Man, by the <hi>evil conscience,</hi> those things which pollute the Soul, which keep one from having a <hi>good conscience void of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence towards God and Man,</hi> such as bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Lusts, inordinate desires, unworthy Passions, evil Thoughts and sinful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, whether born with us, or contracted afterwards. All these must be mortified and purged out, before we can be throughly reconciled to God; for as <hi>Iehu</hi> said to <hi>Ioram,</hi> when he ask'd, <hi>Is there Peace? what peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Iezabel, and her witchcrafts are so many!</hi> So I say to those who draw near to God, how can they look for Peace from him, while their Pride, Vain-Glory, Malice, Wrath, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, and other filthy and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:93003:197"/>
Lusts, live and reign in them? God is willing to be reconciled to our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but not to our Sins; we must part with them, or if our Sins and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be separated, we must give up Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with God. <hi>Truly God is good to Israel,</hi> but 'tis to such only <hi>as are clean in heart.</hi> He cannot love foul polluted Souls, he cannot chuse but loath and hate them, for <hi>he is not a God that hath Pleasure in Wickedness, neither shall evil dwell with him.</hi> As therefore when we entertain great Persons, we use to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all things nasty and unhandsome, and whatsoever may readily offend them, or shame our selves, and are careful to have all things about us decent and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shionable; so being to approach the holy Presence of God, let us lay aside every thing offensive and unsuitable, <hi>viz.</hi> the Love and Inclination to every Sin, for <hi>he is of purer eyes than that he can behold iniquity,</hi> he naturally abhorrs it; and let us give all Diligence to adorn our Souls with holy Thoughts, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Dispositions, for <hi>the righteous Lord loveth righteousness, his countenance doth behold the upright.</hi> But if this be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we can have no Acceptance. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will</hi>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:93003:198"/>
               <hi>not hear me</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>Psal.</hi> lxvi. 18. Even <hi>David</hi> shall be rejected if he regard Iniquity. Some will say, if the Case be thus, none can have Hopes, or who can say their Heart is clean? 'Tis true in our present State, our Hearts cannot be so clean as to have no Blemish, there will be ever some Remainders of Sin in us; and now and then perhaps some sinful Motions will arise in the best; but this will not be imputed to us, neither hinder our Reconciliation with God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we regard them with Love and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, cherish and follow them. If we look on these Irruptions of our corrupt Nature with Sorrow and Regret, if we take care to prevent and suppress them, and are filled with Grief when they at any time prevail, God will not condemn us. They are innocent and clean accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Gospel, who inwardly hate and loath Sin, and keep a continual War with it, and who love Holiness, and constantly aim and endeavour after it, and he who is so clean inwardly will give an outward Manifestation; and therefore it is added, that we have,<note place="margin">

            <p>In the last place, our <hi>Bodies washed with pure water.</hi> The former Clause as we have seen referred to the inner-Man,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:93003:198"/>
and this relates to the outward Man, for both must be made clean in the Sight of God: We must <hi>cleanse our selves from all filthiness both of the flesh and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> neither of them singly will do well: God has united Spirit and Flesh together to make up one Person, and therefore what God hath thus joined together, ought not to be put asunder. Our Minds and Spirits must ascend to God, but the Body must not be left behind wallowing in the mire and filth of Sin and Uncleanness, else the other will not speed, they will not get Access unto God. We ought <hi>to glorifie God both in Soul and Body, for both are his;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as under the Law Men were tied to frequent washing of their Body, that they might be legally clean, and fit to enter the Temple, or approach the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, from which they were debarred, if they had any corporal Filthiness upon them, or had touched any unclean thing; so in Allusion to this, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle here exhorts us to purifie our Life and Actions, to sanctifie our outward Conversation in the World, by breaking off the Course of Sin, and conforming our Words and Actions to the Word of God, for that is like pure Water to

cleanse us from all Spiritual Filthiness. <hi>By what means</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>shall a young man cleanse his way, by taking heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to according to thy word,</hi> Psal. cxix. 9. Now until we be thus cleansed both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and outwardly, we are not fit to draw near to God, nor throughly disposed for Reconciliation with him, <hi>without holiness</hi> (saith our Apostle) <hi>no Man can see God.</hi> There must be both outward and inward Holiness to render us worthy of Peace with God, we must be endued with holy Minds, and the Beauty of Holiness must appear in our Lives and Conversations; and if the outward Man have not a holy Face and Countenance, the inward Man is much to be suspected: Scabs and Ulcers in the Skin, betoken corrupt and impure blood in the Veins. 'Tis great Hypocrisie to pretend change of Heart, when there is no Change of Life, for Persons to say they are regenerate within, when no Reformation appears without. When <hi>Saul</hi> pretended a Performance of the Command which the Lord gave against <hi>Amalek, Samuel</hi> said to him, <hi>what mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth then this bleating of the Sheep, and the lowing of the Oxen which I hear?</hi> For that was an Evidence against him:
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:93003:199"/>
So I would ask those who say their Heart is right, they have a good Conscience towards God, and yet walk in Sin; what means their evil Speeches, their Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and Swearing, their Reviling and Backbiting, their obscene Talk, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest Behaviour, Revellings and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, Injustice and dishonest Dealing, Cruelty and doing Injury to others, and the like Crimes? For doth not our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tell us, that these proceed from the Heart. He whose Heart is perfect and upright with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is always careful to do that which is good in his Sight. 'Tis true, the beginnings of Conversion to God, do not always visibly appear, as the Recovery of the Body from Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is not at the first discernable to others; But in Process of time a sincere Conversion will certainly manifest it self in the Life and Actions. <hi>The path of the just is as the shining light, which shines more and more unto the perfect day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men and Brethren, Sin was the Cause why we were cast out of God's Favour, and there is a Necessity of laying aside Sin before we can recover it. Indeed Christ died to take away the Guilt of Sin, but he has not taken away the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick Evil of it, that remains still;
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:93003:200"/>
he by his Death, has made Sin pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but not allowable; and therefore we must not continue the Servants of Sin: We must quit a vain and wicked Conversation, turn every one from his Iniquity, die to Sin and live to God, and yield our selves to be Instruments of Righteousness according to his Will and Pleasure, and then we shall please him, and he will greatly love us. <hi>Wash ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil, learn to do well; seek judgment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the Widow, and then come</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>though your Sins be as Scarlet, they shall be as white as Snow, though red like Crimson, they shall be as Wool,</hi> Isa. i. 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have explained the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of obtaining Reconciliation with God, and if you please to make Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on them, you will find them most just and reasonable, and as easie as can be required. God could not pass these without renversing the Order of Nature, and laying aside his Holiness and Honour which was impossible; nor could any Terms be more proper for Man, nor better accommodated to the State and
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:93003:200"/>
Condition of all: If many expensive Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. rich Gifts, or Summs of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney had been required, what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the poor, who make the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the World? But now neither the Rich are received upon the Account of their Riches, nor the poor rejected for their Poverty: But both the one and the other are accepted according to their Faith, Repentance, and Obedience. Some there are, who will not allow us this Privilege, whatever we believe or practise, because we are not of their Church: But as the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb is, <hi>Better be condemned by ten Physicians, than one Iudge:</hi> So certainly it is better to be condemned by any Number or Quality of Men, than to be condemn'd by the Word of God; the Word of God you see condemns none who has the Qualifications in the Text, but encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages them to draw near to God, and gives them Assurance of Acceptance. If then through the Grace of God, we come to be so qualified in the Union and Communion of the Catholick Church, we need not fear what they say, who themselves are Schismaticks from the Catholick Church. We have all the reasonable Assurance we can have of our
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:93003:201"/>
Salvation, we may be more sure of it, than if we had the Pope's Bull for it, a thousand Indulgences, ten thousand Masses daily sung for us, and all the Church treasure of Merits bestowed on us: And if we lack this, that will not, cannot be compensated with Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Processions, Pennances, Bowings, Prostrations before Altars, Crossings and Sprinklings with Holy Water, nor yet the Absolution of Priests; for as our Apostle saith, <hi>bodily exercises profit little</hi> as to Salvation: and by what hath been said, you may understand, that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which recommends us to God, must be somewhat more Spiritual than what these amount to. But to leave this, and come to an Application.</p>
            <p>This Text in both parts may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated<note place="margin">Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to the Sacrament of the <hi>Lord's Supper:</hi> These words, <hi>Let us draw near,</hi> may be, without stretching, applied to our coming to this Ordinance, for this is one way of drawing near to God, and the most solemn we can make in this Life, and an earnest of that inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate admission into his glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence hereafter; and hereby also is set forth that which procur'd us this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Privilege, <hi>viz.</hi> The Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:93003:201"/>
of Jesus Christ. Wherefore those who desire to draw near to God, and would have the comfort of his Favour, and the hopes of everlasting Glory, should embrace readily and chearfully the occasion of the Sacrament. And to speak freely to you, I know nothing can keep People from this Sacrament, and make them slight it, but the want of a true desire after God, and the little concern they have for their Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. I pray God forgive those who have made some believe it a mark of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or greater Sanctity to withdraw themselves from our Communion. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you be not easily deceived, believe not every Spirit, but examine well what you hear, whether it be agreeable to Truth. None that knows the Truth, or loves the Purity of the Gospel, can join in Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> But I appeal to all your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, if there be any Doctrine taught in this Church, or any thing practised in our Worship, disagreeable to the Word of God? And if there be not, why should Persons withdraw from our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? And what can excuse such withdrawing? These Tables are indeed too seldom covered; but when they are
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:93003:202"/>
covered, let them be filled with Guests; and if they be not, what a shame is it? Let not this poor Church be miserably torn with needless and unwarrantable separations, whereby we become both a prey and a laughing-stock to our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <hi>How comely a thing is it</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>for brethren to dwell together in unity;</hi> and it is as profitable as comely. Are the Times bad? We should meet to pray God to make them better: Is this a wicked generation! That should not make us <hi>forsake the assembling our selves together,</hi> but we should the rather do it, <hi>to provoke one another to love and good works.</hi> Let not any pretend a liberty of doing what they please, or say they are not accountable to us whether they go or come: Consider, I pray you, that you are all accountable to God; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so as Christians and Members of his Church, you are all accountable to his Ministers, especially to his Supream Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters under Christ, the Bishops, to whom you are subject as to your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Superiours, and ought to obey them. This is his Command, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are obliged to do what he Commands, and not what is right in your own Eyes, or in the Eyes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:93003:202"/>
let therefore his Laws be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually observed, and his Ordinances waited on. And let none take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a Dispensation from any of these, lest they incurr his displeasure, which of all things is most to be feared.</p>
            <p>But though I wish all would come to this Sacrament, yet I would not have any to come unworthily and without due Preparation, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> has told us the sad danger of that. Now what is required to render one worthy, you may learn from the Text, he hath <hi>the wedding garment</hi> who hath the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in the Text. Let me therefore beseech you all to retire Home, to lay aside the thoughts of other Business, and in all seriousness to examine how it stands between God and you; see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you be already adorn'd with these Qualifications here spoken of; if you have them, rejoice and bless God, and come up to Morrow to the House of God, and to this Sacrament, that they may be confirmed and perfected in you. If as yet ye are Strangers to these Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, do not resolve to withdraw, for that is to continue in your sin, and so without God; but be ye rather more earnest this Night in acquiring them:
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:93003:203"/>
In so short a time, 'tis true, you cannot bring them to Perfection, but you may have them in Sincerity, which for the present will be admitted. O! rouze up your Faith, and let it operate in your Minds, besprinkle your selves with the Tears of true Contrition, and cleanse your selves with stedfast Purposes of departing from all Iniquity, and of keeping ever hereafter the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; and if you do so, you shall go back justified in God's Sight.</p>

               </note> and wholsome Advice to a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable People, lying under the weight of God's Anger, and threatned with many sad and grievous Judgments. The People were <hi>Israel,</hi> the Children of the Ten Tribes, with whom God had a Controversie, because there was no Truth, nor Mercy, nor Knowledge of God in the Land: They had cast off the Service of the true God, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted themselves with the Idolatry, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, and other Abominations of the Heathen Nations among whom they dwelt: For which, God's Wrath was kindled against them, and this Prophet was sent forth to intimate the Divine
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:93003:204"/>
Displeasure, and how severely it would fall on them. But the Divine Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are for the most part like <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than's</hi> Arrows, shot for Warning rather than Destruction: <hi>In the midst of Wrath he remembers Mercy,</hi> and when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth War, he intends to spare, and therefore denounceth it that Men may be awakened to their Duty, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent (if not the Temporal Evils which they deserve) yet their Eternal Ruin, which is worst of all. Wherefore it is that the Prophet so often intermixeth his Threatnings with Exhortations to Repentance, Obedience, and seeking the Lord, as here in our Text.</p>
            <p>This Advice has no particularity in<note place="margin">It is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther People.</note> it to restrain it to those to whom it was here given; but it may very well suit with any other People, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of God's Favour, and have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to fear his Displeasure: Nay, here is laid down the general and indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable Conditions on which any People may expect Peace, and Reconciliation with God, and the sure means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining good things from him, and so they are proper to be considered by you at this time.</p>

               <hi>Hosea</hi> speaks here in Metaphorical<note place="margin">The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions are borrowed from Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry.</note> terms borrowed from Husbandry: which as it is the most ancient Employment of Mankind: So according to <hi>Cicero,</hi> it is of all others most becoming and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a Gentleman, and hath employed the Pens of the <note n="*" place="margin">As <hi>Varro, Cato, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> &amp;c.</note> greatest among the <hi>Romans;</hi> and there is a great deal both of Grace and Force in the terms of it, to carry the things recommended by the familiar use of them home to the Minds of Men, and render them more effectual: Upon which account nothing is more usual in the Scripture. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls Believers <hi>God's husbandry or tillage,</hi> 1 Cor. iii. 9. And here we have proper Directions, how to manage it with Skill and Profit. Plowing, Sowing, and Reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are main parts of Husbandry, and should be well looked to by all that would thrive at the Trade; he that neglects them, or is ignorant how to go about them, will certainly come both to Poverty and Shame. They are as es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential in the Spiritual Husbandry, as the Natural, and therefore should be well studied by all, who wish well to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. I pray God we may learn and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise the Lessons here laid before us, and we shall become both perfect and happy thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:93003:205"/>The Prophet begins with Sowing,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> What is meant by Sowing.</note> tho' it be not the first part of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, something must go before it; however, we will not change the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets words, but take them as they lye, it being no great matter what be first or last taught, providing all be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully heard and observed. Sowing then in a Moral sense, signifies Action, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther internal of the Mind, or outward of the Body; for as Sowing is always followed with some Crop, the Grain thrown by the Husbandman's Hand, tho' it be covered with Earth doth not perish, it riseth again, and produceth an answerable Harvest: So Mens Thoughts, Words, and Actions, do not vanish as soon as they pass from them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as the Seed doth, and will spring up again either to their Shame and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, or Comfort and Glory. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concerns us very nearly to look well to all we think, do, and say: A good Husband man will not sow at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom any thing that comes nearest him, but will consider what is the best time, and will choose out the best Seed: So a wise Man will not live at random, speak and do whatever is suggested to him, or comes in his Head, but studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:93003:205"/>
the fittest times and season of things, and he taketh care to give every time and season what is suitable thereto. As Cockle and Darnel is never to be sown; so neither ought Sin to be sown at any time, or upon any account, but <hi>whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we ought,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>to do it all to the glory of God.</hi> And therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet here bids us, <hi>Sow in righteousness, or righteousness it self,</hi> for we cannot carry on the Glory of God, or sincerely intend it any other way: God can and doth turn the Wickedness of Men to his Glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when he doth so, he is not beholden to us for it, and therefore the only way we ought to seek his Glory, is to adhere closely to Righteousness.</p>
            <p>When the Prophet saith, <hi>Sow righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> What is implied by Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> 
               <hi>or in righteousness,</hi> (which is all one, for some make it To, others leave out the Hebrew Particle as Redundant) He holds forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the quality of the Seed or Grain we should sow. And by Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, here is not only meant the vertue of Justice and Honesty in our dealings with Man, but it is taken in a larger sense of equal extent with Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; which includes all Acts of Piety and Devotion towards God, of Justice,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:93003:206"/>
Charity and Kindness towards Men, and what is good and comely for our selves: St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Injunction to the <hi>Philippians</hi> iv. 8. is a good Paraphrase on Sowing in Righteousness; <hi>Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, or any praise, think on these things.</hi> What things are so, must be learned from the Scriptures, the Word of God is the Rule of Righteousness, it is the very good and precious Seed which we ought to sow, and to sow in Righteousness is nothing else, but to live and do according to the Word of God, to practise what it teacheth: <hi>Qui mandata veterit in opera seminat in justitia.</hi> Jerom. <hi>Whosoever expresseth in his actions the Commands of God, soweth in Righteousness.</hi> And as we must thus look to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of what we sow, that it be Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, things agreeable to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Word of God; so we ought to take heed to the Quantity, that we do not sow sparingly, but plentifully. This some will have to be the only meaning of the Words, but there is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to refer the Expression to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:93003:206"/>
as we have done: However, this must be taken in too, for he doth not sow in Righteousness sincerely and with delight, that doth not abound therein. His Heart is not right who serveth God by halves, who doth only some few good things: But he is a truly righteous Man, who sets himself and gives all diligence to abound in the Work of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And we have all reason to do so, for<note place="margin">The Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</note> it is our Interest and Advantage. Men use to ply well what redounds to their particular Profit, what they think will certainly benefit them; and truly we are sure of this, it will fall particularly to our share. It is remarkable, that the Prophet calls the <hi>sowing righteousness, a sowing to or for our selves,</hi> as if nothing else could be reckoned so. And, indeed, Men may be frustrated of all their other Labours, but they can never be disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of this. In the things of this World, one may sow and another may reap; what one builds and plants, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther often takes possession of. Most Men labour for others. If the most busied would cast up his accounts, he should find but a very small part of his Travel and Projects to redound to himself. It is
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:93003:207"/>
not only the meanest sort of People that are to be esteemed Drudges to others; but Men of all ranks from the highest, are truly Servants of a different kind: And the more Faithful and Diligent any one is in his Station or Imployment, he becomes thereby only the more useful Servant to the rest of Mankind. He only truly lives to himself, who makes it his business to be found upright be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and to do that which is right in his sight. He that neglects this, quite neglects himself, and carries away no Profit of all his Labour under the Sun. What can the Wisest, the most Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious, and most fortunate Worldling boast of? at the best but a poor transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory enjoyment of perishing things. In that Night his Soul is taken from him, what reckoning can he make of his Barns, Goods and Store? whose are all these things? not his to be sure, and perhaps they fall into the hands of one who has little kindness for him, or his Memory. <hi>When he dieth,</hi> saith the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, <hi>he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him.</hi> And then to how little purpose has he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be made Rich, and to get the Glory of his House increased. But he
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:93003:207"/>
that is stedfast and immoveable, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abounding in the Work of the Lord, his Labour shall not be in vain, the gain shall redound to himself. What one doth in this, is, <hi>extra Fortunam,</hi> not liable to any hazard, runs not the fate of other things, a Man is sure of it. Sow Righteousness and ye shall sow to your selves, none shall come betwixt you and the blessed Fruits which is produced by that sowing.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is here added, and <hi>reap</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> Of reaping Mercy.</note> 
               <hi>in mercy.</hi> Because the <hi>Verb</hi> here is the <hi>Imperative Mood,</hi> some will have this a Command, for a farther Progress in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that good we have explained to be contained under the first Head: But this cannot be admitted, for besides the Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tology, we must put a strain'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual sense upon Reaping. Wherefore certainly in this Phrase is set forth the gracious Reward wherewith God will bless Sowing in Righteousness; Reaping follows Sowing, and is the natural effect thereof; so, who Sows in Righteousness, shall Reap in Mercy, tho' what they thus Reap, be neither the necessary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural effect of what they sow, nor yet the just desert thereof; if they merited what they Reap, it should not be called
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:93003:208"/>
Mercy: But it is so called, that they may not think what is given them to be their due. If Men would consider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their actions impartially, and lay aside all proud thoughts, they would adjudge their merits to' be small, and that little belonged to them on that account. However, all who ply Sowing in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness sincerely may look for Mercy, as the Husband-man doth for a Crop after he hath sown; nay, they may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure themselves of it, which he cannot do, they may claim it as their Privilege by virtue of the Divine Promise which can never fail. With respect to which Promise, and the undoubted certainty thereof, the Prophet bids them here <hi>Reap Mercy:</hi> Reap is Imperative, to denote the certainty of the thing, as if there were no more requisite, than to put forth the hand and take it, in which sense the Imperative is usually taken in Scripture, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> xviii. 32. They have not the promise, nor are they capable of Mercy who sow not in Righteousness. <hi>Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, shall be upon every soul of man that doth evil.</hi> Rom. ii. 9. As therefore Sowing must go before Reaping, so Sowing in Righteousness must be previous to the
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:93003:208"/>
Reaping in Mercy; this is necessary, not that we may merit, but that we may be fit objects of Mercy. And as naturally the Crop exceeds the measure of the Grain which was Sown; so the Gifts and Expressions of God's Mercy towards righteous Persons, shall infinitely exceed the Works done by them. Wherefore a <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctor hath not ill express'd it, <hi>Sow,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Do that which is good in mine eyes, and the good Reward which ye shall receive of me, shall be far greater than your good Works, as he that soweth a Bushel, hopes to reap two or more; and therefore in the Command for sowing, he useth the word Iustice; but in the promise of Reaping the word</hi> Chesed <hi>Mercy or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity, which is more than Iustice, or what in strict Iustice can be required.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Mercy which they who Sow in Righteousness shall Reap, is like God himself the Author thereof, infinite, and so cannot be express'd: We cannot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize all the ways whereby God will shew his Mercy to such Persons. It is written, <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1 Cor. ii. 9. As long before the Harvest the Husbandman
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:93003:209"/>
is refreshed with the sight and savour of his Field, so God comforteth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresheth the Souls of the righteous even in this World, and hereafter he Crowns them with unspeakable Glory, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them with eternal Life. The Light of God's Countenance even in this Life, where its beams are often intercepted, do yet afford more Joy than in the time of Harvest, when Corn, and Wine, and Oil abound with Men: And what will it do in the other World, where it shines fully and clearly, and without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and where there is nothing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the Power and Efficacy thereof: Lord! What Joy is there in the very prospect of this Harvest? How happy and blessed are they who are sure of it? What a kindness is it that we have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to throw in our poor stock into such a profitable Bank? and a Privilege to Sow, where we may Reap so much? With what Face can any refuse the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion? or what Excuse is sufficient? Have Men by their many Inventions found out any higher Felicity, than what God and his Superabundant Mercy can confer? or is there a nearer way, or more proper to this, than that which the Prophet directs to, the Sowing in
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:93003:209"/>
Righteousness? Is it better to labour for Temporal than Eternal things, for that Meat which perisheth, than that which endureth to Life everlasting! Will ye plough Wickedness, and reap Iniquity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and eat the Fruit of Lyes? that is, will ye die rather than live? This were a mad and shameful Choice; and yet one of them we must make, for there is no middle Course left us: It is certain the Wages of Sin are Death, and that there is no way to Everlasting Life, but to have our Fruit unto Holiness. <hi>Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Man soweth, that shall he also reap. He that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the spirit, shall of the spirit reap life everlasting,</hi> Gal. vi. 7.</p>
            <p>The Prophet having told them what<note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> Of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the fallow Ground.</note> they would reap, returns to exhort them to the Use of those means which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in order to it, and to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of those Duties to which reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Mercy is promised; which Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have need to be put in mind of, for ordinarily they are very slack and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; Many would be at reaping, but few set themselves to the Work and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that must go before it; they would
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:93003:210"/>
be putting in the sickle in Harvest-time, though they have not sown, nor made any Preparation for it. But those who sow not shall not reap, and that our sowing may be successful, we are bid first, <hi>break up our fallow ground,</hi> for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters make the Prophets Speech <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liptick,</hi> and will have <hi>First</hi> or <hi>After</hi> that, or some such Word to be understood.</p>
            <p>If the Ground be not prepared, sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to no Purpose; the Seed was lost that <hi>fell on stony ground, among thorns, and in the high-way.</hi> The good and precious Seed to be sown is the Word of God, our Hearts are the Ground which must receive it, and they cannot receive it till they be made <hi>honest</hi> and good, as our Saviour speaks, <hi>Luke</hi> viii. 15. and in order to this they must be prepared, Pains must be taken on them. <hi>Break up your fallow Ground.</hi> If the Husband-man did not till his Ground, cast Furrows in it and root out the Weeds thereof, he needed not sow, and would in vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Crop: So our Hearts by their natural Constitution, are like <hi>fallow ground</hi> which was never laboured, which is indisposed for receiving Seed from the Sower, and of it self brings forth only Thorns and Briars. The natural Product
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:93003:210"/>
of Mens Hearts is only Sin and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>God saw that the wickedness of Man</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note> 
               <hi>was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</hi> Naturally Mens Hearts are hard and averse to all good; <hi>The natural Man receiveth not the things</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>of the Spirit of God, for they are foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto him, neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned.</hi> But as hard and bad as they are, they may through the Grace of God be changed, and improved to the better, if due Pains be taken on them. The Evil and Naughtiness of our Hearts will not excuse us from being or doing good, tho' many pretend it. What a silly Excuse were it for an Husband-man to turn his back upon his Labour, that his Ground of it self yielded nothing but Briars and Thorns, and other Weeds? Should he not labour for all that, and by Art and Industry make it do, what of it self it cannot do? So, though our Hearts be as fallow Ground, yet let us break them up and weed them; let us by continued Care and Diligence, bear down their natural Growth, and render them sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of better things; let us pluck up the Prejudices of our Nature, throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:93003:211"/>
the choaking Cares of this Life, and break off the Course of Sin: Let us ply our Hearts continually with Prayer, Meditation on the Word, Use of our Reason, the serious Consideration of our Ways, and an Attendance on those Means and Ordinances God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and in Process of time through the Grace of God, our Hearts will be broken and changed from their natural Barrenness, to be fruitful in Holiness and good Works. This is the way to break up our fallow Ground, to make our Hearts tractable and obedient, capable of receiving and nourishing the good Seed of the Word, and unless this be done, our Hearts will be as a Wilderness barren and altogether unfruitful in good: <hi>Break up your fallow ground,</hi> says <hi>Ieremy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 4. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and sow not among Thorns.</hi> What a Folly is it to sow in a Ground overgrown with Thorns and Briars; and what can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from Men, <hi>whose hearts are as hard as an Adamant, who refuse to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zach. 7. 11.</note> 
               <hi>and pull away their Shoulder and stop their Ears, that they should not hear:</hi> As the Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> speaks? There are many Complaints now a-days against the Sower, but there is more Reason to retort them upon the Ground, I mean
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:93003:211"/>
to cast the Blame of not profiting upon the People themselves rather than the Preacher; you are oft-times indisposed, your Hearts are not duely prepar'd, therefore it is that the Word Preached hath so little effect in you. Mortifie therefore your Lusts, subdue your Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, daily cultivate your Hearts with Acts of Repentance and Contrition, and the fore mentioned Exercises of Prayer, Meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That they may be softned and fitted for the Seed of the Word, and that it may prosper and spring up and bear Fruit.</p>
            <p>Thus you see your Task, and that we<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> Of seeking the Lord.</note> may be excited with all Speed and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to go about it, and also encouraged with Assurance of Success, it is added, <hi>For it is time to seek the Lord, until he come and rain Righteousness upon you.</hi> By <hi>seeking the Lord</hi> is meant the seeking his Favour which is the Ground of all our Comfort and Happiness, or his Help and Assistance without which we labour in vain, and all we do is ineffectual: And we then seek both the one and the other, when we heartily practise the Duties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd us; for his Favour returns upon our Repentance and Obedience, and his Grace and Assistance is bestowed as we
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:93003:212"/>
labour and endeavour; <hi>he worketh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, (saith <hi>Hosea</hi>) <hi>It is time thus to seek the Lord,</hi> which implieth first a proper Season or Opportunity for it; Opportunity should be laid hold on, every thing should be taken in its time, and Men are encouraged to work and labour so long as the time of doing it is not past. The Season for sowing and breaking up is all the time of Life, while God allows the Use of Reason, the means of Grace, while he makes offers of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and calls by his Providence, it is time to seek him: <hi>Seek the Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 55. 6.</note> 
               <hi>while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near.</hi> If any have been negligent, if hitherto he has loitered and slept away his time, neither laboured nor sown, but let his Heart lie all this while fallow, that it is quite overgrown with Weeds, it is a great Fault, and calls for mourning; but it is no ground to despair nor Reason to lay aside the Thoughts of this necessary Work. Art thou sensible that thou hast been too long a beginning? Doest thou wish that thou hadst been more wise? Arise, the Day is not yet done, work while it is Day; the Season is not wholly past, lay
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:93003:212"/>
hold on it and double thy Diligence to recover mispent time; which if thou dost, it shall be yet well with thee, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common but wise Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Better late than never.</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they who wrought but one Hour had their Hire. <hi>If the wicked will turn</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 21.</note> 
               <hi>from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my Statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die, saith the Lord. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 55. 7.</note> 
               <hi>unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God and he will abundantly pardon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But secondly, by saying it is time, the Prophet lays before them, that it is full time, and so not to be let slip; it is now time, but it will not be always so, it is time, but this time is ever run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and will once be at an end, and therefore Delays are dangerous. It is indeed time yet, but not to sleep and stand loitering; it is high time to awake out of Sleep, to gird up our Loins, and to set about our Work lest the Night come in which no Man can work. It is the great Folly of many, that they think they have Times and Seasons in their
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:93003:213"/>
own hand, at least they act as if it were so: But we neither have always Time and Opportunity, nor can we always Command Grace to use it aright, and therefore should take it when it may be had and fear to deferr and put it off. Sometimes Men come to that, that they can neither seek nor work, have neither Strength of Body or Mind, no Use of any Faculty so much as to desire what is good for them? Sometimes they seek and find no Acceptance, desire and endeavour, but have no Success. It is hard to tell peremptorily the precise time when it is so with any, but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture forewarns us of this, and bids us fear it. <hi>When you spread forth your hands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 1. 15.</note> 
               <hi>I will hide my face from you, yea when you make many prayers I will not hear. I will</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 11. 11.</note> 
               <hi>bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape, and though they shall cry I will not hearken unto them. They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the Lord, but they shall not find him, he hath withdrawn himself from them.</hi> Wherefore as the Apostle enjoins, <hi>Let us</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>exhort one another daily, while it is called to day, lest any of you be hardned with the deceitfulness of sin.</hi> You that are stricken in Age, will, I hope, readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:93003:213"/>
That it is time (if ever) for you to seek the Lord, and mind the business of your Salvation: for your time is near spent, your Sun is ready to set, and your Day is almost at an end. The Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man useth to be busie when the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is almost at a close, especially if at first he has loitered and been idle. And you that are young have no less Reason to fall to work quickly, for though by the Course of Nature you may live a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable time; yet you know that Course may and has been often interrupted, and none knows how soon this may befall him. Wherefore let neither young nor old give Sleep to their Eyes, or Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to their Eye-lids; but let both young and old seek and labour with all Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. <hi>To day, saith the Holy Ghost, if ye will hear, harden not your hearts.</hi> But to go on;</p>
            <p>In the last place, we have here an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>Seek,</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>till he come,</hi> which requires Constancy in seeking. <hi>There is need of patience to them that have</hi>

               <hi>done the will of God, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the promise.</hi> It is childish and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable Peevishness, to fret because we are not presently answered, to desist from our Work, because we do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly reap the Fruit thereof. They make too great haste to their Doom, who conclude themselves forsaken and reprobate, because presently they find not God's Presence and the gracious To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens thereof. What is delayed is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, God knoweth his Hour, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth till it come, and so should we; he putteth off, to try our Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, to exercise our Patience, to quicken our Desires; <hi>Be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the Lord.

            <p>Now what is the Lord to do when he comes? <hi>He will</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>rain Righteousness upon you.</hi> The Allusion to Husbandry is still continued, all know how necessary Rain is to the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, without it he labours and sows to no Purpose: But if the Heavens rain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, his Labours prosper, he sees the Fruit thereof, eats and is satisfied. The Dew of Heaven is no less necessary to our spiritual Husbandry, it also depends entirely on the Blessing of God, without that all our labour is in vain. <hi>Without me</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>ye can do nothing.</hi> But<note place="margin">John 15.</note> as God giveth Rain and Snow from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to water the Earth, to make it bring forth and bud, that it may give Seed to the Sower, and Bread to the Eater, so in spiritual Blessings he will not be wanting to those who are not wanting to themselves.

            <p>But secondly, Some understand these Words of Christ, and not without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for he that cometh, or is to come, and will come, are his frequent Titles in the Scripture. St. <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> asked if he was the Christ under this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:93003:216"/>
               <hi>Mat.</hi> xi. 3. And the main end <hi>of his coming was to teach and</hi> give Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. He is called the <hi>Lord our Righteousness.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 23. 6.</note> Who sheweth the way of Righteousness, who worketh it in us, and who, by the Merits of his own Righteousness hath obtained for all true Believers, that their honest and sincere, tho' imperfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness should be accepted of God, as perfect, and that they should be dealt with by him, as if they were perfectly and compleatly righteous. As it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Old, and applied by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in the New Testament, <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness,</hi> and <hi>he was made sin,</hi> or a Sin offering, <hi>for us that we might be made the righteousness of God in him;</hi> that is, that we heartily believing in him, and as Believers heartily and sincerely obeying of him, might be reputed as perfectly righteous in the Eyes of God, through the Merits of his Blood, who was perfectly and compleatly righteous, without spot or blemish. Here then is a Promise of Christ, and the Benefits of him, as a Saviour, that they who are truly sanctified with inherent Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, have it imputed to them through the Merits of Christ for perfect and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:93003:217"/>
compleat Righteousness, tho' it is not so, but defective and short of that absolute Perfection which the Law requires; as it is written, <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? It is God that justifieth: Who is he that condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? It is Christ that died, yea, rather that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fear not little flock, it is your Father's will to give you a Kingdom.</hi> A Kingdom of more Glory than all the Kingdoms of the World, and it is a Kingdom which shall never end. This is the Reward which God will certainly bestow on his righteous Servants and Children; of which Reward some make the raining Righteousness in the Text a Promise; for they take Righteousness to be the Reward of it, as in the following Verse Iniquity is taken for the Punishment thereof. But whether that be the main intent of the Words, certainly it may be comprehended in them, for the Fruits and Effects of Righteousness are always given where it self is given. Holiness and the glorious Reward of it, cannot be disjoined; so that he who has the one, is sure of the other. The Wicked
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:93003:217"/>
cannot inherit Glory, nor can the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous be excluded. Instead therefore of perplexing our selves, what shall come of us, whether we shall go to Heaven, let us chearfully do our Duty, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily endeavour to be righteous in the sight of God, for hereby we may be assured of eternal Life. The one is the Earnest and Pledge of the other.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have handled and applied<note place="margin">
                  <hi>VII.</hi> An Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</note> the Text, with a respect to Mens private and personal state. But as was said in the beginning, the Prophet delivered this Advice, with a regard to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick state of his People, both Civil and Ecclesiastick: And so it proposes the true Way and Method, of preventing and removing publick Calamities and Disasters from Church and State; which is, to put away Sin and Wickedness, and to encourage and promote Piety and Godliness. As the Prophet forewarns them of very sad and heavy Judgments, so all along he plainly inculcates the cause thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Pride and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness, the neglect of God and of his Worship, and a gross contempt of, and disobedience to his Righteous Laws. For this cause he told them they were to be so exemplarily punished, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:93003:218"/>
could save them from utter Ruin, or procure the lengthning of their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, but the ceasing from Sin, and the doing that which is right in the sight of God. Both the Preservation and Ruin of Kingdoms and publick States is of God, and he is moved to the one or the other, according as they are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous or wicked: For, as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Righteousness exalteth a Nation, but sin is</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 34.</note> 
               <hi>a reproach to any people;</hi> which Maxim of the Wise Man is clearly exemplified in Sacred History, and was wisely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in relation to the <hi>Iews,</hi> in the person of <hi>Achior,</hi> the Captain of the Sons of <hi>Ammon;</hi> for in the Speech which he is said to have made to <hi>Olofernes,</hi> he told him, That <hi>whilest they sinned not before their God, they prospered, because the God that hateth iniquity was with them; but when they departed from the way which he appointed them, they were destroyed in many sore Battels, and were led Captives into a Land that was not theirs, and the Temple of their God was cast to the Ground, and their Cities were taken by the Enemies.</hi> From which wise Observation he concluded, as wisely, his Advice to the same <hi>Olofernes: Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Lord and Governour, if there be</hi>

               <hi>any Errour in this People, and they sin against their God, let us consider that this shall be their ruin, and let us go up and we shall overcome them. But if there be no iniquity in their Nation, let my Lord pass by, lest their Lord defend them, and their God be for them, and we become a reproach before all the world.</hi> Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness<note place="margin">Judith 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.</note> is the greatest Security of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is the strongest Bond of Union amongst themselves, and will defend the Frontiers better than Garisons or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies can do: For it secureth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Almighty, who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the strongest and most numerous Forces, and <hi>who when a man's ways please the Lord, maketh his enemies to be at peace with him.</hi> If therefore we have any concernment for the Church and State whereof we are Members, if we would have God to do good to our <hi>Zion,</hi> and to <hi>build up the walls of our Ierusalem;</hi> if we would have him to settle Peace within their Walls, and Prosperity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Palaces, let every one of us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the Evil of our ways; let us seek God with all our heart, retrieve true Piety, and true Religion, and by the works of real Righteousness study to please God. If we do this, then his

Heart will be towards us, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light will be in us; then we shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Pleasant Vineyard, which he will fence and plant, out of which he will gather the Stones, and in which he will build a Tower for himself; he will cherish our Church and State, and do all that can be desired for their Beauty Order and Peace. But if instead of the pleasant Grapes of Righteousness, we yield the sowre Grapes of Iniquity; if instead of Judgment God see Oppression; if instead of Righteousness he hear a cry; if instead of the sweet smelling savour of a Christian Conversation, we send forth the noisom and stinking scent of Sin and Impiety, Ungodliness and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lusts, then he will utterly abandon us: I will tell you what he will then do to his Vineyard, <hi>I will, saith the Lord, take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up: and break the wall thereof and it shall be trodden down. And I will lay it waste: It shall not be pruned nor digged, but there shall come up briars and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it,</hi> Isa. v. 5. Our Land will always be made to mourn so long as Sin and Iniquity abound in it: Publick Peace and Prosperity cannot be

Let us therefore seek the Lord, and by fervent and effectual Prayers beseech him to give Repentance unto all People, and to Rain down true Righteousness upon all Ranks and Orders of Men, that it may be well with every one of us, and with the Land we live in: For then our case should be happy, and then both <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> would have reason to rejoice, for the Lord then would <hi>streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the bars of their gates, he would bless the people within them, make peace in their borders, and fill them with the finest of the wheat.</hi> Now unto him that is able to do this for us, unto the King Eternal, Immortal, Invisible, the only Wise God, be Honour and Glory for ever and ever.</p>

               <q>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Iudah saw his wound: then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to King Iareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.</q>
               <q>For I will be unto Ephraim as a Lion, and as a young Lion to the house of Iudah: I, even I will tear and go away: I will take away and none shall rescue him.</q>
               <q>I will go and return unto my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: In their affliction they will seek me early.</q>

               <hi>EPHRAIM</hi> is put here for the<note place="margin">An Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Text.</note> whole Ten Tribes, who revolted from the House of <hi>David,</hi> and embodied themselves into a distinct Kingdom. Under <hi>Iudah,</hi> is here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:93003:220"/>
also the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin;</hi> which two Tribes, as they kept close in Allegiance, and Expressions of Loyalty to their lawful King, so they made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Serving the One true God, in that way, and after that manner prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by his Word.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Sickness of Ephraim,</hi> and the <hi>Wounds of Iudah,</hi> is meant those Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Calamities which God sent upon the several States, because of their Sins and Transgressions: And by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this Prophesie, and the History of these several Nations, we find the Judgments they were visited with, and which are here especially pointed at, to have been a withdrawing the Necessaries and Comforts of Life, Factions and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions within, and Oppressions from Neighbours without.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Ephraim</hi> going to the <hi>Assyrian,</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> sending to King <hi>Iareb;</hi> The same thing is understood by all Interpreters, for they make <hi>Iareb</hi> either the proper Name of the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> then reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or an Appellative title given to all the Kings of that Nation, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was the title of the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Coesar</hi> or <hi>Augustus</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; or it is thought to be the Name
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:93003:221"/>
of a City in <hi>Assyria,</hi> where the Kings resided; and that he is called <hi>King Iareb,</hi> because he lived there; or finally, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Etymology of the word, some will have the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> so called, because the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Israelites</hi> expected he should have vindicated and defended them; wherefore the Translators of the Bible have put into the Margin, <hi>Or to the King that should Plead.</hi> But which soever of these ways be taken, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that <hi>Assyria</hi> is meant, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect is had to what we read 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xv. 19. xvi. 17. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxviii. 16. Where we see how both <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a League with <hi>Assyria,</hi> and studied by Money and Presents, both to procure his own Peace, and also Assistance to curb and restrain others who infested them.</p>
            <p>And when it is said, <hi>he could not heal you, nor cure you,</hi> thereby it is represented how ineffectual this Method was for their relief, for they were not put in a better state by his means, so far from that, that even he from whom they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Ease, became an Instrument of more Mischief and Trouble unto them; as the Sacred History plainly shews. The reason hereof is given in the <hi>14th.</hi> Verse,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:93003:221"/>
to wit, because God <hi>was angry with them</hi> and resolved to <hi>punish them,</hi> he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be <hi>as a Lion to Ephraim, and as a young Lion to Iudah, to tear them, and take them away;</hi> That is, as these Beasts are strong to catch their prey, and when they have set upon it do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it, and it is in vain to think to get it safe out of their clutches, so God being incensed, he will shew himself able and strong to punish those who had done it: And it was a most foolish thing to think by Men, or any other Means, to prevent the Mischief he certainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: It was like the offering to take back a prey from the Jaws of a hungry and raging Lion. Who can rescue out of his Hands? When he declares War, who can make Peace? Men may fight with Men, but it is in vain to strive against God, or to think that any Means or Projects will prosper where he is the Enemy. And as these Savage Beasts, when they have catch'd their prey and eaten it up, use to retire to their Dens and Coverts and lurk there; so in allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to this, God saith in the last Verse, he <hi>will return to his place;</hi> that is as it were shut himself up in Heaven, that the Earth should no more feel his gracious
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:93003:222"/>
Presence, or the comfortable Effects thereof. He would so leave them and forsake them, by withdrawing the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Expressions of his Providence, as that they should be tempted to think he had confined himself to Heaven, and would no more visit the Earth, nor the Children of Men. But all this God did not so much out of Wrath, and for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, as out of Love, that he might at last save them, and make them Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his great goodness. They were so perverse as to resist his gentle Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, so stubborn as not to be wrought upon by his former Acts of Kindness, that he was provoked and (if it were proper to speak so of the Almighty) constrained to take up the Rod, and to deal with them thus roughly and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely. But still his intent was, not to cut them off utterly from him, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bring them into a stricter Union with him afterwards: He let his anger out now upon them, that they might afterwards be made capable of his Love, to wit, when they became sensible of their Sin and Folly, in forsaking the Commands of God, and resolved to seek him seriously in all time coming; This, saith he, I will do, <hi>till they</hi>
               <pb n="421" facs="tcp:93003:222"/>
               <hi>acknowledge their offence and seek my face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as God had this end before him in their Punishment, so there is here a gracious intimation, that the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments laid upon them should be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual for this purpose; <hi>In their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions they will seek me early,</hi> which words are not so much a Prediction of what probably they would do, as a Promise what he would then by his Grace make them do: Afflictions have, indeed, some natural tendency to soften Men, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them tractable and obedient, but then only this is truly effectuated, when God sanctifieth Afflictions, and giveth his Grace with them; And when Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions produce this, when People are so happy as to be converted by them, then God layeth aside all Quarrels, he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth off his anger, and putteth on Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of Love and Compassion; he hideth his Face while Men continue in their Sins and Transgressions: All the time they are going astray from God, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires within his Place, as is here said; But when they begin to acknowledge their Offences, and in all sincerity seek his Face, then he comes forth of his Place, and lifts the light of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:93003:223"/>
upon them, and speaks comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably unto them; his <hi>going forth is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared as the Morning,</hi> and then he <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the Earth,</hi> which both refresheth it, and maketh it fruitful.</p>
            <p>Thus I have explained the words, and given you the genuine Scope and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of them. In the next place, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to propose plainly such Instructions as they afford; and as I judge them both useful and seasonable; so I pray God, they may be candidly heard, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, seriously considered, and carefully observed.</p>
            <p>First then, We may read and discern<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> Sin is the Cause and Occasion of all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils which befall either private Persons or publick States.</note> here the Cause and Occasion of all the Evils and Mischief, which come either upon private Persons, or on publick States, <hi>viz.</hi> SIN. This is the bitter Root which shoots out all kind of Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. If Man had not known Sin, he would never have felt Punishment. We should never have been made to taste the bitter Fruits of Trouble, if Sin had not been planted in our Natures, and if it did not shoot out and mingle with our Life and Actions. It's to this, we must ascribe all the Diseases which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest both particular Persons and publick
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:93003:223"/>
States, and where Sin is cherished and doth abound, we may certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that Trouble and Calamity will follow; for the one is the necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of the other; <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi>'s <hi>Wounds</hi> proceeded from their Sins; as appears both by the Text and Context, they first suffered the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Humour of Sin to creep into their Veins, and to ferment there; and thence it was that they drooped and languished, and felt so much Pain and Sorrow. Our first Parents no sooner tasted the forbidden Fruit, but they were filled with Shame and Confusion: which are the inseparable Effects of Sin. The Body cannot but be sick and pained which is disordered, disjointed, and which suffers Convulsive Motions; no more can they who are infected with Sin be without Grief and Anguish. Therefore <hi>Eliphaz</hi> said truly, <hi>That the wicked man travaileth with pain all his days;</hi> this is but what is agreeable to the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Constitution. And besides the Misery and Trouble which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally interwoven into the very Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Sin, it makes one liable to the Wrath and Anger of Almighty God, it necessarily draws down his Displeasure:
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:93003:224"/>
And who will not be Sick and Wounded who groans under the pressure of God's Wrath. As the light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance puts more Gladness into a Man's Heart, than when Corn, Wine and Oil doth abound. So the Abstraction of his Favour is more grievous than the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing Health, and all outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and Conveniences; but because Men are a little dull to perceive this, therefore God teaches them how mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable it is to be without his Favour, by depriving them of outward Comforts, and what they apprehend to be the ground and matter of their Happiness: His Favour is the foundation of all Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and the cause of all the Good we enjoy; and his Displeasure is ever atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with outward Punishments. No sooner did <hi>Adam</hi> offend God, but he was cast out of <hi>Paradise;</hi> and had the Earth cursed for his sake; and as this is the Original of these common Calamities, which our life is liable to while in this World; so whoever tread the footsteps of these common Parents, and imitate them in their disobedience to God, shall share of their lot, and not go unpunished; <hi>for the face of the Lord is against them</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 34. 16.</note> 
               <hi>that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of</hi>
               <pb n="425" facs="tcp:93003:224"/>
               <hi>them from the earth. Lo, they that are</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 73. 27.</note> 
               <hi>far from thee shall perish, thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</hi> We must not indeed conclude them the greatest Sinners who meet with the greatest outward Trouble and Affliction in this World. Our Saviour hath taught us the contrary: And the History and Example of <hi>Iob</hi> is a clear proof that it is not so: But certainly God is so just, as never to inflict Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but where there have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Faults to call for it: And as some of the best of Men have had the greatest share of Troubles and Affliction; so the best have been guilty of Sin, and the least measure of this guilt is sufficient to justifie the greatest measure of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which can be inflicted upon any in this World: and if some of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Sinners have escaped exemplary Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment here, it is because God reserves them to a more sad and heavy Doom hereafter.</p>
            <p>But however it be with particular Persons, it is certain in the general that Sin offends God, and never goes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished; and however particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may escape exemplary Punishment in this Life; yet Nations, Kingdoms,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:93003:225"/>
and publick Societies are always visibly punished in this World, when they are corrupted and defiled with Sin. Crosses and Afflictions have been laid upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Persons, sometimes more for trial than for Punishment: But general Judgments and Calamities never came upon a Nation or People, till they were first ushered in by Sin and Iniquity; nor is it possible to give one instance of the escape of any Nation where Sin and Iniquity abounded. God doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forbear till the Cup of their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities be full, as he said of the <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites;</hi> but when People have filled up the Cup of their Iniquities, then God is ever sure to make them drink of the Cup of his Wrath. Nor did number, or multitude, or greatness, or splendor ever prevail with God for an Act of Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, where the continuance and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Sin cried for Judgment, as may be evidenced in the old World, in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Nineveh</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> and several others which may be drawn from Sacred and Prophane History. Nay, near Alliance and Relation to himself never made any be spared, as appears from this instance of the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Israelites.</hi>
               <pb n="427" facs="tcp:93003:225"/>
Indeed God hath many Favours in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness to bestow upon his People, but they are such, as are worthy of his holy Nature, but to grant them an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in Sin, is inconsistent with his essential Holiness, and therefore the most honourable Relation of being the peculiar People of God, as all truly Catholick Churches are, is so far from securing of them against his Displeasure, that it gives his People greater Cause to expect Judgments when they are guilty of Sin: As we may learn from these Words, spoken by the Prophet <hi>Amos, You have</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amos 3. 2.</note> 
               <hi>I known of all the Families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Judgments and Calamities, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Nation, and impending over it, are certain Declarations that Sin and Iniquity abound in it: And the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sin and Iniquity, is a certain Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nostick that the Judgments of God are not far off. These things mutually prove one another: If therefore we have Reason to fear publick Calamities, we have as much Reason to conclude that we are great Sinners; if we see the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Body, whereof we are Members, sick and wounded, we may easily guess
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:93003:226"/>
the Cause of its Distemper; and if we discern a general Corruption and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of Manners, throughout the Kingdom, and among all Ranks, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Fore-sight we may foretell a Visitation of the Divine Judgments. If the general Pulse of the Nation beats Vice and Sin, as it is no great wonder we feel inward Pangs and Throws; so it needs no great Skill, only a little Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Word of God, and the general Course of his Providence, to declare that the Body will be seized with sore and dangerous Fits, that it will be sadly toss'd and shaken.</p>
            <q>Sequitur superbos semper à tergo Deus.</q>
            <p>Secondly, we may observe hence,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are insensible of the Cause of their Evils.</note> how dull generally Men are in taking up the Cause of their Maladies and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers. They easily perceive the Evils which touch them, but are not so soon sensible of the Cause and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which make them groan longer under the Distemper. <hi>Ephraim</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Sickness, <hi>Iudah</hi> felt his Wound; their Senses taught them both these, but they had not Understanding enough to discover, whence these things came;
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:93003:226"/>
they had no Sense of their Sins and Transgressions, and were slow in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the Reason they were so pinched and infested, was because they sinned and would not frame their Doings to turn unto their God. And it is just so with the Generality of the World at this time. Men have sense enough to perceive the outward Evils that are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, but scarce any to discover the Hand which inflicts them, or the Cause which procures it. Touch a Man in his Body, in his Fortune, or in any thing dear unto him, he will be quickly sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of it, and ready enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain: But there be few so wise, as to acknowledge that the Root of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is in themselves. People ordinarily throw all the Blame of their Trouble from off themselves upon other external things; he that is sick finds fault with his Diet, or his riding and travelling unseasonably, and in unwholsome Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he that is wronged and oppressed, chargeth and accuseth such and such Persons, as perhaps are the immediate Instruments thereof; in times of publick Calamity and Disasters, all the Talk is, how they began, and after what manner they proceeded; if the Plague enter a
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:93003:227"/>
Place, the Inhabitants curiously enquire about the first Person who brought it in; if Fire take hold of a City, the Discourse is about the small Occasion of its beginning, and the Unwariness of the Servant who kindled it. Statesmen and Politicians resolve Wars, civil Broils, and Factions, Oppressions, and other things of the like Nature, into Political Causes: Philosophical Heads exercise their Wits in finding out natural Reasons of Famine, Pestilence, immoderate Drought, excessive Rains, and other such Judgments, according to the uncertain Hypothesis of some vain System they have imbib'd. And thus Mens Thoughts are carried off, from the serious Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the true, that is, the moral and meritorious Cause of all the Evils that are upon them. They reflect not upon their own Sins, nor the Sins of the Land they live in. They say not with <hi>David, Thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore, there is no soundness in my flesh, because of thine</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 38. 2.</note> 
               <hi>anger; neither is there any rest in my bones, because of my sin. For mine iniquities are gone over mine head, as an heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.</hi> It's long before People come to lay to Heart, that the
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:93003:227"/>
Evils which are upon them, are because <hi>the Lord hath a controversie with the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the land; because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land; that it is by reason of swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting adultery, and other abominations, that the land is made to mourn.</hi> To take only Notice of the immediate Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Trouble, without enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into this chief Cause thereof, is just but to act like Children, and to do what the common Rabble do at publick Executions, who only consider how the condemned Person is led to the Scaffold, and after what manner the Executioner proceeds to put him to Death, never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the Sentence of the Judge, nor the Transgression of the Law, which yet ought chiefly to be considered. <hi>Hear ye therefore the Rod, and him who hath appointed it;</hi> as ye feel the Evils which are laid upon you, so call to mind from whom they come, and for what Cause they are sent, otherways Ease and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is not to be expected. It's necessary in order to the removing of bodily Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, that there be first a Knowledge of the Nature and Cause of the Disease, without this there can be no Cure, all
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:93003:228"/>
Applications are ineffectual; even so the first step to remove the Wrath of God, and the sad Effects of it, is to find out those Sins and Transgressions which have occasioned it: till this be done, it's in vain to struggle, and to use Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for the saving our selves; it is but as the common Proverb is, <hi>a striving against a stream, which is too strong for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I am brought to a third Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Custom of Mankind is, to run to second Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, before they address to God.</note> and it is this, <hi>That when God is visiting with his Iudgments, people are seldom so wise, as to address themselves first to God; but they ordinarily in the first Place, have recourse to second Causes and humane Endeavours, which tends but to their greater ruine and mischief. Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> here, instead of making Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to God, sent to the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> and addressed to King <hi>Iareb.</hi> So when Sickness comes upon Men, the Physician is sent for, and he is required to use his Skill, and to apply his Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and with the Woman in the Gospel, who had the bloody Issue, they seek not out for Christ, till they have spent much upon the Physicians to no purpose, and that their Art and Skill hath been quite baffled. When Men are opprest and born down, all their Thoughts are, how
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:93003:228"/>
to get an Interest in some great Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage; and ingage him to espouse their Cause, and thereby counter-balance the Power of the Person that oppresses them. In a word, every one considers the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and likeliest Method and Means, of procuring to themselves Ease and Relief; and when they have discovered the same, they are wholly bent on it; and the Eagerness of Men to be saved by those means, which their own Prudence has suggested, keeps them from exercising that Trust and Dependance on God which is necessary. Men have not Faith enough ordinarily to commit their cause entirely to God, and they walk so much by Sight, that they can put little Trust, where they see no visible Means; and because ordinarily God works by ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal means, and has established in the World a settled Order, and a Series of Causes, for producing certain Effects, they too much imagine that these things work necessarily, and that they cannot be disappointed of the Effects, while they make use of the Means and Causes which ordinarily produce them: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all things depend upon the Blessing of God, and only work and take effect as he is pleased to give the Word unto

them. I do not say that prudent Means and Methods should be neglected, or that Men should expect Deliverances miraculously when these other may take Place: But that in seeking to save our selves from any Danger or Judgment, we ought to apply our selves to God, and as we ought never to use any means for our safety, but what is lawful; so in the Use of the most lawful and most proper means, we ought to depend en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon God for the Success, else we may expect these Means to be blast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or what is worse to turn to our Hurt and greater Damage: As we see here befel the <hi>Israelites,</hi> for the King of <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> whom they sent to, not only could not heal them and cure them, but he brought upon them more Trouble and Mischief than what they sought him to prevent. <hi>Cursed is the Man that</hi>

and Devils, and whatever infests Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, are all at God's Command and under his Power: They break not out till he give the word; they are his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers sent forth to execute his Pleasure: And as they go when they are sent, so they will not retire till he call them back. It's both Folly and Treachery to tamper with the Officers and Soldiers of the King, without seeking to satisfie the King himself. If People be at War with some mighty King, they cannot expect to be freed from the Invasion of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by Land, or from the pilfering and robbing of his Pirates by Sea: Peace should be first sought with the King himself, and then these other Molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will cease of their own accord. It was wisely as well as devoutly done by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he received the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Letter of <hi>Rabshakeh,</hi> he went to the House of the Lord, and spread it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and prayed; he first tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to secure God's Favour, knowing that if he found Acceptance with him, <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shakeh</hi> could not hurt him, and that all his Brags and Boasts would prove but empty puffs, which made a great noise, but could do him no harm. There is certainly no Security, but in the Favour

               <hi>of God;</hi> And let none Pride themselves, that whatever fall out they have this, and the other thing to lean to, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account think themselves safe enough; for if they lean not to God, and make not him their Friend, all their other props will fail; and they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive but the surer and the greater fall, the more they have trusted to them. <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord, ye scornful</hi>

curing them; what remains then, but that we presently with all possible care and speed, look to our selves, and take that course which is absolutely necessary<note place="margin">To private Persons.</note> for our safety. If there be any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Persons here, groaning under the weight of any trouble, diseased in Body, or distressed in Fortune, or any other ways afflicted; Let me beseech them, as they wish their own well, to search freely their ways, and to labour to find out that accursed thing which they are guilty of, and which provokes God's Anger against them: And when they have found their guilt, let me also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech them not to hide the same, by excusing and extenuating it; but to make an humble and ingenuous Confession un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and to testifie an unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, by a sincere care to bring forth the fruits <hi>meet for Repentance;</hi> Let them rectifie what they have done amiss, and make an amends for their past Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, by an exact Diligence hereafter to keep all the Commandments of God: Which if they do, I may assure them that God will no longer hide his Face and Favour from them; he will no more frown, but smile, and give them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable words, that they may be made

            <p>In the next place, I would make Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,<note place="margin">To the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick state of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to the <hi>publick State of this Nation</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> whereof we are Members, and in whose welfare Religion and Interest oblige us to be concerned. I think it needs surprize none, if I say, <hi>That God is angry with us,</hi> and that <hi>his judgments are hanging over these Lands,</hi> for who is so blind as not to see it? The present bad <hi>Harvest</hi> is one instance: the Evil threatned in the Tenth Verse, we may say, is literally like to be inflicted upon us, <hi>He is pouring down his wrath upon us by water;</hi> which threatens to wash away the Food both of Man and Beast. What other Calamities are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending either on Church or State, I leave to the Consideration of wise Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. But without danger, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of indiscretion, I may bid you read the <hi>Sins of the Land,</hi> and by that foresee what is to be feared. It would be no great stretch, tho' I should offer to draw a Parallel betwixt the Sins that abound amongst us, and those of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> complained of in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; and would one charge the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ranks and Orders amongst us, with
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:93003:233"/>
the same Faults our Prophet lays upon the <hi>Priests,</hi> the <hi>Rulers,</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of his time, no great Injury would be done to Truth: But such an unusual freedom, perhaps would not be well taken, especially from a Stranger. But certainly it is a Kindness to give warning of a common Danger, and it's the Duty of all to provide for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Safety. Tho' we would flatter our selves, it would not go better with us. Was <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> punished because they would not frame their doings to turn unto the Lord, and do we think to Escape? If we imitate their Sins, is there not reason to fear a being made to share in the like Judgments? Is God arisen to Judgment? Is he going through the World with the Rod of his Wrath in his hand, visiting Nations for their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and do we think that we shall not have our turn? That he will pass by us, when we are as guilty as any other? No, so long as Sin thus continues and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses amongst us, it will never be well with us; our state shall still move from evil to worse. If then we would either prevent the Evils which are yet a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or heal the Wounds already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, let us join our Endeavours to stop
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:93003:233"/>
the Current of Sin and Iniquity, and to cleanse the Land of the Abominations that are amongst us. It avails little to apply external Plaisters while the Arrow's Head sticks in the Wound. In this, and the former Ages, the People of these Lands have been ever crying out of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, but they have had little of the Spirit of Discerning, to find out the great Cause and Ground of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Sins and Transgressions against God; For which, if they had heartily grieved, they had never had so much matter of making other Complaints. In our Fathers days, all the Fault was laid upon the Government, and Governours in Church and State, which through the instigation of Factious and Seditious Men, made People restless until they had overturned the Government, and thrust the chief Ruler, and perhaps the best of Men, not only from his Throne, but out of the World in a most barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous manner: But as this increased their Guilt, so it did not heal their Sores, nor ease their Pain; they rather felt more smart and grief, which disposed them to <hi>seek again unto David their King.</hi> And if together with that, the People had seriously sought the Lord also, all had
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:93003:234"/>
been well. But alas, that is yet to do! whatever Change and Revolution we have suffered, there has never been cordial Endeavours, to introduce that best and most desirable Change from Vice to Vertue, from Sin to Holiness and Godliness. Blessed be God there has been a Reformation in our Doctrine, and our Worship has been rectified and purged from the Superstition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry which had crept into it, through the Ignorance and unwariness of Men: But to our shame it must be said, that our Practice and Conversation is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but continues much the same, and perhaps in some things worse than what was before that other happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Doctrine and Worship came in. There was certainly reason to descry and run down the Hypocrisie and forms of Godliness fashionable in the late times, but it had been more commendable to have endeavoured with greater Vigour to set up the Life and Power thereof. And would to God we were at last sensible of our Errour and Omission, and convinced that hitherto we have very unskilfully set about the curing our Maladies. O that all who profess the same Truth, would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:93003:234"/>
to lay aside all other Contests, and to contend together for maintaining the Purity of the Faith, and joyning therewith the Purity of Life and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. If we would thus by true Piety, and sincere Obedience return unto the Lord, he would return unto us, and put us in a happy and glorious state; as <hi>he hath torn,</hi> so <hi>he would heal us;</hi> as <hi>he hath smitten,</hi> so <hi>he will bind us up, that we might live joyfully in his sight.</hi> But if this be neglected or delayed, and if instead of this we take Methods and Devices of our own for saving our selves. I dare not say what is to be feared, Judgments of all sorts we may expect to be visited in our worldly Concerns; and those two sadder Calamities which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Amos</hi> viii. 11. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> ii. 11, 12. may be looked for, which God avert; <hi>Plead with your mother, plead,</hi> saith God by this Prophet, <hi>for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband; let her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts, lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</hi> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches.</p>

            <p>THE Prophet speaks here in the<note place="margin">The Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Scope and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Text.</note> Name of the Church, and with respect to her present Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and what was shortly to befall her. Her present Condition was very
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:93003:235"/>
sad and lamentable, if you consider her inward State, there was no Health nor Soundness in her, but much Disorder, Confusion, and Corruption, as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of throughout the whole Book; but which is expresly declared and set forth in this Chapter, from the First to the Sixth Verse. This Sickness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Distemper could not be without grievous Pangs and Convulsive Fits: But besides, they were lying under sad pressures from without; the <hi>Assyrians</hi> oppressed them, and by frequent inroads, wasted their Wealth, and made great Devastations of their Country: The Ten Tribes were already carried Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and the Captivity of the other Two, together with the destruction of the glorious Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> were approaching. The Prophet being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of what had already happened, and foreseeing by the Spirit what was to come, he doth here, in the Name of the Church obviate those Misconstructions Men would be ready to put on this her deplorable Condition; and also instruct us how it was to be received and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. The <hi>Idumeans, Chaldeans,</hi> and <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and other Enemies without, who envied the former Prosperity of
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:93003:236"/>
               <hi>Israel,</hi> were glad at these Disasters and Calamities which befell them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced at their Misery; they took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to mock them, saying, <hi>Where is now the God in whom they trusted,</hi> who had saved them heretofore, and done so many great things for them in <hi>Egypt?</hi> Thus in stead of <hi>fearing God,</hi> and <hi>trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at his Iudgments</hi> he had inflicted on his own People for their Sins, they made them matter of prophane Mirth and Laughter; and not understanding the Wisdom and Justice of his Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, they even accused God himself, and darted up Blasphemous Speeches towards Heaven. But the Prophet bids them here <hi>be sober,</hi> and adviseth them <hi>to moderate their mirth,</hi> and to <hi>lay aside their prophane and insulting humour:</hi> for things would not always be at this pass, God would not always deal so roughly and harshly with them; Experience taught them not to despair, but to hope for the recovery of a better state: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice not against me, O mine enemy;</hi> as if he had said, <q>Make not our Calamities and Disasters the subject of your Mirth and Laughter, which should rather strike you with Dread and Fear, for if we the peculiar People of God,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:93003:236"/>
whom he had chosen for himself, have suffered such things because we sinned against him, what may ye expect who were never in Covenant with him, and who have always provoked him? Neither insult over us as if we were utterly and eternally ruined, and that it were impossible for us ever to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, so as to deserve any regard from you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Common Humanity should teach Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to pity one another, and to have Compassion on the Miserable: And if ye consult Experience, it will shew that all Persons, and all things under the Sun are liable to changes; that there is none so exalted, but he may be abased, nor any so low, but he may be exalted:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Nemo confidat nimium secundis,</l>
               <l>Nemo desperet meliora lapsus.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>None can secure his State, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the most Happy and prosperous ought not to brag; nor should the most abject and miserable despond and give over hope. None stands so secure but he may catch a fall, nor is any fallen so low, but God by his Providence is able to raise him up again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="450" facs="tcp:93003:237"/>And as for me (to go on with the Prophets words) <hi>when I fall I shall rise,</hi> or as it may be rendred, <hi>though I fall I shall arise.</hi> As if he had said, <q>Think not my case desperate, or that I have so fallen that I cannot recover; I am not destitute of Hope, for as low and miserable as I am at present, my God abideth still, who is Almighty to save, whose Hand is strong and always ready to relieve the distressed. 'Tis true, he is at present angry with me, but his anger will not last always, he doth not cast off for ever; His Mercy is everlasting, and I know his Promise cannot fail, which is, <hi>If they break my Statutes and keep not my Commandments, then will I visit their Transgression with the Rod and their Iniquity with Stripes, nevertheless my loving kindness will I not take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.</hi> I have had often experience of this kind dealing of his, <hi>I have fallen and I have risen again.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis so in the Original, and though there be nothing more ordinary than the promiscuous using the <hi>Preterite</hi> and <hi>Future Tenses,</hi> so that our Translators might very well render it here in the
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:93003:237"/>
Future, yet some render it, <hi>I have fallen, I have risen,</hi> as if the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, or the Prophet in her Name, had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Hope from Experience, and said to her insulting Enemy, <q>Conclude not me utterly lost and irrecoverable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hath brought me low; look back to the times past, and consider that God never left me to perish, that as he visited me with his Rod, so he always shewed me his Salvation. I trust he will do so now, and in the mean time <hi>when</hi> or <hi>while I sit in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the Lord will be a Light unto me.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Darkness</hi> in Scripture language signifies Trouble and Affliction, and <hi>Light</hi> is put for Joy and Comfort. And so the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet by this Expression declares his assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>that God would afford his people seasonable tokens of his favour,</hi> even in the midst of their Tribulations, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of their Hearts, and the support of their Minds, until the time of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance come. Now the Prophet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus answered the prophane Scoffs and Mockings of the Heathens about them,</p>
            <p>In the next place, he draweth his Peoples thoughts more home, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them to look into themselves, and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:93003:238"/>
to consider their <hi>own hearts and ways,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of these mis-constructions of the Divine Judgments, by Men unacquainted with the ways of God: And whatever their Enemies said, he himself resolves and teacheth the rest of his People, to take all these Calamities and Afflictions from God, as the Effects of his Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and the Punishment of their Sins, to which they should submit, and which they ought to bear patiently. <hi>I will,</hi> saith he, <hi>bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him.</hi> And as their Calamities were thus to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and entertained, so he encourageth to it, by a Promise that they should be but for a time, and that thereafter God <hi>would plead their cause, and execute judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them,</hi> that is, <q>Defend and vindicate them, right their wrongs, repay their injuries, and do justice on those who had been the Instruments of their Misery, he would set them at Liberty, and restore them to their Prosperity and Glory, which is meant by bringing them to the Light.</q> And then to their great comfort and joy, they should <hi>behold, and understand his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;</hi> that is, That he is <hi>just and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in all his ways, true and faithful</hi>
               <pb n="453" facs="tcp:93003:238"/>
               <hi>in his promises, and wonderful in all he doth,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>I know, O Lord, that all thy judgments are right, and that out of faithfulness thou hast afflicted me,</hi> Psal. cxix. 75.</p>

            <p>And First, To rejoice at the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Afflictions of others, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult over them who are in Misery, is a sign of a Prophane and Ungodly Spirit. They who rejoiced at the Calamities of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> were the <hi>Idumeans, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> and <hi>Babylonians,</hi> who were no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Enemies to them, than they were to God and the true Religion. And <hi>Psal.</hi> lxix. 26. among other Characters of the Wicked, this is one, That <hi>they persecute him whom thou hast smitten, and talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.</hi> When <hi>Iob</hi> declareth his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, he giveth this as one proof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,<note place="margin">Job 31. 29, 30.</note> That <hi>he rejoiced not at the destruction of him that hated him, nor lift up his soul when evil found him. Neither</hi> (saith he)
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:93003:239"/>
               <hi>have I suffered my mouth to sin, by wishing a curse to his soul.</hi> To make God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on others, tho' Enemies, a matter of Laughter, doth very much bewray a want of the Spirit of God, and is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent both with the true Fear of God, and that Love and Concernedness for others, which Religion requires and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spireth. They who truly fear God, will tremble to see him Angry; tho' it be not against themselves but others. When the Destruction of the Wicked is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, it is said, That <hi>the righteous shall</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 52. 7.</note> 
               <hi>see and fear.</hi> And accordingly the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> foreseeing the Evils and Calamities that were to light upon the Tents of <hi>Cusham,</hi> and the Land of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> was so far from rejoicing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting thereat, that he tells us, <hi>when I heard, my belly trembled, my lips quivered</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hab. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>at the voice, rottenness entred into my bones, and I trembled in my flesh.</hi> Indeed it is added in the forecited place, That <hi>the righteous shall also laugh:</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> lviii. 10. it is said, <hi>the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance.</hi> But hereby is meant, that as the righteous is careful to remark all the Acts of the Divine Providence; and in particular, his exemplary Punishments on notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:93003:239"/>
wicked Persons, so he will Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud the Justice and Equity of them, and he will be glad to see such evident and convincing proofs of a Deity and Providence, for silencing the Atheist, and restraining the <hi>wickedness of men:</hi> though still his joy is mixed with a secret regret at the occasion, and such an aweful apprehension of the Power and Justice of God, as forbids him to mock at the Effects and Expressions of his Displeasure; Even as a wise and good Citizen rejoiceth at the good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his City, and finds a satisfaction in the procedure and execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, which are too grave and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to be mocked at.</p>
            <p>Again, the rejoicing at the Calamities of others is inconsistent with the Spirit of Religion, which is a Spirit of Love and Humility, and which requireth the greatest Love and Sympathy, that can be among Men; its Precepts are, <hi>love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that persecute you and despite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully use you. Rejoice with them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, and weep with them that weep. If thine enemy hunger feed him, if he thirst give him drink.</hi> Now how little do they
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:93003:240"/>
observe these Precepts, and how little have they of that Spirit which enjoins them, who can contrive and work Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to their Brethren, and when it falls on them behold it with Pleasure? We may say to such, what our Saviour said to his Disciples who would have been calling for Fire from Heaven on those who would not receive them, <hi>you know not what manner of Spirit you are of.</hi> The Miseries and Distresses of others call for Pity and Compassion; and one must have put off very much of the Man, who draweth Pleasure from the Miseries and Afflictions of other Men, tho' they be Enemies. Our Saviour knew the Wickedness of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and that he was to be crucified therein, yet as he drew nigh to it, <hi>he wept over it</hi> by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of those sad Calamities which were coming upon it. It was <hi>David's</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest that <hi>Saul</hi> was dead, yet he did not rejoice at his Death, but because the manner thereof was deplorable he mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him. As it makes <hi>Herodias</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous that she rejoiced to see the Head of <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> in a Charger; so it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to the Commendation of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and <hi>Iulius Coesar,</hi> that neither of them insulted over the Defeat and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:93003:240"/>
of their Enemies; the first was touched with Compassion, when <hi>Darius</hi> his Mother, Wife and Children, were taken Prisoners, and brought to him, and afterwards when <hi>Darius</hi> himself was killed. And the other wept when <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey's</hi> Head was brought to him. I know some charge these Tears of <hi>Coesar</hi> with Hypocrisie, seeing he was the Man who pursued <hi>Pompey</hi> to Death; but who knows, but the Bowels of Nature at that time overcame his Ambition and other Passions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They who insult and rejoice in this wise, are ignorant of themselves, and also of the End of these Divine Judgments, they cannot know they are Sinners, and that others are so and so punished in their sight, to fill them with Fear and to lead them to Repentance, otherwise they would make other Uses thereof, and would behave themselves otherwise. When a Father chastises a Child, is it to give Mirth to the rest? Or is it not, that they may stand in Awe of him, and forbear those things which may bring the Rod on their own Back. When any Criminal is laid hold on, and brought to publick Punishment, should they who are equally guilty, stand by and laugh
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:93003:241"/>
either at the Misfortune of their Fellow, or the Execution of Justice? What Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity were this! Should they not take Warning and Fear, and forsake those Ways which are attended with such Shame and Pain! When some told our Saviour of those <hi>Galileans</hi> whose Blood <hi>Pilate</hi> mingled with there Sacrifices, he answered them; <hi>Suppose ye these Galileans were Sinners above all others,</hi> because they suffered such things, <hi>I tell you nay, but except ye Repent ye shall all likewise perish.</hi> And in Truth they who set light of the Afflictions of others, and entertain the Rods on other Mens Backs with Scorn and Derision, shall hardly escape them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. <hi>Laugh no Man to scorn in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 7. 11.</note> 
               <hi>of his Soul, for there is one who humbleth and exalteth,</hi> saith the wise Son of <hi>Syrach.</hi> And <hi>Solomon,</hi> whose Words have yet greater Weight, saith, <hi>whoso mocketh the poor, reproacheth his Maker,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 17. 5.</note> 
               <hi>and he that is glad at Calamities shall not be unpunished.</hi> So the Prophet <hi>Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk</hi> saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he was humbled at these Disasters of <hi>Midian</hi> and <hi>Cushan,</hi> that he himself <hi>might rest in the day of trouble.</hi> Who wisely and seriously consider the Instability of humane Affairs, will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be lifted up with their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:93003:241"/>
nor will they insult over their Neighbours Misery: For what is the ones Case to Day may be the others to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Who at present braves it out with Pride and Scorn, may within a little time come to be contemptible.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Quem dies vidit veniens superbum,<note place="margin">Seneca.</note>
               </l>
               <l>Hunc dies vidit fugiens jacentem,</l>
               <l>Res Deus nostras celeri citatas turbine versat.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Secondly, We see here that the Church<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> The Church and People of God, are often visit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Rod of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</note> and People of God are often visited with the Rod of Afflictions. The Text de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth it, and if any Persons doubt it, let them read the History of the Church, and they shall be fully convinc'd. As for the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, 'twas first sadly oppress'd in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thereafter for the space of forty Years, 'twas exercised in a barren Wilderness with divers kinds of Afflictions. After they came to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> during the time of the Judges, they were often brought low. They had Peace a part of <hi>David's,</hi> and all <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's</hi> Life; but afterwards it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually interrupted, till they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Captive to <hi>Babylon.</hi> When they were brought back, and restored to their
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:93003:242"/>
own Land, they were not settled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hot Debates and Contests with their Neighbours; and after their Settlement, they had severe Wars, and were kept in continual Exercise with divers sore Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles until Christ, as appears from <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> and the History of the <hi>Maccabees.</hi> And as for the Christian Church, Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sprang up with it, and continually attended it; for the space of Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years, it suffered Ten severe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Persecutions, besides many sad par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Conflicts. And tho' after that the Emperours and Rulers turned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian; there was no general Persecution for the Name of Christ, and the Sake of the Gospel; yet there was no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church or People without the Rod of Correction: They have been visited either with Foreign Wars, or Intestine Divisions; with Pestilence or Famine, or some other Calamity. No Nation or People can boast of an Immunity from such Disasters, but for the space of One Hundred Years. As Man in his private Capacity, so States and Societies are born to Trouble: Nor is an Exemption from the same among the Privileges of the People of God. The <hi>Roman</hi> Church makes Temporal Felicity one of the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:93003:242"/>
Notes of the true Church. But her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility appears as little here as in other things: For as it is no where promised in Scripture, so no Church can <hi>de facto</hi> shew it; She her self would fail if she were put to prove her self the true Church by this, for where was her Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Felicity, when <hi>Rome</hi> it self was sacked, and the <hi>Pope</hi> shut up in Prison. Calamities and Afflictions do indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate that they who suffer them are Sinners: But they do not prove them to be Reprobates and Cast-aways, for the People of God may expect them as well as others; nay, they may look for them more than others, because God is more jealous of them, and his glory is more concerned to Punish Sin in them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We may observe here, that<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> When God is provoked to punish, he doth not lay aside his Kindness and good Will.</note> even when God is most provoked, to lay on his afflicting Hand, and to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, he doth not forbear to shew Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: And that in the extreamest Misery, there is still ground to Hope in God for a Deliverance. None ever provoked God more, than the People of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> in the days to which this Prophecy referrs, nor did any Peoples case look more desperate than theirs, when carried Captive by the King of <hi>Assyria:</hi> And
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:93003:243"/>
yet you see here, that the Prophet in regard to them then, saith, <hi>when I fall, I shall rise, when I sit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the Lord shall be a light unto me.</hi> As God casts down with one Hand, he lifts up with another.</p>
            <q>Soepe premente Deo fert Deus alter opem.</q>
            <p>Thus when he cast the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of their own Land, he made them to find favour with the People among whom they were dispersed. God wisely tempereth his Punishments, so that while they vindicate his Holiness and Justice, they also serve to manifest his Mercy and Good-will. God hath no pleasure in Wickedness, and therefore when he seeth it, he punisheth it: But all his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred being against the Crime and not the Person, therefore he saveth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth them, and maketh their very Afflictions tend to their Good, unless they have made themselves altogether incorrigible, and have hardned their Hearts against all his Methods, and then indeed he gives them up to Destruction. When he sees it necessary to withdraw external and worldly Comforts, he dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles inward and spiritual Consolations.
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:93003:243"/>
So the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> having denounced Judgments against <hi>Israel,</hi> he addeth, <hi>And therefore will the Lord wait that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you. And though the Lord give you the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 30. 18.</note> 
               <hi>bread of adversity, and the water of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; yet shall not thy Teachers be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy Teachers; and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this is the way walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</hi> The felicity of the Soul is to be preferred to the welfare of the Body; and Spiritual Consolations to Worldly Advantages: Now because or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily People are insensible of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and indisposed to receive them while the latter abound with them; Therefore he takes away this, that they may seek the other, and be capable of them; so that we really gain by our losses, and <hi>our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> Thus it is said, <hi>Hos.</hi> ii. 14. <hi>Therefore behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her, and I will give her her vineyards</hi>
               <pb n="464" facs="tcp:93003:244"/>
               <hi>from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope, and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</hi> These words shew that God comforteth his People in their Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and therefore afflicteth them that he may make them sensible of his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and have occasion to speak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to them: As also that in due time he will deliver them, and make them to rejoice for the days wherein they have been afflicted. <hi>It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.</hi> There is always ground to hope, and never rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to despair, be our condition never so low, perplex'd and troubled: For he is Omnipotent in Power, and Infinite in Goodness, and can do for us above what we either can ask or think. When all Humane help faileth, there is help in God, and then he useth to help and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, when relief can be expected no where else, that we may know it his doing, and that he only may have the Praise and Glory. Thus he delivered <hi>Ioseph,</hi> when all the World had forgotten him. He saved <hi>Moses</hi> when his Parents could hide him no longer. He redeemed
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:93003:244"/>
his People, when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> exercised the greatest cruelty towards them; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways when they were lowest and most oppressed by their Enemies, he raised up Deliverers for them, and he returned this Captivity when there was least ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it, and when it was not so much as thought upon, except by some few who remembred and believed the Promise by the Mouth of <hi>Ieremiah, Chap.</hi> xxv. 12. So likewise when the Persecutions against the Christians came to be bitterest, he always brought about a mitigation and relentment. And when that most severe one under <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and his Colleagues, had proceeded so far that 'twas thought the Name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity was quite extinct, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly Trophies were erected for it; he first turned the Heart of <hi>Constantius Chlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> to protect Christians, and thereafter raised up <hi>Constantine the Great,</hi> who not only gave them full liberty, but made the Christian Religion the professed Religion of the Empire.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We learn hence how to<note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> The Right uses which people ought to make of Calamities and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> receive, how to entertain, and how to improve all those Calamities and Afflictions which befall us, so that they may turn to our good, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:93003:245"/>
means of reconciling us to God. The Prophet teacheth us this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by his own example, when he saith, <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him:</hi> Which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, first, to receive all our Evils and<note place="margin">1. To acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God the Author of them.</note> Troubles as from the hand of God. And indeed there is no <hi>evil in the city which the Lord hath not done,</hi> Amos iii. 6. Who ever or what ever be the Instrument, he is the Author: He cannot indeed be the Author of the Evil of Sin, but he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways that of Punishment: He orders, disposeth, and determines all that falleth out in the World. What ever disposition there be in Men, Devils, or any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Mischief, yet they cannot stir or move but when they are allowed, and as they are directed: As in a well-disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined Army, the Soldiers go not out on any Expedition, but when they are commanded. So <hi>Ioseph</hi> ascribed to God his being sold into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> though it was through the Malice and Envy of his Brethren. And <hi>Iob</hi> acknowledged God the Author of all his Disasters, though some were committed by the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans; The Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>gave, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="467" facs="tcp:93003:245"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As we are here taught to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge<note place="margin">2. To own Sin to be the Cause and Occasion of them.</note> God the Author of our Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Calamities, so our Sin's the cause and occasion of them. <hi>When God corrects man, it is always for iniquity;</hi> For he is more righteous than to punish when there is no fault: <hi>He doth not grieve the Children of men willingly, nor afflict them;</hi> and therefore when he doth it, it is because they have sinned against him, and consequently they who are afflicted should acknowledge their Sins which have kindled the indignation of the Lord against them: So doth <hi>Daniel,</hi> Ch. ix. 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To bear the Indignation of<note place="margin">3. To suffer them Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently.</note> the Lord, is to fuffer patiently without murmuring. A thing may be imposed on a Man, but he cannot be said to bear it who doth it not willingly, and he doth not bear it willingly, who frets, murmurs and complains. And <hi>why should a living Man complain, a Man for the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of his Sins?</hi> Would it be reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in a Criminal to accuse or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur against the Judge for giving out Sentence, when it was yet less than his Crimes deserve; Now certainly no Man suffers or can suffer in this life so much as his Sins merit. <hi>Furthermore,</hi> saith the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:93003:246"/>
Apostle, <hi>we had fathers of our flesh who corrected us, and we gave them reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; shall we not much rather be in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Father of spirits and live?</hi> Heb. xii. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To bear the Indignation of<note place="margin">4. To repent of Sin and to sorsake it.</note> the Lord because of Sin, implies a hearty grief for it, and a real turning from it. He that is sensible that the Evils he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, are the Effects of God's displeasure for his Sins, cannot but have a remorse for them; and if he have a true remorse for them, he will also abandon them, and shew all care to serve God better. Until we do so, we never accept the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of our Sins. They despise the Rod, who do not amend, neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more dutiful by it. And such shall bring greater Punishment upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But they who thus receive and use their Chastisement, shall be eased and delivered: <hi>He will plead their cause, and execute Iudgment for them, and bring them forth to the light. Humble your selves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time,</hi> 1 Pet. v. 6.</p>
            <p>The last Observation I shall draw from<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> The Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, when rightly understood, do declare his Righteousness.</note> the words, is, That when these Divine Dispensations, I mean, the Afflictions and Calamities which befall his People,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:93003:246"/>
are well considered and rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, there will be found much Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness in them. There is too much proneness in Men to censure the Actions of Providence, which speaks out the greatest rashness and presumption ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable:<note place="margin">See <hi>Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into the Nature,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of Faith.</hi> Essay 5th.</note> For what are we? Where is either our Authority or Capacity, that we should take upon us to canvass the Actions of the Almighty, or to rectifie the Contrivances and Determinations of Infinite Wisdom! A Child is fitter to pass Judgment on the actings of a wise understanding Man, and a dull Country Clown may with less arrogance examine the Maxims of a <hi>Matchiavel,</hi> and other famous Politicians; <hi>Shall not the Iudge of all the Earth do right!</hi> said <hi>Abraham.</hi> Certainly he cannot but do it, he can do nothing amiss: But indeed to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate this, and to make out the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of his particular Providences, is for the most part above Human reach: For as the Psalmist saith, <hi>Thy way is in the Sea, and thy path in the great Waters, and thy footsteps are not known. O the depths,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>of the riches both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his Iudgments, and his Ways past finding out!</hi> But when they
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:93003:247"/>
are found and discovered, they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear most Righteous. <hi>He hath made every thing beautiful in his time,</hi> saith Solomon, <hi>also he hath set the world in their hearts, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end,</hi> Eccl. iii. 11. Look the best piece of Arras on the backside, and its handsomness will not appear: Nor will the beauty of the finest Picture be known, unless it be set in a due light. So we cannot understand the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God's Providence, without knowing the reason and ends thereof. And these are often hid from us, till the event declare them; and then we are forced to approve and applaud what before we were ready to condemn. As Fines, Imprisonments, and other Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments are necessary to a Common-Wealth, so Calamities, Troubles, and Afflictions are now necessary to the World. By them God keeps up his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, defends his Laws, curbs Sin, prevents some from going astray, and reclaims others who have already erred from the ways of his Commandments. Hereby he exercises his Peoples Virtue, Integrity, Faith, Patience, and other Graces, and makes them to acquire the
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:93003:247"/>
Growth, Stature, Vigour, and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of perfect Men, which they would not do if softness and ease and plenty were always indulged them. As Winds serve to purifie the Air, and Frost, and Snow, and Rain, to moisten and fatten the Earth, that it may be fruitful; so God sendeth Calamities and Afflictions, that they who are barren may be made to bear fruit, and that others may bring forth more fruit. If an ignorant and unskilful Person saw a Gardiner pruning his Trees, and lopping off the Branches with Axes and Knives, he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps suspect him of madness, or think he intended the destruction of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: Whereas he thereby prevents their overgrowing and undoing one another, and renders his Garden both more come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and more profitable. So God by Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions prunes his People, he keeps down those Corruptions and Disorders which otherwise would break out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, and disposeth them to bear proper fruit in their season. <hi>It is good for me that I was afflicted,</hi> said <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> The Psalmist was once tempted to think that God was unkind to his Church and People, because he afflicted them: But on second thoughts he checks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:93003:248"/>
and concludes, that <hi>truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.</hi> That is such dealing with his People do not prove that he has no kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for them: For he is still good to them, and their Afflictions testifie it, and such as are of a clean heart shall certainly find it so.</p>
            <p>Now seeing these things are so, let us<note place="margin">
                  <hi>VI.</hi> Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> not complain of the present Providence of God; let us not murmur against, nor bear impatiently those Evils which are upon us: For we have truly sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and he doth justly punish us, whatever may be said of many of the Instruments of our Trouble and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. I must not flatter you, certainly our Princes, our Nobles and Great Ones, the Pastors and People, and all Ranks amongst us, have corrupted themselves, and done wickedly, and therefore God hath justly brought Evil upon our Land: And they who have smarted by this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, have suffered justly at the hands of God. Let us therefore humble our selves before him, acknowledge our Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and the Justice and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Judgments, and then he will be ready to plead our Cause. I beseech you, in the words of <hi>Hosea; O Israel!</hi>
               <pb n="473" facs="tcp:93003:248"/>
               <hi>return unto the Lord thy God, for thou hast faln by thine iniquity, take with you words, and turn to the Lord, say unto him, take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously, so will we render the Calves of our Lips;</hi> and then we shall hear him saying, <hi>I will heal your backsliding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from him.</hi> And as he saith in another place, <hi>Come and let us return unto the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heal us, he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as this is the only proper Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for our selves, so I would advise those to whom the present times seem a little more favourable, I mean, <hi>our Brethren of the Presbyterian Party,</hi> whom I call Brethren, though their usage and treatment of us have shewed them Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, seeing they have overthrown the Church, and treated her Bishops and Priests with Contumely and Reproach; I say, I would advise them not to be over vain and confident, for they know not <hi>what a day may bring forth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To rejoice at our Affliction, and to insult over our Misery, doth not favour much of Religion, to which they make
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:93003:249"/>
so high pretences: And unless they could chain their present State by irreversible Decrees; there is as little Prudence as Religion in despising us thus, and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling so much upon us: For it may come to pass, that they may yet be forced to seek shelter under the Shadow of our Vine. They know it is not long since another Party, I mean those of the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, boasted and bragged, and aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too at more than was fit or meet, or what Discretion would have required, which brought on their Ruine, and which has occasioned their Loss of that Peace which otherwise they might and would have enjoyed. <hi>Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.</hi> I believe, <hi>that thou shalt arise, O Lord, and have mercy upon Zion, when the time to favour her, when the set time is come.</hi> Though our Case were more desperate in the Eyes of the World, yet I would not despair, tho' we were at a lower pass, and had fewer Friends, I yet would not let go my Hope; for <hi>God is able to do for us above what we can ask or think.</hi> It is true, we have provoked the Lord, and tho' he leave us we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; But we know also, that our <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="475" facs="tcp:93003:249"/>
               <hi>is merciful, and with him is plenteous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. He will not cast off for ever.</hi> Therefore <hi>they who are his people should still hope in him.</hi> And we are his People, as much for any thing I know, as any other Christians in the World can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be, for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> is a sound Member of the Holy Catholick Church, professing the same Faith, that the Churches in the most ancient and purest Ages did, and hath the same Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry and Government, even that very Ministry and Government, which in those times were thought necessary to the being of a Church; and in, and under that Ministry, we also have the holy Sacraments purely administred, by which we are bound to God, by a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which is more solemn and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred than any of Man's inventing can be. If therefore we return to the Lord, and acknowledge our Offences, he will have Mercy upon us, and surely visit us with his Salvation: For we are his <hi>Zion,</hi> a part of his Catholick Church, or pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People, and he will not always be angry with us. We may take up this Hope both by our own Experience, and the Experience of others. Have we not
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:93003:250"/>
fallen heretofore? And have we not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen again? Have we not seen the Church invaded, her Essential Order and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination demolished, her Pastors exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, her Temples profaned, her Beauty defac'd! And have we not seen all these repair'd and restor'd again? Is there any thing impossible unto God? Can he not suddenly alter the securest State, and put a stop to the most violent Career? <hi>ANNO</hi> 58, and 59, neither King nor Royal Family durst be owned, and then it was a capital Crime to pray for them? And yet you all know that within a Year or two, our King was wonderfully restored without Sword and without Bow; and even they who had banished him were forced to concur in the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him back; <hi>This was the Lord's doing,</hi> and <hi>it was</hi> then <hi>wonderful in our eyes.</hi> Now he that was able to do this, what is he not able to do? <hi>The stone which the builders have refused, he has made become the Head stone of the Corner.</hi> And so he may cause them who are at this time rejected, as <hi>Gibeonites</hi> and <hi>Samaritans</hi> (so one was pleas'd lately to term the <hi>Episcopal Clergy</hi>) to be courted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as chief Builders of the Temple.
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:93003:250"/>
People may come to be convinc'd, that their present Prejudice and Aversion are unreasonable, so that Love, Respect, and Good-Will may take place instead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Now when those who have stated themselves our Enemies shall see this, what will they say? Shall I say, as it follows our Text, <hi>Shame shall cover them?</hi> God forbid! that we should wish any other Shame to them, than that of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents and Converts, which is profitable for themselves, and acceptable unto others. Far be it from us to wish or contrive any Persons Confusion, or to harbour Thoughts of Revenge, we have not so learned Christ. God forbid! that we should wish any thing, save the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, the Peace of the Church, and the common Good of all; and in order unto these, the promoting of Truth, the retrieving true Piety, the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a decent, reasonable Worship, and a comely Order, and good Government. Though our Sins hinder these Blessings at present; yet we hope God will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time grant them. And that it may be so, let us frequently address him by hearty and serious Prayers; and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially let us study to please him by a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>THE Letter of the Text needs not much Explication, nor has the Original any thing more Emphatical or material than this Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, so that any <hi>Analysis</hi> that could be made of the Words, would be meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Grammatical; and therefore I'll not trouble you with it (though it may be usual in these Exercises) because it would be a very dry and bare Entertainment.</p>
            <p>This Verse contains a particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I.</hi> An Enquiry into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of this Verse with the Context.</note> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> concerning his bodily Health, and so it is a matter of some Difficulty, to find out the Reason why
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:93003:252"/>
it comes in here, among so many grave and important Directions about the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, and especially why it should be cast in before the <hi>24th.</hi> and <hi>25th.</hi> Verses, which have evidently a Relation to the <hi>22d.</hi> whereby the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Discourse is interrupted, and what should be joined together is divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder.<note place="margin">The Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of some proposed and rejected.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To take away this Difficulty, some fansie that the Order of the Apostles Words has been changed, and misplaced by some ignorant and unwary Transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which is no ways to be admitted; nor can there be alledged any ancient Manuscript, or modern Copy of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Reading, from this which is used by us, upon which such a Conceit may be grounded. The general current of Interpreters give no other Reason, for the inserting this particular Precept among so many general ones, but St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Friendship for <hi>Timothy,</hi> and the great Concernment he had for one, who was so eminently useful to the Church of God. They do not allow it any Connexion with what goes before, and frankly acknowledge that it hath no manner of Relation to the Apostle's Purpose in this Place, and do think it a
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:93003:252"/>
vain thing to search for it, it being very usual with the Apostle to make Digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to bring in things abruptly, to fall from his Purpose and to return to it again; which the learned <hi>Daille</hi> justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, saying, That it is the way of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting used by the other Divine and Sacred Authors of the Scripture, and besides, that it is evident, that the best, and most ancient, and the most admired Authors in the World have also practised it, as may be seen in those Works of theirs, which remain with us, wherein these great Men have not tied themselves to the strict Rules of Logick and Rhetorick, invented by the Weakness and Subtilty of modern Spirits, but do, in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, especially in their Epistles, keep almost the same Order, the same Air, and the same manner of speaking which is usual in common Discourse and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Conversation, whereof Writings, especially the more familiar Epistolary sort of Writings, should be the Image and Picture. In the Conferences and Discourses which we hold <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> there is nothing more ordinary, than to break off the Subject begun, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assume it again after some Pauses and Digressions. And why should this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:93003:253"/>
be denied to those that write, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to those that write Letters? But with a due Deference to this great Man's Judgment, I do think, that a greater Coherence, betwixt Mens Thoughts and Words, may be looked for, when they write, than when they speak. In Conference we are obliged to follow others, and ordinarily the Company casteth in something or other, which necessarily draweth us off the main Subject; whereas when one writes he has all Freedom for his Thoughts, and it is not to be supposed, that a wise and knowing Person will interrupt his Purpose, or cast in any thing in the handling of it, which doth not serve for an Illustration, the obviating an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, the preventing a Mistake, or the like. And such Coherence must not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be denied, when it is not apparent to every Reader. If we understood the Scripture truly, and had a particular Knowledge of the Scope and Purpose of the several parts thereof, I doubt not but there would be found a more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Union and Coherence, than what is commonly believed, though it is chiefly to be regarded for the great and important Truths delivered therein.
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:93003:253"/>
Upon which very account it is more to be valued, than all the most accurate and closely written Books in the World.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The true Reason why St.</hi> Paul <hi>gives this Advice in this place.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>As to the present Text, I do not think it comes in so abruptly, and without any Relation to what goeth before, as is commonly alledged; for I would make it to be delivered on this Occasion. In the former Verse St. <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> to lay hands suddenly on no Man, that is, to beware of admitting any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily into the Office of the Ministry, for, if through his Carelesness any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Person crept in, he would have an Accession to all the bad Effects of their Ministry; their Miscarriages and Male-administration, their Sins and their Scandals were to be charged on him: And seeing every Man will find burthen enough of his own Sins, therefore he adviseth him to take Care, that he be not by this means Partaker of other Mens Sins; and from thence taketh Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to exhort him to keep himself in all things unspotted in the sight of God: <hi>Keep thy self pure,</hi> saith he, which in the first place referreth to the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, of not admitting of unworthy Persons into the Ministry, or any one hastily: But withal it is to be extended
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:93003:254"/>
farther, to the avoiding all things which may stain or pollute us; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ordinary in Scripture, than to take Occasion from particular Duties to recommend a general Sanctity, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance whereof we have, <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 48.</p>
            <p>Now least such a serious Exhortation to <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was forward enough of his own accord, should have made him over-do in his Acts of Temperance and Abstemiousness, the Apostle wisely casts in this Caution, <hi>Drink no longer water,</hi> &amp;c. Thus I would construe the Words, and make them cohere with that which goeth before.</p>
            <p>Before I consider the Apostles Precept<note place="margin">
                  <hi>II.</hi> Inferences from the Occasion of delivering this advice. The first, to caution against the Abuse of Doctrines.</note> in it self, I think it will not be amiss to draw some Observations from the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of delivering it.</p>
            <p>And first, This shews what Care Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours should take in their Teaching, both publickly and privately, to adapt their Discourses to the Hearers, and so wisely to caution their Doctrine, that they may not give Occasion to any to entertain, or to run into Errours and Mistakes. The very Scriptures, St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>are wrested by the unlearned and unstable;</hi> and how much more readily will such wrest the Words of Men: And though
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:93003:254"/>
it is not possible to prevent altogether the Abuse of our Doctrine, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting our Words, yet it becomes us to guard against it as much as we can, and by timeing our Doctrine aright, and seasoning our Discourses so well with the Salt of Divine Wisdom, to keep our selves free of all Accession to such Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as ignorant and perverse Men may make of what we deliver. There be some general things which we cannot press enough, and which may be largely insisted on, as Faith, Repentance, Love, Charity, Holiness, and the like; But particular Duties have Bounds and Limits which must not be leapt over, for the Excess proves vicious, as well as the Defect, which <hi>Solomon</hi> may have an Eye to, when he saith, <hi>Be not Righteous over much, neither make thy self over-wise.</hi> Eccl. vii. 16. In refuting Errours, Care should be taken so to state the Truth, that those we would reclaim may not run into the contrary Extream, which falls too often out, because 'tis little heeded. When we comfort the droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and disconsolate, we should beware of blowing them up into Presumption, or of turning them careless or secure, and should so apply the Threatnings and
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:93003:255"/>
Terrours of the Gospel to such as seem careless and obdurate, as that they may not be driven to Despair. The Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Efficacy of God's Grace should be so taught, as that Men may not think their own Endeavours needless. And in pressing Persons to work out their own Salvation, we should take heed of wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from a Dependance upon God. Zeal should be so taught, that People may not think themselves bound to leap out of that Rank and Order, wherein Providence has placed them: And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining them from these Disorders, we should be careful not to render them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned and lukewarm. Obedience to Superiours should be so stated, that People may see themselves tied to things lawful, and in which the Superiours have a Right to command, and no more: And when there is Occasion of calling them to obey God rather than Man, it should be so done, as that they may not think Religion requires them to break their Ranks, and to take more upon them than what becomes them; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist their lawful Governours, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse Obedience to their lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; to wrest the Government from them, or to treat their Persons with
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:93003:255"/>
Contempt. Things indifferent may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come sometimes very useful, and then they ought to be recommended, but not so as to ensnare the ignorant into a Belief of their being absolutely necessary, or some way meritorious. In a word, we should so deliver our Doctrine, so temper our Exhortations and Reproofs, that our Hearers may neither come short of their Duty, nor yet go beyond what is proper in any particular incumbent on them, but may be made to go on straightly in the way of Truth and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, without turning to the right or the left Hand.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We may learn hence what<note place="margin">The second, the true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Friendship.</note> are the best and truest Expressions of Friendship; <hi>Friendship is the very Soul of Life,</hi> as one saith, it exceedingly sweetens it, and where this is wanting, there can be but small Satisfaction: But then true Friendship doth not spend it self, in a phantastick Dotage on the Person of our Friend, nor should it eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate into idle Words and Complements. Friendship doth not consist in Flatteries, nor is he the truest Friend who is most obsequious, who humours his Friend in all things, who is like <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> of whom it is said, <hi>That he was so partial</hi>
               <pb n="488" facs="tcp:93003:256"/>
               <hi>for his Friends, that he would not have any thing they did found fault with, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was right or wrong.</hi> Such, for the most part, are the Friendships a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Men of the World; but they scarce deserve the Name, they are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Shadow of it. True Friendship designs the Good and Happiness of the Friend; but these draw on his Ruine and Destruction. St. <hi>Paul</hi> understood well what the sacred Name of a Friend im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and therefore he expresseth his Friendship for his beloved <hi>Timothy,</hi> by giving him Instructions how to behave himself aright in his Place and Station, and by correcting his Mistakes and Faults, that he might become useful to the Church of God, and loved and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired of all. If then we would have a true Friend, let us chuse such an one, as may further us in the Attainment of Wisdom and Vertue, who as he will be careful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to approve of us when we do well, so will not fail to admonish us when we do amiss. These are the true Offices of Friendship, he abuseth and betrayeth it who doth not use them, and he is not worthy of a Friend, who will not admit of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="489" facs="tcp:93003:256"/>Thirdly, Consider what a Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">The third, a Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for useful and eminent Persons.</note> all should have for Eminent and Useful Persons, and how desirous they should be of their Safety and Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was at a distance from <hi>Timothy,</hi> but yet carefully tenders his Health, and remembring his Sickness and Infirmity, doth prescribe him Remedy, even in the midst of those great and weighty Directions about the Doctrine of the Gospel, and the Government of the Church. The Affairs of the Church, and the Interest of the Gospel, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of more moment than any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Man: Yet you see when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles thoughts were most taken up with these things, he is mindful of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s particular health, and puts in a prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it amongst the other: Which he did not so much, because he was his beloved Friend, but because he considered him as one very <hi>serviceable to the Church of God,</hi> and as one on whom, under God, the Prosperity of the Church somewhat depended. As in the natural Body, all the Members should be had a care of, but those especially should be regarded and tendered, which are most useful and important, and which might hazard the whole, if ought ailed them; Even so
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:93003:257"/>
every Member of Church and State should share of our love, but those whom God has raised up, and by his special Gifts and Graces has singularly fitted for preserving, recovering or advancing the good of Church and State; I say, they should be much esteemed, and their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular welfare should be carefully sought after, by all who regard either Religion or the Civil Peace; for when it is not well with these, the other are in hazard. In an Army the lives of private Soldiers should be secured as much as is possible; But Heroes, and valiant Generals and Captains much more, because if they should be cut off, the other would be soon scattered; and if they be preserved, they can by their Valour and Conduct, recover a loss sustained amongst the common Soldiery: It is true, Man can do nothing without God, but God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily worketh in and by the means of Men. Such Men therefore should be much respected and cared for, whom God has marked out, to be fit Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of conveying his Blessings, to whom he has given Wisdom, and Zeal, and Courage, and other proper Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for propagating Truth, stopping Error, the curbing of Vice, and the right
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:93003:257"/>
ordering the House of God: which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a general Blessing upon the Land, and tendeth to the Temporal and Eternal welfare of every individual.</p>
            <p>I come now to consider the Precept<note place="margin">
                  <hi>III.</hi> The Advice of not drinking water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</note> in it self, in which you may take notice of what St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviseth <hi>Timothy,</hi> and then the reason he gives of that advice: What he adviseth him is, <hi>To drink no longer water, but a little wine;</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he gives, is for <hi>his Stomach's sake, and his often Infirmities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the First, <hi>Drink no longer</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. It only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy'</hi>s Case and Practice.</note> 
               <hi>water.</hi> This is no positive Prohibition of the use of Water, but it has a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reference to <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Practice, which must be considered for the better understanding of the <hi>Apostle</hi>'s meaning. It would seem that <hi>Timothy</hi> had hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made use of no other sort of Drink but Water, not certainly that he was not able to procure Wine to himself, nor yet from any scruple about the lawfulness of using that Liquor: For so great a person as <hi>Timothy</hi> was, to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave so high <hi>Elogies</hi> every where throughout his Epistles, and whom he thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Trust of the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> could not be so Ignorant as not to know that <hi>every Creature of God is good,</hi>

               <hi>and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving.</hi> No doubt St. <hi>Paul</hi> taught him early, <hi>that the Kingdom of God is not Meat and Drink, but Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and Peace, and Ioy in the Holy Ghost:</hi> And being so taught, he would be far from placing Religion in such kind of Abstinences. But his continued use of Water, was either because he was so brought up by his Parents, or out of his great Temperance and Sobriety; and that by this means, in imitation of his great Master St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he might <hi>keep his Body under, and bring it into subjection, lest when he preached to others, he himself should be a cast-away;</hi> as the Apostle speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 27.

Age, and of recommending Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and subduing of the Body by Fasting, Abstinence, and other Acts of Mortification. The Primitive Christians kept their Bodies under a severe Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which is now adays worn alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether out of fashion: We are not so far behind them in time, as we fall short of their strictness and severity, which is the reason that we come so short of their Devotion and Piety, and those other Christian Vertues which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them Illustrious. An account of their Severities and Mortifications would be thought fabulous; Men accustomed to such softness and looseness as we of this Age would hardly be induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, and if any of them were retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning back to this World, they would have as great difficulty of believing us to be Christians, seeing we work so much the <hi>will of the Gentiles, and walk in lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquettings, and do run</hi> easily and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly as they do <hi>to the same excess of riot.</hi> And indeed, if our ease, voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and loose manner of living be suitable enough to the Joys of Heaven, and consistent enough with the Graces which are necessary to fit one for it,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:93003:259"/>
then <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> and all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians were Fools and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as an <hi>Italian</hi> Monk said once wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, Preaching before two Cardinals. But the imputation of folly falls certainly on us, and not on these great Lights of the World. Our Apostle thought Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering and Wantonness, Gluttony and Drunkenness, only agreeable with the Night of Heathenish Ignorance, but we practise them in the broad Day of the Gospel, we make these Works of Darkness face the clearest Sun-shine. So little are the Men of this Age acquainted with Abstinence and Mortification, that I fear they would brand a Man with Heresie that would recommend them. There is no restraint put upon the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; but occasions are industriously sought out to gratifie and regale them, insomuch, that it is counted miserable not to be able to entertain them with the best things to Satiety and Repletion. Back and Belly take up the thoughts of Poor and Rich, and most Mens Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, the very end of their Life, is that they may lie softly, and fare deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously every day. This is the fashion of this Age, after this manner do Men now frame their Lives: But this is not
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:93003:259"/>
the way to imitate the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, nor yet to walk by the Rules of the Gospel. If Man was only Flesh, if he could taste no higher Pleasures than what come to him by the Sense of the Body, this were not so unreasonable, though it be reported even of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that he established <hi>Sobriety and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by his Principles.</hi> If a Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Paradise were all our Expectation hereafter, I would not either think it unlawful or improper, to give way to our Appetites, and to cherish volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Desires, whereby we may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed for those Sensualities which are promised there: But seeing our Heaven is of another sort, and that we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd that God will <hi>destroy both the Belly and Meat,</hi> and are told of pure Spiritual Joys to be tasted even in this Life, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, surfeiting, and a full feeding daily are most unseemly; to pamper the Body is to ruin the Soul; for thereby those Lusts are cherished and strengthned, which war against the Soul and destroy it. We need no greater Enemies of our Salvation, than what are lodged within our selves; If all the Enemies without were removed out of the way, our own Flesh and Blood are enough to precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:93003:260"/>
us into Perdition: Have we not then great reason with St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> to subdue the Flesh, and to keep our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies under; if these two eminent Saints did this, lest they should have been Cast-aways; certainly we should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to neglect Abstinence and Exercises of Mortification, whereby the Flesh is kept from rebelling against the Spirit, or at least disabled from gaining a Victory over it. If our Body be not kept in subjection, if restraints be not put upon our Appetites, they will turn unruly, and at last involve us into utter Ruin. <hi>As Bridles should be put into the Horses mouths,</hi> so (saith St. <hi>Augustine</hi>) <hi>our Bodies should be bridled and kept in with Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Watchings and Prayer:</hi> Nam quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admodum aurigae, si fraena laxaverint per praecipitia ducuntur, ita &amp; anima nostra cum ipso corpore, si ei fraenum non im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posuerimus ad inferni praecipitia dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur.</p>
            <p>The Wantonness of the Rich, their insolence towards God, their contempt of others, and all their ungodly Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions and Actions, St. <hi>Iames</hi> ascribes to their <hi>living</hi> continually <hi>in pleasure,</hi> and to the <hi>nourishing their hearts every day as in a day of slaughter,</hi> that is, they
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:93003:260"/>
make every day a day of Feasting and Rejoicing, and set no days apart for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and Mourning. They let loose their Sensual Appetites, and are still making Provision for the Flesh and its Lusts, which carry their Thoughts quite from God and the things of another Life; so that they are both prompted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced easily to commit those Crimes which render them obnoxious to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wrath.</p>
            <p>God doth not grudge us the <hi>fat</hi> and <hi>sweet,</hi> he doth not envy us Lawful and Innocent Pleasures: And there are no Real Pleasures but such. He is willing that every Man <hi>take his Portion,</hi> that he <hi>enjoy his Labour, and rejoice in his Works.</hi> This (says <hi>Solomon</hi>) is <hi>the gift of God:</hi> but also he requires us so to moderate the outward Enjoyments of this Life, as that they may not be prejudicial to the Soul and its Eternal Happiness, nor yet hinder those inward Spiritual Comforts, which he is ready and willing to bestow, and which put more gladness into the Heart, than Corn, Wine, and Oil. You may feed the Body, but in the mean time take care that you do not starve the Soul, whose nourishment is deep and serious Meditations upon God and his Word, to
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:93003:261"/>
which a cramb'd and glutted Body is no wife disposed. They whose Hearts are overcharged with Surfeiting, and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, and the Cares of this Life, are neither mindful of, nor capable to use the means of Salvation. Wherefore it is necessary to intermix Days of Fasting and Retirement from Worldly Business, that we may have time for Prayer and Meditation, for instructing our Minds and examining our Actions; We should curb our Sensual Appetites, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deny our selves the Enjoyments of this Life, that our Desires after God and Heaven may be the more keen; We should mortifie the Body by Abstinence and other suitable Exercises, that it may not be a Clog to the Soul, nor a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the right Performance of the several Acts of Religion. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the Church, in former times, did wisely enjoin Vigils, and Fasts, and Times of Abstinence, as <hi>Lent:</hi> And the practice of Pious Men, in all Ages, do recommend Private Fasting once a Week or Month. While these things were observed, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion flourished, a Spirit of Devotion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in People, and they were suscep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of Impressions from the Truths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Gospel: And the common
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:93003:261"/>
Neglect of these things is one great Cause of the present Decay of Piety amongst us; which Neglect did proceed from a blind and indiscreet Zeal against Popery, which did not distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the due Use and Abuse of things.</p>
            <p>But however useful it may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,<note place="margin">3. Cautions to be used in Abstinence and Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> and for some persons, to exercise Abstinence, and other Acts of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: From what St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviseth <hi>Timothy</hi> here, we learn in the next place that the use of these things should be always managed with Prudence and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, that they may neither prove prejudicial to our Health, nor yet dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into Superstition. Fasting and other corporal Austerities are not things in themselves absolutely necessary, but become fit and good, according as they are subservient to other things which are so; they are to be accounted Religious Acts only when they serve to the great ends of Religion, and as they further the attainment of those Vertues and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which Religion strictly enjoins: When they are not profitable this way, they profit nothing at all: If they prove ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hinderances than furtherances of those Moral Duties, to which either our general or our particular Calling obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:93003:262"/>
then they are wholly to be laid aside. An excess in the observance is no ways commendable, and sometimes more hurtful than the total neglect of them. The Flesh with its Lusts should be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, but the Body by no means is to be destroyed; It's fit to keep the Body under, but it ought not to be so enfeebled as that it cannot discharge the Functions of Life, wherefore they bewray a great deal of Ignorance, Weakness, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, who make a scruple of forbearing the Fastings and Abstinences which they prescribe to themselves, when their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances seem to require it, as when they are under any indisposition of Body, or when abroad and cannot perform them without some signs of ostentation, some more than ordinary trouble to themselves, and inconvenience unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for when by these or the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, things of the like Nature cease to be useful, or prove noxious, they also cease to be acceptable unto God.</p>
            <p>Fasting, Abstinence, and Acts of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, are not of the Nature of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Charity, Humility, Meekness, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, and other like Christian Virtues, which are good in themselves, indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably necessary, and which ought to be
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:93003:262"/>
practis'd at all times, and in all places: Nor yet are they like Prayer, which as it is a Duty we are commanded to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>without ceasing;</hi> so it is agreeable and proper to all Persons, States, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, Seasons and Places. Fasting and external Acts of Mortification are not valuable in themselves, they are only commendable and Praise-worthy, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Prudent Management of them, and the Ends proposed by them. Sometimes they are in no wise suitable and proper; wherefore our Lord would not suffer his Disciples to fast while he was with them: When Strife and Envy, Vanity and Ostentation are the Motives, they are, to speak in the Scripture Phrase, Abominations; and they degenerate into Superstition, when they are observed out of an opinion of any particular Merit in them, or that they please God other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than as they are design'd and made means of subduing the Flesh and its Lusts, of quickening the Spirit of Devotion, and of fitting our selves to watch, pray, and to perform aright the other Acts of Religion.</p>
            <p>And hence it appears, how little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has, to boast of the Fastings, Penances, and other Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:93003:263"/>
practis'd by those of her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and that the Treasure of Merits, pretended to be amassed from these, has no real Foundation, but is Imaginary; as I have said, there is no intrinsick good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in these things; and if the meer external Performance did Merit any thing, some of the Ancient Hereticks might have stood as high upon this point as They; Nay, There are at this very day Pagans, which come nothing short of the most Religious in the Church of<note place="margin">See amongst others <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernier'</hi>s Travels.</note> 
               <hi>Rome,</hi> in Abstinence and corporal Auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities; yea, they often out-doe them. They who make Religion to consist in these <hi>Bodily Exercises,</hi> do neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Nature of God, nor the true Way of worshipping him; and they are yet farther mistaken, they mock God and deceive themselves, who think that these can be a Compensation for their Sins and the omission of Moral Duties. <q>If (saith St. <hi>Austin</hi>) thou macerate thy Body by long-fasting, and yet perseverest in ill, <hi>Magis horres quam placeas Deo.</hi> Then shall thy Fasts be acceptable, when thy Conscience is purged from Sin, and thy Life adorned with good Works. <hi>Cur enim Corpus fame discrucias, cui turpiter peccando blandiris?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="503" facs="tcp:93003:263"/>But besides that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does over value Penances and Corporal Austerities, and that the Generality of her Communion rest in the bare Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them; It is further to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that the Fasts of the Papists, for the most part, are not real Fasts; for tho' all be enjoin'd to fast <hi>Fridays</hi> and <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,</hi> yet on these Days they neither ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain totally from Food, nor so much as from Delicacies: They only forbear Flesh, but are allowed to eat Fish, and other things which pamper the Body and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Lust as much as Flesh doth, if not much more. Is a simple change of Meats to be esteemed a Fast? Does he mortifie himself, who feeds upon palatable and luxurious Food? Are not Flesh and Fish alike before God? Why should there be a Religious Distinction made betwixt them? Full meals of Fish are as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Fasting, as eating of Flesh: and he who feeds constantly upon Fish, is no more temperate and abstemious, than he who eats Flesh, provided he do it moderately, and not to Excess. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the New Regulation of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Orders, which restrain them wholly to Flesh, doth not serve the Ends of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion more, nor yet doth it mortifie the
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:93003:264"/>
Flesh better, than if they had been still allowed the use of Flesh: Nay, it is not agreeable to the Precepts and Nature of Christianity, to make such distinction of Meats, and place more Virtue and Religion in one than another. And as for the Severities of <hi>La Trap,</hi> and one or two more, which both encrease the Distempers of those who enter into them, and also do bring new ones upon them. This very Text without strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, doth shew that they are not at all to be approved, and that the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of them is a cruel Superstition: For tho' Sickness, when it is inflicted by God, ought to be received with an humble Submission, yet every one ought to take care of his own and Neighbour's Health as well as Life, and they who do Violence to either, commit a great Sin. Sickness, Pain, bodily Infirmities, and Indispositions, do hinder one from being useful and serviceable, and very often, also, they render the Mind dull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed for Devotion.</p>
            <p>But to go forward with the Text, as<note place="margin">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> of Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wine.</note> the Apostle adviseth <hi>Timothy,</hi> to forbear the continued use of Water, so he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joineth the use of Wine, whereby he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth<note place="margin">The use of it lawful.</note> the lawfulness of the use of that
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:93003:264"/>
Liquor against the <hi>Manichees, Encratitoe,</hi> and other ancient Hereticks, and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who maketh Abstinence from Wine, one of the principle Articles and Characters of his Religion. Our Saviour long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore warranted the use of it, by his own practice; and if it had not been lawful to drink Wine, he would not have made a Miracle for furnishing it to the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Cana.</hi> This, and all other the like Superstitions, concerning Meats and Drinks, are clearly and fully refuted by that Assertion of the Apostle in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter, <hi>Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving.</hi> But I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, there is none here inclined to any such Heresie, and therefore I will insist no more upon it.</p>
            <p>But as there is no question to be made<note place="margin">The Excess Unlawful.</note> of the Lawfulness of the use of Wine, so there is as little to be made of the Unlawfulness of the abuse of it, which is, alas, but too too common, and which St. <hi>Paul</hi> cautions against, in the words of our Text, when he enjoins but a little Wine: He mentions a little, not for <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>'s cause, for there was no fear of his running into excess, but for the sake of others, into whose hands this Epistle
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:93003:265"/>
might come, that none might pretend the Apostles warrant, for going beyond a due measure. <hi>A little Wine is good, it maketh glad the heart of Man;</hi> and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> bids <hi>give it to those that</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 31. 6.</note> 
               <hi>are of heavy heart.</hi> But too much is dangerous, for then it enflameth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, disordereth the Blood, distorteth the Countenance, and doth violence to the whole frame of the Body, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it an unweildy instrument for the Soul, and by frequent Excesses of this kind, the Mind is at last besotted, and the inward Faculties worsted: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle had good reason to say, <hi>Be not drunk with wine wherein there is</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>excess.</hi> And lest it should be thought that only weak Heads, who cannot bear Drink, but are soon intoxicated, fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these Prohibitions, the Scripture denounceth <hi>a woe unto them, that rise up</hi>

               <hi>early in the morning that they may follow strong drink, that continue until night till wine enflame them.</hi> The Creatures of God are good indeed, but the abuse of them is evil; they are created for our use, but they are not to be lavished away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Reason, Necessity, or Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency: The quaffing off as much as another, is in the stile of <hi>Drunkards</hi> and

               <hi>Bon Companions,</hi> called, <hi>a doing one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> but certainly it's against all reason to abuse the good Creatures of God, or our selves by an immoderate use of them, contrary to his express and peremptory Command.</p>
            <p>I cannot adduce all that can be said<note place="margin">The Evil of Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> against this Vice of Drunkenness, for that would carry us far beyond the measures of a Discourse. I shall pass over what Heathens have said, and what the very common light of Nature may furnish us with, and shall only give one or two Instances peculiar to Christianity. It is first then, contrary to that Duty of Watching against our Spiritual Enemies, which our Holy and Christian Calling obligeth us to: They are base and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Soldiers, who fall to Eating and Drinking when they know the Enemy is close at hand, and ready to give Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; we are begirt about with many, and subtile Enemies, and therefore should be ashamed of Excess and Intemperance in Eating and Drinking, which incapacitate us from defending our selves or resisting them. <hi>Be sober, be vigilant,</hi> (saith St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>)<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 8.</note> 
               <hi>because your adversary the Devil as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour.</hi> Secondly, It is disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:93003:266"/>
with a patient waiting for Christ: That Servant has little regard either to his Master, or his own Credit and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, who by debauching away his Sense and Reason, putteth himself out of a Condition of coming to his Lord when he is called, and of giving that account which is asked of him. O the horrour and confusion of being hurried out of this World, and carried before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of God, in a Fit of Drink and Excess! And yet this hath often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto Drunkards. <hi>Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to your selves,</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares of this life, and so that day come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares. If the servant say in his heart, my Lord delayeth his coming, and shall begin to beat the Men-servants and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and to eat and drink and to be drunken, the Lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him his portion with the unbelievers,</hi> Luk. xxi. 34. xii. 45.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is inconsistent with those Spiritual Exercises our holy Religion cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for, and indisposeth one for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:93003:266"/>
that holy Spirit, <hi>whereby he is to be sealed unto the day of Redemption. Be not drunk with Wine,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, wherein is excess, but be filled with the Spirit:</hi> In which words, he establisheth a direct opposition betwixt these two, so that the one necessarily thrusteth out the other. The Heart which is moved by Wine, cannot be sensible of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit: Nor can the Head be filled with the Spirit, which is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and overcast with the fumes of Drink. The Holy Spirit can only reside in pure and holy Souls, upon these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and many more that might be alledged, there is hardly any thing more unbeseeming Christians than Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, tho' alas, it be too too ordinary. And that a Clergy-Man should be guilty hereof, is not only most unbeseeming, but abominable: The very Supposition is horrid; That he should be given to this, who hath not only himself to watch over, but many others; who ought to wait his Lord's coming, not only to give account of himself, but of all under his Charge. The burthen of our Holy Calling is too great to be sustained by our own Strength: <hi>Who,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, is sufficient for these things?</hi>
               <pb n="510" facs="tcp:93003:267"/>
None therefore have more need of the Aids of the Holy Spirit than we, and therefore also none ought to be more careful to avoid what may grieve this Holy Spirit, and provoke it to desert us. And consequently Ministers should not be given to too much Wine, that they may be in a capacity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Spirit of God: And that when it comes, it may reside with them to direct, strengthen, and comfort them.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Reasons St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> The Reason of S. <hi>Paul's</hi> Advice to <hi>Timothy</hi> considered.</note> gives for prescribing <hi>Timothy</hi> a little Wine; to wit, <hi>his Stomachs sake, and his frequent Infirmities.</hi> It was not upon the account of Conscience, for upon this account Wine and Water are things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different; Neither the one nor the other is contrary to Piety, providing Water be not drank to Superstition, nor Wine unto Excess: But the Apostle consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Timothy</hi>'s weak Stomach, and the Diseases to which he was subject, for correcting the one, and preventing the other, he prescribed him the use of a little Wine, which is certainly a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, to be either drank alone or min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Water.</p>
            <p>

We should not take Pleasure in Eating and Drinking for themselves, but out of a regard to the ends for which they were ordained, and to which they are subservient; nor should the most delicious Meats and Drinks be lusted after, but what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth best to Health: And if God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford wholsome Meat and Drink, we ought to be content, though our Table be not furnished with Dainties.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we may learn hence the<note place="margin">2. The Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the Use of Means to remove Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</note> Lawfulness of using natural Means for the removing of bodily Distempers, and other outward Afflictions. Diseases as all other Afflictions are of God, it is his Hand which inflicts them, and therefore we ought to bear them patiently: But yet we may seek the Removal of them, and use what is fit and proper in order thereunto, without walking contrary to that Submission we owe to God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="512" facs="tcp:93003:268"/>Thirdly, it doth hence appear, that<note place="margin">3. The Gift of Healing not always used.</note> the Gift of Healing bestowed on the Apostles, and others at first, was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways used at the Arbitriment of him who had it, but upon some special Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Spirit, and at some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Occasions; when it tended to the Confirmation of the Gospel, or the making way for Mens Faith in it. For if St. <hi>Paul</hi> might have healed every Person, and at all times, he neither would have suffered his beloved <hi>Timothy,</hi> to be so much troubled with the bodily Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers here spoken of, nor yet <hi>Epaphroditus his fellow labourer, to be sick nigh unto death,</hi> as we read, <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 27. Which shews the Vanity of some Popish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, who that the healing promised by St. <hi>Iames,</hi> as the Effect of Prayers, and anointing with Oil, may not be referred to bodily Health, as is generally alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Protestants, say that then it would follow that none died in those Days, which is ridiculous: Whereas we see clearly here by the Example of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> That those who were endued with the Power of working Miracles, did not heal all the Diseases they met with, but did only exercise that Power on such Persons and at such times, as the Spirit
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:93003:268"/>
of God directed them to, for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Glory of God, and Honour of the Gospel; which also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us a Reason why Miracles are cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for they being given at first only for demonstrating the Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and evidencing that they who preached it were of God, now that this has fully appeared, there is no more need of Miracles.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The Apostles making mention<note place="margin">
                  <hi>VI.</hi> An Enquiry into the Reasons why God suffereth eminent and useful Persons to labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bodily Infirmities and Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Sickness, and being liable to frequent Infirmities of Body, gives us occasion to treat of a very important Question, <hi>viz.</hi> how it can be consistent with the Wisdom and Goodness of God, to inflict sore and heavy Diseases, and the like Disasters on eminent and useful Persons, such as <hi>Timothy</hi> was, whereby they are disabled from the Exercise of their Functions, and hindred from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Great Work of the Gospel, and the Salvation of Souls? If a King be engaged in War, doth he employ crazy and sickly Generals, and Captains? Would he not wish them perfect Health and Strength of Body, that they might be in a Capacity of disciplining the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and of going about to exhort and encourage the Soldiers? How then
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:93003:269"/>
comes it to pass that the Champions in the Christian Warfare, that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and Captains in God's spiritual Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, should be so much liable to bodily Distempers and Infirmities and other grievous Afflictions, nay more liable commonly than any other sort of Men, so that they cannot make those Advances and Progress which otherwise they would? The great St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> starts this Question upon this very Text, and handles it at great length in a particular Discourse, but I shall be very brief upon it, having been so large already, and shall only touch a little at those things which come properly under this Head.</p>
            <p>First, Then for Answer to this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,<note place="margin">First Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> the same Reason may be given for the Sickness and bodily Distempers, of the Ministers of the Gospel, even the most eminent, which the Scripture gives in general for the Afflictions of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, <hi>viz.</hi> That hereby they may be tried and perfected. God will not have his Children and Servants soft and effeminate, but wise and well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, which cannot be without putting them to divers Temptations and Afflictions. <hi>The Captain of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was <hi>perfected by sufferings,</hi> and by
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:93003:269"/>
the same means we must all arrive to true Perfection.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This is done to keep these<note place="margin">Second Reason.</note> Servants and Favourites of God in all Humility, and to preserve them from Pride, which would cast them out of his Favour. Men are naturally enclined to be proud, they are apt to be vain and lifted up, for the very common Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Nature, and how much more ready would they be, to be exalted in their own Conceit, for the special and much more valuable Blessings of Grace, if something were not done to them at the very time, to convince them of their Frailty and Meanness? After St. <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>caught up into the third Heavens,</hi> and had so many special Favours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on him, he tells us, <hi>Lest I should be exalted above measure, for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</hi> Some make this <hi>thorn in the flesh</hi> to be a grievous Pain in the Head, but I have not leasure to examine that matter.</p>
            <p>A Third Reason, is, That other Men<note place="margin">Third Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> may not think of them above what they ought to think. The World has been
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:93003:270"/>
generally too much enclined to magnifie their Heroes over-much; they have made Gods of meer Men, because of the Eminency that appeared in them, and upon the Account of the Benefits they had from them: Now God to restrain his People from such Absurdity, and that none of his beloved Servants em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by him, might become a Snare to others, or a Means of dishonouring himself: he therefore stamps them with visible Marks of humane Frailty: He makes them bear in their Body the signs that they are Men, that none may be so senseless as to Deifie them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God thus dealeth with the<note place="margin">Fourth Reason.</note> Servants whom he employeth in his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Work of the Gospel, that he may bring the greater Glory to himself; <hi>His strength is made perfect in weakness:</hi> The more weak, mean, and silly the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument is, the more doth his Wisdom and Power appear, which atchieve great things thereby. The Excellent and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Treasures of the Gospel are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto <hi>Earthen vessels, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the power may be of God, and not of men: He chuseth the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and the weak things of the world to confound the</hi>
               <pb n="517" facs="tcp:93003:270"/>
               <hi>things that are mighty: that no flesh should glory in his presence; but as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. i. 27.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Divine Providence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth<note place="margin">Fifth Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> these harsh Dispensations to these his Servants, to manifest the Truth and Sincerity of their Heart to all the World: How that they do not serve him for temporal things, as the Devil thought <hi>Iob</hi> did: Of whom God said to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>That he was a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil, who still holdeth fast his integrity although thou movest me against him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him without cause;</hi> and to make this fully and clearly appear, God suffered all these Disasters to befall him.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, One end of this Providence,<note place="margin">Sixth Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> is to keep People in hopes of a Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and future Rewards: For if the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Goodness of God, cannot but reward those who faithfully serve him, and that they receive not their Rewards in this Life, therefore it's certain there must be another, wherein they are given. <hi>If in this life only we had hope, we are of all men most miserable,</hi> saith our Apostle. And because it were most absurd to make him, and others like him, the most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:93003:271"/>
of Men, therefore their Miseries are a most convincing Argument of a better Life.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, God layeth Diseases on <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Seventh Reason.</note> and such other eminent Servants, that the weaker and meaner ones may have Comfort and Encouragement. Man is apt to despond in Adversity. Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are ordinarily construed Signs of the divine Displeasure, and Proofs of God's Rejection, which be of dangerous Consequence, and ready to run the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ignorant sort into Despair: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God to comfort such, he afflicteth his most beloved, that it may be seen <hi>whom he loveth he chastiseth, and correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every son that he receiveth;</hi> and so none may either despise or murmur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Chastisements of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Finally, God suffereth his chosen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,<note place="margin">Eighth Reason.</note> and whom he designeth to be Leaders of his People, to fall into fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Infirmities; not only that they may give Example of Patience unto others: But that all other People may be excited and encouraged, to imitate and follow them, in all other Vertues which shine forth in their Life. If the Prophets and Apostles, if the <hi>Timothys</hi> and other eminent Lights of the Church,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:93003:271"/>
had been exempted from the common Calamities and Infirmities of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, People would have concluded them, to have been something more than Men, and so would have excused themselves from the Imitation of them: But now that we see clearly, they are Men of the like Passions and Infirmities with our selves, what can we say? What Excuse can we pretend for not shewing the like Zeal and Devotion, and Piety and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Patience, and Courage which they manifested on all Occasions? The Weakness of our Natures needs not hinder it, for we see that those who were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as weak as our selves, have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to these and all other Graces, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to lay aside all Excuses, and to wrestle through all Difficulties, and to go on with St. <hi>Paul, fighting the good fight,</hi> and endeavouring to do all things commanded us <hi>through Christ that streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More Reasons might be given, but these are sufficient, not only to clear the Divine Wisdom, and Goodness of all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, but also to make them appear eminently in such Dispensations towards his best and most beloved Servants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="520" facs="tcp:93003:272"/>When I first entred on this Discourse,<note place="margin">Conclusion.</note> I intended to have taken in the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Verses, not thinking that this one would have furnished matter enough for a Discourse; but you see how far the handling of it hath carried us, and how without digressing from the Purpose of the Text, or doing Violence to the Words thereof, several material and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Observations have been drawn: From which we may see as St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> observes, the fullness of the Scripture, and that an inexhaustible Treasure of Wisdom and Knowledge is contained in it, when one single Verse, and so barren at the first Appearance, can afford so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and so useful Instructions. If one Verse can do such, what may the whole do? Surely, <hi>It is able to make us wise unto Salvation,</hi> and beyond all Question, <hi>is profitable for Doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the Man of God may be perfect, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furnished unto all good works.</hi> God grant that this Word of his may dwell in all Christians richly in all Wisdom; but especially in the Ministers of the Gospel, whose Office it is to instruct others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
