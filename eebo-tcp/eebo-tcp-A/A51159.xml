            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF I had any other deſign to ſerve by this Addreſs, than what was in my view when I preached the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermons, I would perhaps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to the favour of ſome particular Patron; but I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lay hold of this opportunity, that I may acknowedge (in as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

a manner as is poſſible for me) the many kindneſſes that I received amongſt you, when I was allowed to preach the Goſpel in my Native Country.

               <hi>Lord Provoſt and Town Council.</hi> I retain a grateful ſenſe of it; And this is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal reaſon why theſe Diſcourſes do now appear. I am not ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly fooliſh, as to think that the preſent Age needs any of my Compoſures: if they are innocent and well meant (though attended with many other imperfections) they may promote good thoughts in ſome who heard them with Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Attention. They are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calculated for their Meridian. Moſt men have different Taſts for
<pb facs="tcp:59505:4"/>
Books, as well as for other things, and what is ſincerely intended, may ſometimes be read with greater ſucceſs, than more accurate Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes.</p>
            <p>The World is very vain, and changes its Faces and Figures every moment, yet true Religion is inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, as the Author of it; and therefore we are to ſteer our courſe towards Heaven by thoſe great Truths that are uniformly received amongſt all Chriſtians; and to take heed, that we do not ſeparate from the Catholick Church of Chriſt, her antient Rules and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions by which ſhe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Primitive Ages. For it is certain, that God did not ſuffer the Univerſal Church to deviate from the Apoſtolical Diſcipline, when as yet <hi>ſhe</hi> was furniſhed with

no other Weapons to pull down Idolatry and Superſtition, than her Unity, Prayers and Univerſal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. There is nothing more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to Piety and Devotion, than Pride and Vanity; and to deſpiſe the Wiſdom of all our Predeceſſors, is, not only arrogant, but impious. The multitude and variety of later Sectaries (eſpecially in the <hi>Iſle of Britain</hi>) have advanced Atheiſm to a prodigious Impudence; and it is impoſſible to recover the World (now ſunk in Folly and Irreligion) but by the extraordinary Zeal of good Men. The decays of Piety in our days appear openly amongſt all Ranks and Orders; and this muſt be imputed in a great part to that Itch after Novelties, which hath ſo fatally overrun theſe Nations. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Faction, hath almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd the diſtinction between
<pb facs="tcp:59505:6"/>
things <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Prophane</hi>; yet it is certain, that <hi>the wrath of man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not the righteouſneſs of God</hi>; and thoſe pretended <hi>Reformations</hi> that are managed with Noiſe and Tumult, have ordinarily no other effects, than Sacrilege and Confuſion. We are very apt to have other thoughts of God and of our ſelves, when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Gates of Death, from thoſe which we have entertained in the days of health and proſperity; and if then we have the leaſt <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the World to come, we cannot but diſtinguiſh true Zeal to advance the Power of Godlineſs, from the inſidious arts of graſping Earthly Dominion: the firſt is pure, calm and humble, merciful and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate; the other being from the Earth, is agreeable to that Spirit that prevails in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59505:7"/>OUR <hi>Saviour</hi> founded the Church a diſtinct Society from the World, and therefore armed it with Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Laws and Cenſures, that ſhe might be preſerved by thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Helps, though all Earthly Powers ſhould endeavour to cruſh her; and experience witneſſes, that ſhe hath been more Victorious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Lewdneſs and Infidelity, by her Patience and Sufferings, than by all her Secular Intrigues and Political Methods. When <hi>ſhe</hi> ſtands upon the immoveable Pillars of her firſt foundation, her outward Splendor may be eclipſed, but her inward ſtrength is made more firm and laſting by the Counterbatteries that are raiſed againſt her Peace and Proſperity. Truth is not aſhamed and therefore it is Weakneſs and Puſillanimity to deny it in the face
<pb facs="tcp:59505:7"/>
of Danger and Perſecution; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the moſt Sacred Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are daringly invaded and trampled upon: and though Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Politie be thought now a-days as mutable as are the <hi>incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the people,</hi> yet they who conſider things more maturely muſt ſee, that the antient Faith cannot be preſerved amongſt men, but in its Original Vehicles of Primitive Order and Conſtitution; and when the Apoſtolical Government of the Church is overthrown, a multitude of Errors and Deluſions creep into the World, that deſtroy the inward Power of Godlineſs, as well as the outward Beauty of Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>I AM heartily ſorry, that our Country ſhould be the Theatre of ſo many Complaints and Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb facs="tcp:59505:8"/>
and that the immediate Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Sanctuary, both Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Presbyters, ſhould be run down with Clamour and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, for no other reaſon that I know, but becauſe they are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the World to the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Services of the Living God: notwithſtanding of all this, we ought to <hi>poſſeſs</hi> our <hi>Souls in Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and to believe, that <hi>not a hair of our head falls to the ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our heavenly Father.</hi> And this one Truth may compoſe our Spirits againſt all Storms and Diſaſters, and teach us to reſign our ſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtruggling to the diſpoſal of Heaven. When we are ſincerely humbled for our Sins (both Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and Perſonal) <hi>he will viſit us again in the multitude of his tender Mercies</hi>: and therefore it is more our duty to look unto him that
<pb facs="tcp:59505:8"/>
ſmites us, than complain of our Oppreſſors. It may be, that they themſelves who have been moſt active in our Calamities, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſenſible of their Cruelty; and if not, we heartily pray, that God would <hi>bring into the way of Truth all ſuch as have erred and are deceived.</hi> The preſent Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Church may be palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with many little Excuſes, but all the Rhetorical Colours imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble can never hide the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of ſo monſtrous a Change.</p>
            <p>WHEN we are ſurrounded with Difficulties on the right and left hand, we muſt <hi>make our requeſts known unto God by Prayer</hi>; for <hi>he is a preſent help in time of trouble.</hi> We may meet with Croſſes from the ſmalleſt things and occurrences; and perhaps our Afflictions are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb facs="tcp:59505:9"/>
multiplied, that we may be taught to run unto God, who can either mitigate or remove them, or by <hi>them</hi> exerciſe our Patience and Magnanimity. God knows all things, but he ſeems to take notice more particularly of ſuch things as we feel, and recommend to his Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodneſs and Compaſſion, ſo willing He is to have us depend on Him by the cloſeſt adherence.</p>
            <p>THERE is nothing more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to true Chriſtian Practice, than wrong Principles.<note place="margin">Mat. 6.23.</note> 
               <hi>Take heed therefore that the light which is in you be no darkneſs.</hi> The fear of God makes men move with a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Steadineſs in all their Actions; and nothing elſe yields true Peace at the hour of Death; <hi>A Conſcience void of offence towards God and towards Men,</hi> is the ſureſt Anchor againſt all

                  <hi>Lord</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulam.</note>IT was the Obſervation of a <hi>learn'd Philoſopher</hi> and a <hi>great Stateſman</hi> of our neighbour Nation, That a ſuperficial Inſight into Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd men to <hi>Atheiſm</hi>; but a more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough view of <hi>its</hi> regular Methods, and the Cauſes of things, did neceſſarily lead us to the acknowledgment of the <hi>Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HIS Reaſon is very plain: While the Mind of Man looketh upon ſecond Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſcattered, it may ſometimes reſt in them, and go no further; but when we behold the Chain of them confederate and link'd together, we muſt needs fly to Providence, and the contrivance of infinite Wiſdom. The Impreſſions of the Divinity upon Nature, are ſo legible, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> concludes ſuch inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable who do not acknowledge them.<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> His moſt glorious Attributes are, in a manner, felt in the works of Creation, even his eternal Power and Godhead,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59505:15"/>
being clearly ſeen by the things that are made.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> taught this <hi>Philoſophy</hi> before S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>19.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>The heavens declare the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, the firmament ſheweth his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy works; day unto day uttereth ſpeech, and night unto night ſheweth knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no part of this great Fabrick of the World, which doth not direct us to a <hi>Moſt Mighty Being,</hi> by whom it was made. But above all the reſt, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens which are ſo vaſtly extended (and wherein we ſee ſo many glorious Bodies) proclaim aloud the Power, Wiſdom, and Skill of that ſupreme Governor and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitector.</p>
            <p>THIS Conſideration tranſported the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> unto the moſt heavenly Raptures and ſeraphick Gratulations, So we find him in the <hi>eighth Pſalm.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>8.3.</hi>

               <hi>When I conſider thy heavens the works of thy fingers, the moon and ſtars which thou haſt ordained,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. <hi>When I look up to that celeſtial habitation, and conſider the beauty of that admirable ſtructure; how richly thou haſt gilded the roofs of thy outer houſe, with the lights that ſhine there; I am ſtruck down
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59505:16"/>
with wonder, I know not what to ſay; that thou ſhouldſt ſtoop ſo low as to take notice of man, or the higheſt amongſt the ſons of men, who dwell in houſes of clay, whoſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is in the duſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The inconceivable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between original Purity and Perfection and humane Miſery.</note>THIS Contemplation is ſo juſt and ſo natural to the Souls of Men, that it appeared frequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of the Church.<note place="margin">De Nat.

               <hi>Tully</hi> argues pertinently from this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it were the groſſeſt Stupidity, the moſt unaccountable Folly, the moſt unreaſonable Madneſs, to admit, that we our ſelves are endued with a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Wiſdom and free Election; that our Actions are managed by counſel and choice; and yet think, that the vaſt Machine of the World, the Harmony of all its parts, the Beauty, Order and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of all its wonderful productions, ſhould be deſtitute of ſome ſupreme and infinitely wiſe Contriver; to regulate its Motions and order all its Revolutions. And this may be diſcovered in the whole, and through every part of it: the divine Providence diſplays its Artifice in the works of Nature, to the conviction of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59505:16"/>
the moſt ſtubborn, and the obſervation of the moſt ignorant.</p>
            <p>THE Lillies of the field do exceed the glory of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the little Flowers that we overlook, preach the unimitable Wiſdom of their Creator. The Beauty of Nature, and its Productions infinitely ſurpaſſes the faint Endeavours of human Skill and Invention. In the beſt poliſh'd Steel we diſcern remarkable protuberan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but when we view the works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whether by our eyes immediately, or by the interpoſal of <hi>Microſcopes,</hi> we are forc'd to ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous are thy works, and that my ſoul knoweth right well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND yet no part of the viſible frame of Nature points more ſignificantly to the <hi>Deity</hi> than the <hi>Body of Man,</hi> which made the devout <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> retire into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as into the Abſtract and Epitome of the World, the Quinteſſence of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; he had for a while ranged abroad, his thoughts ran the circuit of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and ſaw, as it were, the <hi>Deity</hi> tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Spheres, ruling the Orbs, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the courſe of the Sun: when he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59505:17"/>
perceived that ſecret and univerſal ſpring of Motion (the wheel within the wheels) his unfathomable Wiſdom, his unlimited Goodneſs, his irreſiſtible Power, his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Providence, his unſearchable Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience, his Eyes that pierce to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets that are buried in darkneſs; then he comes home fully ſatisfied, fraughted, as it were, with the purchaſe of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, <hi>I will praiſe thee, O God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen,</hi> in his Book <hi>De <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu Partium,</hi> (which ſome ſay he wrote in a kind of divine Enthuſiaſm) the more he viewed the Skill that is tranſparent in the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of human Bodies, the Wiſdom and Art that ſhines in the formation of all the parts, the more clearly did he diſcover the Author of Nature. And tho he was no great Friend to Religion, yet his Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy conſtrained him to acknowledge, that there was ſome divine Skill, ſome inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hand that guided the motions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and preſided over all its actings; they appear to be ordered <hi>pondere, nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero, &amp; menſura,</hi> every grain weight weighed in the balance of infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59505:17"/>WE cannot look abroad either below or above, but all things preach the <hi>One Great Numen,</hi> whoſe Power and Preſence runs to and again, without whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Conduct, the Elements would break their mutual league and correſpondence, they would quickly jumble themſelves into their original <hi>Chaos,</hi> and break all the Laws of Order and Beauty.</p>

if blind Chance (which is no cauſe at all) had been the Parent of Proportion and Order. But <hi>Tully</hi> affirms, <hi>There is nothing ſo abſurd but ſome of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers did own and defend it.</hi> I leave this Contemplation, and let us ſee how far we may improve the <hi>Pſalmiſts Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> for the Government of our Lives.

            <p>The Text offers two things to our Conſideration.</p>

            <p n="2">II. The Foundation and Ground of his Acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>I conſider the laſt particular in the firſt place; which, tho it be laſt in the order of the Words, is yet firſt in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I mean the Ground and Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Acknowledgment,

            <p>GOD placed Man among his fellow Creatures, as Superintendent of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59505:19"/>
lower World. He is the Image of God, and in him ſome rays of the Divinity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and until ſuch time as he fell from his Obedience by Folly and Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all the lower Animals did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him as their Governour. He was plac'd upon the Theatre of the World, to hold intelligence with Heaven, to be the Mouth and publick Orator of the Creation; to admire the works of God. And he that was thus taught to admire, is himſelf one of the greateſt Miracles in Nature. But let us improve this Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to direct our Chriſtian Practice and Morals, And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> ARE our Bodies thus curiouſly fram'd, then certainly they ought not to be abus'd to the vileſt drudgeries of Sin. Why did God build ſuch beautiful Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles? Did he deſign this ſtately Habitation to be the receptacle of wild and furious Paſſions, and unbridled Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites; to be the dwelling-houſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirits? Is it uſual with wiſe and conſiderate Men to beſtow ſo much coſt and pains in building Houſes for keeping the filthieſt Creatures? Do Men erect ſtately Palaces for the meaneſt uſes? No
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59505:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
certainly. No more did God deſign that our Bodies that are ſo wonderfully made, ſhould be <hi>the inſtruments of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.</hi> To this purpoſe the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> exhorts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 v. 1. <hi>I beſeech you by the mercies of God, that you preſent your bodies a living Sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which is your reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervice.</hi> And again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. v. 15. <hi>Know ye not that your bodies are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt?</hi> How clear and ſolid is the Conſquence, <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>You are bought with a price, wherefore glorifie God in your bodies and in your ſpirits which are Gods.</hi> It was on this Conſideration again, that he exhorts the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>That every one ſhould know how to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs his veſſel</hi> (the Tabernacle where the Soul dwells) <hi>in ſanctification and honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Nimbleneſs and ſtrength of the body is not to be proſtituted to Sloath, Idleneſs and Luxury, thoſe Vices thwart the deſign of God, croſs the purpoſes of our Creator, baffle and affront the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our great Benefactor. Therefore we are taught by the curious Fabrick of our Bodies, to remember, that God takes ſpecial notice how we employ
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59505:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 494.9. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand, O ye brutiſh among the people, and ye fools when will ye be wiſe; he that planted the ear ſhall he not hear, and he that formed the eye ſhall, he not ſee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET me add to this that God is to be worſhipped with the Body as with the Mind: For he made both, redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both, and will glorifie both. I need not prove this, it were a reflection on the Gravity of my Hearers to offer at any proof of that nature. But there are amongſt us who have baniſhed the Worſhip of the Body out of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; to bow their knees, or to ſtand upright at ſome of the more ſolemn pieces of Worſhip, is thought Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and they meaſure the Purity of Religion, by its Ruſticities and Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies, and think that they are never got far enough from <hi>Rome,</hi> unleſs they oppoſe all the decent Cuſtoms of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized World. As if the Eternal Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of Heaven, were to be approached contrary to the Cuſtom of all Nations, the Devotion of all Churches, and the common Senſe of all Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59505:20"/>THE Devotion of ſuch reſembles the Superſtition of thoſe <hi>Pagans,</hi> that <hi>Strabo</hi> mentions, <hi>that offered none of the Fleſh of their ſacrifices unto their Gods, but affirmed that the Gods were contented with the Blood only, as if they had no regard to the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of their Worſhip.</hi> The behaviour of ſome of us, in the time of God's worſhip, would not become us in the preſence of our Governours. But cuſtomary and univerſal Faults are not ſo eaſily reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſome of them the more they are reproved, the more incurable they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi> IS the Body ſo curiouſly framed? Is this brittle and mortal Edifice ſo artificially reared? Are there ſuch prints of the Finger of God on this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, even whilſt we are here? then judge what it will be, when it is raiſed from the duſt, when it ſhakes of the diſhonours of the grave, and appears with its Robes of Light; when this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy clog of Fleſh and Blood is made pure and aerial, nimble enough to vie with the ſwifteſt Angels and fly with eaſe in the regions of Glory; when we ſhall be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59505:21"/>
all Life, Light, Spirit, and Wing, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſharers of Angelical Pleaſure. Now the earthly Tabernacle drags and pulls down the Soul to low and deſpicable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; then, the Body is made ſtrong and refined, to comply with the higheſt Capacities and Inclinations of the Mind.</p>
            <p>WE ſhall mount aloft from the Earth unto the Air, where his imperial Throne is erected. <hi>We ſhall ſhine ass the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the firmament, and as the ſtars for ever and ever</hi>; when we are got looſe from the Priſons of the Grave, and the Fetters of Corruption knockt off; but now in our preſent ſtate, how hard is it for us to raiſe our thoughts to the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Sons of God!</p>
            <p>WHEN we have our feet upon the top of Mount <hi>Zion</hi>; when we ſee the Glories and Empires of this little Globe below us, and we our ſelves beyond Danger and Temptation, far above its frowns and flatteries.</p>
            <p>How will our Souls be tranſported to find their Garments lighter? and our

the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that <hi>he ſhall change our vile bodies, that they may be faſhioned like his glorious body, by the power whereby he is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelf.</hi> With what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence then may we lay them down in their grave, ſince we are ſure to receive them again pure and incorruptible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Weakneſſes and Indiſpoſitions of their former Captivity.</p>

               <hi>The hour is coming when all that are in their graves ſhall hear his voice,</hi> we may triumphantly apply to our ſelves that place in the book of <hi>Job,</hi> 19.25. <hi>I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth, and though after my skin worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ARE our Bodies ſuch curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Repreſentations of his Wiſdom and Skill? then we ſhould treat them honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably and decently after the Soul is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. The firſt Chriſtians had a great care that the pooreſt of their number ſhould be handſomly interr'd, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times did they dreſs the bodies of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59505:22"/>
the meaneſt Chriſtians with coſtly Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and odoriferous Spices; that they might do honour to the human Nature, and teſtifie their hope of the <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; that the dear Companions of the Soul might be decently treated, and laid in their graves as in their ſafe repoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, until the general ſummons of the <hi>Arch-Angel</hi> awakened them.</p>
            <p>WHEN their Enemies obſerved their great care of the Bodies of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> (to do the Chriſtians deſpite) they burnt the Bodies of their dead, and ſcatter'd their Aſhes in the Sea, leſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans might have the ſatisfaction of doing the common offices of humanity to their deceas'd Relations. Certainly the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the dead ſhould be preſerved from all rude Affronts and Diſhonours, and <hi>Churchyards,</hi> that are the Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> ſhould not be places of paſturage for all kind of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. And would to God that the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty only were to be blam'd for this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Prophanation.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Are our Bodies ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly built? Judge what the Soul
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59505:23"/>
muſt be, that Lamp of Light, that Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Lord, the inviſible Jewel that's laid up in that Caſement; 'tis no leſs than the Breath of God, it bears the Image of the Deity in legible Characters. How active and indefatigable is it in the the ſearch of Truth? How much above the Enjoyments of Senſe, and feculent Pleaſures of the Body? With what tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport doth it embrace Concluſions drawn from their Principles? How fond is it of its own Contemplations, that are raiſed on the immoveable Pillars of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</p>
            <p>How ſwifts in its Thoughts? How eaſily does it fly round the Earth, climb the Heavens and view the Creation? 'Tis a divine Spark of Light, from the Father of Spirits, that glances in thoſe priſons of fleſh for a while; it's true Pleaſures are pure and Angelical; it graſps Truth for the ſake of Truth, with Order and Complacency, and makes to it ſelf Ladders of true Conſequences from the viſible Creatures, to aſcend to Heaven.</p>
            <p>BUT let us dwell a while longer on
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59505:23"/>
this Meditation. Did God furniſh our Minds with ſuch noble Powers only to till the Ground, <hi>and make proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the Luſts thereof?</hi> No certainly. This vaſt and capacious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that than lodge ſo many Truths to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without Confuſion or Diſorder, was deſign'd to enjoy God; any thing elſe falls ſhort of its Height and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur.</p>
            <p>WHENCE is this Appetite of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality that we feel within our ſelves? Is it altogether in vain? Did God place it within our Souls purely to vex us? Was there nothing deſign'd to ſatisfie it? Yes certainly; elſe Mankind had been a phantaſtick Impertinence; the vaineſt and the ſillieſt nothing in the Creation. <hi>For if in this life only we had hope, we were of all men the moſt miſerable</hi>; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the Earth, when our Souls fly far beyond it; and immured in the Walls of Fleſh, when their Capacities diſpoſe them for the Life and Enjoyment of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
            <p>ALL the reſt of the Creatures have Objects proper for their Appetites; ſhall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59505:24"/>
Man alone have Inclinations beyond the Earth, and yet die like the Beaſts that periſh? Let no ſuch thought enter our Souls, for <hi>we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET me add to this, If the Soul be ſo vivacious in its Walls of Fleſh, when 'tis chained in this dark Tabernacle, that (as <hi>Quintilian</hi> obſerves) it flies in a trace from one Object to another, nothing can engroſs its power and ſtrength: how large and comprehenſive muſt it be, when we come to our Countrey above; when we are united to the original Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Light and Truth? What a fooliſh violence doe we offer to our Souls, when we bend and bow them to earthly Enjoyments? Why did we not rather let them fly to the place of their reſt and tranquility? Their natural motion is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, and Chriſtian Religion deſigns no more than their Primitive Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>WHEN we would perſuade Men to be religious, we need not borrow our Arguments from foreign Topicks; let them only look inwards; let them view the frame of their own Souls, their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59505:24"/>
Knowledge, Will and Memory; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie Reflections of their Conſciences when they do amiſs, it makes them taſte, whether they will or not, the fears of an impartial Tribunal; that drags them, in the midſt of their Jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, before that Judge that can neither be deceived nor be impoſed upon.</p>
            <p>HEAR then the calm Reaſonings of your own Spirits: you may ſhift the force of our Arguments, when we have urged them with all Zeal and Sincerity; but you cannot hide your ſelves from that inviſible Judge, your own Souls.</p>
            <p>IT were Folly in the higheſt degree, to feed a hungry Stomach with wiſe Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, excellent Diagrams: or if ſuch things were offered for the cure of a Man in a raging Fever; this is the Folly we tranſcribe when we endeavour to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie our Souls with any thing ſhort of God himſelf; the Satisfaction and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that we look after is higher than the Earth. The Earth ſays it is not in me; and the Sea ſays it's not in me; and the Treaſures of both the <hi>Indies</hi> have nothing in them to feed the ſtrong
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59505:25"/>
Deſires of Immortality, or to fill the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of Reaſon.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Are our Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſuch Monuments of the Divine Wiſdom? ſhould we not then frequently view and conſider our own Frame and Compoſition. Why are we ſuch Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to our ſelves? <hi>When the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the great deep,</hi> the reſt of the Creatures were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their order, as they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to appear; <hi>by his word, that commanded things which are not as if they were</hi>; they were inded the more negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſtrokes of <hi>Omnipotence</hi>; but MAN appears by his deliberate Method, and ſet off with the Characters of his <hi>Image,</hi> in <hi>Wiſdom, Purity, Liberty, Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> What Majeſty in theſe Words, <hi>Come, let us make Man in our own Image?</hi> And if the very rubbiſh of this Edifice, the ruines of him in his lapſed Condition be ſo magnificent; what was he, when <hi>but a little lower than the Angels,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>8.5.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with glory and dignity?</hi> Eſpecially when we remember that ſtill he is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch Improvements. Recover him by Education from his childiſh Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59505:25"/>
from his untamed Luſt and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, furniſh him with Health, Strength, all Wiſdom divine and humane, inveſt him with publick Honour and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and then he is but ſome degrees <hi>below the Angels of God.</hi> And yet all this is but a ſhadow and a dream, in compare with what Improvements he is capable of, <hi>when regenerate to the Image of God, and the hope of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ARE not we our ſelves then worthy of our moſt ſerious thoughts? True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion teaches a Man to converſe with himſelf in the nobleſt manner, to covet the higheſt Improvements of his own Nature, to obſerve his own Failings. <hi>Seneca</hi> tells us in one of his <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> that it was his cuſtom every Night when the candle was out, calmly to examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and look narrowly into the Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his own Conſcience; this, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ſeriouſly performed, begat Calmneſs and Serenity in his Boſom, which he compares to the Regions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Moon, where there are no Clouds, no Vapours, no Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59505:26"/>BUT a wicked Man is afraid to look within himſelf; the violent Earthquakes and ſhakings of his Spirit, make thoſe Reflections intolerable. Did we thus take our ſelves more accurately to task, we would not have ſo much ſpare time, to deſcant on the Actions of others; we ſhould be more merciful in our Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, leſs ſevere in our Reflections, more equitable and juſt in all our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. When <hi>Pauſanias</hi> the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> deſired <hi>Simonides</hi> the Poet to beſtow ſome memorable Saying upon him, he gave him this, <hi>Remember that you are a man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND indeed this contained a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of the beſt <hi>Philoſophy</hi>; did we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that we are the Offſpring of God, could we proſtitute ſo noble a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſerve the Devil? could we debaſe our ſelves ſo far as to truckle under the Violence and Servitude of our Paſſions. <hi>Tully</hi> hath an admirable Saying to this purpoſe;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>L. 3.</hi> Off.</note> Put the caſe, ſaith he, that we ſhould carry any thing ſo privately, as that neither God nor man ſhould diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, yet we ſhould have ſuch a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59505:26"/>
for our ſelves, as not to ſuffer any thing that is immodeſt, unjuſt, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean to eſcape us. So terrible is the witneſs of Conſcience, and ſo infallible is its deciſion, in the great branches of our Duty.</p>
            <p>THEN <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Is Man ſuch a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous piece of workmanſhip? he muſt be under the peculiar Eye of Providence? Thus reaſons St. <hi>Paul, Doth God take care of Oxen, yes, the very Law, thou ſhalt not muzzle the Ox that treadeth out the corn</hi>; prove ſufficiently, that they are under his care, and the eye of his Providence.</p>
            <p>BUT the care that is extended to thoſe poor Animals that feed upon hay and corn, is far below the ſpecial care that he hath of Mankind. His delight is with the Sons of Men; there is a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar eye of Favour that watches over the human Race, and yet a higher degree of Love and Providence over good and holy Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.13. <hi>The Lord looketh from
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59505:27"/>
heaven, he beholdeth all the ſons of men.</hi> v, 14. <hi>From the place of his habitation he looketh upon the inhabitants of the earth.</hi> v. 18. <hi>Behold the eye of the Lord is on them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy.</hi> Pſal, 34.7. <hi>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</hi> But his Love towards Mankind is ſo ſtrong, that it cannot fall under Words.<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>He gave us his Son, and if he gave us his Son, how ſhall he not with him alſo give us all things. He did not take hold of the nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but of the ſeed of Abraham.</hi> It was his Love to us that engaged him <hi>to take upon him the form of a ſervant, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf unto death, even the death of the croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> IF God hath put ſuch Marks of Beauty and Honour on the human Nature, <hi>Let us love one another.</hi> So the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> enjoins, <hi>Honour all men; Love the brotherhood.</hi> There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing due to our Nature, under the cloud of the meaneſt Circumſtances: As the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> alleged, when he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed his Alms to an unworthy Perſon, <hi>Non homini ſed humanitati.</hi> Our Love
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59505:27"/>
muſt reſemble the Benignity of God, that <hi>maketh his Sun to riſe on the evil and the good, and ſendeth down Rain on the juſt and unjuſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LOVE is the life of Heaven, whence all Bitterneſs and Unkindneſs is baniſhed as far as Hell; 'tis planted in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we are enclined to it by our origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conſtitution; it is the Livery of the Chriſtian Religion, and the Badge of our Profeſſion. The Vices oppoſite to it make up the Devil's Nature and his Torture too; Anger, Bitterneſs, Envy and Revenge, create thoſe Storms that continually ruffle the compoſure of our Spirits; whereas the Practice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity hath in it the Fore-taſtes of Heaven, and the Life of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>THERE is no injury done to us can looſe us from this Obligation; no Error in Opinion; no Enormity in Practice; no Diſaſter of Fortune; for our Brother is of our kind, and however ſullied and defac't, retains ſtill the Image of God. The more frequently we conſider this, the more we are obliged to the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s reſolution,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59505:28"/>
               <hi>I will praiſe thee.</hi> Which leads me to the <hi>Second</hi> Particular that I mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s Gratitude and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment.</p>
            <p>Now in ſpeaking to this, I ſhall <hi>Firſt</hi> Mention ſome of thoſe Inducements that oblige us to it. And then <hi>Secondly</hi> preſs the Practice of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. GOD is to be praiſed, becauſe he is the only Object of Praiſe, Love and Admiration; nothing elſe can love us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain but God, or ſome other Creature that reſembles God. Therefore St. <hi>John</hi> exhorts, <hi>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world, if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND if he is to be praiſed becauſe of the Works of Nature, how much more becauſe of his ineſtimable Love in the Redemption of the World by our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let the pureſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, in their Robes of Light and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, admire it, and veil their Faces with their Wings, and ſtand at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and <hi>behold what manner of Love
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59505:28"/>
this is, wherewith the Father hath loved us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God.</hi> If we cannot fly about the World with that Swiftneſs and Rapidity as the Angels do in Heaven, yet what hinders our Souls to center themſelves in his Love by the moſt unquenchable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, when we contemplate his Love to Mankind manifeſted in Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE true exerciſe of our Reaſon requires it. What is that you admire? or what is it you purſue? The Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Reaſon are everlaſting, and they are never ſo duly placed as on God; <hi>who is invariable and without ſhadow of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for the world paſſeth away, and the faſhion thereof doth periſh:</hi> but a Mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by the Principles of Chriſtian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy endures for ever. Do but call to mind, as <hi>M. Antoninus</hi> hath it,<note place="margin">Cap. ult.</note> ſuch as have been in eminent Glory, the Hero's and Captains of former Ages; or ſuch as have been tumbled down by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, or run down with Miſery; ſuch as have engaged to talk of all Men in every Condition of Life, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. What's become of all thoſe things now? And ſhould our Reaſon
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59505:29"/>
ſpend its ſtrength in the chaſe of ſuch Shadows, it cannot be duly employed in ſuch tranſient Vanities; had we but a view of the Impertinencies and Vanities that paſs in one City, but for one day, how vain ſhould we find the World to be!</p>
            <p n="3">3. To praiſe God, is the Enjoyment of Heaven. The viſion of God, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Light of Reaſon duly ſix'd on its true Object, and advanc'd to its true Elevation, when the Soul is dilated and enlarged, and expatiates on its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Theme. Have you ſeen the Cedars or the Fir-trees, that riſe ſo high, and ſpread their Branches ſo wide, from a little Seed; juſt ſo is the Soul, how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely beyond its preſent ſelf are its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations then found to be.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Dearly Beloved, I beſeech you as ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and pilgrims abſtain from fleſhly luſts which war againſt the Soul.</p>
               </q>

            <p>FROM the ninth Verſe, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> ſets off the Dignity of the Chriſtian State, the Honour and Prerogative of that high relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Ye are a choſen generation, a Royal Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> They were thus advanc'd, that <hi>they might ſhew forth the praiſes of him that had called them, out of darkneſs, into
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59505:32"/>
his marvellous light.</hi> They could not but with the higheſt contentment and joy, call to mind, the difference between their preſent and their former condition.</p>
            <p>IT is upon this foundation, that S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> makes his addreſs with ſo much love and zeal, that he may provoke them to a life pure and heavenly, and becoming that relation into which they were late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adopted.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>Verſe</hi> that I have read, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes unto the Phraſe that he made uſe of, in the firſt <hi>Verſe</hi> of the firſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> which is addreſs'd <hi>to the ſtrangers ſcattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia and Bythinia,</hi> remov'd far from the Country and Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Anceſtors. It was eaſie for them (from the conſideration of their <hi>Earthly Pilgrimage</hi>) to remember that they were not only ſtrangers, with regard to that Country; but in a higher ſenſe, ſtrangers upon Earth, a people di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the World. And not only ſo, but quite contrary unto it, and far above it in their aims, ſtudies, and deſires.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:59505:32"/>THAT which takes up the thoughts, the talk, and the admiration of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, was ſo little valued by our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> that when he cloth'd himſelf with our fleſh, he drew up a Syſtem of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that ruin'd the eſteem that ſuch things had got in our affections; <hi>the luſts of the eys, the luſts of the fleſh, and the pride of life,</hi> did in a manner, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Adorations of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile.</hi> He ſtript thoſe Idols of that meretri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious varniſh and paint, that had for a long time inveigled Mankind; and he made himſelf of no reputation, that he might trample upon human glories, and raiſe our affections to that honor which is ſolid and durable. He exemplify'd his Precepts in his own practice; and by a new <hi>Philoſophy</hi> raiſed mens Spirits to a clear ſight of God, to a juſt value of themſelves; and conſequently, to the higheſt contempt of the World, in all its pomps and fantaſtick appearances.</p>
            <p>THE Exhortation that I have read, is ſo eſſential to the Chriſtian Religion, that it is enforc'd by its ſtrongeſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, every one may ſee it to be the natural reſult and conſequence of ſuch

heavenly Premiſſes, <hi>that we ſhould abſtain from fleſhly luſts</hi>; becauſe <hi>they war</hi> (or ſet themſelves in battel array) <hi>againſt the Soul.</hi>

And though I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the words in this extent and latitude; yet I deſign to level the moſt part of my Diſcourſe againſt fleſhly luſts in the ſtricteſt ſenſe; as they ſignifie all manner of uncleanneſs, contrary to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity. General Diſcourſes againſt vice, are ſeldom ſucceſsful towards the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of men from under their dominion: and therefore when we aſſault the body of death, we muſt level our ſtrokes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt particular limbs, and members, as the ſureſt, and the ſpeedieſt way to our victory.</p>
            <p>BUT that I may diſcourſe with the better ſucceſs, let us conſider <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation it ſelf, <hi>Abſtain from fleſhly luſts,</hi> and this Exhortation is ſtrengthen'd with
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59505:33"/>
a twofold Argument; one is taken from the oppoſition of ſuch luſts to the Soul; and the other taken from our preſent ſtate, condition, and relation: <hi>We are but pilgrims and ſtrangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW that I may make thoſe fleſhly luſts as odious to the Chriſtian eye, as is poſſible; I will in the firſt place lay before you ſome conſiderations, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them in their true and proper colors. And Secondly, I will offer thoſe Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from Reaſon and the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, by which we may be defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their aſſaults.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Do but conſider, that thoſe fleſhly luſts are directly oppoſite unto the Nature, Spirit, and Tendency of Chriſtianity. It was our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s great deſign, when he took upon him our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to fortifie our Spirits beyond the reach of bodily impreſſions; to eſtabliſh them in an abſolute Empire and juſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty over the Senſes; to exalt that part of us, that is divine and heavenly to its true elevation, that it might no more truckle under the body; that the ſenſes, and all the motions that we feel
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59505:34"/>
by them, might be kept at their true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and not meddle with that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and authority that belongs to the mind. In a word, that our Souls might be adorn'd with their true Glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. When we are thus ſet at liberty, then,<note place="margin">John</note> and not till then, are we <hi>free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi>; when we remember the value, ſtrength, and excellency of the Soul, which (though it be united to the Body, and therefore muſt mind the concerns of the Body, with great care and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet) it more vigorouſly deſires to be united unto God. It may ſubſiſt without its Union to the Body, but it cannot be happy, unleſs it be united unto God, ſo that this Union of the Soul with God is in a manner folded up in its very nature, and eſſence.</p>
            <p>WE are in the ſtricteſt ſenſe the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of God, and it was reaſonable for us to expect, that when the Son of God did appear to reform Mankind, he ſhould level his Directions and Precepts againſt thoſe vices and ſins, moſt vigorouſly, that did ſink the Soul below its true glory and dignity; the ſins that took down its Plumes, by which it mounted the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59505:34"/>
but now was become ſoft, trifling, and degenerate. And becauſe no luſts did break the vigour of our mind, and blunt the edge of our Spirits, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our union with God, more than fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts in the ſtricteſt ſenſe; therefore do we find the cautions againſt thoſe ſins ſo frequent in the New Teſtament, with this aſſurance, that <hi>he that is in Chriſt Jeſus hath crucified the fleſh with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and luſts thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Arguments that S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes uſe of againſt thoſe ſins are heavenly and ſublime. 1 Cor. 6.19, 20. <hi>Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghoſt, and you are bought with a price, therefore glorifie God, in your bodies and in your ſpirits, which are Gods.</hi> Anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to this, we find that the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians (notwithſtanding of the blackeſt Calumnies of their Pagan adverſaries) lived the life of Angels in earthly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; their Chaſtity was ſo great a Jewel in their eyes, that many of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Women moſt cheerfully reſign'd their life, rather than part with their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And <hi>Tertullian,</hi> towards the cloſe of his <hi>Apology,</hi> reſolutely defies the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59505:35"/>
of the <hi>Pagans:</hi> for they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did acknowledg the purity and innocence of the Chriſtians in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; becauſe they judg'd it a more into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable puniſhment for their Women to be condemned to the <hi>Stewes,</hi> than to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Martyrdom.</hi> How many of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Women among the <hi>Romans,</hi> when the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> made their Irru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption into <hi>Italy,</hi> threw themſelves into <hi>Tyber,</hi> rather than be expos'd to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Embraces of luſt and diſhonour? The Story of the young man recorded by S. <hi>Jerom</hi> is very memorable, who, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf entangled in the embraces of a wanton Strumpet, did bite off his own Tongue, and ſpit it in her face, leſt the ſtrength of his temptation, and the weakneſs of humane nature, might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him into Indecencies unbecoming his holy Profeſſion. We ſee then, it is moſt certain and clear, that fleſhly luſts are in their nature and tendency, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that Religion, which our <hi>Saviour</hi> planted, and the firſt Chriſtians em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> LET us remember, that theſe fleſhly luſts are ſeverely puniſh'd
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59505:35"/>
both here and hereafter. We are told by <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 6.26. <hi>that by means of a whoriſh woman, a man is brought unto a piece of bread.</hi> And the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> in the fifteenth of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the miſerable eſtate of ſuch with great advantage; the ſufferings that thoſe luſts expoſe men to are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to one ſingle capacity, but they ſpread their Poiſon not only through the body, reaching ſometimes even beyond the bones, into the marrow; but alſo through all the ſuffering capacities of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature; health, fortune, life, and reputation are the ordinary Sacrifices that are brought to the Altars of this unclean Devil. <hi>Solomon</hi> again tells us, Prov. 66.33. <hi>That a wound and diſhonour is his reward, and his reproach ſhall not be wiped away.</hi> Have you ſometimes obſerved the macerated Skeletons of Luſt worn in the Devils warfare, bearing the diſhonourable marks of their Maſters ſervice, ſometimes in their foreheads, to ſuch a degree of infamy, that hardly one would think, that Mankind could be made ſo miſerable? And though thoſe Trophies of Miſery have frequently been diſplayed, to the ſcandal of Religion,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59505:36"/>
diſgrace of human nature, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of all Spectators; yet ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are the moſt part of Mankind, and ſo ſtupifying is the Enchantment, that it requires a heavenly frame, and a bold Reſolution, to ſubdue thoſe imperious and ſtubborn luſts.</p>
            <p>How many did God remarkably pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh for this ſin? Numb. 25. <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozbie</hi> were ſlain in the very act, and <hi>four and twenty thouſand of the Children of Iſrael</hi> fell for their unlawful mixture with ſtrange Women. And though God had left thoſe filthy Creatures without Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, yet the ſin carries corruption in its Nature; <hi>for he that ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption,</hi> in the moſt literal ſenſe. Add to all this, the flames of unquenchable fire, that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Sons of Luſt and Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the other World. They may poſſibly eſcape the notice and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of earthly Judges; but when the hidden things of diſhoneſty are brought to light, then Heb. 13.4. <hi>God will judge whoremongers and adulterers.</hi>

               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59505:36"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> CONSIDER, that thoſe who give way to this kind of ſenſuality, are become ſtupid and irrecoverable, Prov. 23.27. <hi>A whore is a deep ditch, and a ſtrange woman is a narrow pit.</hi> Such as are immerſt in and deluded with this enchantment, may be compar'd unto the Companions of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> who could not be brought back to their Ships; but by Whips and Rods, when once intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the juice of that Herb amongſt the <hi>Lotophagi.</hi> We are told by <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 27.22. <hi>That though you ſhould bray a fool in a Morter, yet will not his folly depart from him.</hi> So appoſite is the ſimilitude that he makes uſe of, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the folly and ſottiſhneſs of the Man, that is entangled by the artifice and inſinuations of a Whore, Prov. 7.22. <hi>He goeth after her, as an Ox goeth to the ſlaughter</hi>; the one ſees not his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, no more than the other, <hi>and as a fool to the correction of the ſtocks.</hi> Such is his ſtupidity, he marches faſt forward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fatal period of irrecoverable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence, whence there is no returning, Matth. 12.43. <hi>When the unclean ſpirit is gone out of a Man, he walketh through

dry places ſeeking reſt, and finding none,</hi> &amp;c. The Devil hath the character of the unclean Spirit faſtned upon him by ſpecial propriety. I might add to this, that though by our Nature, <hi>we are a little lower than the Angels</hi>; ſet over the inferiour Creatures, yet thoſe fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts do ſink us below the beaſts that periſh.</p>
            <p>BUT in the ſecond place, I promiſed from the Holy Scriptures to offer thoſe Remedies that are moſt effectual to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain, and cure thoſe vicious Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. LET us maintain a lively ſenſe of Gods univerſal preſence, <hi>to whoſe eyes all things are naked and open: for the night, and the light, are both alike to him.</hi> Did we dwell on the thoughts of his Nature with ſtedfaſtneſs and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, how eaſily would theſe Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons quench and diſſipate the fiery darts of the Devil? Did we keep the eye of our Soul fixt on his Purity, thoſe impure Spirits durſt not lodg within our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms. 'Twas this that kept the modeſt and generous Soul of <hi>Joſeph</hi> free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59505:37"/>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. amidſt the careſſes and ſolicitations of an imperious whoriſh Woman.</p>
            <p>This ſenſe of his preſence, is like the Angel, that with a flaming ſword guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Paradiſe. Our hearts thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays of the <hi>Church</hi>), Cant. 4.12. <hi>A garden incloſed, and a fountain ſealed.</hi> This is it that baniſhes vain thoughts, idle muſings, and luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fancies from the mind, Prov. 4.23. <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the iſſues of life.</hi> And Matth. 23.26. <hi>Cleanſe firſt that which is within the Cup and Platter, that the outſide of them may be clean alſo.</hi> If this fire be not ſmother'd and quench'd within, it will break out upon all occaſions, unto unhandſom ſignifications of that diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that the Soul is ſick of. Therefore that we may attain a maſculine and a ſolid habit of Spirit, proof againſt thoſe temptations, that ſhake and diſturb ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Souls: Let us maintain a conſtant Converſation in heaven; Let us dwell with God until we feel him, and the beams of his Majeſty and Power, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing all inordinate motions within
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59505:38"/>
us. By this our Souls are taught to fly aloft above thoſe feculent Exhalations, that blindfold the more unwary and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Spirits.</p>
            <p n="2">AND next to this, let me 2. adviſe the keeping a ſtrict guard over our ſenſes. It was the reſolution of <hi>Job, He made a Covenant with his eyes</hi>; and the Prayer of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.37. <hi>Turn away my eyes from beholding vanity.</hi> And our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> inſinuates how ſoon the Soul is fired by thoſe windows. Add to this, that we ſhould be careful of our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. <hi>Can a man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>carry fire in his boſom, and not be burnt?</hi> We are to ſhun the Diſcourſes and filthy Communications of men of corrupt minds. It was generouſly done of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> the Great, to reject the overture made to him by ſome of his Flatterers of viſiting the Wife and Daughters of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> when taken Captive in the War, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo much commended for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Beauty: He ſaid, it was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming, and diſgraceful, that he, ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a Conqueror, who had overcome ſo many men, ſhould expoſe himſelf to the hazard of being overcome by Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59505:38"/>
In this he was truly more trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant than in all his Victories beſides: and <hi>Solomon</hi> proves, that he that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes himſelf is more generouſly victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, than he that taketh a City; the Conqueſt of the one lies much in the Valour of Souldiers, Conduct of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Strength of Armies; and all theſe things may be in the poſſeſſion of one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for Vice and Folly: but the Victory over a Man himſelf, proceeds certainly from his more divine half, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ground of his earthly and ſenſual part. Here then lies the true Excellency of our Nature, that we are recovered from under the Dominion of Senſuality, to that Soveraignty over the Senſes, which is the Birth-right of the Soul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE moſt appoſite Remedy that we can adviſe men to, for the reſtraint of fleſhly Luſts, is <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi> And to tell freely what I think in this matter, moſt of all the carnal Vices ow their beginning and growth to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this Duty of <hi>Faſting</hi>; which I cannot ſo properly call a particular Duty, as a ſafe and ſure Antidote againſt all Vice, eſpecially when it is attended with <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59505:39"/>
Prayer</hi> and <hi>Devotion.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſeems to join them both together in S. <hi>Matthew</hi> 26.41. <hi>Watch and Pray, that ye enter not into temptation.</hi> And 'tis moſt certain that a full Belly is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Watching, and as improper for fervent Prayer. This is acknowledged by the light of Nature; the <hi>Pagans</hi> at all times when any thing extraordinary threatened their Peace and Happineſs betook them to Faſting and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſo ſevere was the Faſt enjoin'd by the <hi>King of Nineve.</hi> And therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour made Faſting no new Precept of his Religion, but only gives Directions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; that the performance of it may be kept ſafe from Hypocriſie, Oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Superſtition. All Philoſophers that endeavoured to advance Morality to any degree of Reputation, judg'd it very worthy of their Practice; not only for the Sobriety of the Mind, but alſo for the Health of the Body; even <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> himſelf had his faſting days. Tho we had not immortal Souls to ſave, tho we had not the View of <hi>ſo glorious a Crown and Prize</hi>; yet when we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how many are the Errors of our daily Converſation; how apt we are to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59505:39"/>
in the conduct of our ordinary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; and how fond we are of our Mirth, Friends, and our ordinary Delights, and how readily our moſt accurate Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings may deceive us; how quickly our Tongues pour out thoſe things that are diſhonourable to God, hurtful to our Neighbours, nauſeous to our Friends, and diſgraceful to the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I ſhould think that we have more than ordinary Inducements to oblige us to ſet apart ſome Portions of our time to converſe with God, and with our own Souls. That we who ſee Motes in our Neighbours eyes, may at laſt pull out the beam out of our own.</p>
            <p>WHEN we read of the ſtrict Diet of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to which they were tied by the common Law of Chriſtianity, and withal remember their ordinary Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment from the World; a Catalogue whereof we have in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>In all things approving your ſelves as the miniſters of God, in much patience, afflictions, in neceſſities, in diſtreſſes, in ſtripes, in impriſonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in faſtings.</hi> I ſay, when we call to mind, that this was
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59505:40"/>
their entertainment, one would think, there needed no more to keep their fleſh within bounds, and under the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect command of Religion. And yet we find, that the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> laſt cited, did uſe voluntary chaſtiſements and reſtraints towards himſelf, that he might be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſengaged from all fleſhly ſolicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 1 Cor. 9.26, 27. <hi>I therefore ſo run, not as uncertainly, ſo fight I not as one that beateth the air,</hi> but <hi>I keep under my body, and bring it unto ſubjection, leſt that by any means when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND it is moſt certain, the reaſon why we are not ſo ſucceſsful in our reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions againſt vice and folly, is that we are not ſo particular in our choice of particular means and methods againſt particular ſins. <hi>When we beat the air</hi> (in the language of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>), and never aim our ſtrokes at particular ſins; we hover, and are bewilder'd in the midſt of many indefinite projects and fancies; if we reſolutely fight againſt the body of death, we muſt wound it in ſome particular limb, before the ſtrength
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59505:40"/>
of the whole be taken down. And therefore I would heartily adviſe all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious men, in their retirements to ſingle out ſome particular ſin, to which they find themſelves more inclin'd, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their ſpecial reſiſtance. And this method hath this advantage alſo, that not one ſin falls, without the ruin of many others, to which it is nearly related. And to cloſe this advice in one word, young and robuſt people, that are health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and vigorous, where there is no danger of ſickneſs, infirmity, or old age, ſhould frequently faſt and pray, that they may be ſtrengthened againſt temptations, that their Spirits being recollected, they may with greater ſecurity venture abroad in the midſt and hurry of ſecular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances.</p>
            <p>So far have I diſcours'd againſt Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Luſts, in their reſtrain'd ſignification, as they proceed from wantonneſs, and laſciviouſneſs. But I ſee no neceſſity why we may not underſtand the <hi>Fleſhly Luſts</hi> in this place, in their full extent, as they ſignifie all thoſe unruly paſſions, and deſires, that act the unregenerate part of Mankind, and drive them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59505:41"/>
upon innumerable Precipices of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, folly and miſchief; all of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by S. <hi>John</hi> to three heads, <hi>the luſts of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life.</hi> All thoſe gilded nothings, and hurtful Idols, that Mankind gaze upon with ſo much dotage and fondneſs, all of them, whether ſingly conſidered, or in the bulk, are contrary to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Genius of Chriſtianity, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with true peace and tranquility of mind, and wholly ſet againſt the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of our Souls. We have a Catalogue of them in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Chap. 5. v. 19. In which Catalogue, <hi>the Luſts of the Fleſh,</hi> ſtrictly ſo called, are placed in the front, Now the <hi>works of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe, Adultery, Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs, Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, Hereſies.</hi> V. 21. <hi>Envyings, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Drunkenneſs, Revellings, and ſuch like, of the which I tell you before, as I have alſo told you in times paſt, that they which do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:59505:41"/>THE <hi>Apoſtle</hi> then bids us <hi>abſtain from thoſe Luſts,</hi> that are ſo directly oppoſite in their nature and tendencies to the beauty and juſt intereſt of our Souls.</p>
            <p>AND this leads me to the ſecond Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that I deſign to ſpeak to, and that is, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s firſt argument againſt thoſe <hi>Fleſhly Luſts,</hi> taken from their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Soul. They are drawn up in battel array againſt the natural life, as well as the mind. And that I may make this apparent in a few words: 'Tis eaſie to obſerve, that they war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Soul, in its pureſt and higheſt excellencies; and though they cannot commit a direct rape and violence upon its Spiritual Nature, yet do they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine all their force and ſtrength, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and allure it, unto unworthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances. And this is ſo much likely to ſucceed, in that we are plac'd in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of Heaven and Earth. Our Souls hang between the pleaſures of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and its own Speculations; and theſe objects that our Bodies feel, make ſuch impreſſions upon us by their neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that it is with great difficulty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59505:42"/>
that the Soul is victorious over their importunity, and frequent aſſaults. Now all the prejudice that the Soul can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, may be reduc'd to theſe three Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT may be ſullied in its natural per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and operations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IN its moral endowments and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT may be depriv'd of its ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural rewards, and carnal Luſts do war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Soul in all theſe regards.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I SAY, they war againſt it in its natural perfections and excellencies. Now the true perfection of the Soul, is, to be united unto God. This is its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural element, the contemplation of truth, is its true and proper employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if by the enchantment of our Senſes, we have forgot our ſelves, yet, the accuſations of our Conſciences, the pricking, reproofs and regrets of our mind, amidſt the noiſe, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of external avocations, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inform us, that our Souls are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated againſt their original tendency, when they are made to worſhip the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59505:42"/>
Creature inſtead of the Creator. We were originally deſign'd to view the Creation, but not to reſt upon it, not to dwell in its embraces; but ſo far to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, that by thoſe Ladders we might climb unto the <hi>Author</hi> of our <hi>Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HEAR then the reaſonings of our own mind. How have we enſlaved them, to thoſe mean and abject drudgeries that are unworthy of their Nature and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal? Now thoſe Spirits that are Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to Cherubims and Seraphims, by complying too much with their Senſes, are become feeble, flat and unweildy, for their more genuine and ſpiritual operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Had we nothing elſe to do, but to <hi>make proviſion for the Fleſh, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Luſts thereof,</hi> we needed not ſuch Souls, as now we are furniſhed with Souls that can graſp ſo many truths to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and lodge them without confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or diſorder; that ſearch into the Secrets of Nature, and feel pleaſures wherein the Body can have no ſhare. Why ought we to have ſuch intellectual furniture, if we had nothing elſe to do, but to move above the ſurface of the ground for ſome few Months, or Years,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59505:43"/>
and then lye down in eternal ſilence, in the cold embraces of the Grave? 'Tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Goodneſs and Wiſdom of God, to make ſo noble a Creature, and aſſign him no higher end; than what may be attain'd with greater advantages, by the Beaſts that periſh. But thoſe <hi>carnal luſts,</hi> do not only weaken and blunt the edge and vigor of our Spirits, in their natural perfections.</p>
            <p>BUT 2. They do ſully, darken, and defile them in their moral endowments. See with what ſolemnity and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence the Hiſtory of our Creation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd, Gen. 1. <hi>Let us make man in our Image.</hi> 'Twas a deſign truly becoming the Majeſty of God, to repair the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches made in this Image. We are fallen from our Original Life and Purity, that beauty and light, that adorn'd our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is become almoſt deformity, and darkneſs; and ſo incurable is this bruiſe and wound, that all the Rules of human <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> cannot remove the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. <hi>God was manifeſted in our fleſh, that he might heal our Nature, and reſtore his own Image upon our Souls:</hi> he awakens us to fix our eye on this, as our higheſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59505:43"/>
honour, <hi>to be renewed again to the Image of him that created us.</hi> And when he diſparages the things that chiefly take up the thoughts of Mankind, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to remove our miſtakes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, he does it by this ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous motive,<note place="margin">Matth.</note> 
               <hi>that ye may be like your Father which is in heaven.</hi> To be like God, is the higheſt beauty, and the moſt glorious ornament of rational Souls. The Image of God conſiſts in light, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, love, univerſal benevolence, unconfin'd Goodneſs, Charity, Patience, Greatneſs of Spirit. Now where thoſe Graces are, there heaven is begun, and the Soul is made ſtrong, and impregnated with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine force, <hi>is more than Conqueror, through Jeſus Chriſt that loved us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have heard the Catalogue of the <hi>Works of the Fleſh,</hi> out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians</hi>; Let us view next <hi>the Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> that are reckoned, v. 22. <hi>Love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Galat. 5.</note> 
               <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, againſt ſuch there is no Law.</hi> When we confront the one with the other, the Fruits of the Spirit with the Luſts of the Fleſh, there is no doubt to be made, but
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59505:44"/>
that by the laſt, our Souls are much ſullied and defiled in their moral en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THOSE <hi>Fleſhly Luſts</hi> rob us of our ſupernatural rewards, not only by their merit, but by their natural cauſality: they indiſpoſe us for that place and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, where nothing enters that is impure. Let us then awake, and ask our ſelves, if no conſideration, no argument, be ſtrong enough, or great enough, to ſtartle us out of our ſleep and lethargy? Muſt thoſe Souls of ours that have been made to ſerve God, and to converſe with him in the nobleſt manner, be ſuffered to grovel in the duſt, to look no higher than the entertainments of Goats, and Swine, and Worms? O! what an indignity is this to our Nature! what a reproach to our Manhood! what a diſhonour to the Author of our Being! how diſgraceful is it to be accus'd of ſuch follies, (as tne moſt part of Mankind are engaged in) before the Throne of God!</p>
            <p>THERE is a ſecond Argument to alienate our affections from <hi>fleſhly luſts</hi>; and that is taken from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59505:44"/>
of our ſtate and condition, <hi>We are Pilgrims and Strangers</hi>: Men cut off by their Religion, from the Earth, whoſe aims and deſigns, are for another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and a life more pure and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, more fixt and ſerene. We are told by the <hi>Author</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews, that here we have no continuing City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT I may make this a little more clear, let us enquire, in what ſenſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are ſaid to be <hi>Strangers upon Earth:</hi> and Secondly, What improvement we are to make of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THEY are ſtrangers in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. It is the moſt infallible character of a ſtranger; ſo the Maid that accus'd S. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſhe thought, ſhe was very ſure he was a <hi>Gallilean.</hi> The Chriſtian breaths in a heavenly air; his heart (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently his tongue) is perfum'd with the odors of heaven. S. <hi>James</hi> exhorts us, Chap. 2. v. 12. <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be judged by the Law of Liberty:</hi> And the ſame S. <hi>James</hi> in Chap. 1. v. 26. aſſures us, <hi>That if any man ſeem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, he deceiveth his own heart,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59505:45"/>
his Religion is vain.</hi> And again, <hi>He that offendeth not in word, is a perfect Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE faults of the tongue are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, that glibe, ſlippery, and nimble Member, that is certainly the glory of our Nature, is frequently abus'd to the diſhonour of God. S. <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 3. excellently paints its unrulineſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance, v. 6. <hi>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity, ſo is the tongue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our members, that it ſetteth the courſe of nature on fire, and it is ſet on fire of hell.</hi> We are exhorted by the <hi>Apoſtle, to have our ſpeech ſeaſoned with ſalt; that we may know how to anſwer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, with Chriſtian diſcretion, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and charity, free of all filthineſs, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, levity, ſlander, detraction, or evil ſurmiſings.</hi> Let us by our tongues diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the language of our Country, of that heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is above, where the tongues of the Inhabitants are wholly taken up in the praiſes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:59505:45"/>2. THEY are ſtrangers with regard to their Laws, Matth. 5. v. ult. <hi>Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you, bleſs them that curſe you.</hi> Can there be any thing devis'd or thought of, that runs more directly oppoſite to the Spirit and Genius that prevails in the World? the treachery, rapine, revenge, fraud, and ambition, that fill all places with noiſe and tumult? They that fight under the Worlds ſtandard, look upon thoſe pure Laws of Chriſtian, innocence, humility and patience, as the Romantic follies of imagination. Their luſt, revenge and paſſion give them Laws; they diſdain to ſtoop to thoſe Laws that are ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the Statutes of the Kingdom of darkneſs: and therefore the ſerious Chriſtian is judg'd a fool by the World, when this undefil'd Religion becomes the rule of his actions. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> in the forming of his Laws, had an eye to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and diſparage all thoſe things that the World moſt admires; preſent and ſharp revenge ſatisfies the carnal man to the higheſt degree; and nothing ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and gallant in his eyes. But the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59505:46"/>
Chriſtian Religion reſtrains the very firſt motions towards anger; it ſtifles thoſe flames, before they break out into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, paſſion and revenge. In a word, it was the deſign of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> to ſtrip the World bare of that painted glory, which it had from our deluded imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He came to rectifie our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and inform us, that <hi>to make us meet partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light</hi>; we muſt be rul'd by other Laws, than the Laws and Threatnings of this World. When ſuch as were left of the Race of <hi>David</hi> (relations of our <hi>Saviour</hi>) were brought before <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperour, becauſe of his Jealouſie, leſt any of them ſhould aſpire to the Crown; they told him plainly, that our <hi>Saviour was a King, but his Kingdom was not of this World</hi>; and for themſelves, all the poſſeſſions they had, was a few Acres, out of which they paid a good Tribute to him, and maintain'd themſelves with the reſt, through their hard labour, and great temperance. The Laws then, and the deſigns and aims of this Kingdom, are different from the Laws, the Principles, and the Maxims, by which worldly men are govern'd.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:59505:46"/>3. WE know they are ſtrangers, by their entertainment from the World. The World does not treat and entertain thoſe ſtrangers, with that kindneſs and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity, they ſhew to their own Children. When the <hi>Samaritans</hi> perceiv'd, that our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s face was toward <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they perſecuted him with all the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of rudeneſs and diſdain. We muſt not think, that the World ſhould careſs and flatter us, if we are the followers of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> for the Kingdom and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that ſupport us, are of an inviſible Nature. And our <hi>Saviour</hi> told ſo much plainly to his Diſciples, when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to leave them, John 15.18, 19. <hi>If the World hate you, ye know that it hated me</hi> before it hated you, <hi>if ye were of the World, the World would love his own, but becauſe ye are not of the World, but I have choſen you out of the World, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World hateth you.</hi> And again, <hi>Fear not, for I have overcome the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We know ſtrangers by their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, by their way of living and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. If they differ in their habit, their air, their manner of life, we find
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59505:47"/>
that they are perſons of another Climate. This is viſible in the Chriſtians, though they live in the World, yet they are not of the World; they are govern'd by the Laws of another Kingdom. We are told by the <hi>Ancients,</hi> that the <hi>Pagans</hi> brought this accuſation againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that they differ'd in their Laws, and way of living, from all Nations under Heaven. Thus the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhorts, Phil. 2.15. <hi>That ye may be blameleſs, and harmleſs, the ſons of God without rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Nation, among whom ye ſhine as lights in the World.</hi> And the <hi>Apoſtle Peter</hi> exhorts them <hi>by their heavenly converſation, to put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men.</hi> The light and beauty of Chriſtianity, is a conſtant reproach to the <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and Irreligion of the World; there is ſo much of true Majeſty, and Innocence, to be ſeen in their behaviour, they wear his Livery in defiance of all oppoſition, they are known to be of another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THEY are Pilgrims and Strangers by their motion, flight, and journey from the World; their reſt, and habitation is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59505:47"/>
not here; they are on wing to their Country, which is above; their deſigns and thoughts are there; their biaſs, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies and breathings lead thither; they vilifie all the glory, pomp and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of this vain World; and the Idols that the moſt part of Mankind worſhip, are no more in their eſteem, than the toys and rattles of our Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. The Children of this World dwell here with pleaſure, the thoughts of their removal are grievous and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but we muſt have the other World conſtantly in our view, and by that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, order and direct the whole courſe of our actions. And it is eaſie to improve this truth to our ſpiritual advantage. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Are we ſtrangers upon Earth; then let us frequently think upon our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, whilſt we are almoſt frozen here, in the regions of the ſhadow of death. 'Tis comfortable to look above, where it is a perpetual Sun-ſhine. This lower Country is overcaſt with clouds, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, and thick darkneſs; round about us we hear nothing but ſcrieches, groans and complaints: and though we had no
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59505:48"/>
ſhare in thoſe infelicities, yet it is uneaſie to any man, that is not utterly void of pity and compaſſion, to behold the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable miſeries of others.</p>
            <p>OH! when ſhall we be above this hurry and noiſe, this diſorder and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Can there be any Cordial ſo ſtrong to ſupport us, as the thoughts of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Manſions that are in our Fathers houſe?</hi> Let us with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. v. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Take his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes to be our ſongs in the houſe of our pilgrimage.</hi> When we think of our Country above, <hi>we ſigh, as the Babylonian Captives,</hi>

               <hi>upon the banks of Euphrates, and hang our Harps upon the Willows</hi>; ſince we are not at liberty to <hi>ſing the Songs of Zion,</hi> with that harmony and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light we aim at.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſaid of <hi>Cain,</hi> that <hi>he built a City when he went from the preſence of God,</hi> he meant (as one gloſſeth it) to fix his reſidence here. But <hi>Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, went from place to place, and dwelt in Tents, and ſaw the promiſes afar off,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> and confeſſed that they were but Pilgrims and Strangers upon Earth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 120. v. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Wo is me</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>that I ſojourn in Meſech,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59505:48"/>
and dwell in the Tents of Kedar.</hi> How frequently ſhould we mount aloft in our thoughts and meditations? Such fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent flights from the Earth, would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us againſt the flatteries of ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; nay, they provoke us to the moſt vigorous endeavors after the happineſs of another life. They teach us to deſpiſe this World with all its pageantry and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and with magnanimity to bear all the croſſes incident to this ſtate. They quiet our ſolicitudes, and raiſe our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, to the moſt noble and generous undertakings. They fill our hearts with joy and peace, in believing; and amidſt all our anxieties and fears, teach us <hi>to poſſeſs our Souls in Patience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. IF we are ſtrangers here, we ought to ſtudy the diſpoſitions that prepare us for the happineſs reſerved for us. That Kingdom above is govern'd by other Laws, and the inhabitants of that place are at liberty from their ſins, their fetters are knocked off, and they wear Crowns and Diadems, more bright, than that of the mightieſt oppreſſors. 'Tis our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to enquire, how near we are to that bleſſed temper of love and tranquillity,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59505:49"/>
that prevail in the Regions of Light. The general notion of happineſs is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to our imaginations, but that life and immortality, which is promis'd in the Goſpel, cannot be poſſeſs'd, but by ſuch, whoſe Souls are of a piece with it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Since we are ſtrangers, we muſt patiently bear the uneaſineſs of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition. We muſt with zeal and courage undergo the rougheſt accidents of this Life. We are not to be careſs'd with the delights and pleaſures of this World; <hi>we muſt fight manfully under the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> We are not to meddle with the affairs of the World with that concern and application of mind, that the Natives do: for we are ſtrangers; and it is the higheſt impertinence for ſuch to engage too far in other mens buſineſs. Let us not be ſtartled too much with the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of events here below. Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unſolicitous and fixt in our choice: for, the Skreen is ſhortly to be drawn, and we ſhall have a full view of thoſe intricate Methods of the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that now perplex our enquiries. We ſhall have our feet upon Mount
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59505:49"/>
               <hi>Zion,</hi> and from thence look down with joy, that we have ſo happily eſcaped the toſſings of this tempeſtuous Sea.</p>

                  <p>And this is the victory that overcometh the World, even our Faith.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>TO prepare my way to the Text, I need not acquaint you with the general ſcope and deſign of this Epiſtle, that all along breaths the Air of Peace and Love, a ſtrain of mildneſs and ſweetneſs, that appear'd in all the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in S. <hi>John,</hi> who was allowed a more familiar converſe with our Saviour, than the reſt of the Diſciples.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:59505:51"/>FROM the beginning of this Chapter, we find him deſcribing the force and activity of the Divine Nature, by which we are enliven'd to higher actions than what our Nature produces: for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature being the life communicated from, and by God, raiſes the Soul beyond its natural ſelf, and ſtrengthens us <hi>to do all things through Chriſt that loved us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE are taught by the Divine Nature immediately to place our higheſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on God, and this love naturally teacheth us obedience to his commands: 'Tis in vain to call him <hi>Lord,</hi> and not to do the things he commands; ſuch is the force of this Divine Love, <hi>it overcomes the World.</hi> This life to which we are begotten by the <hi>Miniſtry and Incarnations of our Saviour,</hi> is ſo oppoſite to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt practices, maxims, and deſigns, by which this World is govern'd, that it proclaims open war againſt it: and though <hi>he that is in us</hi> (in the language of S. <hi>John</hi>) <hi>be ſtronger than he that is in the World</hi>; yet the World ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch advantages againſt us, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances and weakneſſes hang ſo cloſe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59505:51"/>
to us, we are ſurrounded on all hands with ſo many troubles and difficulties in our way to heaven, that before we overcome, we muſt grapple with our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and bear up with Chriſtian Courage and Magnanimity.</p>
            <p>THIS ſtate of Warfare is the Scene of our tryal and preparation, we are Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates for a Crown of Glory, and it is unreaſonable that we ſhould expect it, until firſt we have given proof of the Greatneſs and Vivacity of our Souls.</p>
            <p>OUR <hi>Saviour</hi> cloath'd himſelf with Fleſh and Blood, that he might teach us, who are lodged in Tabernacles of Fleſh, to manage our weapons againſt our enemies: and this ſpiritual skill and conduct, is viſibly ſeen in our conqueſt and triumph over the World, and all its flatteries and engines. This leads me directly to a more particular view of the words that I have read. And by the <hi>World,</hi> I underſtand nothing elſe, <hi>than that Spirit of Folly and Wickedneſs, that prevails amongſt Mankind.</hi> Which our <hi>Saviour</hi> oppoſes by his <hi>Goſpel.</hi> And here I take three particulars to conſideration.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59505:52"/>
Firſt, The great oppoſition maintain'd by the World againſt Chriſt and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Secondly, The poſſibility of our victory and triumph. Thirdly, The mean by which this is accompliſhed, even our Faith.</p>
            <p>As to the Firſt, That the World doth moſt deſpitefully and violently oppoſe the deſign and tendencies of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> did acquaint his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with it, when he was to leave the World. John 15.19 <hi>If ye were of the World, the World would love his own, but becauſe ye are not of the World, but I have choſen you out of the World, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World hateth you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT that I may give you a clear proſpect of the oppoſition between the Spirit of the World, and the Spirit of Chriſtianity, let us Firſt, Conſider the Laws and Maxims by which the World is govern'd contrary to the rules of our Saviour. Secondly, The things that the World moſt admires, loves and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervs. Thirdly, The rewards it offers to its friends and votaries. Fourthly, The manner by which it acts its malice againſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59505:52"/>
Chriſt, and his Diſciples: and when we have ſhortly viewed theſe particulars, we ſhall clearly ſee the fierce oppoſition againſt Chriſt, againſt the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, againſt the whole Oeconomy of his Kingdom and Laws.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt of theſe, Are not the Maxims by which the World and its af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs are governed, moſt oppoſite to, and different from the Laws of our Saviour? We are told by <hi>him,</hi> that, <hi>the Children of this world are wiſer in their own gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than the children of light:</hi> They are acted by principles of deſign, ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and artifice; the other is acted by a principle of truth, integrity and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: The one is acted by fraud, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and avarice; the other by purity, innocence, ſelf-denial, patience and charity.</p>
            <p>THE World applauds, and raiſes on the wings of fame, the man of buſineſs, might and dexterity, in managing and canvaſſing the labyrinths and intrigues of affairs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:59505:53"/>BUT by the Laws of our Religion, we are taught to deſpiſe the World, and all its trifling intereſts and pleaſures; and to conſider the Wiſdom of the World, as the greateſt impertinence and folly. By this I do not mean its Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Conſtitutions, by which its madneſs is reſtrained, but I mean its ordinary practices.</p>
            <p>WE are invited to other treaſures far above the gilded nothings that this World admires. O! how empty is its pageantry, when the varniſh drops off, when it appears naked to the eye of Reaſon and Faith!</p>
            <p>So much the World and the genius of it, teacheth men to value themſelvs, to deſpiſe others, to be revengeful, to climb as high as is poſſible; they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to attract the eyes and admiration of all men, to ſatisfie their paſſion to the full, to gather together all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Nature, and dwell ſecurely in its embraces. But the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion teacheth us to ſee the vanity of all thoſe contrivances, the folly of their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59505:53"/>
paſſions, the emptineſs of their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>WE are taught by it, to go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, through the tempeſts and ſtorms of this World with a low Sail; to prefer others to our ſelves, to be patient under reproofs, to be humble in the higheſt of our proſperity, to be denyed to the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of Senſe; to be unconcerned and unſolicitous for future events, caſting our ſelves with the whole weight of our faith and hope, upon the care, wiſdom and love of God. We are taught by it, to cut off our right hands, and pull out our right eyes, to bleſs them that curſe us, and to do good to them that deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſe us: In a word, it ranverſes and overturns the whole fabrick of the Worlds Politicks, it runs croſs to all its corrupt deſigns, and to the end we may become wiſe unto ſalvation; we muſt be eſteemed fools in the account of the World: and therefore our Saviour frequently told his Diſciples, that <hi>His Kingdom was not of this world,</hi> that it was govern'd by, and eſtabliſhed upon other Laws and Conſtitutions. Now when we but ſhortly reflect upon the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59505:54"/>
different Laws and Conſtitutions, we ſee clearly the oppoſition betwixt Chriſt and the World, the one earthly, the other heavenly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> THIS oppoſition appears, if we will conſider the things that the World moſt admires, loves and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. We are exhorted by S. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Ep. ch. 2. v. 15. <hi>Love not the world, nor the things that are in the world, for all that is in the world, the Luſt of the Eyes, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and the Pride of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Luſt of the Eyes,</hi> tempts out Covetouſneſs: the <hi>Luſts of the Fleſh,</hi> ſet on fire thoſe appetites that deſerve that name in the ſtricteſt notion of the phraſe. The <hi>Pride of Life,</hi> are honors, preferments and glories, that men pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue with ſo much concern and eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But,</p>
            <p>How poor and deſpicable are theſe things to the enlightned eye of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that ſees by the eye of Faith? How thin are they! how unworthy of our choice! how diſproportionate to the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59505:54"/>
Soul of Man! how feculent and paultry are the pleaſures of Senſe, attended with ſo much toil in the purchaſe, vanity in their enjoyment, uncertainty in their continuance! And if the World had nothing elſe to make it vain beyond all expreſſion, but this one thing, that thoſe who have admired it moſt, and ſought thoſe ſatisfactions from it, have been forced at length to acknowledge, that there was nothing in it, but vexation of Spirit. This, I ſay, might convince us, that the things the World moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires, are very unſuitable to the Soul of Man.</p>
            <p>BUT inſtead of ſuch things, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion offers to our view and choice, the pure and maſculine pleaſures of Devotion, the ſavour of God, the peace and tranquillity of our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, the victory and dominion over our luſts and paſſions, and thoſe riches that are at Gods right hand in the Heavens.</p>
            <p>The chaſt and ſolid ſatisfaction of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving overcome our vices, brings more true honour, than the atchievments that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59505:55"/>
are proclaimed by the loudeſt fame.<note place="margin">Fortior eſt qui ſe, quam qui fortiſſima vincit Moenia.—</note> 'Tis more glorious to overcome evil ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and inveterate diſeaſes of the mind, than to ſurprize, or take by open force a City.</p>
            <p>IN a word, let us but remember what are the conqueſts, glories, and triumphs, that are expoſed to our view by the Chriſtian Religion, and we ſhall find that they move in a far higher Sphere, than the little things that take up the time, talk, buſineſs and thoughts of worldly men.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>voluptuous Man</hi> ſacrifices his Soul to the appetites of the fleſh, as if it had been given him to make proviſion for the luſt thereof. The <hi>rich Miſer</hi> pierces himſelf through with ſo many cares and fears, leſt his Angels ſhould take wings to themſelves and fly. The <hi>Ambitious</hi> is filled with a <hi>Phantom</hi> of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which he hath painted in his own fancy, that he forgets his ſleep, and all things elſe, to place himſelf where he would be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:59505:55"/>BUT the Chriſtian Religion teacheth us, not only to neglect, but deſpiſe ſuch fantaſtic apparitions, ſuch dreams, ſuch nothings, that the blind World adores with ſo much pageantry and folly. We are taught by it, to recollect our ſelves from this hurry and madneſs, to ſtrip thoſe things naked of their borrowed luſtre, to pierce into their very eſſence, and feel that we are not made for ſuch mean things, as human fancy and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, hath magnified beyond their true ſize, when we come up cloſe to them, and conſider them, then their paint falls off, and we muſt acknowledge that we were fools to the greateſt degree.</p>
            <p>So intangled are the Labyrinths of the World, which made <hi>Auguſtus Ceſar</hi> wiſh ſo frequently for his retreat, and ended many of his Diſcourſes to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, with the pleaſant hope of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, that now bore up his Spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the load of ſo many affairs. He had ſo many Armies at his command, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to maintain them, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the applauſe of the Wiſeſt Senate,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59505:56"/>
yet how did he ſigh after the advantages of enjoying himſelf.</p>
            <p>WE are in the trueſt ſenſe the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of God, why then ſhould our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections be mean? Why ſhould we ſo much admire what is deſpicable? for <hi>the world paſſeth away, and the faſhion thereof:</hi> but our Spirits and thoughts run parallel with eternity; nothing leſs can ſatisfie the immortal Spirit of Man.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE are we exhorted ſo frequently in the New Teſtament, <hi>to place our affections on things alove,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 3.2</note> 
               <hi>and not on the things of the Earth</hi>; to remember, <hi>that here we have no continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing City; that here we are Pilgrims and Strangers</hi>;<note place="margin">Cor.</note> that, <hi>when this tabernacle is broken down, we have a houſe with God, not made with hands, eternal in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi> Theſe, and ſuch treaſures, are the things that we are taught to admire, by our Religion: theſe are the things we are commanded to purſue, ſince we are Heirs and Co-heirs with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>HE holds forth to us a Crown of immortal happineſs, that the ſight of it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59505:56"/>
might provoke us to the moſt heroick efforts of virtue, piety, ſelf-denyal, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, patience and humility. Now it is moſt evident, that the World, and the Spirit of Chriſtianity, purſue and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire things of a different nature. But this oppoſition will more fully appear, if we conſider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THE rewards by which the World allures to its friendſhip, and thoſe propoſed by our Saviour; what do men expect from the World, when they have ſold themſelves to ſerve it, when they have ſacrificed their time and ſtrength to court its honours, and follow its genius? Such as have proſtituted their very Souls to comply with its folly and wickedneſs, how miſerable is their gain? or rather how infinite is their loſs? how empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick is the Interrogation of our Saviour, <hi>What hath a man gained, when he hath loſt his own Soul?</hi> We find the World cannot relieve a Man, when he hath moſt need of help and conſolation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>LET him but put the friendſhip of the World to the Teſt, when he groans under the terror of Conſcience, or when
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59505:57"/>
his Soul is ready to leave his body; and then let him ſincerely declare, what weak and brittle reeds theſe things are, that he moſt admired, to ſupport him againſt his own fears.</p>
            <p>WERE we ſo wiſe, as in our fancy to go down into the Grave before we are carried thither, to converſe with the dead that are gone before us, to live a while under ground, to wrap our ſelves in our Winding ſheets, and then from that place of ſilence and darkneſs, to view the things that keep the Men of the World ſo much in agitation.</p>
            <p>WOULD not we be aſtoniſhed to ſee Men made after the Image of God, ſo much enſlaved to thoſe Idols of fancy, to thoſe ſhadows that vaniſh ſo quickly, to ſuch trifles that are the object of childiſh appetites. Did we but call to mind the preſent regrets and tortures of the damned? Were we allowed to ſee <hi>Dives</hi> turned down from his ſumptuous Table, his ſtately Palace, his numerous attendants, and fine linnen, into the ſcorching flames of Hell? And on the other ſide, could we ſee the Martyrs,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59505:57"/>
that have gone through the flames of perſecutions and diſaſters, now ſeated above malice and miſery, in the Regions of peace and love? Might we from thence clearly ſee the irreconcilable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition between Chriſt and the World in their rewards.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Fourthly,</hi> THIS appears in the manner by which the World acts its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt Chriſt and his Diſciples. (1.) It acts this malice by ſlander and calumny: Our Saviour told his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, that <hi>reproach and infamy muſt needs be their patrimony, if they zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly adhered to the doctrine and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Croſs:</hi> nay, 'tis made ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to Chriſtianity, that <hi>to be reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched for the name of Jeſus,</hi> makes up one of its great Beatitudes;<note place="margin">Mat. 5.11.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed are you when all men ſpeak all manner of evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you falſly for my ſake.</hi> He tells them plainly in another place, <hi>that they ought not to be diſcouraged with the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies and reproaches of the world: for if they call the Maſter of the houſe Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub, the diſciples ſhould not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above their Maſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59505:58"/>THERE is nothing in human Nature more tender and delicate, than the ſenſe of honour: God hath planted it in our Nature, to be a ſpur to virtuous and great atchievments. The firſt Chriſtians did ſacrifice even this to the love of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> So S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>that the Apoſtles were made the off ſcouring of all things:</hi> and our <hi>Saviour</hi> intimates in S. <hi>Matthew, that it was impoſſible for Chriſt and his doctrine to appear, but he muſt needs meet with ſlanders, libels and reproaches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John the Baptiſt came neither eating nor drinking, and yet he is ſaid to have a Devil. Our Saviour came eating and drinking,</hi> went to their feaſts and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, to teach them that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ſuch meetings, the higheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and purity, <hi>yet he is repreſented a friend of publicans and ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Spirit of the World is ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and humourſom, that it finds faults with the Chriſtians at every turn, for every thing that affronts their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59505:58"/>WE are to perſiſt as S. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts, <hi>in well doing, and by it to put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men.</hi> Let us live like the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> leaving our reputation, and what elſe is dear to us, to his diſpoſal: for we ſhall one day be vindicated from the fooliſh and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent cenſures of Men, in the view of Angels, and Companies of juſt Men made perfect. The hope of this bore up the Spirit of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as an invincible Rock againſt the moſt violent ſtorms. Rom. 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect, it is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen again from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> THE World manifeſts its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, by violent perſecutions of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and intereſts of the Chriſtians. Did not the whole World arm it ſelf with rage and indignation againſt the light of the Goſpel, when it began firſt to ſhine; and the <hi>Noble Army of Martyrs</hi> forced their way to Heaven, by patience and invincible magnanimity. How undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and fearleſs did <hi>they</hi> ſtand out againſt the powers of darkneſs, even when they appeared above ground, in their blackeſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59505:59"/>
and moſt terrible dreſs. They withſtood their fury like ſo many Walls of Braſs, <hi>reſiſting unto blood, and ſtriving againſt Sin.</hi> How inveterate is the malice of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> againſt <hi>the ſeed of the Woman?</hi> The Spirit of Perſecution ſmoaks from the bottomleſs pit: and our Saviour told his Diſciples no leſs than <hi>that they were to be driven from their Synagogues; that they were to be brought before Judges; that they ſhould be hated of all men for his ſake.</hi> And this is not ſo peculiar to the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, but that all good men have their ſhare of it in all Ages. For S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>they muſt ſuffer perſecution.</hi> But this is not the only way that the World diſcovers its oppoſition to Chriſtianity. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By its Tentations, by its ſoft &amp; ſly inſinuations, by which frequently it trips up the heels of the greateſt Saints; it lays ſnares for us in every circumſtance of our life: what it cannot do by open force, it ventures to compaſs by ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and artifice. The World is one great Trap, and how great a Miracle is it, that we ſhould eſcape the flatteries and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of it? Since its moſt plauſible
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59505:59"/>
offers beat conſtantly upon our Senſes, and we lye open to all its aſſaults on all quarters; we are ſo near a kin to the Earth, that it makes eaſily impreſſions on us: unleſs we are aſſured of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, how could we encounter ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable an enemy, ſuch Armies of Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on the right and left hand.</p>
            <p>WE had need to liſten to the Apoſtles exhortation, <hi>Let him that ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> Our ground is ſo ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, our weakneſſes ſo many, our ſtrength ſo ſmall, our enemies ſo active and malicious, and the inſinuations of Senſe ſo deceitful. From what is ſaid, we ſhall clearly ſee the oppoſition between the World, and the Spirit of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore let us ſhortly improve this Meditation for our practice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> ARE they ſo oppoſite one to the other? then <hi>let us not love the world,</hi> Rom. 12.2. <hi>Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of your mind.</hi> Let us not be mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the frame and faſhion of this World; but let us remember, we have a more heavenly calling, higher nature, a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59505:60"/>
more Seraphick Diſcipline; in a word, we are to ſteer our courſe againſt the tyde, and current of the wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of this World; for even in this ſenſe the <hi>kingdom of heaven ſuffereth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and the violent take it by force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> ARE they ſo oppoſite the one to the other? Let us remember, that <hi>no man can ſerve two Maſters; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerve God and Mammon:</hi> If you are the ſervants of Chriſt, you muſt renounce the World; for it is a part of our Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſmal Engagement to do ſo; <hi>Where the heart is, there the treaſure is alſo</hi>: if it be glued to the World, you muſt bid farewel to that <hi>inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, eternal in the heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> IS the World ſo oppoſite to the deſigns of our Religion? Let us fly beyond it in our thoughts and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Let us frequently ſteal out of the noiſe and hurry of its incumbrances and confuſions, and dwell in thoſe Regions, where there is nothing but peace and harmony, where the Celeſtial Choiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters tune their Harps, and run diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the joyful Praiſes of their Maker:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59505:60"/>
and to be ſure nothing hath a greater tendency to make us victorious over the World, than the frequent flights from its noiſe and cares.</p>
            <p>And this leads me to the Second Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular that I deſign to ſpeak to, which is, That the Saints ſhall certainly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the World, notwithſtanding of its bitterneſs and oppoſitions againſt them; and this I will make good, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, (1.) The Promiſe of God for our conduct and direction. (2.) The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and Triumph of Jeſus Chriſt, as our Head and Mediator. (3.) The Strength and Energy of the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) THE Promiſe of God for our Conduct and Aſſiſtance. He hath ſaid, <hi>I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb.</note> We may ſay of this Conflict with the World, as the <hi>Royal Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaid of his frequent Combats with his enemies,<note place="margin">Pſal. 144.1</note> 
               <hi>'tis he that teacheth my fingers to fight</hi>; and without doubt the Divine Wiſdom is apparent in our Conqueſt over the World; elſe how could poor Creatures (all made up of error, darkneſs and precipitance) ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59505:61"/>
on Tentations of all ſorts without his ſpecial Conduct and Preſence? How quietly doth the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> rejoice in the Meditation of his fatherly Care and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. <hi>He maketh me to lye down in green paſtures, he leadeth me beſide the quiet waters, he reſtoreth my Soul, he gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth me in the paths of righteouſneſs for his names ſake, thy rod and thy ſtaff they comfort me. 'Tis through God alone we ſhall do valiantly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The weapons of our warfare are mighty through him</hi>; he not only treads Satan under our feet, but the World alſo, which is the Devils great Confederate againſt the Saints.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) WE are aſſured of the Victory, through the Triumph and Victory and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He hath bidden us himſelf <hi>be of good cheer, for he hath overcome the World. He is the Lyon of the Tribe of Judah</hi>; he marcheth upon the Head of his Diſciples with diſplayed Banners againſt the Legions of Darkneſs; the World, Hell and the Grave, are hauled at the Wheels of his triumphant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot. Therefore the Author of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> bids us <hi>conſider
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59505:61"/>
the cloud of witneſſes,</hi> but moſt of all <hi>Jeſus Chriſt himſelf the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of our Faith.</hi> When we are like to faint, when our fears grow thick and dark, then conſider the <hi>Captain of our Salvation,</hi> who hath already broke the force of our enemies, <hi>and is ſet down on the right hand of the Throne of God</hi>; and there employes his Power in Heaven and Earth, for the conduct, ſafety and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his followers. Let us believe with the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul, that we ſhall be able to do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) WE are aſſured of the Victory, by the Strength and Energy of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature. So we are told in the Text, that, <hi>that which is born of God, overcometh the World:</hi> and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>He that is in us, is ſtronger than he that is in the World.</hi> If we were to grapple with the World by equal ſtrength,<note place="margin">Eſt Deus in nobis agitante caleſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus illo.</note> we could not promiſe to our ſelves the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, but we are partakers of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, we are carried above our ſelves. God is in us in a truer and higher ſenſe, than the <hi>Poet</hi> meant it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:59505:62"/>THE Divine Nature is full of Life and Power, it grows unto perfection, <hi>unto the ſtature of a perfect Man in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> until it lodge us at laſt in the boſom of God. 'Tis a Coal from the Altar that inflames the Soul, and conſumes the Body of Death to nothing. What is not the Chriſtian Religion able to do in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with Omnipotence?</p>
            <p>THIS is it that wrought ſuch incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Changes in the World, and if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have been ſo ſucceſsful and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in their Conflicts with the World, why ought we to deſpair? Had not the Luminaries of the Church, the ſame fleſh to mortifie? the ſame paſſions to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come? the ſame World to contend with? and if they overcame the World, why may not we be victorious alſo?</p>
            <p>BUT let us improve this Meditation for our practice. If we are thus aſſured of the Victory, if we do not wilfully deſert our Stations, then let us not be diſcouraged with the Terrors of the World; nor with thoſe imaginary diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, by which Men frequently fright
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59505:62"/>
themſelves from their duty. But in the midſt of our fears and objections, let us ſtrengthen our ſelves in God, and debate the matter with our own Conſciences in the Language of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>;<note place="margin">Pſalm 56.</note> 
               <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul! hope in God:</hi> remember, and call to mind the Victory that Men of like Paſſions have attained, why do you thus ſit down hanging your head, as if the World were invincible?</p>
            <p>WHY do we ſuffer our ſelves ſo tamely to be carried down the Stream? Let us bear up againſt it, and remember that we have to do with a broken and conquered Enemy; and if we do not ſhamefully yield, God will ſtand by <hi>us,</hi> at our right hand, and <hi>make <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s more than Conquerors, through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is unbecoming the Goodneſs of God to leave us, when we are engaged with ſuch formidable Enemies. <hi>If he be for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, who can be againſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here we are but Pilgrims and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> and ſince we have renounced the World ſo ſolemnly, why do we look back upon it with ſo much fondneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light? why are we diffident of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory? For the <hi>Captain of our Salvation</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:59505:63"/>
looks on, and ſuffers us to be ſurrounded with Tentations, that he may make proof of our Courage, Conſtancy, Fidelity, Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Patience: God looks on the Conflicts of his people with delight; and by their tryals and hard encounters, he fortifies their Souls for Immortality, which is the prize.</p>
            <p>IT was the glimmering of this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, made ſo many of the antient Philoſophers think,<note place="margin">Maxim. Tyr.</note> that a Man without ſuffering, was without reputation: for honour, by the eſteem and vote of all Mankind, belongs to them that have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and ſtriven reſolutely in the midſt of all diſaſters againſt Vice and its inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations. To this purpoſe <hi>Seneca</hi> in his Book <hi>de Providentia,</hi> ſays, <hi>That a Man bearing up reſolutely againſt diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and diſaſters, was a ſpectacle worthy</hi> Jupiter <hi>himſelf to look on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SINCE then we are furniſhed with better Principles, and a clearer Light, let us under the Conduct of our <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> face all Tentations, and <hi>keep our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences void of offence towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men</hi>; for the things that are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59505:63"/>
to Mans eyes, are but Scare-Crows and Apparitions to the eyes of Faith.</p>
            <p>AND this leads me to the third and laſt Particular, that is, The Mean by which this Victory is obtained, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>Faith is our Victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Figure is obvious enough; this is the Mean and Weapon, by which we trample under foot the World, and all its glittering vanities, and ſoar above it. We are by our Laws Citizens of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdom; we are neither intangled with its ſnares, nor blinded with its fooliſh hopes, nor govern'd by its perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Maxims, nor dazled with its falſe lights; while we keep our eyes open to the light of Faith, and the Glories that <hi>our Jeſus</hi> hath manifeſted to us in the Goſpel, then we grow too big for this World, and the ſight of that Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, enlarges our Souls, and the Earth becomes contemptible in our eyes.</p>
            <p>BUT that I may make this the more clear, I ſhall endeavour to give light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, by the Nature and Excellency of Faith it ſelf, which when we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59505:64"/>
this Conqueſt will appear to be the moſt neceſſary reſult of Faith.</p>
            <p>AND (1.) Conſider, that by Faith we are furniſhed with new Principles, we have a Spirit giv'n us ſtronger than the World, oppoſite to it, far above it; this is frequently aſſerted by S. <hi>John</hi> in the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>That which is born of God, overcometh the World.</hi> The Soul once touched with the Spirit and Love of God, becomes nimble and active in his ſervice, and able to break through the blackeſt Clouds of oppoſition: what is it can damp the Soul once fired with the Love of God? Did not the Courage of the firſt Chriſtians amaze the Heathen World, when they ſaw them part with every thing for Immortality?</p>
            <p>BUT when we call to mind, that the Divine Nature is the Seed of God, we muſt remember, that this Seed muſt grow up to perfection, that it cannot be choaked nor oppreſſed.</p>
            <p>IT is by Faith, that we are made the Sons of God; and the ancient <hi>Poets</hi> ſeem to have a Notion of this, when
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59505:64"/>
they made their <hi>Heroes,</hi> and ſuch as were famous for difficult enterprizes, the off ſpring of the Gods; the fancy may be thus far allowed, <hi>That every good gift and perfect donation is from above:</hi> and whatever is great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous is brought to perfection in the ſtrength of God. Chriſtianity makes a thorough Change in the Souls of Men, we are partakers of ſuch a Nature, as looſes us from the fetters of our former prejudices and errors, and makes us run contrary to our moſt hereditary and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing luſts; this Change is a mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the Divinity of our Religion.</p>
            <p>ORIGEN <hi>againſt</hi> CELSUS glories in this Argument, That by the Doctrine of Faith, the fierce and barbarous <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> became mild, peaceable and calm. That the ſoft and delicate <hi>Perſians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came chaſt, ſober and religious. That the Proud and Imperious <hi>Romans,</hi> made their <hi>Eagles</hi> ſit down under the <hi>Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> That the <hi>Grecians,</hi> famous for their <hi>Eloquence</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> deſpis'd all their Curioſities, and embraced the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrine of the <hi>crucified Jeſus.</hi> This Change had been impoſſible, unleſs it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59505:65"/>
had been begun, and advanced by the Infinite Power of God.</p>
            <p>SUCH is the Strength of Faith that ſo powerfully diſarms us of our Luſts and Paſſions, and makes us vye with the Angels themſelves in the ſwiftneſs and alacrity of our obedience: by this it is we ſnap aſſunder the Cords and Bands that held us faſt in the Embraces of the World.</p>
            <p>But (2.) BY Faith we are not only endued with the Divine Nature, but alſo we have the true Notions of God and of our ſelves; the ſtrength of the World did much conſiſt in our ignorance. One great reaſon why the <hi>Heathen World</hi> was ſunk in folly &amp; wickedneſs, was this, they had loſt the true knowledge of God; and the Fables of the <hi>Poets</hi> were the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of their Divinity; and thoſe <hi>Poets</hi> did repreſent their <hi>Deities</hi> as Actors of all the Follies and Villanies that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature is capable of: then there was no proper reſtraint in their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to divert them from Vice, ſince the very <hi>Gods</hi> they adored, loved and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd it: Might not they infer reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59505:65"/>
that the greateſt ſinners might dwell with thoſe <hi>Gods</hi>; and that there was not ſuch diſtance and hatred, betwixt Sin and the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>BUT our Religion teacheth us, <hi>that he is of purer eyes, than that he can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold iniquity; that nothing unclean ſhall enter the New Jeruſalem</hi>;<note place="margin">Heb 12.14.</note> 
               <hi>that without holineſs, it is impoſſible to ſee God</hi>; that <hi>the pure in heart are only capable of that Viſion</hi>;<note place="margin">Mat. 5.8.</note> that holineſs is not only our duty, but a main ingredient of our happineſs.</p>
            <p>THAT which I deſign by this, is, That we could not overcome the World, unleſs we had clear Notions of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity; and therefore we are frequently told, that the only begotten Son did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal the Father unto us; and the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Prophets themſelves came from him who is the Eternal <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>that enlighteneth every man that cometh into the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Goſpel manifeſts the eternal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betwixt God and Sin; he is Life, Power and Wiſdom, Greatneſs and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59505:66"/>
and Sin in its very nature, is darkneſs, miſery, confuſion and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; then our Faith teacheth us to reaſon againſt the World, from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, as well as from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority; and having by it got a clear proſpect of God,<note place="margin">Phil.</note> our ſelves, and the immortality of our Spirits; what is it that the World can offer to our choice, but what we deſpiſe in our eſteem?</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) FAITH gives us a perfect account of the vanity of the World, its emptineſs and weakneſs; it teaches us to come near it, and feel it. You ſee the things that the World moſt admires, have not their value from their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick worth and ſolidity, but from the fancy and opinion of men. Is it not then ſad, that we ſhould be ſo eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with ſhadows and images of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs? Thoſe Nations that have great ſtore of Silver and Gold, admire our Glaſſes and Toyes, more than their own Treaſures. It is not real worth, but fancy, that makes us idolize the World.</p>
            <p>BUT as I have hinted before, how uſeleſs is the World to a Man that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to feel the weight of Gods indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59505:66"/>
and the flames of his wrath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready kindled in his Conſcience? Let the Man thus tortured, conſult the skilful Phyſicians; let him call about him his great and potent friends, his numerous and ſplendid family, his ſervants and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, and withal ſuppoſe him in the eſteem and love of all his acquaintance, and let the World ſmile on him with all its flatteries and careſſes, yet nothing can give him the leaſt caſe.</p>
            <p>HE groans under the ſmart of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible wounds, his Soul is inflamed with bitter reflections, and all the art and skill of the <hi>Apothecary</hi> cannot give him one quiet and calm thought: how thin and coarſe are all the Medicaments that the World offers us, when we moſt need relief? how powerful are the enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the World, that we ſhould lean upon it, when our Faith hath diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto us, how vain a thing it is? What can it do at the hour of death, when we go to a Country where all its friendſhip is rejected? In our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſtreſſes we ordinarily fly to thoſe ſtrong-holds, that we judge the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt places, now a man cannot be in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59505:67"/>
harder Circumſtances, than when he is toſſed between time and eternity, ready to take his flight into another World; how vain doth the World then appear to him? when his Conſcience begins to waken, and its accuſations can no longer be ſhifted. This I think ſufficiently proves the Vanity of the World, and the knowledge of this we have by Faith, and therefore <hi>Faith is our victory by which we overcome the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (4.) WE overcome the World by Faith, becauſe it gives a fair proſpect of another Kingdom. It is this that lifts our affections above this preſent World; we begin to deſpiſe all its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, when we know we are <hi>heirs of God, and co-heirs with Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> If we were ſurpriz'd with being choſen into the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> how little would we value our former deſigns and projects? The Chriſtians look down upon the World, with a heavenly Magnanimity, as a thing below them; for they fix their habitation above the Clouds, where no Vapour can aſcend to diſturb the Air.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:59505:67"/>THE Contemplations of God, and of that Pure and Angelical Life, makes us quite leave the body, and faſten our eyes on that Celeſtial Inheritance, where the Stars of Light mutually glance Light to one another, and are all of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened and warmed by that Original Light, <hi>that dwells himſelf in light inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 Ep. c. 4. v. 5. <hi>While we look not at the things that are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen; for the things that are ſeen, are temporary, but the things that are not ſeen, are eternal.</hi> To this purpoſe the 11th of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is ſpent, <hi>Abraham ſaw</hi> the Promiſe afar off, the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> confeſſed themſelves <hi>Pilgrims and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers on the Earth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts.</note> 
               <hi>S.</hi> Stephen <hi>ſaw the heavens opened</hi>; how little did he value the Mutinies and Cruelties of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men?</p>
            <p>MOSES (Heb. 11.24.) <hi>deſpiſed the Court of Pharaoh, and the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, becauſe he had an eye to the recompence of reward.</hi> There was nothing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59505:68"/>
charming or deſirable, in all the glory of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when he ſaw the inviſible Crown of Glory: How could one bred in the <hi>Court of Pharaoh,</hi> and in all the Wiſdom of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> amidſt the pleaſures and divertiſements of the <hi>Court,</hi> refuſe the Government and Sovereignty of ſo vaſt an Empire? The World could not ſee into the reaſon of it; they could not but conclude him a fool by their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims: but Faith gave him a view of a Kingdom, above the moſt radiant Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dems, and the brighteſt Thrones on Earth, and a Victory more noble, than the Conqueſt of ſo many Provinces. O the greatneſs and divine force of thoſe mighty Souls, whoſe appetites and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are enlarged by Faith! The World cannot fill their thoughts; and therefore they by Faith overcame it, and all its terrors and flatteries, as the <hi>Martyrs</hi> mention'd in the Book of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> waiting for a better reſurrection.</p>
            <p>SEE into what an holy Agony S. <hi>Paul</hi> did put himſelf, when the heavenly Crown was in his view. Phil. 3. v. 14. <hi>I preſs toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> I
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59505:68"/>
ſee the Crowns which are prepared for the victorious, for the unwearied and reſolute Diſciples of the <hi>Croſs:</hi> when I bend my Soul to its full force and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, to lay hold on eternal life; ſuch a ſight cannot but overcome the World; and ſuch a ſight is only had by Faith.</p>
            <p>BUT for improvement of all theſe thoughts, Let us remember, that the World can never be to us a quiet habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſince the oppoſition between it &amp; our Religion, is endleſs and incurable: when we have overcome one difficulty, we muſt look for another: here we are like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs, toſſed from one hardſhip to another: though the World ſhould promiſe us fair, yet its promiſes are deceitful, and its friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is a violation of our obedience to our <hi>Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us therefore gird our loins, and watch againſt its ſubtilties and ſnares, as they that wait for the return of their Maſter: if we intermit but for a little while, we loſe more ground, than we are able to recover for many days. Let us not therefore be ſlothful and negligent,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59505:69"/>
leſt our Maſter ſhould ſurprize us, and we be found unprepared to make our accounts: Let the World feel that we are Chriſtians; and conſequently, not only taught to deſpiſe it, but enabled to overcome it; that when we leave it, we may come off the Field with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of our Maſter, and ſo with joy and confidence, we may give up our Souls to his hands, as unto the hands of our moſt faithful <hi>Creator.</hi>

            <p>IT is uſual with moſt Hearers, when the Text is plain, when there is nothing in it to invite their Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, nothing beyond the common and great Truths of Chriſtianity; then, to unbend their attention. As if the ſubſtantial Truths of our Religion, that in their Nature, Scope and Tendency, are deſign'd to beget, preſerve and maintain, the life, vigor and devotion of our Souls,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59505:70"/>
were only to be preach'd to the <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Infidels.</hi> But this Diſeaſe of the Mind, is as dangerous, as common: therefore my deſign from thoſe words, is to leave upon your Memories a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Truth, acknowledg'd by all, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and digeſted by very few.</p>
            <p>AND as the Truth contain'd under theſe words, is obvious and plain; ſo are all the Alluſions and Metaphors, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which it is deliver'd, very familiar and eaſie. Thoſe publick Games of <hi>Greece,</hi> mention'd almoſt by all Authors, do naturally repreſent the fervour, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and zeal of Chriſtian Life, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently compar'd in the Scriptures to a <hi>Race.</hi> And therefore all <hi>Interpreters</hi> do agree, that theſe Verſes are Agoniſtical, and that they carry in them an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate relation to thoſe Games; in which, publick applauſe, generoſity, courage and emulation, prompted the Competitors, to the moſt accurate care, caution and activity.</p>
            <p>WHEN we remember what an Age we live in, how far <hi>Atheiſm, Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Stupidity</hi> hath eaten out the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59505:70"/>
vigour and zeal of Primitive Devotion; ſhould we not caſt back our eyes on thoſe glorious Combatants of the firſt Age, whoſe examples are able, even at this diſtance, to put ſome Life and Spirit unto us.</p>
            <p>THIS being the deſign, and the Text being plain (without changing the natural Poſition of the Words), three things offer themſelves to our conſideration: 1. The vigour, ſtrength and activity of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles motion. 2. The ſtraight and unbyaſs'd Line in which he moved. 3. The end, ſcope and prize he had in his view; and that is, <hi>the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> In one word, the Reward of Chriſtianity. Of theſe in order;</p>
            <p n="1">1. GOD is to be ſerv'd now under the New Teſtament, with a holy awe, fear, care and diligence. Though this be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd by all, yet how few are there, that digeſt the Principles upon which it is founded, and by which it may be rivetted into their Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:59505:71"/>I SHALL endeavour then to provoke you to this extraordinary Care, by ſuch Arguments, as do equally enforce it; and chaſtiſe the Lukewarmneſs and Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, Inconſideration and deteſtable Neutrality of the preſent Age. And this will appear neceſſary, if we conſider, 1. Either the Nature of God. 2. The Spirituality and extent of his Law. 3. The Vivacity and Strength of our own Souls. Or, 4. The Practice of the beſt of Men. 5. The Oppoſition that we meet with in our Chriſtian Courſe. 6. The Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of the former part of our Life. 7. The peculiar Obligations of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; <hi>viz.</hi> that we are <hi>bought by the blood of Jeſus.</hi> 8. Conſider the miſerable Toil and Slavery of a Life of Sin. And then we cannot but acknowledge, that hitherto we have little conſidered our Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I SAY, Let us conſider the Nature of that God whom we ſerve.</p>
            <p>NOTHING purifies and enlarges the Mind more, than the true account of the Divine Nature. And therefore
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59505:71"/>
our <hi>Saviour</hi> when he came to accompliſh the great Reformation, did in the firſt place eſtabliſh the true Notion of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and reveal the Father un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. No wonder then, if the Heathen World was miſerably ſunk and buried in their Luſts and Impieties; when the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Hiſtory of their Gods, and the Fables of their <hi>Poets,</hi> did repreſent them under the Tyranny of their Paſſion, Luſt, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, Rapine and Revenge, acting all the Extravagancies that make our Nature miſerable and infamous. How could they think it but honourable, to be like their Gods? could they be induc'd to reform what was heroically virtuous.</p>
            <p>BUT bleſſed be God, we have no ſuch ſubterfuge and pretence for our wickedneſs. God hath manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf clearly unto us; we have ſuch Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Deity, as are adequate to the Reaſon and Spirituality of our Souls fix'd in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>THE Holy Scriptures every where repreſent him as the firſt Original and Self ſufficient <hi>Being,</hi> at an eternal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from all weakneſs, mixture,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59505:72"/>
change or compoſition; the only Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all Life, Power, Goodneſs and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience.</p>
            <p>WILL you conſider his Power. See how elegantly the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes, from his Power, the folly of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. <hi>The Nations are as a drop of a bucket,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 40.13.</note> 
               <hi>they are counted as the ſmall duſt of the ballance: He taketh up the Iſles as a very little thing; all Nations are as nothing, and they are leſs than nothing and vanity.</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 22.</note> 
               <hi>It is he hath ſitteth on the circle of the Earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as graſshoppers, he ſtretches out the heavens as a Curtain, and ſpreads them out as a Tent to dwell in.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>to whom then will ye liken God, what likeneſs will ye compare him to.</hi> When we think of his Power, the very firſt thoughts of it ſhould allay the pride and ſwellings of Vanity. How ſoon were the paſſionate complaints of <hi>Job</hi> run down with the mention of his ineffable Power, and his heart ſtruck with Silence and Reverence?</p>

            </p>
            <p>LET us then but a little more feri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reflect upon the Nature of God, and warm our Soul at this fire. Let us ask, Is this God, whoſe Majeſty fills the Heavens and the Earth, to be indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd with flat and tepid Devotions? Did the Heathens worſhip their Idols
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59505:73"/>
with ſo much Lukewarmneſs as is too too viſible among the Chriſtians? Nay, but their ſacrifices, proſtrations, vain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, their ſuperſtitious Pageantry and Ceremonies requir'd a great deal of attention and application.</p>
            <p>The very Devils if they were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, would not be ſatisfied with the careleſs behaviour of the Chriſtians in our days; and ſhall we approach the Inviſible Immortal God, with leſs regard, than the Pagans did their dumb idols? <hi>Our God is a Spirit</hi> (ſaith our <hi>Saviour</hi>) <hi>and muſt be worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> And if you would allow me to ſpeak a little more plainly, nothing caſts greater contempt upon the God that we adore, or the Religion that we eſpouſe, than the manner of our Worſhip. When we approach our Patrons and Benefactors on Earth, we meet their ſmiles with the loweſt ſubmiſſions, and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But when we come unto the Altar, we <hi>offer the blind and the lame</hi> in the language of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Mal. 1.8.</note> 
               <hi>Offer it now unto thy Governour,</hi> ſaith the Prophet. The Living God muſt be worſhipped with life, and ſerv'd with vigour, and ador'd
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59505:73"/>
with devotion. He is all Perfection, and cannot be ſerv'd with the cold and faint eſſays, of half conviction, and lame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. I ask then, when we dwell on the Nature of God, whether or no the whole Soul ought to be employed in his Worſhip and Service.</p>
            <p>BUT had we to do with ſuch a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as the <hi>Epicureans</hi> fancied, one that had eternally locked up himſelf within the Imperial Heavens: If our actions and affairs came not at all under his cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, then we might approach him with that remiſsneſs, coldneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concernedneſs, that is viſible in our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes. But our God is all pure Life, intent upon the Government of the World; <hi>all things are open and naked before him, with whom we have to do.</hi> His eyes pierce into the Secrets that are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in darkneſs.<note place="margin">Pſal. 139.</note> 
               <hi>He look'd down to ſee if any did ſeek after God. He humbles himſelf to behold the things that are done in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> There paſſes nothing unobſerved; <hi>Whether ſhall I fly from his preſence?

               <hi>that did he both in heaven and in earth, in the ſea, and in all deep places.</hi> The moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and apparently fortuitous actions are ordered by his Wiſdom. Nothing ſo little, but it falls under his care: He is not a little Prince, confin'd to the Hills and Mountains, as the <hi>Aramites</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely imagin'd; but <hi>the valleys alſo are his. The young Lions roar, and ſeek their meat from God, the Lillies of the field are adorned; not a Sparrow falls to the ground without your Father; your ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hairs are all numbered.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2, LET me preſs this from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Law; the ſum whereof ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to love the Lord our God, with all our heart, with all our ſoul, with all our ſtrength, and our neighbour as our ſelves. The Laws of Men reſtrain our hands, and determine our outward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but the Laws of God ſet bounds to our very thoughts. He that gave Man underſtanding, ſees the very firſt riſings of our inventions; and there is nothing appears irregular without, but
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59505:74"/>
what was formed within:<note place="margin">Matth.</note> 
               <hi>for out of the heart proceed murders, adulteries,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore the Divine Law reaches the inſide, as well as the outſide; it makes a very exact Anatomy of the whole Soul, and opens up our hearts unto our ſelves, and diſcovers what we knew not before, and yet now we know to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly true. The moſt intricate caſes are comprehended under its rules and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; if the groſſer acts of impiety and wickedneſs were only forbidden, and our Souls were left at liberty to entertain miſchievous deſigns within, then we ſhould want the moſt effectual mean to heal the diſtemper of our Nature. But he that perfectly knows what is in Man, the whole frame of his Soul, the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, firſt riſings, manifold circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and deſign of all his actions, hath encircled him with ſuch a perfect Law; <hi>a Law that divides between the Soul and the Spirit, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts of the heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Rule is ſo exact and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, that it reaches all the windings, and the turnings of the Soul; the moſt artificial excuſes cannot hide our inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59505:75"/>
from that piercing Light that ſhines in it; it enters into the cloſeſt retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſees into the ſecret imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Its authority ſits ſo cloſe to the mind of Man, that it can no more ſhake its force, than diveſt it ſelf of its own Nature.</p>
            <p>AND this effectually proveth a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Dominion of our Law-giver, this inviſible Authority of him who ſees our hearts, and hath armed our Conſciences with light and power ſufficient to accuſe us, and to chaſtiſe us with its ſharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, for our inward failings, as well as for our outward miſcarriages.</p>
            <p>AND if the Divine Law that is fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the very conſtitution of the Soul, be ſo powerful and piercing; God cannot but abhor thoſe ſervices and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental ſubmiſſions of ſuch as approach him with their <hi>lips,</hi> but leave their <hi>hearts</hi> behind them; eſpecially when we conſider under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> how clearly the Law of Nature was explain'd and improv'd beyond the Standard of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> its high and generous Principles by which
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59505:75"/>
we are acted beyond the common level of Mankind, and rais'd to a participation of the Divine Nature. This is it that enters the Soul with its divine power and efficacy, and ſtrikes down its pride under the Authority of God and Chriſt. It leads <hi>every thought captive to its obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, we are more than Conquerours, through Jeſus Chriſt that loved us.</hi> So far from being captive to the Law of Sin, <hi>that we can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens us.</hi> The Diſciples of <hi>Moſes Law,</hi> did vindicate themſelves to the people, that they had not taken ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ox</hi> or <hi>Aſs</hi> by violence or oppreſſion; but S. <hi>Paul</hi> proteſts, he did not ſo much as <hi>covet any mans ſilver or gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN we then ſufficiently digeſt this Meditation of the Perfection of his Law, we muſt remember, he is not to be ſerved in a trifling, indifferent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but we muſt meditate in his Law night and day. So the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi>

How curious is it in its enquiries? how fond of its contemplations? Its pleaſures are refin'd, pure and Angelical; how ſwift in its thoughts from Eaſt to Weſt? it flies through the Earth, it makes to it ſelf Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the viſible Creatures to climb to Heaven, that it may ſee the face of God.</p>
            <p>Now if it dwell with ſo much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and complacency on leſſer objects, how vigorouſly ſhould it adore God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the firſt and original beauty?</p>
            <p>DID God furniſh our Minds with ſuch noble Powers, only to till the ground, or make proviſion for the Fleſh, and beſtow ſome tranſient thoughts on his ſervice and obedience? No certainly. This Soul of ours that can graſp ſo many Truths, and lodge them together without
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59505:76"/>
confuſion, that is all Life and Motion, muſt beſtow its nobleſt and ſtrongeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires on God; there needed not ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual furniture to feed our bellies, and feaſt our ſenſes. The Beaſt enjoys thoſe objects more feelingly, and with greater ſatisfaction; they want the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie alarms of Conſcience, to awaken them to higher things, therefore they enjoy them without diſturbance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption. But, <hi>Poor Man,</hi> when he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets himſelf, and hearkens to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments and flatteries of Senſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo far unite with thoſe deſpicable things, but that ſtill the regrets and uneaſie reflections of his mind call him higher, and reproach him when he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets his parentage and original.</p>
            <p>IF we then in ſome meaſure under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand our ſelves, know but the frame and conſtitution of our own Soul, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve its motions and activity; if we feel the manner of its operations and reflections, its aſpiring ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity; we muſt conclude, that God did not give us this Soul, to ſerve him negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and careleſly, but to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him our higheſt adorations, our moſt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59505:77"/>
profound ſubmiſſions, our deepeſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments, our moſt joyful thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings: Nay, never to reſt ſatisfied with our ſelves, until we attain to that habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual delight in his Worſhip, that the Angels have in Heaven, who wait with their Wings ſtretch'd, ready to fly when he commands.</p>
            <p>OUR Souls are ſo near a kin to thoſe bright favourites of Heaven, that though we cannot run ſo nimbly, yet ought we to come as near to them as may be. Though their preſent poſture hath ſet them incomparably beyond us, yet we feel that our Souls claim their kindred, and acquaintance. 'Tis true, our incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances are many, but frequently may we gain ground, and let our Souls know their heavenly nature and activity, that they needed not be oppreſs'd with the weight of the Body, nor confin'd to thoſe Walls of Fleſh, but that at ſome time or other, nay, frequently, we may converſe with God himſelf.</p>
            <p>DID we feel the honour and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thoſe flights to Heaven; how they fortifie the mind; how much they
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59505:77"/>
leſſen the World; how much they eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Soul in its choice; how they advance our Victory; and confirm our hopes: We would grow more bold in repelling temptations; more ardent in our prayers; more watchful upon our guard; nay, <hi>more than Conquerours, through Jeſus Chriſt that loved us.</hi> Let us remember then, that whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider God, or his Law, or our own Souls. We muſt ſerve him with zeal and devotion, with our ſtrength and affection, <hi>No man can ſerve two Maſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. LET me urge this, from the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the beſt of Men.<note place="margin">Pſal. 69.9</note>

the whole Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> is one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued proof of his zeal and fervour, and it is ſpent in the admiration of all his glorious Attributes. And this is ſo much the more conſiderable, that he was a <hi>Prince</hi> of much buſineſs, and had many affairs of peace and war to diſturb his thoughts; neither the crowd of people, nor the toil of War, nor the Government of his Forces, nor the innumerable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, wherein <hi>Kings</hi> are neceſſarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd, <hi>could make him forget his God.

            <p>FROM <hi>David,</hi> I may go to <hi>Daniel</hi> the chief Miniſter of State to a vaſt <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi> He was not diverted from his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, neither by the allurements of the Court, nor the malice of his enemies, nor the avocations of buſineſs, nor the threatnings of the King, not the terrors

of the Lyons; but three times a day, his windows being open, he ſet his face toward <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and prayed.</p>
            <p>FROM <hi>Daniel</hi> to <hi>Moſes. He refus'd to be call'd the Son of Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>daughter</hi>; he choſe rather <hi>to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; he eſteemed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Egypt.</hi> And that whole Chapter is but a Catalogue of thoſe Worthies who ſerved God with zeal and vigour, with triumph, and courage, and reſolution, that became the heirs of an inviſible recompence. The ſame Author in the ſixth Chapter exhorts us, not <hi>to be ſlothful, but followers of them, who through Faith and Patience inherit the promiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW if we leave them under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and conſider the practice of the firſt Chriſtians; how remarkable their zeal, how charitable, how devout, how indefatigable in all exerciſes of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Devotion; how ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their greateſt and moſt valuable concerns, to all hazards, for the defence
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59505:79"/>
of the Goſpel? How little did they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue their Lives? how ambitious of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom? Nay, when the <hi>Blood of Jeſus</hi> was but lately ſhed, it was ſo warm up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hearts, that it kindled a fire of zeal, that no ſufferings was able to quench; ſo heroick was their courage, ſo unwearied in their patience, ſo conſtant in all Chriſtian performances. 2 Cor. 6.5. <hi>But in all things approving our ſelves as the Miniſters of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in neceſſities, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, in ſtripes, in impriſonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by pureneſs, by knowledge, by long-ſufferings, by kindneſs, by the Holy Ghoſt, by love unfeigned.</hi> And not only the Apoſtles, of whom principally the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Text may be meant, but their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes alſo to Chriſtianity, became ſuch eminent inſtances of the moſt heroick virtue, even the weakeſt and moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, did eclipſe the fame of the greateſt <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> And we need not dwell any longer on this Conſideration; we may take it for granted, that the practice of the beſt of men recommends the moſt ardent and vigorous zeal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:59505:79"/>But 5. LET us conſider the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we meet with. The World arms it ſelf againſt us by its practices, and tentations. We are ſurrounded on the right, and on the left hand with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; the whole Scene of our Life is a Warfare; we are no ſooner baptiz'd, than we are liſted under our Saviour's Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to wreſtle with all difficulties; and nothing that is truly good can be brought to perfection, without ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and oppoſition.

our tentations diſguis'd under variety of appearances; our enemies numerous, ſubtile and unwearied; when we row againſt the ſtream and current of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour appetites; judge whether we ſhould obey the advice of <hi>Solomon,</hi>

               <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might; for there is no work, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor wiſdom, nor device in the grave whether thou goeſt.</hi>

               <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, to preſs toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God.</hi> How happy a thing would it be, if we ſerved God with ſo much cheerfulneſs and alacrity, as we ſerved Satan, and our ſelves! Formerly we went forward to Hell in a full carere, like the ſwift Dromedary, or an untam'd Heifer, or like the Horſe that ruſheth into the Battel; or like the wild Oſtrich, to whom God gave no Wiſdom. We took complacency to be carried down the ſtream with rapid violence and fury; ſuch the Apoſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> deſcribes the former and unconverted ſtate of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate to have been; <hi>For we our ſelves alſo were ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 3.3.</note> 
               <hi>ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, hateful, and hating one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS Men of robuſt and healthful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, when they recover out of a Fever; Nature in them very quickly fortifies it ſelf againſt the next invaſion. Thus when the Grace and Love of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> enters our hearts, and batters down pride and ſelf-will; when Chriſt by his victorious and ſtrong hand, hath bound
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59505:81"/>
the ſtrong Man; then the Divine Nature erects its beautiful Trophies upon the ruine of the <hi>old Man:</hi> and the regenerate is revenged upon himſelf, for having abus'd ſo good,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.11.</note> and ſo gracious, and ſo bountiful a Redeemer.</p>
            <p>But 7. ADD to all this, the peculiar obligations of Chriſtianity. <hi>We are bought with the blood of Jeſus, we are not our own, we are bought with a price:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us ſurrender our ſelves entirely unto <hi>him, that gave himſelf for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. THE Slavery that they undergo, who ſerve ſin, ſhould add force to this Conſideration. The ſervice of ſin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſts the Spirits, and wearies the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner even to deſpair and damnation; on the contrary, the way of virtue is ſmooth, regular, even and pleaſant: <hi>Her wayes are wayes of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.</hi>

               <hi>that they which run in a race, run all, but one obtaineth the prize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I haſten to the ſecond Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and that is, the regular Method of his Zeal and Devotion. <hi>He preſs'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the mark</hi>; in the way marked out by the Maſter of the Game. There are very many zealous enough, but their zeal is blind, turbulent and factious: the Chriſtian zeal acts ſtrongly, but pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently; diſcreetly and humbly; and in ſubordination to them whom God hath ſet over us. In the fire of Hell, there is heat, without light; and the fury of zealots reſembles it much; or rather is the beginning of it. We are not only to be active in our Chriſtian courſe: but we are to order our Motion, by the Rules of our Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:59505:82"/>IT is not enough to run ſtrongly and ſwiftly for carrying the prize; but one muſt alſo run within his Circle and Sphere, elſe by the Laws of the Game he falls ſhort.</p>
            <p>MY meaning is, when we run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Mark in the Chriſtian courſe, we muſt act in all our performances, like the Diſciples of that Inſtitution, and like the Spirit of Chriſtianity, and though we come ſhort of perfection, yet our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual byaſs being the <hi>Love of Jeſus,</hi> we move <hi>toward the Mark,</hi> and in our way though clogged with many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
            <p>NOW this Genius and Spirit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, diſcovers it ſelf, 1. By the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of our intentions. Matth. 6.22. <hi>The light of the body is the eye, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine eye be ſingle, thy whole body ſhall be full of light.</hi> By the <hi>ſingle eye,</hi> in the judgment of moſt, is meant, the ſingle and habitual deſign and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of advancing the glory of God: when this runs through all our actions
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59505:82"/>
(ſuppoſe the matter of them good and allowable) though they be depreſs'd by many imperfect adherences, yet we are ſure of acceptance: for God loves to take up his reſidence with men of ſingle and ſincere intentions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS is known by our diſengage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the World: the Genius of our Religion is ſtated againſt it, and all its moſt ordinary practices, fraud, diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, vain glory, the ſatisfaction of any of our appetites, againſt the Rules of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, is of the World,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the <hi>Spirit of Jeſus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 2.</note> for by it we are inſpired to contemn it, and deſpiſe all its trifling enjoyments, and to ſquare all our actions, with an eye to immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and eternity. <hi>Love not the World, neither the things that are in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. THIS Spirit is known by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over our Paſſions, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory we have over tentations. The paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Soul have their true uſe (grief, fear, joy and anger) when they come, and go at the command of Reaſon. They
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59505:83"/>
are not to be extirpated as the Stoicks vainly pretended, but they are to be kept in awe, and within their bounds, as the paſſions in the <hi>bleſſed Jeſus</hi> were.

My buſineſs is rather to invite your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the important Truths that are contain'd in this Verſe; which need but little explication, when we look back into the former. For the Glory and Power of God appear'd ſo conſpicuous in the Miniſtry of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity becomes inexcuſable; and it is by that Glory and Power, that the great and precious Promiſes of the Goſpel are given unto us.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Goſpel was to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd, and the Kingdom of Darkneſs to be pull'd down, there was a neceſſity that the arm of God ſhould appear bare in the defence of the firſt, that he might confound the arts and deluſions of the other. The Author puts the believing <hi>Jews</hi> in mind of this demonſtration in the Verſe preceeding the Text: for the Goſpel appear'd in its beginnings, full of glory and power. And afterwards he argues, that the teſtimony of the Apoſtles could not be rejected; for they were eye-witneſſes of his Majeſty. <hi>They did not follow cunningly devis'd fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>; they were moſt unlikely of all men to impoſe upon the World, being
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59505:85"/>
deſtitute of that artifice and ſubtilty that recommend ſecular intereſts and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances. And therefore the Chriſtians might without any ſcruple or fear, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Goſpel, as the undoubted Truth of God; the infallible Method of his Wiſdom for the recovery of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>THE Text is the abſtract of the whole Goſpel, having couch'd in it the Hiſtory of our Miſery and Recovery; and the method whereby this wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance was accompliſh'd. In ſpeaking to it, I ſum up all I have to ſay in theſe four Particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. THAT there is a Corruption in the World.</item>
               <item>2. THAT this Corruption may be eſcaped.</item>

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:59505:86"/>1. THERE is a Corruption in the World. We have the Teſtimony of S. <hi>John</hi> to this great Truth,<note place="margin">1 Epiſt. S. John.</note> that the <hi>whole world lyes in wickedneſs</hi>: and this is very evident, if we conſider, 1. The oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtrugglings that we feel within our ſelves, before we are illuminated by the Goſpel. 2. The ſlow progreſs of Grace after we are illuminated. And 3. The Relapſes of the beſt of Men into their former faults and failings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I SAY, Do but conſider the ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of our Reaſon againſt our Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, before we are acquainted with the Goſpel. And this proves ſufficiently, that we have an unhappy byaſs in our Nature, to oppoſe the Dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as well as Revelation. We are made up of Body and Spirit; <hi>there is a Law in the Members, bringing into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivity the Law of the Mind; croſſing its counſels and deſigns</hi>; bowing and bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its moſt heroick reſolutions; what a load do we feel, when we would fly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven? Our ſenſual inclinations and propenſions baffle and affront the Sovereignty of the Mind. And the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59505:86"/>
Schools of all the <hi>Pagan Philoſophers,</hi> ſeem to reaſon from this Truth, as from the univerſal experience of Mankind. We feel ſuch inteſtine commotions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Reaſon and our lower Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites; that the one is run down againſt its natural tendencies; oppreſſed and buried under the drudgeries of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: So that we cannot but ſee and feel the decayes of our firſt Beauty, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ruins of our original frame. And this needs neither proof nor illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, to any that is ſo far acquainted with himſelf, as to reflect on his own acts and inward motions. How fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is he hurried to follow the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of his Senſes againſt the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt light of his Soul? How often baffled in his beſt thoughts, by their unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble clamour and noiſe? In one word, when we would prove that there is a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the World, we need no more than bid men of ingenuity and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration look within themſelves; and they muſt acknowledge the great diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that attends on moſt of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that it proceeds from ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy principle of Corruption, that maintains a conſtant War againſt the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59505:87"/>
Spirit. What God made, was beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and harmonious; the Soul of Man, as well as his Countenance, looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven; his lower faculties were then calm and obedient. But when we view <hi>him</hi> in his preſent condition, we feel that he is miſerable; and his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt infelicity is, that he knows not (of himſelf) where to find his remedy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS is clear, if we conſider the ſlow progreſs of Grace, after we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Goſpel. This cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is ſo inveterate and ſo deeply rooted, that even when we are reſcu'd from its tyranny, it yet moleſts our peace, and diſturbs our quiet. We muſt fight after we are in poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as well as when we ſtruggled with our enemies in the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi> My meaning is, that the <hi>Canaanite</hi> is ſtill in the Land; and the moſt ſignal Victory leaves ſome remains of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, though ſcatter'd and broken, yet they are very troubleſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie.</p>
            <p>SUCH is the ſtrength and enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tentations, ſuch the ſubtilty of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59505:87"/>
our enemies, the infirmity of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the ſoft inſinuations of Senſe, that unleſs we keep the ſtricteſt watch, we loſe more ground in a moment, than we are able to recover in a conſiderable time. And though we feel our ſelves ſometimes full of life and alacrity, <hi>to run the race that's ſet before us</hi>; yet, in an inſtant ſuch wearineſs creeps over all our faculties, that we grow lumpiſh and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, cold and unactive as the Earth. So difficult a thing it is to climb up the Hill, to row againſt the ſtream, to change the old cuſtoms of our Nature; to pull up inveterate habits, and to <hi>crucifie the fleſh, with the affections and luſts thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So backward are we to receive the impreſſions of the Goſpel, that when our Souls are form'd into the <hi>Image of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> we again look back unto <hi>Egypt.</hi> God is provoked every moment to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert us; his Graces are not improved, his Spirit is reſiſted, his love deſpiſed; ſo ſlowly goes our Victory forward, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter full and plain Convictions, the moſt ſolemn Vows, and deliberate Reſolutions. If the Light of the Goſpel, in conjunction with, and ſuperadded to our Reaſon,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59505:88"/>
conquers our Corruption ſo ſlowly; we muſt conclude, that it is very deeply rooted in our Nature; eſpecially when we conſider,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE relapſes of the beſt of Men into their former follies. Nothing proves more the weakneſs of Humane Nature, than the remarkable failings of Wiſe and Religious Men. And it is obſervable, that the Divine Providence hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times permitted the moſt eminent Saints to fall into the very ſins that they moſt abhorr'd, and were moſt oppoſite unto their habitual reſolutions. What more inconſiſtent with the generous and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Spirit of <hi>David,</hi> than by treachery and baſeneſs to expoſe his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> to unavoidable ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? What more unagreeable to the Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> than to proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute his Royal Authority to the humors and fancies of ſo many Women? Was there any thing more unlike the zeal and courage of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> than to be ſo ſoon frighted at the Challenge of a poor Maid? If we are kept from the moſt notorious Crimes, we ſhould wholly impute it to the Grace and Favour of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:59505:88"/>THE danger and prevailing force, the univerſality and pertinacious obſtinacy of this Corruption, cannot be better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, than in the Language of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures. <note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 48. v. 8.</note>

            <p>WHEN we reflect upon the former Truth with attention; It teaches us hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.<note place="margin">Job 15.14</note> For if this Corruption be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious, ſo pertinacious, and ſo difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cur'd; may not we infer with <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> the <hi>Temanite, What is man that he
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59505:89"/>
ſhould be clean? and he which is born of a Woman, that he ſhould be righteous? Behold he putteth no truſt in his Saints,</hi>

               <hi>yea, the heavens are not clean in his ſight, how much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN we remember that we have been made a <hi>little lower than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, crowned with glory and dignity,</hi> yet now fall'n in a manner below the Beaſts that periſh; that our underſtandings are darkned with ignorance and error; and our Souls become the habitations of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paſſions; ought not this conſideration alone, to take down our pride and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? There is not a more compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous method to attain true humility, than to be acquainted with thy ſelf; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes of our Body are ſo many, that Phyſicians have not names for them; and the weakneſſes of our Mind are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more. So many are the toſſings and contradictions of our thoughts, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of our fancies; the rovings and variety of our imaginations, that in a minute we may learn, that <hi>every man at his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:59505:89"/>CAN there be then any enquiry more ſeaſonable and more profitable, than to ask, if this <hi>Corruption</hi> may be eſcaped? And this leads me to the ſecond Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular that I promis'd to ſpeak to; and that is,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT this Corruption may be eſcaped. And this I ſhall endeavour to make clear, from theſe three Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 1. The Remorſe of our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. 2. The Pleadings and Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations of God himſelf in the Holy Scriptures. 3. The Strength, Nature and Efficacy of Spiritual Aſſiſtances of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I SAY, Conſider the Remorſe of Conſcience. S. <hi>Paul</hi> is witneſs, that the very Heathens had it, when they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs'd the Laws of Nature, the Soul did puniſh it ſelf by remorſe and bitter refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and when they were innocent, there innocence was an inviſible ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port againſt all Calumnies and Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> Their thoughts did <hi>both accuſe and excuſe.</hi> I would gladly know, whence the uneaſineſs of a Man's mind, upon the wilful violation of God's Law
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59505:90"/>
ariſes? The ſevere regrets and piercing thoughts, wherewith the Soul laſhes her ſelf, if there were no other Argument to prove the whole of Natural Religion, this remorſe alone muſt neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and defend all its Principles. Do we uſe to blame our ſelves, becauſe we do not fly with Wings, becauſe we cannot meaſure the Heavens, drain the Seas, or remove Mountains? No cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly.</p>
            <p>THE remorſe of Conſcience feeds it ſelf with this thought alone, that the evil which we have committed, might have been avoided. And if there be no ground for any ſuch thought, there is no more place for any degrees of this remorſe of Conſcience. Liſten then to the ſuggeſtions of thy own mind, and you ſhall immediately feel, that you might have done otherwiſe; that you might have followed that which is juſt and right, and have avoided that very ſin, for which thou art ſo ſeverely chaſtis'd and laſh'd by thy Conſcience: elſe whence is this ſharp and piercing torture of thy mind, upon the commiſſion of wilful and deliberate ſins?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:59505:90"/>EPICTETUS his <hi>Philoſophy</hi> may be reduc'd to theſe two. 1. To order pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the things that fall within our power. 2. To ſuffer cheerfully that which we cannot poſſibly avoid. And the Light of Nature could not poſſibly preſcribe a more excellent method to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain true tranquillity of Spirit. When thou art then moſt impartial in the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of thy Conſcience, tell me ſincerely, whom do you blame? and if you blame your ſelf, then is it purely upon this account: becauſe you might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the faults and omiſſions that are then under conſideration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS Truth appears from the pathetick expoſtulations of God in the Holy Scriptures. He as it were comes down from his Throne of Majeſty, and ſtoops to reaſon the caſe with incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible ſinners. He pleads with them from acknowledg'd Principles of Reaſon, as if he ſtood upon even ground; not to upbraid them with their weakneſſes, but to provoke their ingenuity; to work upon all their Paſſions; to aſſault their Souls on all quarters; to ſee if
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59505:91"/>
they will repent and be reclaim'd.<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.18.</note> 
               <hi>Come now and let us reaſon together</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow; though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wooll. Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 2.5.</note> 
               <hi>What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?</hi> And again,<note place="margin">v. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>Paſs over the Iſles of Chittim, and ſee, and ſend unto Kedar, and conſider di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently; and ſee if there be ſuch a thing? Hath a Nation changed their Gods, which are yet no Gods? But my people have changed their glory, for that which doth not profit. Be aſtoniſhed O ye hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, at this! and be horribly afraid.</hi> And again,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.25.</note> 
               <hi>Hear now, O houſe of Iſrael! are not my ways equal, are not your ways unequal.</hi> Sometimes he courts their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, by the moſt powerful Charms all crowded together, in a ſtrain of pity, condeſcenſion and ſeverity. <hi>Wo unto thee O Jeruſalem!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 13.27.</note> 
               <hi>when wilt thou be made clean, when ſhall it once be?</hi> And our <hi>Saviour</hi> in the Goſpel, thus aſſaults them when they were upon the precipice of ruine. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, how often would I have gathered thee, as a Hen ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59505:91"/>
her Chickens under her wings, but ye would not.</hi> And again, <hi>You will not come unto me</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>that you might have life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM all theſe reaſonings put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ſee that God condeſcends to plead with us from our own Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and indeed if our Souls were not acceſſible to Arguments and Reaſonings, the Stones might be as wiſely addreſs'd to, as we could be reaſon'd unto refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>THE poſſibility of this change and eſcape from the Corruptions of the World, appears 3. From the ſtrength and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of that Grace which is offer'd in the Goſpel. We need no other proof of the poſſibility of ſuch a Reformation as we plead for, than the Victory and Succeſs of Chriſtianity over Vice and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, amongſt them who have cordially embraced it. This was the Argument that the firſt <hi>Apologiſts</hi> for our Religion made uſe of, to prove its Divinity. Such a wonderful change could not be wrought in its Proſelytes, without a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Power; and if ſo many have been
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59505:92"/>
actually changed, then it is modeſt to infer, that our reformation is poſſible.</p>
            <p>WHEN we remember the biaſs of our inclinations, how contradictory they are to the deſigns of the Goſpel, how adverſe to purity, ſimplicity and ſelf-denyal; it can be nothing leſs than a Miracle, to <hi>pull down ſtrong holds, and lofty imaginations, and to lead every thought captive to the obedience of Chriſt, to take up our Croſs and follow him</hi>; this is the triumph of the Goſpel. And if the Grace of God did not aſſiſt us, how is it conceivable, that ſuch weak and feeble Creatures, ſhould grapple with ſo many difficulties, and at laſt overcome them? That the Change we plead for is poſſible, even from under the power of the moſt inveterate habits and the groſſeſt ſins, is further clear from 1 Cor. 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>Know ye not, that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God. Be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, nor Adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God. And ſuch were ſome
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59505:92"/>
of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM what I have ſaid, it is very evident, that no man ought to plead for his impenitence, as if he were irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably chain'd up under the power of his ſins and evil habits. God pleads with him, and his own Conſcience expoſtulates, and the experience of all ſober men, baffle his pretences; for no man is ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ty'd to miſery and corruption, but that he may break his bonds, and <hi>eſcape the corruption that is in the World through luſt. To day then,</hi> let me exhort you, <hi>if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts,</hi> break up the Priſon doors; the Grace of the Goſpel is mighty and powerful; you cannot be captive againſt your wills; this corruption that prevails in the World may be eſcaped and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Do not fright your ſelves out of your duty, by vain apparitions, ſcare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crows and counterfeit apologies, ſuch as the ſlothful man in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> is ſaid to uſe; <hi>There is a Lyon without, I ſhall be ſlain in the ſtreets.</hi> All ſuch excuſes
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59505:93"/>
are vain and impertinent; whether they are taken 1. From the difficulty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving old habits: or, 2. From the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of our worldly incumbrances; or, 3. From the multitude and ſtrength of temptations: or, 4. From the ſeverities of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE excuſes taken from the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of old habits. The incorrigible ſinner will plead, that the <hi>Ethiopian can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not change his skin, nor the Leopard his ſpots, nor they that are accuſtomed to do evil, ever learn to do well.</hi>
            </p>

               <note place="margin">Vid. Orig. cont. Celſ.</note>THUS <hi>Celſus</hi> againſt <hi>Origen</hi> ſeems to deny the poſſibility of any ſuch reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Chriſtian Religion requires: becauſe cuſtomary ſins become a ſecond Nature, that no puniſhments can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form or change; <hi>yet</hi> (ſaith <hi>Origen</hi>) <hi>herein</hi> Celſus <hi>not only contradicts the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but all others who own any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous principles of Philoſophy.</hi> And there <hi>Origen</hi> gives inſtances in their own Heroes, and ſuch as were admir'd for Vertue among the Heathens, that our recovery from Vice was very practicable; and though it be difficult in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59505:93"/>
to eradicate old habits, yet when the firſt aſſaults are over (if we vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly proſecute ſo excellent a deſign) it becomes pleaſant and delightful. Herein appeared the power of the Goſpel, that it made men exemplary in theſe very Graces that were moſt oppoſite to their former biaſs. Thus the firſt <hi>Apologiſts</hi> plead in behalf of Chriſtian Religion: <hi>Let us ſee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Lactantius</hi>) <hi>the moſt proud, and he will become humble; the moſt covetous, liberal; the moſt fierce and cruel, tame and meek like a Lamb.</hi> And is it poſſible, that ſuch a change can be wrought, but by a ſupernatural Cauſe; by light, and motives far beyond our former principles? If we act by world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Maxims, we muſt be confin'd in our thoughts to the lower Regions; but <hi>when the day-ſpring from on high viſits us,</hi> the Soul feels within her ſelf new powers and faculties, which earthly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives could not put in motion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though evil habits could not be throughly reform'd by the faint and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimous attempts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the <hi>Pagan Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers</hi>; yet the moſt inveterate cuſtoms and wicked practices could not reſiſt the light of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> When we plead
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59505:94"/>
that we cannot do otherwiſe than we do, it is not our Reaſon that ſpeaks, but our lazineſs, our idleneſs and ſenſuality: for all wiſe men, and the ſtarkeſt fools, in their lucid intervals thought otherwiſe, elſe there is no diſtinction between choice and blind fate; between Men and Beaſts; between Reaſon and Mechaniſm; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Intellect and Matter. If you then perſiſt in this obſtinate foolery, that you cannot be reform'd from your vicious converſation, your reaſonings deſign to prove no more, than that you have no excellency above the Beaſts that periſh; and by ſuch arguings you take the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt methods to reſemble them in the ſtricteſt ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. SOME plead the incumbrances of the World. And it is certain that moſt men endeavour to excuſe themſelves by ſuch Arguments. The vanity and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptineſs of this excuſe is repreſented by our Saviour, <hi>One went to his Farm, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his Merchandiſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 22.5.</note> and alledg'd, <hi>they could not come.</hi> But this is the higheſt contempt of the Wiſdom of God, as if there could be any buſineſs of ſo great importance, as the ſaving of our

Souls. And beſides, to prove the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence of this excuſe, I can inſtance Men of <hi>Royal Quality</hi> and vaſt incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, who amidſt all their divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and avocations; found leiſure for their devotion, and the Worſhip of God. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a great Captain, a great Prince, and a great Politician; yet his hands were lifted up to Heaven in Prayer, when others muſt needs ſupport him. <hi>Job</hi> was very illuſtrious among the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and yet under a deluge of Calamities, and the continual repinings of his Wife, he preach'd reſignation. <hi>David</hi> was a Warlike Prince, yet the melodious Strains of his Harp were as Devout as Poetical. <hi>Solomon</hi> a King, the greateſt and wiſeſt that ever ſat upon the Throne of <hi>Judah,</hi> when he enter'd upon the Government, in the firſt place, fell down before God, and begged <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> to order and conduct ſo <hi>numerous a People.

               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:59505:95"/>LET us not then plead the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of the World: for they that moſt converſe with God, are taught even to diſpatch their worldly affairs with greater diſcretion than their neighbours; becauſe no part of their time is ſpent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently.</p>
            <p n="3">3. SOME plead the ſtrength and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous violence of temptations. It muſt be confeſs'd, that the objects of Senſe do ſtrongly allure and flatter the mind to unworthy compliances; and that they entice us conſtantly to bodily pleaſures; yet if it be uneaſie to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch inſinuations, let the very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty provoke our courage; for the moſt glorious enterpriſes are atcheiv'd by patience and fortitude. And if the prize of honour were not encompaſs'd with Thorns and Briars, it might fall to the ſhare of every deſpicable Wretch; whereas indeed, honour crowns the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, and ſuch as reſolutely face the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

and patience, that rais'd them above their neighbours. And if ſuch a tranſient thing as the favour of a <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Hoſanna</hi>'s of the Croud, cannot be juſtly obtain'd, but by toil and labour; how is it poſſible, that we can think to gain immortal honours, without wreſtling and ſtruggling? God hath placed us on this Theatre to act our part, to try our patience and our fidelity; and with a deſign to trample upon the World by his Grace in us, that <hi>we may be more than Conquerours through Chriſt that loved us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tentations from the World are indeed very terrible, <hi>the Luſts of the Fleſh, the Luſts of the Eye, and the Pride of Life.</hi> But may not all theſe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by Faith, and the Spirit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity? their ſtrength (if we approach them cloſely) is not ſo formidable. 'Tis true, they appear invincible to the ſoft and delicate, but they have no reliſh to the Soul illuminated with the knowledge of Chriſt. The eye of Faith diſcovers their emptineſs, they are but ſhadows and appearances of things, attended in their moſt flattering dreſs, with vanity and vexation of Spirit. Let us awake

then, and ſee what is it, that thus inchants us into folly and ſin. What are thoſe pleaſures that we doat ſo much upon, if once compar'd to the pure <hi>rivers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that are at his right hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. SOME plead the ſeverity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, to excuſe them from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it. The Precepts of humility, meekneſs and ſelf-denyal are intolerable to ſuch: but I muſt tell them, that ſuch Precepts appear only terrible to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and ſuch as have no mind to come under any yoke or diſcipline at all.

vigorouſly until the noiſome rubbiſh of our corruptions were remov'd, then our Souls might become a clean habitation for the Spirit of God; and where the Spirit of God dwells, there is alſo peace, light and tranquillity; joy unſpeakable and full of glory. What an impregnable Garriſon againſt calumny and diſaſter, is a <hi>Conſcience void of offence towards God, and towards man!</hi> How vain is it to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the painting of it by rhetorical colours!

uſually pleaded in its defence, is vain and unreaſonable. Let me ask then, how this Contagion, that has ſo univerſally over-run Mankind, may be cured? And the Text makes anſwer to this, that this Corruption is eſcaped by <hi>the great, and the precious promiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND this leads me to the third Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that I am oblig'd to ſpeak to. The Goſpel in it ſelf is the great and laſt Engine of God's Goodneſs and Wiſdom, for the recovery of the World; and the Promiſes of the Goſpel are the Wheels upon which it moves. So much Spirit and Life did go alongſt with the firſt preaching of the Goſpel, that it ſhook the Pillars of the Kingdom of Darkneſs, threw open the Priſons of Satan, and loos'd whole Societies of Men from their bondage.<note place="margin">Acts 26.18.</note> The Apoſtles did <hi>open their eyes, and turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> The Promiſes of the Goſpel are the counterpoiſe that God hath laid in the other Scale againſt ſin. He principally deſigns to deliver from ſin, and from the Love of the World, becauſe it leads un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin; and the Promiſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59505:97"/>
have a peculiar energy to ſave us from the one, and to deter us from the other. If we believ'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpel, without fear and hypocriſie, we would immediately turn our backs upon our ſins, eſpecially when we remember, that theſe very Promiſes are environ'd about with the moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble denunciations of the wrath of God againſt the diſobedient.<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 1.7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> Can there be any thing ſo powerful to alienate our affections from the World, as the Promiſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel?<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> How far was the glory of the Court of <hi>Egypt</hi> below the Spirit of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when he ſaw him that is inviſible, and had reſpect unto the recompence of reward?</hi> We are expreſly told by S. <hi>John,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. LET us ponder, and conſider the excellencies of theſe Promiſes. I ſhall name but the two Epithets beſtow'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in the Text. 1. They are Great. 2. They are Precious. I ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are Great: and that in three regards. 1. With regard to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, the <hi>only begotten Son of God, whom all the Angels worſhip and adore. He is the brightneſs of his Fathers glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds all things by the word of his power.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> This one conſideration is enough to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verawe the boldeſt ſinner, and it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taken notice of, to magnifie the Goſpel, and to recommend to us the Precepts of our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.6, 7, 8.</note> that <hi>he was in the form of God, and thought it no robbery to be equal with God, but made himſelf of no reputation,</hi> &amp;c. Shall we contemn the Promiſes made by the Son of God? God ſent his Son to give the <hi>Jews</hi> the laſt, and moſt undenyable proof of his Love and Wiſdom:<note place="margin">Matth.</note> 
               <hi>Certainly they will

reverence my Son.</hi> Thus reaſons the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2.3.</note> 
               <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10.28, 29.</note> And again, <hi>He that deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Moſes Law died without mercy under two or three Witneſſes; of how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer puniſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace.</hi> Againſt whom does the incorrigible ſinner ſport himſelf? againſt the Son of God, and the cleareſt proofs of his love. <hi>For herein is love, not that we loved him, but that he loved us, and gave his Son to be a propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for our ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. THE Promiſes are Great in their intrinſic value. I mean not only the Promiſe of eternal life, but all the other Promiſes that are of a relative and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Nature, the Graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the remiſſion of our ſins, the peace of our Conſciences, theſe are things to be valued above Gold and Silver. <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

is preferred above the choiceſt Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies; the Gold of Ophir is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd unto her.</hi> Therefore the Graces of the Spirit are compar'd unto the moſt coſtly things;<note place="margin">Rev. 5.18.</note> 
               <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me Gold tried in the fire, that thou mayeſt be rich; and white rayment, that thou mayeſt be cloathed, and the ſhame of thy nakedneſs do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with eye-ſalve, that thou mayeſt ſee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Promiſes are Great in their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and deſign, to recover the World ſunk into Corruption; to overthrow the Worſhip of Devils, to enlighten the World, to take down the Kingdom of Darkneſs, and to advance the Image of God upon the Souls of Men; were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns becoming the Goodneſs and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of the Son of God. But of this I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak under the fourth Particular. And therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſecond Epithet beſtowed upon the Promiſes. They are not only Great, but,</p>
            <p n="2">2. PRECIOUS. And that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their 1. Price. 2. Certainty.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:59505:101"/>3. Durableneſs. 1. In regard of their Price.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.18.</note> S. <hi>Peter</hi> informs us, that <hi>we are not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, from our vain converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without ſpot or blemiſh.</hi> There is no Religion wants its Sacrifice, and this is the Myſterious Sacrifice of our Religion; the blood that ſpeaketh better things than the blood of <hi>Abel</hi>; that powerful Atonement, that ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully pleads for pity and compaſſion in the ears of God; the Sacrifice under whoſe interceſſion we come with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Throne of Grace; the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that laid aſide all the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the Sacrifice that was typified by all the former, and was more acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable unto God, than <hi>the Cattel upon a thouſand bills.</hi> This is the Sacrifice that the Prophets foretold, and the Apoſtles preach'd, and upon which we muſt lean at the hour of death. Nature teacheth us to fly to the ſtrongeſt refuge, when we are reduc'd to the ſaddeſt extremities. And therefore do we graſp the Merit of his Sacrifice, in our laſt conflicts and ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; <hi>for he is the Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſins of the world.</hi> This
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59505:101"/>
is the Sacrifice, that bears the weight of all their ſins who are penitent. So rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the Divine Author to the <hi>Hebrews; for if the blood of Bulls and of Goats, and aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9.13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>ſanctifieth to the purifying of the Fleſh; how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your Conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY that allow him no more, than to be a reſolute Martyr for the Truth; who rob us of the comforts of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and Propitiation; take away the great pillar of our hope at the hour of death; they would reform us unto a gentile kind of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> though there be no error more plainly oppoſite to the Scriptures than theirs. For the Notion of a piacular Sacrifice, and the penal ſubſtitution of it in the room of the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, was receiv'd amongſt all Nations; and the Scripture makes uſe of the ſame words that are uſed by other Authors, to expreſs a proper atonement, when they ſpeak of the Sacrifice of our <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:59505:102"/>WHEN we conſider this, it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our hope, and withal put us in mind, <hi>how fearful a thing it is to trample upon the blood of the Son of God; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing redeem'd by his blood, we are no more our own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. THE Promiſes are precious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their certainty. The frame of Nature may ſooner be diſſolv'd, the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Creation may ſhake and crumble into their firſt diſorder, rather than that his Word ſhould fail; <hi>for he is everlaſting truth,</hi>

               <hi>and he cannot lye.

If thoſe Ordinances depart from before me, ſaith the Lord, then the ſeed of Iſrael alſo ſhall ceaſe from being a Nation before me for ever.</hi> Theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are made to the Spiritual ſeed of the true <hi>Iſraelites</hi>;<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> as is proved by S. <hi>Paul.</hi> And therefore to remove all our doubts and diffidence, all our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt and heſitation, they are confirm'd

by his Oath;<note place="margin">Heb. 6.17, 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>Wherein God willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the heirs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the immutability of his Counſel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it by an Oath. That by two immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have a ſtrong conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. THE Promiſes are precious, in regard of their durableneſs, I mean that the things promiſed are eternal. There is nothing liable to decay, that can give true repoſe to the Spirit of a Man; the Chriſtian Religion ſettles the frame, and ſatisfies the enquiries of our Souls, by bringing life and immortality to light. Nothing elſe can ſatisfie the vaſt capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the mind of Man. The endleſs duration of our happineſs is expreſs'd in the Scriptures, by full and plain phraſes. <hi>And this is the promiſe that he hath promiſed us, even eternal life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 2.25.</note> And again, in the Goſpel of S. <hi>John, He that keepeth my ſayings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall never ſee death.</hi> And S. <hi>Peter</hi> aſſures us, that <hi>we are begotten again unto a lively hope by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead: To an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59505:103"/>
that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for you.</hi> And can there be any thing, that ſo adequately ſatisfies the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs deſires, and intellectual appetites of a reaſonable Creature, as an eternal weight of glory. O Eternity! who can forget Thee, that remembers himſelf, and the frame of his Nature? Who can contemn eternal things, that thinks that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is any thing more excellent than the Beaſts that periſh? Have we naturally ſuch ſtrong inclinations to immortality, and can we deſpiſe the Goſpel that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares and trims our Souls for life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? Who can reflect on the variety and Spirituality of his own thoughts, and yet conclude, that he was made to <hi>make proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof?</hi> Let no ſuch thoughts dwell within thee, but rather <hi>look at the things which are not ſeen.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.1.</note> 
               <hi>For we know, that if our earthly houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</hi> And now when we look upon whole Goſpel, its entire frame and deſign we may ſafely ſay of it, as the Apoſtle ſays of its Promiſes, that it is <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> in all its lineaments and features.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59505:103"/>
Eſpecially when we conſider the great deſign that is carried on by the Goſpel, and that is nothing leſs, than to make us partakers of the Divine Nature. And this leads me to the fourth Particular, that I promis'd to ſpeak to: <hi>viz.</hi>

and that this is his delight. <hi>Have I any pleaſure at all that the Wicked ſhould dye, ſaith the Lord God,</hi>

               <hi>than that every one that nameth the name of Jeſus muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from all iniquity.</hi> Our Religion is very pure, and it is the laſt revelation of his Will, that God vouchſafes to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And therefore it bears the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reſemblance of the Divine Nature, and is perfective of ours; and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples of this Religion muſt not think to recommend themſelves to God or Mankind, by artificial knacks of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, disfigured faces, and Phariſaical Prayers; but rather by ardent zeal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59505:106"/>
ſimplicity, the moſt generous charity, ſincere mortification, and a Will reſign'd to his Infinite Wiſdom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. LET us ſuppoſe, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures did not ſo peremptorily inculcate the neceſſity of this change, yet the Notions that we have of God, confirm this truth, that nothing ſhort of true Piety, can recommend us unto Him; that in order to our Salvation, we muſt be partakers of the Divine Nature. Is he ſuch an eaſie Majeſty, that he may be put off with multitude of Sacrifices, coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Oblations and outward Solemnities of Religion? Can he be diverted from the execution of his Juſtice by complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Addreſſes? Pray what do we take him to be? Is he fond of Trifles and Ceremonies? To imagine that ſighs and tears, and melancholy reflections will propitiate the Deity, charges him with ſeverity and cruelty; as if he took plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the calamities and ſufferings of his Creatures.<note place="margin">Vid. Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biad. Plat.</note> Whereas nothing is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but our true reformation and freedom from ſin.

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59505:106"/>
Charity, are the Sacrifices moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Deity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. SUCH is the diſtance of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from Heaven, and the employment of that State, that we muſt do violence to our corrupt inclinations, before we can act our part, <hi>among the Spirits of juſt men made perfect; we muſt become meet partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi> Sin (though pardoned) yet if it is not extirpated, muſt ſink us unto Hell. It is in its nature moſt oppoſite unto God, <hi>i. e.</hi> to his Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Power: becauſe it carries along with it all the lineaments of baſeneſs, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and malice. This ſhould make us hate all thoſe Principles in Religion, that make the <hi>way broad,</hi> that our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath pronounced <hi>ſtrait.</hi> All thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Opinions that ſeem to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote licentiouſneſs, folly and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;<note place="margin">Matthew.</note> 
               <hi>if the light that is in thee be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs?</hi> but when corrupt Nature, and corrupt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are combin'd together, there is no hope of our recovery; and we are carried headlong into all folly and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:59505:107"/>2. LET us enquire wherein the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the Divine Nature appear. God is the firſt and original beauty; and true Religion is but a Tranſcript of his Nature. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT carries the Lineaments of his Power and Victory. True Religion is a Confederacy with the Almighty.<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>We can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth us. The Lord is my ſtrength</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>my rock and my fortreſs, my deliverer, my God, in whom I will truſt: My buckler, the horn of my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and my high tower.</hi> His Power is viſible in our conqueſts over ſin; we muſt prove our ſelves to be the Sons of God, by our triumphs and victories over the World: becauſe he that is in us, is greater than he that is in the World.</p>
            <p>THE raviſhing beauty of the Divine Nature, ſhines in the converſations of the righteous. For all round about them <hi>ſee their good works, and glorifie their father which is in heaven.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Phil. 2.15.</note> 
               <hi>They are blameleſs and harmleſs without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,

in the midſt of a crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Purity of the Divine Nature is copied in the life of a Chriſtian: pure and undefil'd Religion flies from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs and hypocriſie, by a divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and ſenſation. The Scripture ſeems to ſearch for all Metaphors, to repreſent unto us the filthineſs of ſin. <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 3.13.</note> 
               <hi>The Rottenneſs of the Grave, the</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.20.</note> 
               <hi>Vomit of Dogs, the Poyſon of Vipers, the Filthineſs of Swine,</hi> are ſome of the expreſſions that point unto us the odious Nature of ſin. <hi>But God is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. And the Wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and eaſie to be intreated, full of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocriſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Wiſdom of God is no leſs ſeen in the lives of good men. True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the knowledge of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Truths, the contemplation of the moſt glorious objects, and the practice of ſuch duties as are moſt ſerviceable to our happineſs. <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wiſdom. The Children
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59505:108"/>
of this World are ſaid to be wiſer in their own generation, than the Children of Light; i. e.</hi> they are more skilful to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage worldly affairs. But in the true eſtimate of things, they are fools in the ſtricteſt ſenſe. The truly Religious, is the only Wiſe Man; he alone improves his Reaſon to the beſt advantage: for he looks to things future, as well as to the things preſent; he prefers great things to ſmall things, and chuſes the fitteſt Means to attain his ends; <hi>this is to be wiſe unto ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE are taught by the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to imitate the Divine Goodneſs, his unenvious Bounty, his unconſtrain'd Liberality.<note place="margin">Matth. 5.44, 45, 46.</note> 
               <hi>Love your enemies; bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you; and pray for them which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you; that you may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven: for he maketh his Sun to riſe on the evil, and on the good; and ſendeth rain on the juſt and unjuſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GREATNESS of Spirit is a branch of the Divine Nature; and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is great in his Victories, Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59505:108"/>
and Behaviour; nothing mean and ſordid, in the behaviour of the true Sons of God: <hi>they are heirs of God, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs with Chriſt, and therefore muſt needs have the world under their feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM what I have ſaid, we may eaſily learn, That there is nothing ſo amiable as true Religion. Nothing elſe reſembles the Divine Nature,<note place="margin">1 John.</note> 
               <hi>He that is born of God, committeth no ſin; he that committeth ſin is of the Devil; and the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi> The Text that I have hitherto diſcours'd of, is the abridgement of the Goſpel. Let us remember our miſerable condition by Nature, and enquire what effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies there may be to knock off our fetters, to procure unto us the <hi>Liberty of the Sons of God,</hi> to reſtore us to his Image, and how glorious our Victory muſt make us, when we are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Divine Nature; when we live in a purer Air, and feed our Souls with the proſpect of Immortality; when we are got above the Enchantments of Senſe; when by our comfortable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience <hi>we taſte and ſee that God is good</hi>;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59505:109"/>
and in the meditation of ſuch things, <hi>let us commit our ſouls unto him, as into the hands of a faithful Creator.</hi>

Poem of all that <hi>Solomon</hi> ever wrote, and deſerves to be ſo called, as <hi>Grotius</hi> hath it, <hi>ob multas elegantias quae in alium ſermonem tranſlatae non idem ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piunt,</hi> they are like Aromatick Spirits that cannot ſo eaſily be conveyed from one veſſel to another.</p>
            <p>'TIS in its kind a <hi>Dramatic Poem,</hi> full of art and delicious harmony, that under the Chaſt and Sacred Metaphor of Marriage, ſets off the <hi>Love of Chriſt to his Church,</hi> in the moſt raviſhing ſtrains and flouriſhes. And this is laid down as the firſt foundation of expounding this Book, by the beſt Interpreters both Antient and Modern: and the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves moſt unanimouſly conclude, that it hath an immediate reference to the glories and felicities of the <hi>Meſſias</hi>; and this Metaphor of <hi>Marriage,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the <hi>Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Chriſt to his Church,</hi> is frequent in the Writings of the Prophets. Hoſea 2.19. <hi>I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth thee unto me for ever, yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſs and in judgment.</hi> And it is no leſs uſual to the Apoſtles, when we look into the New Teſtament, Epheſ. 5. and 32. <hi>This is a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59505:110"/>
great Myſterie, but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and his Church.</hi> 2 Cor.11. and 2. <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one husband, that I may preſent you as a chaſt Virgin to Chriſt.</hi> Revel. 19.7. and 9. <hi>For the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her ſelf ready, and to her was granted, that ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine linnen, clean and white: for the fine linnen is the righteouſneſs of the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW when we apply to the Church the Characters of Beauty, and the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sacred Love, that are ſcattered up and down through this Book, we but follow and trace the footſteps of the Prophets and the Apoſtles. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> in his firſt Sermon on the <hi>Canticles,</hi> gives this Epitome of the Works of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that are extant. <hi>In the Book of the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, <hi>ſuperfluous ſelf love is baniſhed; in the Book of</hi> Eccleſiaſtes, <hi>the vain love of the World is rejected:</hi> but, <hi>in Cantico Canticorum praeſcribitur caſtus Amor Dei</hi>; the whole Book being nothing elſe, but the ſtrongeſt efforts of the Divine Love to be united in the cloſeſt Bonds to Chriſt our Head.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:59505:111"/>AND this Chapter out of which I have read this Verſe, breaths the ſame air, and is wholly taken up, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the incomparable Beauty of the <hi>Spouſe. Behold thou art fair my Love, behold thou art fair: i. e.</hi> thou art fair beyond thought or expreſſion.

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I SAY, We have the uſe of thoſe Waters, <hi>Fons hortorum,</hi> a Fountain of Gardens, ſo conveniently ſituated in the middle, that by its Conduits and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, it may water and refreſh the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Gardens. <hi>The Church</hi> looks
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59505:112"/>
with tenderneſs and compaſſion, on the right, and on the left hand; as our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> looked upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> before her approaching ruine, and ſays in his very words, <hi>How often would I have gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you? She</hi> wiſely and diſcreetly diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes the Waters of Life to the neceſſities of all; the contrite and humble, <hi>ſhe</hi> raiſes from the duſt, by conſolations and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes; the incorrigible and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, <hi>She</hi> caſts down by Thunder and Lightning, by words of terror and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. <hi>She</hi> comforts the fearful, warns the ſlothful, and applies her ſelf to the ſpiritual neceſſities of all. <hi>For her weapons are not carnal, but mighty through God, for pulling down ſtrong holds, and lofty imaginations, and leading our thoughts captive to the obedience of Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I WOULD not paſs over this firſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor tranſiently, but let us examine its deſign, and we ſhall find it may natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally imply, either Firſt, The Beauty of its Situation; or, Secondly, The abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of its Furniture; or, Thirdly, The Strength of its Incloſure; or, Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Propriety of its Owner. 'Tis <hi>Fons ſignatus,</hi> a Fountain ſealed, <hi>the chaſt
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59505:113"/>
Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt, married and ſealed by his Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I SAY, this Metaphor implies, the Beauty of its Situation, ſo plac'd, that it might water the neighbouring Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and Incloſures, that the Rivulets derived thence, might moiſten and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie all quarters of its dependance. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſays to his <hi>Apoſtles, you are the Light of the World, and a City ſet upon an hill cannot be hid.</hi> Iſa. 5.1. The Church is ſaid to be <hi>a Vineyard on a very fruitful Hill</hi>; and this <hi>is the Hill</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) Pſal. 68.16. <hi>which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to dwell in, yea, the Lord will dwell in it for ever.</hi> They then that are ſet on the Towers of <hi>Sion,</hi> muſt look on all hands to defend the place from the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of the enemy. The <hi>Church</hi> to the Earth, is like the Sun in the Firmament, though ſometimes darkned with Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, Clouds and Exhalations; yet its Beams break through the thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and illuminates South and North, Eaſt and Weſt. Our Religion is light, and nothing more evident and plain, than the light; and though we cannot give perhaps a Metaphyſical account of its
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59505:113"/>
nature, yet we all know what it is; we feel the Warmth and Beauty of it: we are not then to make this Doctrine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure or abſtruſe with human inventions, or Comments and Gloſſes ſuperinduced by Fancy, Vanities, or worldly Deſigns; nor are we to keep it up from People, but to let the Streams of thoſe Waters run ſo ſeaſonably and plentifully, for the edification of all our Maſters houſhold. The Doctrine is in it ſelf plain, We need not ſay, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to bring it down,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Romans.</note> 
               <hi>or deſcend into the Depth, to bring it from thence; for it is near thee, and in thy mouth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BY <hi>the Fountain</hi> then, I underſtand the <hi>Organic Church,</hi> plac'd as it were in the midſt of the World, and ſet upon a Hill. And ſince we are advanc'd to this height, we muſt breath in a purer Air, than the feculent Vapours of the lower Regions. Our Souls muſt fly higher, and mount nearer the Sun, than the Birds of darkneſs and Senſuality. We are obliged to converſe with the reſt of Mankind, as the Meſſengers of God, who deſign to gain them from their ſin and danger, that when the great
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59505:114"/>
Shepherd comes, we may be found ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our loins girt, each at his own Poſt moving in his own Sphere, and then ſhall we appear as Workmen that need not be aſhamed, as neither having vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated nor betrayed that Sacred <hi>Depoſitum</hi> committed to our care.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> THIS Metaphor implies the abundance of its furniture; there is in this Fountain of the Holy Scriptures, <hi>Scaturigo perennis aquarum.</hi> Mat. 13.52. <hi>The Scribe inſtructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven, bringeth forth out of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure things new and old.</hi> When our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> deſign'd to propagate his <hi>Church</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he opened the Store-houſes of Heaven upon the day of <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt,</hi> by which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Divine Eloquence and Zeal, to aſſert and defend the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven. 1 Cor. 12.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>To one is given by the Spirit the Word of Wiſdom, to another the Word of Knowledge by the ſame Spirit, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith by the ſame Spirit, to another the Gifts of healing by the ſame Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:59505:114"/>WHEN we conſider the Neceſſities of the <hi>Church,</hi> thoſe Gifts muſt needs be multiplied in proportion to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Diſeaſes and Exigencies of Mens Souls; the firſt Ages of the <hi>Church</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the miraculous Gift of Languages, Miracles and Healings: and the latter Ages, no leſs Devotion, Care and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the Gifts that are proper for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and eſtabliſhment of the People in <hi>their moſt holy Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN to this we add, the Nature of our heavenly employment. It is not a little trifling Skill, that qualifies Men for this undertaking: Our Function is converſant in the higheſt Myſteries, and ſuch as are of the higheſt conſequence; does it not require the beſt of Moral Preparations, the ſtrongeſt intellectual Furniture, all the Accompliſhments of Nature, Grace and Education?</p>
            <p>WE muſt form the Minds of Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a higher Diſcipline, than Humane Arts and Sciences; we muſt leave no Stone unturned to reform the World, we muſt dig hard in the Spiritual Mines of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59505:115"/>
the Holy Scriptures for <hi>knowledge, as for Silver, and ſearch for her, as for hid treaſures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOW delicate and curious a piece of work it is, to frame the Souls of Men into right Principles, ſolid and clear No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to recover them from darkneſs to light, to be imployed in watching over the <hi>Church,</hi> that God bought with his own blood, how noble an employment is this? The Son of God incarnate was the firſt of our <hi>Order,</hi> the Founder of our <hi>Society.</hi> When we conſider how various are the Spiritual neceſſities of the <hi>Chucch,</hi> the ignorances, miſtakes and negligences of the People, the Arts, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry and Wiles of the Devil, nothing but an inexhauſtible Fountain, can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply its wants.</p>
            <p>AND therefore the People ſhould conſider our Character as the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and moſt Sacred, it requires the cloſeſt application of Mind, the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Meditation, the moſt indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Attendance, to inſtruct the ignorant, to convert the ſinner, to ſettle the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to confirm the wavering, to rouſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59505:115"/>
up the negligent, to awaken the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to open to all men the Doctrine of Chriſtianity; and in a word, to lead our People by Vertue, Patience and Piety, through the intricate Stages of this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome life, till they are put beyond danger and tentation.</p>
            <p>ONE thus engaged, had need to be furniſhed with a grave, ſerious and ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy temper of mind. <hi>Who can think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> Would not he need to have the illumination of an Angel, the compaſſion of a Father. Would not he need the Wiſdom, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Reſolution and Courage of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Soul, whom no Storm, no Tempeſt, muſt drive from the Helm.</p>
            <p>OUR <hi>Saviour</hi> foreſeeing what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations would muſter againſt the <hi>Church,</hi> what Legions of darkneſs would endeavour to ſhake its Faith, and diſturb its Unity, did furniſh his peculiar Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that wore his Livery, with ſuch Gifts and Graces as might defend the <hi>Church,</hi> propagate the Faith, and repel the force of Errors to the end of the World. When <hi>he aſcended up on high,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59505:116"/>
he led Captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</hi> He made the <hi>illiterate Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> baffle the Infidelity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> confound the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and expoſe the Worſhip of <hi>Demons.</hi> The Donatives that he ſcattered amongſt his followers, overcame the little Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Sophiſtry of Carnal Wiſdom, and made both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> ſtoop to receive the Yoke of the <hi>Crucified Meſſias.</hi> The Prophecy of <hi>Joel</hi> was fulfilled, and his Spirit powred out on all fleſh, in ſuch plentiful effuſions, that it broke down all oppoſition, it carried all before it, and defied all obſtacles that were inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by human Counſel; and though this be meant in its moſt eminent ſenſe of the Apoſtolical Age, yet the ſame Spirit ſupplies the <hi>Church</hi> in all Ages out of the ſame fulneſs. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> IN this Metaphor is implied the ſtrength of its Incloſure. The <hi>Church</hi> is a Society formed and combined by Spiritual Laws and Ligaments: <hi>for Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem is a City that is compact together.</hi> Pſal. 122. Accordingly the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> prays, <hi>Peace be within thy Walls, and Proſperity within thy Palaces.</hi> The
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59505:116"/>
               <hi>Church</hi> is a foreign Colony, a Kingdom not of this World, fortified with Spiritual Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Laws and Arguments, to overawe the Conſciences of Men, to reclaim the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, to eſtabliſh the Authority of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> by the Promiſes and Threatnings of an Inviſible Kingdom: for his Kingdom is not of this World, it forms no deſigns againſt the Temporalities of <hi>Princes,</hi> it gives no diſturbance to their Poſſeſſions; it lives in the profoundeſt peace, and the moſt abſolute tranquillity.</p>
            <p>AND until Eaſe, Luxury, Riches and Idleneſs had debauch'd the Morals and Intellectuals of the Weſtern <hi>Church,</hi> there was no diſturbance given to the <hi>Powers of the Earth</hi>; the <hi>Church</hi> indeed is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, but a Society whoſe Laws, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims and Methods are wholly different from Secular Policy. The Nature and Genius of our Religion abſtracts Mens Minds from the World, and the Laws of it are Pure, Heavenly and Spiritual, and the natural tendency of them, is to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate our affections from the Earth.</p>
            <p>HAVE you obſerved any Society of Men under the Name of a <hi>Church,</hi> graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59505:117"/>
at Earthly Power, and by Secular Intrigues and Contrivances levelling all oppoſition, it is no more acted by the Spirit of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding of this Innocence, the <hi>Church is a Fountain of Gardens,</hi> a peculiar Incloſure, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Wolves</hi> nor <hi>Bears</hi> can break through, neither Perſecutors nor Hereticks can deſtroy it; <hi>the gates of Hell cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt it</hi>; the Storms may indeed riſe very high, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in the Ship, and he can reprove the Winds and Storms. Pſal. 129. <hi>Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſay, yet have they not prevailed, the Plowers plowed upon my back, and made long their furrows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN we remember, that the whole World lies in wickedneſs, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that prevails moſt among Mankind, is oppoſite to the deſigns of the Goſpel; what a Miracle of the Divine Goodneſs is it, that the Hedge of the <hi>Church</hi> is not quite broke down? And ſometimes the violent attempts of the Kingdom of Darkneſs may ſo far prevail by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of God, as utterly to deface and ruine particular <hi>Churches.</hi> They have
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59505:117"/>
all their Intervals, Eclipſes, and ſeveral Periods of Light and Darkneſs: for no particular <hi>Church</hi> by any Promiſe, Grant or Privilege of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> is ſecured from a poſſibility of falling, by Error, Defection and Hereſie; but the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Church</hi> is owing wholly to the Divine Arm; his Love, Care and Tenderneſs reaches the <hi>Church</hi> in all her conditions and members. <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a Shepherd, he ſhall gather the Lambs with his Arm, and carry them in his Boſom, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HIS Ambaſſadors muſt be ſuch, as by their Seriouſneſs, Gravity and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men: we muſt reſolutely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the hard Cenſures and Obloquies of a perverſe World, and when we have done our utmoſt to oblige them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the Goſpel, and <hi>us</hi> for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels ſake, we may chance to be treated with all the marks of ignominy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and diſdain. If it be ſo difficult then to preſerve the <hi>Church,</hi> and our own Reputation, from the attempts and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of wicked men; I think in Prudence,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59505:118"/>
Honour and Conſcience, we ought to be very kind to the Reputation of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To beſpatter ones Reputation, is the greateſt wound you can give his Character, and it is all one whether you do it by a direct blow; or ſlantingly, by cunning and ſlie inſinuations. Indeed we can do little by our ſelves to defend the incloſure of the <hi>Church</hi>; we are but weak and feeble, and the wickedneſs of Men makes us more and more ſo; yet if every one made his Brothers Reputation dear to him as his own, we might do very much to vindicate the Innocence, to extenuate the Infirmities, to remove the reproaches, that are Atheiſtically caſt upon Men of <hi>our Order,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> might appear unto our enemies, to be in the language of the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> Cant. 6.4. <hi>beautiful as Tirzah, and comely as Jeruſalem, and terrible as an Army with banners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE weakeſt things knit together, make a ſtrong reſiſtance; for though we fight not with carnal weapons, yet thoſe we make uſe of, are mighty to break and ſhatter the Kingdom of Darkneſs, and all its retinue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:59505:118"/>THIS Metaphor implyes <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> The Propriety of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Spouſe.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> is ſaid in the twelfth Verſe, to be <hi>Fons ſignatus, a Fountain ſealed; She</hi> carries the viſible Badge and Livery of her deareſt <hi>Lord and Redeemer: She is the chaſt Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; hence you find, whenever the <hi>Jews</hi> made defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Worſhip of the true God, the <hi>Prophets</hi> did upbraid them with their <hi>going a whoring after their Idols.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> is married unto him in <hi>Truth and Righteouſneſs</hi>; his <hi>Myſtical Body bought with his Blood</hi>; Silver and Gold could not redeem her; the Love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> is incomprehenſible, the height, the breadth, and the depth of it, goes beyond our imaginations, and much more all our expreſſions. <hi>He lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the gates of Zion, more than all the dwellings of Jacob</hi>; and Pſal. 78.68. <hi>He chuſed Mount Zion which he loved, he built his Sanctuary like the Earth, which he hath eſtabliſhed for ever</hi>; his love to the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>prima regula amoris,</hi> Eph. 5.25. <hi>Husbands love your Wives, even as Chriſt loved his Church, and gave himſelf for it.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> hath but one Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59505:119"/>
one Mediator, one Sacrifice: the Purity, Value and Propitiation of which defends <hi>her</hi> for ever, againſt all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and aſſaults of Hell. We ſee by what is ſaid, that this Metaphor in its true intent, moſt naturally agrees to the Organick Church, eſtabliſhed in the true Faith, and guarded with its true Paſtors.</p>
            <p>BUT I go forward to the ſecond Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular that I promiſed to ſpeak to; the Purity of theſe Waters; <hi>the Church is a Well of Living Waters. Dilherus</hi> renders it <hi>Puteus aquae viventis,</hi> a deep Well, <hi>non collectitiae clauſae atque ſtagnantis, ſed ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trò ſcaturientis</hi>; that by its copious, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and uninterrupted ebullitions, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters all the neighbouring Regions: they are the only Waters can quench the Thirſt of reaſonable Souls: this is the Well after which they <hi>pant</hi> and <hi>breath. As the Hart panteth after the Water-brooks,</hi> Pſal. 42.</p>
            <p>HERE Interpreters take care to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt a Fountain and a Well. Every Well is a Fountain, but every Fountain is not a Well. So the Well
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59505:119"/>
implies great <hi>depth and profundity</hi>; and this Phraſe added to the former, does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, that the Waters of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary are not only pure, clear and ſerene, but very deep; they are not a puddle, nor a ſtanding Lake; not like the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> where Fiſhes cannot live; but the ſmooth and deep Rivers of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Metaphor then duly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, does imply the Purity, Profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and free Communication of theſe Oracles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I SAY, the Purity of theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> is not to be fed with Dreams, and Fancies, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Doctrines; not with noiſe, oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and popular tricks; but with Words of Eternal Life. 2 Tim. 1.13. <hi>Hold faſt the form of ſound words which thou haſt heard of me, in Faith and Love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus. We are to take heed</hi> (1 Tim. 4.16.) <hi>to our ſelves, and to our doctrine</hi>; for this is the way to ſave our ſelves, and them which hear us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:59505:120"/>THE Hereticks of all Ages have been proud, and ſubtile, and indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and there is no Antidote againſt their Poyſon, but to adhere to the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Goſpel, the pure <hi>Canon</hi> of the Scriptures, the antient <hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>Liturgies</hi> of the <hi>Church, the faith which was delivered to the Saints,</hi> the Doctrines that have been received <hi>uno ore apud om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Chriſtianos:</hi> the Golden Rule of <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius Lirenenſis, quod apud omnes, quod ubique, quod ſemper.</hi> This is certainly the Rule of Faith, and by this Standard were the antient Hereſies examined, baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled and confounded: Reaſon, Scripture and Univerſal Tradition, were the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons by which they defended the Truth. For the Apoſtle foretells, 2 Cor. 4.2, 3. <hi>That the time would quickly come, when men could not endure ſound doctrine, but after their own luſts, they ſhould heap teachers to themſelves, and turn their ears from the truth, and follow after fables.</hi> They did ſo in a little time, and the offspring of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> covered the <hi>Church,</hi> as the Frogs did <hi>Egypt.</hi> This occaſioned the <hi>Hereſiologies</hi> of <hi>Irenaeus, Epiphanius,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> Many forſook the Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59505:120"/>
of Faith, and mixt the Waters of Life, with the putrid Streams that they drew from their own Ciſterns.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Credenda</hi> of our Religion are but very few, and the Conſtitution of Human Nature did require, that they ſhould be few. For ſince our <hi>Saviour</hi> did calculate his Religion, not for any particular Sect or Party, but for the whole Body of Mankind, it cannot be thought, that he deſign'd that it ſhould be ſpun out into Nice Deciſions, <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical</hi> Diſtinctions, odd and Barbarous Words. When the School Divinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be the Learning of the <hi>Weſtern Church,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Philoſophy</hi> gave Laws to their <hi>Theology,</hi> how miſerably was the Chriſtian Religion mangled and broken into airy Queſtions, uncertain Concluſions and idle Problems,<note place="margin">Pope <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> IV. his Creed.</note> that eat out the Life of true Learning and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And Articles impoſed on the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the <hi>Church,</hi> neither neceſſary in their Nature, nor revealed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor taught by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> nor founded in Reaſon, nor conſiſting with the Analogy of Faith. The Chriſtian Religion thus ratified unto nothing, became feeble and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59505:121"/>
dry, loſt its force and primitive vigour. And the truth is, ſince the Thirteenth <hi>Century,</hi> in which that kind of Learning domineered in all Schools, Colleges and Monaſteries; all Diſcourſes, even the Homilies that exhort the People to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and a Holy Life, were all blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with that <hi>bombaſt Jargon.</hi> But our Religion was firſt plainly delivered, and loves perſpicuity, and fixes its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in the moſt ingenuous Souls; and if it be covered and mantled in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who can diſtinguiſh it from Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe and Vanity?</p>
            <p>AND therefore ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> by us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys theſe Waters to his <hi>Church,</hi> let us not ſully them with <hi>Chimerical</hi> Gueſſes and Uncertainties, but let us pour them out in their original Purity and Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, without alteration, corruption or addition. How often doth the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhort to this? 2 Tim. 7.8. <hi>In doctrine ſhewing uncorruptedneſs, gravity, ſincerity, ſound ſpeech that cannot be condemned.</hi> And Titus 1.9. <hi>holding faſt the faithful word, as thou haſt been taught, that he may be able by ſound doctrine, both to exhort and convince gainſavers.</hi>
            </p>

Our Arguments may be intrinſecally ſtrong, but if they are ſet off with venom, rancour and perſonal aſperſions, they may well irritate the Diſeaſe, but they ſhall never reclaim the Erroneous; and therefore when we deal with any ſuch, either on the right or left hand, let us ſtate the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies fairly; elſe we but <hi>beat the Air</hi>; neither muſt we multiply them needleſly; nor are we to toſs and bandy thoſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions to ſerve the deſigns of Fame, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation of Learning, or Popularity; but with a ſincere reſolution to edifie the <hi>Church,</hi> to fight under the <hi>Royal Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of Chriſt,</hi> to preſerve his <hi>Church, his chaſt</hi> and <hi>dearly beloved Spouſe.</hi>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> THIS Metaphor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the profound Nature of Goſpel Myſteries: 'tis <hi>puteus profundus aquae viventis. The Woman of Samaria</hi> ſaid to our <hi>Saviour</hi> of <hi>Jacobs Well,</hi> that <hi>it was very deep,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, how much
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59505:122"/>
more profound are the Wells of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? The Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, the deep things of God, the Myſteries kept hid from Ages and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. <hi>Great is the Myſterie of Godlineſs, God manifeſted in the Fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, believed on in the the World, received up into Glory.</hi> We are taught by the Goſpel to ſpeak the Wiſdom of God in a Myſterie. The illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of theſe Myſteries,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.33.</note> fell in a tranſport of admiration. <hi>O the depth of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God, how unſearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways paſt finding out!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THOUGH there be nothing in the Goſpel that overthrows Reaſon, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts its Principles, yet its <hi>Myſteries</hi> and Revelations are beyond it. The whole Contrivance of our Redemption is a <hi>Myſterie</hi>; and then certainly we ought to approach the adminiſtrations of his Houſe with pure hearts and clean hands. Let us <hi>waſh our hands in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, when we compaſs his Altar.</hi> They were to look to their feet that came to the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; much more
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59505:122"/>
ſhould the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Servants of the Sanctuary, prove the keeneſt enemies to all prophanation of holy things. I am no friend to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and as little to Giddineſs and Enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>THEY that acknowledge no Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Goſpel, deſpiſe its Original and Divinity, and by conſequence they trample on the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> alſo; and therefore the followers of <hi>Socinus</hi> on this account are odious, that they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the Belief of all Ages, and what was received in the <hi>Chriſtian Churches</hi> ſince the firſt Plantations of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they have ſtript our Religion naked of its Myſteries, and made the Holy Scriptures to bend and bow to that <hi>Scheme</hi> and <hi>Model</hi> that they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their own fancies.</p>
            <p>AND then again, if this <hi>Well be ſo deep,</hi> we can neither furniſh our ſelves nor others with theſe Waters of Life, without earneſt Prayer, profound Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and great Humility, a ſerious and cloſe application of Spirit. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſes <hi>Timothy, Be in thoſe
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59505:123"/>
things</hi>; and it is an Apoſtolick Precept, <hi>Give thy ſelf to Reading.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CAN we think to beat down the Counter-batteries of Hell, by careleſneſs and negligence, ignorance or inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Men will not reſign their Reaſon without the beſt Arguments duly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Mines of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, are not only rich, but very deep, we ſhould dig in them night and day. It was the great Commendation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos,</hi> that he was mighty in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>BUT I go forward to the third Thing that I think implied in this Metaphor, and that is, the freedom, unconſtrain'd activity, force and ſtrength of their ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions. 'Tis a Well of Living Waters which cannot be contained in one place, but muſt burſt forth to water the Hills and Valleys, high and low, rich and poor. When we remember what a World we live in, how refractory and ſtubborn to the <hi>Yoke of Jeſus,</hi> we muſt not be niggardly of our Inſtructions, <hi>we muſt reprove, rebuke, exhort, in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, with all long-ſuffering, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59505:123"/>
doctrine; here a little, and there a little, agitur de ſumma rei</hi>; and there are no meaſures to be ſet to our endeavours, but the meaſures of Charity. It was ſaid of the antient Chriſtians upon that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument rais'd to the Memory of <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> that <hi>Superſtitionem ſuam generi hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano inculcabant,</hi> they did embrace all occaſions to make men acquainted with the truth and excellency of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>INDEED we ſhould ſet our ſelves to do this with the greater readineſs, when we conſider the oppoſition that we are like to encounter, either Firſt, From the Malice of Satan; or Secondly, From our own Weakneſſes and Infirmities; or Thirdly, From the Perverſeneſs, Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs and Incredulity of them, to whom the Goſpel is preached.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I SAY, from the Malice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. When the Goſpel began firſt to be proclaimed to the Nations, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Hell did ſwell with fury and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation; they began with all ſpite and rage, to cruſh the very beginnings of it; he gathered together all the Forces and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59505:124"/>
Legions of Darkneſs, to conſult, how <hi>the growing Religion of Jeſus might be ſtopped.</hi> But the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> fortified themſelves in the words of the <hi>Prophetic Pſalm, Why did the heathen rage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſalm 2.</note> 
               <hi>and the people ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine vain things?</hi> It is the Devils very Nature to retard the Goſpel; 'tis he that inſpires Hereticks; caſts ſtumbling blocks in our way, and finds out a thouſand methods to ſtop our progreſs. 1 Theſſ. 2.18. <hi>We would have come unto you once and again, but Satan hindered us</hi>: and his endeavours in a peculiar manner, are levelled againſt the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who are moſt terrible to his Kingdom, and beat down his ſtrong holds and retirements in the Conſciences of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> WE are hindered by our own Weakneſſes and Infirmities: When we ſee ſo little ſucceſs of our labours, we are like to grow faint, and give over, and ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Lord who hath believed our report?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſaiah.</note> 'Tis true, <hi>We have this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in earthen veſſels</hi>; and theſe Veſſels are brittle and ſoon ſhattered; and when we would vigorouſly and zealouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve our God; we are dragged down again to the Earth, by this dull and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59505:124"/>
lumpiſh Body that we carry about us we cannot ſhake off human Paſſions, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Infirmities; we are not priviledg'd to run his Errands ſo nimbly as the Angels do; we are apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond, and to ſuffer the fleſh, and its lazy whiſpers overcome our quickeſt motions, and moſt zealous reſolutions. Oh! then to be within the <hi>Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> where the brightneſs of his face, and the light of his Countenance can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer us to grow weary, ſullen and melancholy in his Service. We ſhall miniſter before his Altar in the Sacrifices of Praiſe; and <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> without faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, interruption or ſlumber.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We are oppoſed by the perverſeneſs incredulity and ingratitude of the World. When we contemplate the Arguments and Nature of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we would think that they are ſo ſtrong, that no Soul could reſiſt them; but when we come abroad into the World, and endeavour to reaſon men out of their folly and wickedneſs, how hard is this undertaking? How many Sermons are loſt upon the inconſiderate multitude? We muſt after many years
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59505:125"/>
endeavours, ſit down with ſorrow, and complain of their incurable madneſs.</p>
            <p>THEY have hardned themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all reproof; we muſt make our approaches to their hearts, and cut out our way through Rocks and Iron Bars, and inveterate Prejudices, they have fenc'd themſelves againſt our ſerious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, and ſtopped their ears like the <hi>deaf Adder, when we have charmed never ſo wiſely and affectionately.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAD we nothing elſe to do, but to let men ſee the reaſonableneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Chriſtian Religion, the folly and danger of Sin and Vice, then our work had been <hi>eaſie,</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is <hi>honourable</hi>: but we find to our ſad experience, that when we have chaſed them from one Cavil to another, when we have ſhamed them out of all their denyals and exceptions, they ſtill keep their hold, in defiance of all our Remonſtrances.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4.</note> 
               <hi>The God of this World hath blinded the minds of men, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt (who is the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59505:125"/>
Image of God) ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi> How hard is it to recover the World from Senſuality and Error? How diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to make them love the Precepts of our Saviour, and the Doctrine of the Croſs? To deny themſelves, and crucifie the fleſh, to forgive injuries; to bleſs them that curſe us; to deſpiſe the World and all its trifling intereſt? This is the aim of our Religion, and this is it which men are loth to practiſe; this ought to provoke our Zeal to the higheſt flame, and make us ſet our faces againſt tho ſtream and current of wicked practices, againſt all immoralities and errors.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Church,</hi> like ſome Aromatick Spices, the more you preſs them, the more fragrant they ſmell: their <hi>effluvia,</hi> fly on all hands, and their Smell perfumes the Air. The more we are beſieged, the more the Goſpel takes Air, like thoſe precious Spices, mentioned in the Verſe before my Text: ſo skilfully plac'd,<note place="margin">Dilherus.</note> and ſo orderly diſpoſed, that by their Order, <hi>ſuaviorem reddant odorem.</hi> So the <hi>Prince</hi> of Poets in his <hi>Paſtorals,</hi>

            <p>And this is propheſied of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that his <hi>Garments ſhould ſmell of Myrrhe, Aloes and Caſſia.</hi> And from <hi>him</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> hath all thoſe excellent Smells,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.</note> mentioned <hi>Verſe</hi> 14. <hi>Saffron, Calamus</hi> and <hi>Cinnamon</hi>; to teach us, that though the Gifts of the Spirit are, and have all their ſeveral excellencies; yet they are all uſeful to the <hi>Church, whoſe garments are made of needle work, and different colours</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore it is an unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable vanity in the People, to make ſaucy compariſons between the Gifts of <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi>; for, <hi>ſtabit unus quiſque ſorte ſua</hi>;<note place="margin">Corinth.</note> and the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſhould teach them more modeſty. <hi>If the foot ſhall ſay, becauſe I am not the Eye, I am not of the Body; is it therefore not of the Body?</hi> If we look up to our Superiours for aſſiſtance, conduct and direction, they muſt look down to us for obedience, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>THE third Thing that I promiſed, was the riſe of thoſe Waters, they come
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59505:126"/>
from Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> by an impetuous force and vigour. Nothing can more lively repreſent the firſt riſe and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe heavenly Oracles. The Goſpel is the <hi>day ſtar from on high,</hi> and the Doctrine that our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, is from Heaven. We are told by <note n="*" place="margin">Jacob.

And this leads us natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to the Divinity of our Religion; but here I ſtop, being afraid that I have tranſgreſs'd already the time that was allowed me.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the former part of this Epiſtle, aſſerted the Doctrine of Evangelical Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation againſt the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſtuck ſo tenaciouſly to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws. And now he
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59505:128"/>
ſums up in one pathetic Exhortation, the ſtrength and deſign of the Goſpel, and of all Religion. Chriſtianity was not a Collection of dry and airy Notions, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to amuſe the World; but a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, the higheſt and the pureſt, that ever was received amongſt men: the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Revelation of Infinite Wiſdom, which brought along with it <hi>true and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They were now invited to offer unto God more valuable Oblations, than any of their former. They were to bring themſelves to the Altar of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign their Will to his Will. And this was more agreeable to the nature of true Religion, the deſign of the Goſpel, and the higheſt exerciſe of Reaſon. When we bring unto God only things that are without us, we miſtake his Nature, and deſpiſe his Goodneſs. Reaſon taught us, that the beſt things are to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto God;<note place="margin">Non do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, ſed donantis animus.</note> and therefore the Heart and Soul, and Mind of Man, are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrifices that are truly valuable.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59505:128"/>
And this is the reaſon why the Apoſtle addreſſes to the Chriſtians at <hi>Rome,</hi> with ſo much zeal and affection.</p>
            <p>I will ſhortly, conſider, 1. His Preface. 2. His Exhortation. And 3. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to enforce it. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the Preface, <hi>By the mercies of God.</hi> We eaſily infer from the fervour and ſolemnity of the Apoſtles Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the weight and importance of his Exhortation: <hi>i. e.</hi> I do beſeech you with all the earneſt paſſion and true tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that I am capable of: <hi>I exhort you by the Mercies of God; i. e.</hi> by what is uppermoſt in his Nature, his boundleſs Compaſſions, that are in the front of all his glorious Perfections, and in the Language of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi>

               <hi>from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to everlaſting</hi>: by all that is great, ſacred and venerable, that which takes up the wonder of Angels, the praiſes of men, and the adorations of the Saints in glory; that you no longer reſiſt the Light of the Goſpel; but ſince you are redeem'd from the pompous drudgery of an external Religion; that you would think no Sacrifices worthy of God, but
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59505:129"/>
ſuch as are attended with your life, ſtrength, zeal and devotion: for this is the true Worſhip of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> when our Will is united to the Will of God.</p>
            <p>'TIS eaſie to obſerve the holy Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Fire of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Spirit, when he endeavours to plant-true and ſolid Religion. Here he ſpeaks, as if his Soul was ready to crack the ſtrings that ty'd it to his Body. He is all flame, all love, all endeavour, all charity; He wiſhes himſelf an <hi>Anathema,</hi>

               <hi>i. e.</hi> a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Sacrifice for the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> if this could recover them from their Infidelity, to the acknowledgement of the Truth as it is in <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE made uſe of this weighty Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this place, becauſe there is none of greater force. If the Angels were to preach to us, and gain us to the belief of the Goſpel, they could not fly higher in their Perſwaſives, than the <hi>Mercies of God.</hi> It is by <hi>them</hi> that he chuſes to proclaim all his Titles of Honour to the World,<note place="margin">Exod.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, ſlow to anger, and of great goodneſs.</hi> So
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59505:129"/>
when the Apoſtle exhorts by the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God,</hi> he exhorts by God himſelf, and all thoſe ineffable appearances of his Goodneſs, that are felt by the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent World, and every moment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd with wonder and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>HOW merciful muſt he be, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers without preſent revenge, the many horrid Crimes that are daily commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the provocations that fly in the face of Heaven, their multitude, their variety and their circumſtances;<note place="margin">Pſal. 14.2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>as if men would pull down the Almighty from his Throne,</hi> and reverſe the foundations of good and evil! And yet ſuch is the love of God to mankind, that after many unkind denyals, and rude affronts, he beſieges the Conſciences of men, by the force of his Convictions; he makes the Light of his Word to pierce to the bottom of the Soul, and powerfully overcome the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſs of our Will. How wiſely does he conduct us through the labyrinth of tentations! How ſweetly does he engage us by the motions of his Spirit! How kindly does he receive the <hi>Prodigal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> when as yet he had but ſome ſmall beginnings
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59505:130"/>
of wiſdom, ſobriety, and calmneſs! <hi>He ſaw him afar off, he ran to him, fell upon his neck, and kiſſed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN we remember that the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God,</hi> are our ſureſt Refuge and Sanctuary in all our fears, ſtraits, and difficulties, we need ſay no more to amplifie them.

            <p>IT is uſual with the Apoſtle, when he recommends thoſe comprehenſive Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that have in them the Soul, and ſtrength of Chriſtianity, to enforce them by this Argument. <note place="margin">Phil. 2.1.</note>

               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:59505:131"/>I. BECAUSE the contempt of God's mercies is attended with the ſharpeſt, and the ſaddeſt marks of his diſpleaſure and indignation. And this is juſt in its ſelf, if we conſider that we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay on our own behalf, when we trample upon his Love and Mercy. So argues the Author to the <hi>Hebrews, How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great a ſalvation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2.3.</note> 
               <hi>which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by them that heard him.</hi> And again, <hi>He that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes <hi>Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">—Chap. 10.28, 29.</note> 
               <hi>died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy, under two or three witneſſes; of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe, ye ſhall he be thought worthy, that hath trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under foot the blood of the Son of God.</hi> The contempt of his Love and Mercy, manifeſted in the Goſpel, is the moſt inexcuſable folly and madneſs; <hi>This is the condemnation that light is come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3.19.</note> 
               <hi>and men love darkneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than light.</hi> This is the Vinegar, and Gall, that fill the Souls of the damn'd with ſelf-horror, confuſion and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is the thought, that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally diſquiets the dark Habitations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>viz.</hi> that once they might have
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59505:131"/>
been ſav'd, that once they had their day, and that they refus'd the Light when it ſhin'd. No Tortures ſo exquiſite as the laſhes of an inrag'd Conſcience. The Light that they deſpis'd whilſt they were here, looks them broad in the face, and makes them roar to all Eternity. And theſe accuſations of the Soul againſt it ſelf, the upbraidings, and inward whips of the Mind, make up the miſeries of an <hi>intellectual Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. THE Apoſtle made choice of this Argument, from the <hi>Mercies of God,</hi> in this place, when he ſumm'd up the whole Chriſtian practice into one Exhortation: becauſe his Mercies in the Goſpel are his laſt remedy for our Recovery. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other occaſions the Apoſtle moves men to their duty, by the conſideration of his Power. So he exhorts the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cor.</note> 
               <hi>Knowing therefore the terrour of the Lord we perſuade Men.</hi> But there are other Arguments to move us, when thoſe from his Power and Sovereignty are us'd. If we ſin againſt his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Power, we fly to his Mercy; but when we ſin againſt his Mercy, there is not another Attribute in God, to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59505:132"/>
which we can fly; his Mercy is the laſt remedy for the recovery of Mankind. This is decipher'd excellently in that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Goſpel;<note place="margin">Luke 20.13.</note> the Maſter of the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard when all his former Servants, and Meſſengers had been baffled, and abus'd, reſolves at laſt to <hi>ſend his beloved Son; It may be</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>they will reverence him when they ſee him:</hi> and if they did not, the patience and goodneſs of God was no longer to ſtruggle with them. If we reflect a little on the weight and ſolemnity of this Preface, we may juſtly infer the conſequence of that Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to which it is prefix'd, <hi>I beſeech you by the moſt ſacred Myſteries of our Religion, I beſeech you by all that is amiable, and delightful, by the mercies of God, that ſoften the moſt rugged diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and melt the moſt obdur'd hearts, by that great Propitiation brought to light by the Goſpel, that you would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſervice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND this leads me to conſider this Exhortation more particularly. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle aſſerted formerly our freedom
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59505:132"/>
from the Levitical Sacrifices; and leſt we ſhould think, that by our Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty we are loos'd from all worſhip and obedience, he informs us here, what was the Sacrifice that was chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd under the Symbols, and Figures of the ancient Law, and indiſpenſably requir'd under the Oeconomy of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. And tho <hi>Interpreters</hi> may vary in their Expreſſions, yet all of them muſt agree, that there is no more intended, than that the Chriſtians, (inſtead of Beaſts, and bloody Sacrifices) would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up themſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> their Wills, Strength, and Affections, with purity and zeal to the ſervice of God. <note n="†" place="margin">

in it, the Spirit and Quinteſſence of all practical Devotion; I ſhall endeavour to recommend it, and give further light unto it in the following Method.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I WILL conſider the excellency of this Sacrifice, abſtractly, and in it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE value that God did ſet upon it, when the Levitical Sacrifices were preſcribed by the Law, and were moſt in vogue amongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT this Sacrifice was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally intended by all the care, caution and ceremony, wherewith all other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were offered.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I WILL ſeparately explain the Epithets by which this Sacrifice is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, with alluſion to the old Sacrifices of the Law. And from all theſe particulars, we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that this is the Sacrifice that truly recommends us to God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. LET us view the excellency of this Sacrifice, and total ſurrender of our ſelves to his diſpoſal. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59505:133"/>
elſe ſuitable to the Divine Nature; it is not Gold, nor Frankincenſe, nor the coſtly Perfumes of <hi>Arabia,</hi> that propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the Deity; a Soul purified from vice and ſin, is his peculiar Habitation. Nothing quenches the fire of true Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more, than wrong notions of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. The great reaſon why the Heathens were over-run with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Superſtition, was, becauſe the Hiſtories of their Gods were ſtuff'd with folly and wickedneſs; and they could not pretend to greater heights of Purity, than the Deities that they worſhipped. To adore God, is to beſtow upon him the higheſt Love, Veneration, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of our Souls. His Eyes pierce to the ſecrets that are buried in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to the Centre of our Spirits; and if our Sacrifices are ſullied, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd in their firſt ſprings and principles, <hi>they are an abomination unto him.</hi> No Worſhip can be pleaſing unto God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs what is offer'd by Love. Pray, what do we take him to be, when we endeavour to put him off, with any thing leſs, than the flower and ſtrength of our Reaſon? Thus our <hi>Saviour</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the <hi>Woman</hi> of <hi>Samaria</hi> in the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59505:134"/>

               <hi>and now is, when the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth; for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him.</hi> How groſs muſt their apprehenſions be, who think, that he is delighted with carnal Oblations, <hi>for he is a Spirit,</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>Philoſophers</hi> diſcover'd the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of this Doctrine without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; and the beſt of them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valu'd outward ſervices, and Sacrifices, in compariſon of a chaſt Mind, and a pure Soul. <hi>Do ye think</hi> (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) <hi>that God is pleas'd with many Sacrifices, and much Blood, high Temples, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Structures,</hi> nay rather, <hi>in ſuo cuique conſecrandus eſt pectore.</hi> The breaſt of a good Man is the moſt lovely Temple for the Divinity, the place of his peculiar reſidence and Habitation. And this is but the language of the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> a little

varied.<note place="margin">Iſa. 66.1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the Heaven is my Throne, and the Earth is my footſtool, where is the houſe that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my reſt?

The Sacrifices of Gods own inſtitution were not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs they were ſubſervient to this more excellent Oblation.</p>
            <p>THIS Evangelical Sacrifice, is the only, and moſt proper mean to attain the true ends of Worſhip; freedom from ſin, the favour of God, and peace of Conſcience, are the great ends of all Religion; and theſe things are not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the moſt pompous ſhew and <hi>parade</hi> of Ceremonies, unleſs the Soul and Will be firſt ſacrificed to his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <hi>When ye come to appear before me, who hath requir'd this at your hand?<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.11, 16.</note> to tread my Courts? bring no more vain Oblations, Incenſe is an abomination unto me, the new Moons, and Sabbaths, the calling of Aſſemblies, I cannot away with,

            </p>
            <p>THIS is the Sacrifice that is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Throne of God with filial confidence; like <hi>Children of the free woman</hi>; diſingaged from the ſervile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, that held the <hi>Jews</hi> in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. When we offer our ſelves unto God with true alacrity, ſtrong deſires, and a mind purified from the World, and feculent adherences, that ſtick to us from the neighbourhood of ſenſible Objects: when we come with that maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine and chearful Devotion that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them that are ſet at liberty from the weak and dark ſhadows of the Law. By St. <hi>Peter,</hi> we are ſaid to be a <hi>ſpiritual Prieſthood, to offer up ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sacrifices.</hi> And we are told by S.<hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>we have acceſs to the Throne, and liberty to cry, Abba, Father.</hi> And
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59505:135"/>
commanded in our Prayers, to <hi>lift up holy hands without wrath or doubting.</hi> This is the Worſhip of the <hi>new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the foundation of that ingenuous Converſe, that is between us and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Therefore do we with ſo much elevation of ſpirit magnifie the goodneſs of God, that gave us his Son,<note place="margin">Rev. 1 5.</note>

            <p>THIS is true Evangelical Sacrifice, and it alone affords the moſt ſolid delight and ſatisfaction to the Votary. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Services, when they are ſeparated from this inward dedication, have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them but toil and bodily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, we are told by the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that the Jewiſh Religion did conſiſt <hi>in Meats, and Drinks, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Ordinances.</hi> And we find in the Prophecy of <hi>Amos,</hi> that ſuch of the <hi>Jews</hi> as did not ſee further than the letter of the Law, thought their attendance on the Temple-ſervice the moſt intolerable wearineſs. But when we ſacrifice our
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59505:136"/>
very Souls unto his obedience, his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence fills our hearts with joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the pureſt rapture and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">Pſalm 4.</note>

God is the ſource of all Felicity, and the nearer we draw unto him, the more happy we are, and rational happineſs muſt be felt, and neceſſarily muſt dilate it ſelf in all the faculties of the Soul. <hi>A Conſcience void of offence towards God, and towards Man, is a houſe built upon the Rock,</hi> it may be <hi>batter'd,</hi> but it cannot be <hi>ſhaken.</hi> And God loves to pour into our hearts ſuch degrees of joy, <hi>when we are puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from all filthineſs of the fleſh and of the Spirit</hi>; when we offer our ſelves without reſerve to his ſervice and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; when we ſacrifice our hearts

            <p n="2">2. LET us conſider the value that God did ſet upon this ſpiritual Sacrifice, when the Levitical Sacrifices were in force. He always gave his People to underſtand by the Prophets, that the whole train of the Moſaick Ceremonies was deſign'd to ſignifie and advance this everlaſting, and more ſpiritual Worſhip; which was to continue, when the typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal figures and ſhadows were gone. This is clear from that remarkable place in the Prophecies of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jerem. 7.22.</note> 
               <hi>For I ſpake not unto your Fathers, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning Burnt-Offerings, or Sacrifices; but this thing commanded I them, ſaying, obey my Voice, and I will be your God, and ye
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59505:137"/>
ſhall be my people.</hi> Strange! Did not God command the Sacrifices of the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Law? Yes certainly: but with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to advance the purer Worſhip of the Mind. This is more precious than the moſt coſtly Offerings of the Temple. The <hi>Widow's Mite</hi> recorded in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is one viſible inſtance of it; 'tis prefer'd in the eſteem of God, to all the Rich Donations of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees:</hi> ſhe came to the Treaſury with a poor Purſe and a Rich Soul; a Soul made cheerful with the Love of God, and in the ſimplicity of her heart, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation or reſerve, ſhe offered all that ſhe had.</p>
            <p>How much God delighted in the Oblations of the Mind beyond the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sacrifices, appears in this, that he readily diſpens'd with the Ceremony, when that other more valuable Sacrifice was brought. Two famous inſtances we have of this, <hi>viz. David</hi>'s <hi>eating the Shew-bread</hi>; by which our Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the Phariſees, who doted ſo much on the external part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And the next is, <hi>the manner of</hi> Hezekiah<hi>'s celebrating the Paſſeover,</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:59505:137"/>
though the people were not prepared, according to the method preſcribed by the Law. Therefore it is a fooliſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that the <hi>Jews</hi> make uſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our <hi>Saviour</hi>; that he could not be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> becauſe he did aboliſh the Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law. For the <hi>Levitical</hi> Sacrifices did vaniſh of their own accord, when our <hi>Saviour</hi> roſe from the dead, and gave place unto that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Worſhip, that was more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Divine Nature, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> So our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells the <hi>Woman</hi> of <hi>Samaria.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 4.21, 22, 23, 24.</note> 
               <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man believe me, the hour cometh, when ye ſhall neither in this Mountain, nor yet in Jeruſalem worſhip the Father: but the hour cometh, and now is, when the true Worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth: for the Father ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch to worſhip him.</hi> From all this it is very evident, that not only in the time of the Patriarchs, but under the Law, this was only the Sacrifice that was valued by God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. LET us remember, that the exact care and caution wherewith they were
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59505:138"/>
obliged to offer their Sacrifices under the Law, did ſignifie and promote this Spiritual Sacrifice of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> I do not here intend a juſt Diſcourſe of the antient Sacrifices; yet we may be oblig'd to look back into the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to conſider ſome particulars, that concern all Sacrifices in general.</p>
            <p>AND, 1. All Sacrifices were offered with Salt;<note place="margin">Lev. 2.13.</note> 
               <hi>With all thine Offerings, thou ſhalt offer Salt.</hi> This is cited in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> by our <hi>Saviour.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 9.49.</note> I muſt remember, that I ought not to amuſe you with <hi>Cabaliſtick</hi> Fooleries; but it is certain from the Epiſtle to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that there was a ſublime Moral couch'd and intended by the external <hi>Scheme</hi> of the Law. And therefore, though we are not able to trace it in all its Lines and Figures; yet we may ſafely venture, when we force the Law, to ſay nothing but what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the great deſign of Religion, and the Morals of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>LET me return to conſider this firſt ſtep of their Caution in ſacrificing. Salt
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59505:138"/>
hath in it a twofold Vertue, 1. It preſerves from Putrefacton. 2. It binds the parts together.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I SAY, it preſerves from Putre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>faction. The Sacrifices that are offered unto the pure and incorruptible Deity muſt reſemble his Nature; the rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of hypocriſie, fraud and malice, muſt be baniſh'd from all his Sacrifices. <hi>We have eſcaped the corruption, that is in the World through luſt, being made partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi> Thus are we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to ſincerity (oppoſite to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption) by S. <hi>Peter</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.1.</note> 
               <hi>Wherefore laying aſide all malice, all guile and hypocriſies, and envies, and all evil ſpeakings,</hi> &amp;c. See with what complacency our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Nathanael, Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom is no guile.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John. 1.47.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. SALT bindeth the parts together. We are forbidden to bring our Gifts to the Altar, until firſt we are reconcil'd to our Brother.<note place="margin">Mat. 5.23, 24, 25.</note> We are directed by S. <hi>Paul, to lift up holy hands, without wrath or doubting.</hi> Our God is the God of Peace; our Religion is the Goſpel of Peace; and the fruits of the Spirit are
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59505:139"/>
Joy and Peace; and the <hi>wiſdom that is from above is firſt pure, and then peaceable.</hi> Such a temper and frame of Spirit, does well anſwer the Prophecies of <hi>Iſaiah,<note place="margin">Iſa. 11.6, 7, 8, 9.</note> That the Wolf ſhould dwell with the Lamb; the Leopard and the Kid ſhall lye down together. And the Calf, and the young Lion, and the Fatling together, and a young Child ſhall lead them: i e.</hi> the fierce and unruly paſſions of Humane Nature ſhall be conquer'd and ſubdu'd by the Laws of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; every thing that is rugged and boiſtrous muſt be tam'd and ſmooth'd;<note place="margin">v. 9.</note>

            <p>YOU know, that the Morning and the Evening Sacrifices were offered in their ſeaſon, without delays or intermiſſion. To this Cuſtom the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> alludes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 130.6.</note> 
               <hi>My Soul waiteth for the Lord, more than they that watch for the Morning, I ſay, more than they that watch for the Morning.</hi> The <hi>Prieſts</hi> in the <hi>Temple</hi> by turns did watch for the firſt appearance of the Day, that they might offer the Morning Sacrifice. We are to <hi>remember our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator in the days of our youth,</hi> and not delay our Repentance. Our evil habits grow ſtrong; our time is uncertain; the exerciſe of our Reaſon depends upon a thouſand Contingencies; and all our opportunities are ſlippery. God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by our delays, his Spirit is reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and our Convictions are ſtifled. How dangerous is it then, to delay the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice one moment longer, leſt God ſhould judicially harden us, and confine us to perpetual ſlavery? <hi>To day then, if you will hear his voice, harden not your

hearts</hi>; but ſpeedily break off thy ſins by Repentance; for the next moment may put thee under the final ſtate of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence.</p>
            <p>BY what I have ſaid, you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſee that the Caution and care, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were tied to in their Sacrifices, did not ſo much concern the Levitical Oblations, as typifie the great Sacrifice of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> God is to be worſhipped agreeably to his Nature. Our moſt ſolemn attendance on his Worſhip is but an abomination, if at any time it is divided from a chearful, and ingenuous ſurrender of our Souls to his Will. This is the Sacrifice that S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts to, with ſo much Rapture and Concern.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly</hi> and laſtly, LET us conſider the Epithets beſtowed upon this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Text, and theſe are three; 1. It muſt be Living. 2. Holy. 3. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I SAY, it muſt be a Living Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And this in alluſion to that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand under the Levitical Law, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59505:142"/>
any thing to be offer'd in Sacrifice, <hi>which died of it ſelf</hi>; they were not ſo much <hi>as to eat of it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 22.8.</note> far leſs could they <hi>ſacrifice it.</hi> The Sacrifices of the living God, muſt be offered with Life; he is the original Fountain of Life, and it is Life that converſes with Life. This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation may juſtly ſtartle the inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate World, who ſerve God with ſo much coldneſs and indifferency, as if he were not the living God. Let us prove, My Brethren, that we are living Chriſtians, by Actions and Motions ſuitable to that Life, which we have from above.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 15, 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Giving all diligence, add to your faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge, and to knowledge, Temperance, and to Temperance Patience, and to Patience Godlineſs; and to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs brotherly kindneſs: and to brotherly-kindneſs, Charity.</hi> We muſt prove, by a ſteady and uniform practice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Vertue, that we are not the Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſome dead Idol, but the Diſciples of the <hi>living Jeſus</hi>; that as <hi>he was raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the dead by the Glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:59505:143"/>2. THE next Epithet is, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice muſt be holy. I do not deſign to diſcourſe here of Holineſs in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; nor of that Holineſs that muſt run through all our Actions as we are Chriſtians; but of that ſpecial Holineſs that is related to Sacrifices. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt obſerve, that all Sacrifices were holy in a twofold regard. 1. They were ſeparate from common uſe; And 2. They were an acknowledgment of that particular Deity, to whom they were offered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I SAY, they were ſeparate from common Uſe.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid. Mr.</hi> Mede<hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on</hi> Hallowed be thy Name.</note> And this is the true Notion of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Holineſs. It is in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to this, that we are exhorted by St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

               <hi>as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People.</hi> Let us call to mind our New and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Relation, by the ſolemnity of our

Baptiſm, <hi>We are built up a ſpiritual Houſe, an holy Prieſthood, to offer up ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let us remember, that <hi>we are bought with a price, we are not our own, therefore ought we to glorifie God in our bodies, and in our ſpirits which are Gods.</hi> The Prophanation of things Holy and dedicated was looked upon as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Crime. We muſt not take the <hi>Veſſels of the Sanctuary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 5.3, 4.</note> and profane them to common Uſe. This is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that St. <hi>Paul</hi> made uſe of to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> againſt <hi>Fornication</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.15.</note> 
               <hi>Shall I then take the members of Chriſt, and make them the members of an Harlot.</hi> And this Reaſon may be extended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any violence againſt all ſin and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity; we are confederate with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; we are liſted under his Banners; we are ſeparated from the World; therefore all compliance with it, as far as it is oppoſed to the Kingdom of Chriſt, is utterly unlawful: therefore <hi>Love not the World, neither the things that are in the World; if any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. SACRIFICES were not only ſeparated from common uſe, but were alſo the badge and <hi>Teſſera</hi> of the Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the peculiar Worſhip of that Deity to whom they were offered. This made it ſo highly criminal for the firſt Chriſtians, to be preſent at the Sacrifices of their <hi>Pagan Relations</hi>; they were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently invited to theſe Idolatrous Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. And though they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they came to gratifie their Friends, without any further deſign of Religion; yet their very preſence at thoſe Solemnities of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this Pretext. For the Sacrifices were the peculiarties and Bonds, that did oblige to the Worſhip of that Deity to whom they were offered; and both among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Pagans,</hi> there was ſome one Ceremony or other that pointed to that Deity that was worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and acknowledged. The Sacrifices
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59505:144"/>
of the Jewiſh Religion and religious Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies were (moſt of them) diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite to the cuſtoms of the neighbour Nations; that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main marks of diſtinction between the Idolatrous Nations and the <hi>Jews,</hi>

It is moſt certain, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices in all Religions have this in them, that they unite the Votary and the Deity, to whom they are offered. And therefore the Ancient Church was ſo ſevere, not only againſt the <hi>Thurifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati,</hi> and ſuch as did ſacrifice in the time of Perſecution; but alſo againſt ſuch as were preſent at theſe Sacrifices. So much we gather from St. <hi>Pauls</hi> reaſonings,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.14.15. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>The Cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the blood of Chriſt? i. e.</hi> Is it not the Characteriſtick of the Chriſtian Worſhip?

            <p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:59505:145"/>NOW when we ſacrifice our ſelves, with alluſion to this Practice, we muſt remember the peculiar Laws of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; the Laws that erect a Wall of Partition, between the Chriſtians and the reſt of Mankind; where then are our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Obligations?

            <p>THE beginning of this Verſe is a Command to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to forbear theſe Methods and Weapons of humane Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that his, ill-plac'd, (but well meant zeal) did ſuggeſt unto him.

            <p>THE latter part of the Verſe (to which I invite your Meditation more

            <p>THUS the Captain of our Salvation conſidered his Enemies, drawn up againſt him in battel array. He ſaw all the Powers of Hell combin'd, and all their Malice skrew'd up to the higheſt Pin; and this Malice vented againſt himſelf, with all the marks of affront and indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. All the ſuffering Capacities of his <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature</hi> were at once aſſaulted, and the terrour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, the ſullen hypocriſie of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the Rabble, were all in their united force muſter'd againſt him.

            </p>
            <p>AND this ſorrow was not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by his Lips, his Eyes, his Prayers and ſtrong Cries to the Father; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pore in his Body ſpoke it out in <hi>great drops of blood</hi>; as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of him,<note place="margin">Pſal. 22.</note>

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59505:154"/>
who knew no ſin</hi>; when <hi>he</hi> ſtood in our room, and ſuſtain'd the weight of <hi>our ſins,</hi> as <hi>our High-Prieſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OH! how terrible was this <hi>Cup,</hi> that made the <hi>Prince</hi> of Courage and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the original Spring of Strength and Conſtancy, all ſhiver and tremble into Tears, Cries and Prayers! <hi>He</hi> betook him to his ſtrong hold, his <hi>Father,</hi> whom he never had offended; and he prayed in the ſtrength of the moſt powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that bind up the hands of the Divine Juſtice, from inflicting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on leſſer perſons, I mean, thoſe Arguments from Love, Compaſſion and the Relation of a <hi>Father: O Father, let this Cup paſs from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT as if the Eternal Fountain of Pity had been dryed up; as if bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Mercy and Compaſſion had forgot their Nature and neceſſary Emanations; <hi>he</hi> is ſuffered to contend with all thoſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors alone. The Hoſts of Heaven ſeem to joyn with him in this prayer, having their Wings ready trimm'd to fly down to the Earth for his reſcue; yet they are commanded to ſtand aloof, and behold
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59505:155"/>
this combat, without interpoſing in their Maſters quarrel; and that one of their number that was ſent to comfort him, was allowed to do no more, than to afford him ſtrength enough to drink that <hi>Cup</hi> to the bottom.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Philoſophers</hi> do tell us, <hi>That a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Man fighting with difficulties and diſaſters, and by his conduct keeping his mind free from vice, is moſt beloved of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> But how ſoon would all the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes of Philoſophy</hi> be confounded with the leaſt ſhare of theſe diſmal ſufferings? The <hi>Seraphims</hi> of Glory ſtand amazed to ſee the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> in the midſt of all ſinleſs infirmities, give ſuch proofs of valour and magnanimity. And the <hi>Father</hi> took pleaſure to baffle the Devil (<hi>i. e.</hi> the pride and arrogance of the World) by the patience and reſignation of his <hi>only begotten Son</hi>; and he deſign'd to teach Mankind by his ſubmiſſion, that <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>ſuffering</hi> is the way to the higheſt glory. And though this truth be deſpis'd by the carnal World, yet the Morals of the Goſpel are built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. We <hi>muſt cut off our right hands,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59505:155"/>
and pull out our right eyes, if we enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF we conſider more particularly <hi>his</hi> behaviour under theſe firſt Skirmiſhes in the Garden, we may obſerve, 1. His Reluctancies, <hi>Let this Cup paſs from me</hi>; But was not <hi>his Croſs</hi> and Sufferings the conſtant Theme of <hi>his Sermons?</hi> Did not all the Sacrifices of the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> repreſent <hi>his Paſſion</hi> at a diſtance? And the Prophecies of former Ages, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare all men to receive this great Truth, that <hi>the juſt was to dye for the unjuſt?</hi> And did not <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> treat of his Sufferings on the Mount of Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Whence then is this trouble of mind, this extraordinary Agony? Whence all thoſe appearances of fear and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All is true</hi>; yet the <hi>ſinleſs Humane Nature</hi> meeting at once with every thing that is odious, terrible and diſgraceful, ſhrinks and recoils. And herein is <hi>his</hi> Victory, that he ſo perfectly reſign'd <hi>himſelf</hi> to the <hi>Will of his Father,</hi> that he rejoices in the midſt of <hi>his</hi> ſorrows, to ſacrifice his feelings and infirmities to
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59505:156"/>
the Conduct and Wiſdom of God. <hi>O Miracle of Patience! O invincible Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> folded up in that one word, <hi>Not my Will, but thy Will be done</hi>! Thus veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying himſelf to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of by the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Then ſaid, I, Lo, I come, in the volume of thy Book it is written of me, I delight to do thy Will, O my God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 40.7.</note> 
               <hi>yea, thy Law is within my heart.</hi> It was <hi>his Meat and his Drink to do the Will of his Father,</hi> through the whole tract of <hi>his</hi> Life in leſſer inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but now, when the laſt period of it drew nigh, when the Sacrifice was ready to be laid upon the Altar, then it was all burnt and conſum'd with Love. It mounted the Heavens in a Fiery Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of pure and unmixt Zeal, and by one perfect act of Oblation, ſacrific'd his Will to the Will of his Father, without reſerve or limitation.</p>
            <p>WE ſhall beſt diſcover how compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive this ſurrender was, when we read the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, and ſee with what triumph and inſolence, <hi>his</hi> enemies inſulted over <hi>him:</hi> Even in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> where his Miracles made <hi>him</hi> famous, there they prepared their Whips
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59505:156"/>
and their Scourges; their Buffets and their Thorns to <hi>afflict him</hi>; and a Mock Purple to make <hi>him ridiculous.</hi> And thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed, <hi>he</hi> is brought forth to divert the great crouds of People that flocked to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> about this time: and they were to tell the ſhameful ſtory of his Sufferings over the habitable World; yet there was no ſhaking of his Courage and Reſignation.</p>
            <p>AND to let the World ſee, that <hi>his</hi> Love to Mankind was more than hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick, and beyond the Fictions of <hi>Poets,</hi> and truly becoming the Son of God, and the deſigns of our <hi>Redemption:</hi> when the Paroxiſms of <hi>his Agony</hi> gave him the leaſt reſpite, <hi>he</hi> returns to his Diſciples. When Heaven and Earth ſeem'd to be made up of anger and indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>him,</hi> yet does <hi>he</hi> not forget them; and though they became ſtupid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolicitous for <hi>him,</hi> their ſupreme Lord and Benefactor, <hi>he</hi> does not chide them with any bitterneſs and reproach, but only expoſtulates with S. <hi>Peter, Couldſt not thou watch with me one hour?</hi> Here are words ſtrong enough to break the hardeſt heart, able to melt the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59505:157"/>
the moſt inflexible diſpoſition: Words ſo ſweet, and ſo full of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and yet ſo keen and piercing, that they may awaken the moſt ſtupid and inconſiderate.</p>
            <p>AND now we may follow <hi>him</hi> from the Garden to <hi>Mount Calvary,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>his</hi> behaviour there; and becauſe we are not able to ſpeak of <hi>his</hi> ſufferings, but very faintly, and far below their aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Nature, we may in the Hiſtory of the Paſſion fix our attention on ſome Particulars that are moſt conſpicuous. And Divines generally take notice of theſe three:
<list>
                  <item>1. THE Shame of it.</item>
                  <item>2. THE Pain of it.</item>

            <p n="1">1. I SAY, the Shame of it. God hath, for wiſe and great ends, planted in our Nature a deep ſenſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <note n="*" place="margin">

All
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59505:157"/>
generous Souls expoſe every thing to hazard, rather than make ſhipwrack of their reputation. It could not then but be very bitter and uneaſie to the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Soul of our bleſſed Saviour, to be carried in triumph by <hi>his</hi> enemies; to be expos'd to the affronts and indignities of the rude and tumultuous Rabble; to be flouted and abus'd by a prophane and inconſiderate multitude; to be ſent from one Hall to another; and hear the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies and ſcoffs of a ſacrilegious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Crew. <hi>He</hi> was treated with all the indignities that were due to the vileſt Malefactors; and at laſt (that he might make good in himſelf the Type of the <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi>) <hi>he was lifted upon the Croſs.</hi> A puniſhment ſo odious to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that when the <hi>Roman Orator</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd <hi>Varres</hi> for having crucified a Citizen, he ſaid,<note place="margin">Facinus eſt vincire ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vem Romanum, ſcelus eſt verberare, prope parricidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um necare; quid dicam in crucem tollere? Verbo quidem ſatis digno tam nefaria res appellari nullo modo poteſt.</note> 
               <hi>it was a nameleſs wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a crime of ſo high a nature, that it could not be expreſs'd by words.</hi> This ſhameful puniſhment, this <hi>Servile ſupplicium,</hi> was the puniſhment our <hi>Saviour</hi> choſe to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate our ſins by: So that the Prophecy

               <hi>I am a Worm and no Man, a reproach of Men, and deſpiſed of the People: All they that ſee me, laugh me to ſcorn; they ſhoot out the lip, they ſhake the head, ſaying, he truſted in the Lord, let him deliver, ſeeing he delighted in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſame perſons who formerly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd <hi>his</hi> glorious works, who were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd with <hi>his</hi> excellent Diſcourſes, who preferr'd <hi>him</hi> to the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, and were convinc'd that <hi>he taught as one having authority</hi>; even they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held <hi>him</hi> with contempt and diſdain.

               <hi>And the people ſtood, and gazed on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOW vain and empty are the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient <hi>Hoſanna's</hi> of the multitude? The <hi>plaudites</hi> of the Croud are much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain than the Weather. For this is govern'd by Natural Cauſes, that are ſteady in their operations; but the ſame Cauſes produce contrary Effects, frequently amongſt the people. There
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59505:158"/>
is no true honour, but in doing that which is juſt, generous and equal; though by doing ſo, we ſhould pull down upon our ſelves the Pillars upon which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth do ſtand. There is ſo much of God in a reſolute mind, that it ſtands proof againſt the ſhakings and commotions of all foreign violence: <hi>for he that is in us is ſtronger than he that is in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CAN we view our <hi>Saviour</hi> thus run down with cruelty and rudeneſs, and not trample upon the fantaſtick ſhadows of honour, that mankind ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire? <hi>He</hi> was thus expos'd to the abuſes and mockings of the multitude, that <hi>he</hi> might ſuffer in thoſe capacities that are moſt tender and delicate. <hi>He</hi> ſuffer'd theſe wounds, that enter the fancy, and pierce to the bottom of the Soul; that which all men feel moſt afflictive and grievous. <hi>He endur'd the contradiction of ſinners againſt himſelf. He endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame</hi>;<note place="margin">Heb. 12.4.</note> not through a <hi>Stoical</hi> apathy, or a ſtupid careleſsneſs, but the higheſt magnanimity. For <hi>he</hi> had in his view the glory that was ſet before him, the honour of God,

the Conqueſt of the Devil, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Souls.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.6, 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>He deſpiſed all vain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, and being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God, but made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of men, and being found in faſhion as a man, he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf, and became obedient unto Death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS, to be treated in this Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical manner, when his ſufferings were heightened by all the Solemnities of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, could not but be very afflictive to the bleſſed Soul <hi>of our Lord Jeſus. He</hi> was endued with that natural Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, (our abhorrence of Diſgrace) and <hi>he</hi> felt the ſmart of this ſhameful uſage, <hi>yet he</hi> deſpiſed it and all its conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in view of the accompliſhment of our Redemption. What is it then that we ſee in Human glory, when <hi>He</hi> choſe to be thus <hi>deſpis'd by Men?</hi> What do we take our ſelves to be, when our hearts recoil with ſo much impatience, and bitterneſs againſt the leaſt ſurmiſe of Contempt? How come we to be ſo delicate, when our Lord and Maſter
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59505:159"/>
was ſo roughly handled? But it was not only the <hi>ſhame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> THE <hi>pain</hi> that we are to take notice of in this Puniſhment. <hi>His</hi> pure and Virginal Conſtitution heightened <hi>his</hi> Pain; the Nails were faſtened in thoſe parts that are moſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>his hands, and his feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOW terrible is this truth to all the Sons of ſoftneſs, idleneſs and luxury; who ſwim in Pleaſures as the Leviathan doth in the Ocean. When we conſider our <hi>Saviours</hi> pains how may we be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, that we ſhould with ſo much care and anxiety look after theſe bodies of ours; theſe receptacles of Impurities, theſe ſinks of Uncleanneſs! When we remember that our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſpent whole Nights in Prayer, and ſometimes ſat wearied by the <hi>Well of Samaria,</hi> and asked a poor Woman a little Water, and upon the day of his greateſt Triumph, when he came into <hi>Jeruſalem, he rode upon an Aſs,</hi> and that <hi>Aſs</hi> was not his own; why ſhould we careſs, with ſo much fondneſs, thoſe heaps of Duſt and Aſhes that ſhall ſhortly crumble into rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59505:160"/>
and diſhonour, whether we will or not? Did <hi>He</hi> with ſo much reſolution and courage ſuffer the whole Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of diſaſters, in his Mind, in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and in his Body? And do we think to dwell for ever with that <hi>King of Sufferings,</hi> and yet ſuffer no degrees of <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> never undergo any part of the <hi>Croſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> NEXT to the <hi>Shame,</hi> and <hi>Pain</hi>; let us conſider the <hi>Curſe</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>That he was made a Curſe for us,</hi> i. e. He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to publick Infamy and Maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſeemed to be deſerted of God himſelf. <hi>We eſteemed him ſmitten of God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>) In all publick Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices there was ſome Ceremony, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the tranſlation of the puniſhment, from the People to the Sacrifice. Thus the Perſon among the Heathens, that was appointed for a publick Sacrifice, had all the Imprecations of the People heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him as he went along the ſtreets. But our <hi>Saviour</hi> did not only expiate the ſins of one City, Kingdom, or Family, but the ſins of the whole World, paſt, preſent, and to come, in
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59505:160"/>
their moſt heinous Nature, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs Aggravations. He made Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them all by that one pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Sacrifice, which needs not again be repeated, becauſe it had no imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">Heb. 9 25, 26, 28.</note> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.24.</note> 
               <hi>He himſelf alone bore our ſins in his own body on the Tree, that we being dead to ſin, ſhould live unto righteouſneſs.</hi> And our ſins are thus for ever buried, if we do not reinflame the Wrath of God by our impenitence. Now when we remember the Love of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in dying for us, and all the circumſtances of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and the variety of theſe peculiar Vertues that appeared in <hi>him,</hi> under <hi>his</hi> ſaddeſt Torture, may not we pray in the words of the <note n="*" place="margin">Liturg.

            <p>NOW I go forward to the ſecond Particular that I propos'd to ſpeak to, and that is, by whom this <hi>Cup</hi> was ordered and prepared. And our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

From the ſignification of Ceremonies under the Law, particularly that of the <hi>Scape-Goat,</hi> and the Red Heifer. 2.

               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:59505:162"/>To provoke <hi>him</hi> again by our ſins, is a downright affront to his Love; but after ſuch undeniable proofs of <hi>his</hi> kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to disbelieve the Goſpel is utterly inexcuſable. Infidelity makes the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt approaches to the ſin againſt the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi>; which I take to be, the malicious oppoſition of that Light, and Evidence which God offers for our Conviction. When the <hi>Meſſias</hi> came <hi>he</hi> proved <hi>his</hi> Miſſion and Authority by the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Miracles, and Signs more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than ever <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought, nor was it reaſonable to expect that <hi>he</hi> ſhould bring with him, fairer Credentials to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend himſelf and his Doctrine than thoſe <hi>he</hi> diſplayed before <hi>his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> But <hi>his Countrymen</hi> ſhut their Eyes againſt the Light,<note place="margin">John 1.</note> 
               <hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</hi> And we are guilty of the very ſame ſin, if we trample upon the Goſpel, which <hi>at firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed by them that heard him. He</hi> ſeal'd the Truth by <hi>his Death,</hi> confirm'd it by <hi>his Reſurrection,</hi> and by the various Gifts of the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> proves
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59505:162"/>
beyond all contradiction, that <hi>He is at the right hand of God the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> DID our <hi>Saviour</hi> thus die for us? Then, we ought to treat our ſelves with greater regard, than to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlav'd to our former ſin. Did <hi>he</hi> hide the glory of <hi>his Divinity,</hi> that <hi>he</hi> might redeem us from miſery and deſpair by <hi>his own Blood!</hi> Was it for this that <hi>he</hi> took fleſh of our Fleſh, that we might be made partakers of the divine Nature? Why do we live, like ſo many mean, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, abject Creatures, as if we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd by the frame of our Nature, to the Earth only? As if we could look no higher, than the trifling intereſts of this World. So ſadly have we forgot our ſelves, and though very frequently our Pride makes us hateful to God, and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to one another, yet do we truckle under the meaneſt Vices. <hi>We were not redeem'd with corruptible things, ſuch as ſilver, and gold, but with the precious blood of the Son of God.</hi> This is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes uſe of, to heighten our eſteem of our Brethren. <hi>Wilt thou make thy Brother periſh, for
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59505:163"/>
whom Chriſt died?</hi> And the Argument of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to aggravate the folly and wickedneſs of the Hereticks, <hi>that they deny'd the Lord that bought them. To be bought by the blood of the Son of God,</hi> is the powerful Argument of the Goſpel againſt Sin; and if we reſiſt <hi>this,</hi> we may juſtly fear to be delivered up <hi>to a Reprobate Senſe.</hi> Our ſins ſet us at the greateſt diſtance from God; he is Light, Beauty, Strength and Perfection; and Sin is folly, weakneſs, error and deformity. Let us therefore fly from it, becauſe ſo horrid in its Nature, ſo diſmal in its conſequences, that nothing could attone it, but <hi>the Blood of the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

                  <p>And my ſpeech, and my preaching was not with inticing words of mans wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power.</p>

            <p>IN the Firſt Chapter, S. <hi>Paul</hi> had in his view the allaying the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that had ariſen amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> concerning their Teachers, whom they ſhould follow.
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59505:166"/>
He puts them in mind how he had preached the Goſpel amongſt them, and by what Arguments they had been perſwaded to embrace it, <hi>i. e. not with the wiſdom of words.</hi> And again, <hi>not with enticing words of mans wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE thought it not proper to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his doctrine and deſign amongſt them, by the accurate and artificial reaſonings of the wiſe men of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> but, <hi>in the demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE elegant Orations, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Diſcourſes of the <hi>Learned Gentiles,</hi> by which they were wont to put off their opinions to the people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, he did not judge proofs proper for, and ſuitable to, the nature of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. It being wholly Divine, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired divine demonſtration, ſomething above the reach of human ſpeculation, ſomething yet untraced by their moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Diſquiſitions. So the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral gifts beſtowed on the followers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by which they were made to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the ſacred Oracles, and ancient Prophecies, concerning the <hi>Meſſias</hi>; and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59505:166"/>
accommodate thoſe Prophecies, to the moſt particular circumſtances of his Kingdom. By which they were enabled <hi>to diſcern Spirits, and diſpoſſeſs Devils</hi>; ſuch, and ſuch miraculours appearances, together with the Miracles of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> both upon the dead, and the living, were proofs of divinity in their own Nature; far beyond the ſubtile reaſonings, of Orators, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers; more ſuitable to the deſign in hand, more undeniable, and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick; and therefore a proof much more ſolid, and clear, than if they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended the Doctrine of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with all the eloquence, and oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of words.</p>
            <p>THIS method propos'd in the firſt Chapter, He owns, and vindicates in this, from all the objections, and carnal imputations, that the admirers of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy on the one hand, and hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Seducers on the other, might lay to his charge. He did not declare unto them the Teſtimony of God, with the <hi>excellency of ſpeech, or wiſdom.</hi> It was not his deſign to read unto them <hi>Lectures of</hi> Plato's <hi>Philoſophy</hi>; but to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59505:167"/>
               <hi>Chriſt, and him Crucified</hi>; to preach the humble doctrine of the <hi>Croſs</hi>; the plain and neceſſary Articles of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; the very firſt, and indiſpenſible principles of our Faith; not the more abſtruſe myſteries, (of which as yet poſſibly they were not capable) but thoſe early leſſons that we muſt know, as ſoon as we become Diſciples of that Heavenly Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>THIS Doctrine recommended at ſuch a time, and by ſuch men, ſo far above the genius of all the prevailing ſects of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and appearing with ſo much modeſty, and humility, had certainly been run down in triumph by the <hi>Patrons of Paganiſm, and Infidelity</hi>; if it had not been ſupported by another kind of proof, and demonſtration, than that which was taught in the <hi>Athenian Schools,</hi> Therefore the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ought not to be much ſtumbled at the petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy, and ignorance of falſe teachers, who deſpis'd what they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and meaſur'd wiſdom, by a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of their own. The Goſpel was recommended amongſt them by ſuch proofs as were agreeable to its Nature;
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59505:167"/>
that their belief might not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any thing, that was human and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial; but on the moſt ſolid and immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able foundations, the Wiſdom and Power of God clearly diſplay'd in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Goſpel. This is ſhortly the ſcope of the words that I have read: The ſucceſs and efficacy of what he preach'd did not at all depend on the order and compoſure of his periods; tho one might obſerve Eloquence, and Majeſty in his Expreſſions, if they were not too much addicted to what they valued amongſt the <hi>Grecian Orators</hi>; yet did he not at all affect that which the <hi>wiſe men of Greece</hi> moſt gloried in; he deſign'd that it might be very clear: That the ſucceſs of his Doctrine ſhould depend on ſupernatural proofs, or the light, and majeſty, and conviction, that attends the power of miracles.</p>
            <p>LET us view thoſe words more cloſely, and examine their phraſe, and dependance, and ſee how clear a proof they contain of the excellency of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion: And in them we have three particulars.</p>

               <hi>I was with you in weakneſs, and in fear, and in much tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> The weakneſſes wherewith the Apoſtle was emcompaſſed in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, were partly his own bodily frailties, partly the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that did ariſe from the many perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of his implacable enemies, <hi>for the Goſpels ſake.</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did daily thirſt for his blood, and from place to place, he was hunted <hi>like a Partrige upon the mountains.</hi> Thoſe frailties, whether incident to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59505:168"/>
ſtructure of his body, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left by the ſtripes and violences frequently offered unto him, made his perſon appear deſpicable to them, that only conſidered the outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; That mighty Soul that had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs in his view, than the total overthrow of the Devils univerſal Monarchy; this Soul I ſay, dwelt in a ruinous tabernacle. This he himſelf often acknowledged, 2. Cor. 10. v. 1. <hi>I beſeech you by the meekneſs, and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt; who in preſence am baſe among you.</hi> And again, v. 7. <hi>Do you look on things after the outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> Conſider alſo the 2. Cor. 4.7. <hi>We have this treaſure in earthen veſſels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</hi> v. 8. <hi>We are troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſs'd, we are perplex'd, but not in deſpair; perſecuted, but not forſaken; caſt down, but not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd.</hi> And again, Chap. 6. v. 4. <hi>In all things approving our ſelves as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God in much patience, in afflictions, in neceſſities, in diſtreſſes, in ſtripes, in impriſonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in faſtings.</hi> Conſider alſo 2.

<pb n="310" facs="tcp:59505:169"/>
into</hi> Macedonia, <hi>our fleſh had no reſt, but we were troubled on every ſide; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out were fightings, within were fears; and it may be the meſſenger of Satan</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. was ſome bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity.</p>
            <p>NOW conſidering the natural temper of his body, the extraordinary troubles, watchings, and labours that he endured, and the voluntary reſtraints, and chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements he had uſed towards himſelf; we may eaſily underſtand, what a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and ſeries of difficulties, he had to wreſtle with. Sometimes hardly eſcaping with his very life, <hi>Let down in a basket by the wall,</hi> and to put this account beyond all debate, read 2. Cor. 11.23. forward: <hi>Are they miniſters of Chriſt, I ſpeak as a fool, I am more in labours more abundant, in ſtripes above meaſure, in priſons more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, in deaths oft.</hi> v. 24. <hi>Of the</hi> Jews <hi>five times received I fourty ſtripes, ſave one.</hi> v. 25. <hi>Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I ſton'd, thrice I ſuffer'd ſhipwrack, night and day I have been in the deep.</hi> v. 26. <hi>In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, —
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59505:169"/>
In wearineſs, and painfulneſs, in watchings often, in hunger and thirſt, in faſting often, in cold and nakedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW the natural reſult of this heap of Sufferings, and Calamities, ſo thick crowded together, were fear, and trembling. Partly his innocent fear of dangers, and perſecutions; partly his holy care, and ſolicitude, for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and propagation of the Goſpel; though the falſe teachers vilified the <hi>bleſſed Apoſtle,</hi> becauſe of his Infirmities, yet conſidering the nature of his Office, and the deſign of his Miniſtry, they were an undeniable proof of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and miſſion; and conſequently of the verity, and divinity of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>FOR allow but the Apoſtles to be men of common ſenſe, and deſirous to preſerve themſelves; if they were not ſure of the truth of what they deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; how unaccountable were their ſufferings? and therefore their calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſo much miſtaken by other, had in them the ſtrongeſt proof of their ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſince they were ready to ſacrifice all
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59505:170"/>
that was dear to human Nature, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Goſpel. How came they ſo readily, and unanimouſly to part with all their juſteſt Intereſts, if they had not the higheſt aſſurances of their Commiſſion and Authority, and of a life after this, more pure, ſolid, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, than what we here enjoy? How came they to be ſo ready upon all occaſions, to undergoe all that was moſt bitter, and painful, moſt diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ignominious, and this for no other deſign, than to advance a fable amongſt mankind; and for no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward either here, or hereafter, than ſtripes, tumults, perſecutions, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdoms? He that ſuppoſes the Apoſtles to have been endowed with ordinary reaſon and judgment, and yet will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>they followed cunningly deviſed fables,</hi> for no other deſign than to make themſelves miſerable, to all intents, and purpoſes; will yield his aſſent to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more incredible, more monſtrouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fictitious than the moſt Romantick Follies of imagination.</p>
            <p>AND if we yet ſuppoſe, that the Apoſtles were deſtitute of the uſe of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59505:170"/>
their reaſon, and ſtill be able, to the wonder and admiration of mankind, to contrive the ſtory of the Goſpel, ſo orderly, and coherent, and adapt the moſt antient Prophecies to its proof and illuſtration, and that to the conviction, and aſtoniſhment of the learnedeſt of their oppoſers. He, I ſay, that believes all this (which <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Anti-ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts</hi> are obliged to do) believes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more fabulous, more inconſiſtent, than all the <hi>Legends of Poets,</hi> and all the adventures of <hi>Knight-errantry.</hi> The Apoſtle then is ſo far from denying his Infirmities, that he glories in them as one ſpecial proof of his miſſion, and authority; highly agreeable to the Chriſtian Religion, and the tendency of that Doctrine, that recommended <hi>Chriſt Crucified to the world.</hi> In another manner, and by other demonſtrations, than thoſe demonſtrations that the <hi>Schools of Philoſophy</hi> did furniſh, I have choſen to diſcourſe of the Sufferings, and Infirmities of the Apoſtle, under this aſpect, as they yield a clear proof of Chriſtianity, rather than to run out in the commendations of the courage, and patience of Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59505:171"/>
and it will appear in its greater luſtre, if we conſider.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE manner of his addreſs; not in the eloquent and harmonious periods of Rhetorical Diſcourſes, but by a more heavenly and victorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, more certain, and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, than the ſureſt Principles of the <hi>Grecian Philoſophy, not in the enticing words of mans wiſdom, but in the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit, and of Power.</hi> There are, who underſtand by theſe words the inward and powerful illuminations and preſence of the Divine Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mans heart, in order to his Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. I am very far from denying that Illumination to be neceſſary, but that is not meant in this place, nor by this phraſe. For the proof that the Apoſtle brings here, is External, and conſequently muſt be referred to that demonſtration of the Divine Power, that waits upon the Apoſtles, in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and aſſerting the Goſpel, I mean the <hi>power of Miracles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF it were needful to cite Authors for this, I might name many, I take it
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59505:171"/>
for granted, that here the Apoſtle is to prove the vanity of them, that oppos'd his Doctrine, and ſlighted his Methods for want of human eloquence, he ſtates the oppoſition between their way, and his.</p>
            <p>THEY ſet off their <hi>Dogmata</hi> with all the dreſs and <hi>parade</hi> of Rhetorical Amplifications, their Proofs and Topicks muſtered up in all the braveries of Art, and Logick. He ſpoke and aſſerted the myſteries of the Goſpel with greater ſimplicity, but greater Majeſty; leſs Oſtentation in his utterance, but much more Power and Efficacy. We need not think by this, that the Apoſtle was not eloquent; but that he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, nor deſign to lay the ſtreſs of his Sermons on his eloquence. He derived their ſucceſs and victory from a higher ſpring. Thoſe who boaſted themſelves moſt in their philoſophical compoſures might be overcome by ſuch as were more eminent in that kind of Learning. But the proofs of our Apoſtle were wholly out of that road, and beyond the reach and skill of the profoundeſt Sophies; even a demonſtration that all
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:59505:172"/>
his Enemies were forc'd to acknowledge, <hi>it was the finger of God.</hi> And becauſe this is ſo material to the Apoſtles deſign, and contains in it, a very ſolid proof for our Religion; I will endeavour to open the nature of it more fully.</p>
            <p n="1">1. LET us conſider the force and rational evidence that Miracles give to the Teſtimony of him, that works them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE ſpecial force they had to prove the Verity and Authority of Chriſtian Religion. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE muſt acknowledge the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of Miracles, ſince we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Deity, and a Providence. For he that hath eſtabliſhed the Laws of Nature, and directed the motions of all its wheels, may for ſpecial ends of his Providence interupt that order and method, and let us underſtand that he is above Nature. And it is very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and juſt for mankind, upon ſuch ſolemn occaſions, to look for extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Appearances of the Divine Power, both to confirm their Faith, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:59505:172"/>
their Gratitude. when God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhes new Laws, or repeals old ones, 'tis highly neceſſary, that his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and Teſtimony be ſeal'd with ſome ſuch undeniable Evidence, as cannot rationally be reſiſted. The multitude of jugling tricks, and impoſtures in the world, is ſo far from leſſening this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that they rather ſtrengthen it: Becauſe if Miracles were not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be a ſufficient evidence of a Divine Teſtimony, they had never been counterfeited. And it is certain that our reaſon, cloſely and duly applyed to all circumſtances, is able to diſtinguiſh between a true Miracle, and a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit. So we may take it for granted that the Miracles wrought by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were a ſufficient undeniable Evidence, that their Teſtimony was from God, i. e. <hi>that Jeſus of Nazareth was the Meſſias,</hi> and <hi>that they were his Followers, and Diſciples,</hi> and truly and ſufficiently acquainted with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS will appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſpecial neceſſity there was, that ſuch Miracles ſhould be wrought in
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59505:173"/>
confirmation of Chriſtian Religion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to point out. 1. The Perſon of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Or, 2. To diſpoſſeſs the Devil out of his ſtrong holds. Or, 3. To ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the expectations of all men both <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. THIS Proof was neceſſary in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to point out his Perſon to the <hi>Jews.</hi> When the <hi>Jews</hi> require a ſign from our Saviour; he doth not reject the enquiry, as in it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, but made in an unreaſonable manner, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſome extraordinary prodigy from Heaven; ſuch as were done in confirmation of the Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi>; and they would not be contented with the Miracles of our <hi>Saviour</hi>; that were far more Glorious and Divine, both for manner, and quality, than thoſe done by <hi>Moſes.</hi> When I affirm that Miracles were neceſſary to point out the Perſon of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> I mean, they confirm'd his Teſtimony to be from God; he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming himſelf to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the ſacred Oracles giving this character of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that he ſhould work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. For we cannot think that the wiſdom and goodneſs of God will ſuffer
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59505:173"/>
the utmoſt Seal of rational Evidence to be affixed to a Ly. The Learned <hi>Huetius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Huetius.</note> hath excellently cleared the Prophecies concerning the <hi>Meſſias</hi> from all the Cavils of the <hi>Jews</hi>; and there was no characteriſtick given of him in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, more frequent, and ſpecifick, than his working of Miracles. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6, 7. <hi>I the Lord have called thee in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a Covenant of the People, for a light of the Gentiles; To open the blind eyes, to bring out the priſoners from the priſon, and them that ſit in darkneſs out of the priſon houſe.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. Our Saviour tells us that the famous Prophecy of the <hi>Meſſias, Iſa.</hi> 61. Is fulfilled in himſelf.</p>
            <p>HENCE is it, that he appeals to his Miracles,<note place="margin">John.</note> as to his credential Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from Heaven; <hi>If I had not done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them the works which none elſe did, they had had no ſin, i. e.</hi> That of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; and again, <hi>Believe me for the works ſake.</hi> And their unbelief is juſtly expos'd, in that queſton of our Saviour'<hi>s,</hi> when he asks,<note place="margin">Matt. 11.</note> 
               <hi>for which of thoſe works do ye ſtone me.</hi> When <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59505:174"/>
of the Miracles of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſent two of his Diſciples with this queſtion to him, <hi>Art thou he that ſhould come?</hi> i. e. Art thou indeed the <hi>Meſſias?</hi> Our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> return'd no other anſwer than this, <hi>Go,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 7.</note> ſaid he, <hi>and ſhew</hi> John <hi>again thoſe things which you do hear and ſee, The blind receive their ſight, the lame walk, and the dead are raiſed up.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves acknowledge, that they could not in reaſon expect greater Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to be done by the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> than thoſe which they ſaw perform'd by our <hi>Saviour.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 3.</note> 
               <hi>When Chriſt cometh</hi> (ſay they) <hi>will he do nice Miracles, than theſe which this man doth?</hi> And <hi>Nicodemus</hi> grants, <hi>That no man can do theſe things, unleſs God be with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW thoſe Miracles are ſo much the more illuſtrious, that <hi>He</hi> not only wrought them himſelf, but gave power alſo to <hi>His</hi> Diſciples, when he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended unto the Father, to confirm their Teſtimony by Miracles. And the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity furniſh us with many undeniable proofs; ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and ſo palpable were thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the Divine Power, that
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59505:174"/>
multitudes of men and women were heal'd by the Apoſtles, only by the ſincere Invocation of the <hi>Name of Jeſus</hi>; and they, ſuch as were paſt all the cure of Art, and Nature. The ſhadow of S. <hi>Peter</hi> paſſing by did heal many. And the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> aſſures us, <hi>That God bore them witneſs, with ſigns,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2.4.</note> 
               <hi>and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his own will.</hi> And the Ancients largely proſecute this Argument, that ſuch, and ſo many Miracles were wrought by the Apoſtles; as clearly prov'd,<note place="margin">Vid. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nob. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſ. gent.</note> that <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence</hi> was ingaged in their defence, and confirmed their Doctrine: When <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> were not able to relieve any of their votaries, no not in thoſe Diſeaſes, that might be remov'd by the orderly application of Medicine. Thus we ſee that Miracles, were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to prove, that <hi>He was the Great, and Glorious Meſſias.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THEY were neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and baffle the Devil, To diſpoſleſs Satan, and break the force of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Now when we conſider the prejudices that many entertain'd againſt
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59505:175"/>
Chriſtianity, in its firſt appearance; how much the World at that time was ſunk into the groſſeſt Folly and Vanity; how contrary the Doctrine of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and his followers, was unto the biaſs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; how concern'd the Devil was, all the World over, to uphold his tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Throne. I ſay, when we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber all this, and the ſtrange oppoſition that the Goſpel met with, we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the great neceſſity of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; that we may give a reaſonable account of the progreſs of Chriſtianity, the Power of Miracles was a palpable demonſtration, that reach'd the Learn'd, and the Unlearn'd.</p>
            <p>THE jugling tricks of <hi>Daemons,</hi> when in competition with the uſeful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous Miracles of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd like dreams. The Devil was not baffled ſo much by any thing, as by this; when he was forc'd out of all quarters, and began to yield and give ground; wherever the Chriſtians came, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated with ſhame and confuſion, at the <hi>Name of Jeſus</hi>; his Altars fell, his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acles were ſilenc'd, and his Sacrifices deſerted. It was the uſual method of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59505:175"/>
the Apoſtles, firſt to work a Miracle, and then declare to the People in whoſe Name, and by whoſe Authority, they had done it. An inſtance whereof we have in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s curing the <hi>Criple,</hi> that lay at <hi>the beautiful gate of the Temple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN we reflect upon the ſtrange effect of their endeavours, and that ſuch mean perſons as they were ſhould prevail upon ſo many both learn'd and unlearn'd; and that not only in barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and obſcure places, but in <hi>Rome, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi>; and againſt the whole combination of the ſtrongeſt prejudices that we can imagine. We muſt enquire into the rational account of it, which cannot be reſolv'd into the evidence of the thing it ſelf, nor unto the credit of their Teſtimony, but unto the undeniable Power of God, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf in their miraculous Actions. It had certainly been impoſſible to have ſubdued the World to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> without it; and as impoſſible was it for reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men to reſiſt the Evidence of ſuch a heavenly demonſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:59505:176"/>THIS Argument is proſecuted at length, by <hi>Origen,</hi> againſt <hi>Celſus</hi>; where he proves that the Apoſtles did not ſo much convert the World, by their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as by their Actions. When the Souls of Men were drowned in ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nothing leſs than ſuch a cogent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, as reach'd both Soul and Body, could prevail upon them to ſo Heavenly a Religion. They did not put their Auditors to the trouble of making tedious enquiries, into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and validity of their Teſtimony; but prevented all diſquiſitions of that kind, by this infallible Proof.</p>
            <p>AND what rational man could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire any other proof, than the immediate atteſtation of a Divine Power? Who could doubt, and diſpute when he had ſeen the moſt Tyrannical and ſtubborn Devils diſpoſſeſſed, the ſick healed, and the dead raiſed? By this prevailing and mighty demonſtration they bore away their Underſtandings, baniſh'd all their Scruples, and forced open a paſſage into all their Affections; by this means the Goſpel prevailed ſo eaſily, and ſo ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:59505:176"/>
over all the World. And this Power was ſo vulgarly known at that time,<note place="margin">Rom. 15 18.</note> that S. <hi>Paul</hi> inſiſts upon it,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.12.</note> as a proof of his true <hi>Apoſtleſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it adds great weight unto this Argument, that the power of Miracles was not confin'd to the Apoſtolical Age, but was continued down to the next Age.</p>
            <p>WHAT bold Challenges do we meet with in all the Apologetick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the firſt Chriſtians? Offering themſelves to the Tryal, to ſee if the Devil be able to ſtand his ground, when he is commanded to retire in the <hi>Name of Jeſus. Juſtin Martyr</hi> in his firſt <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi> tells the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and <hi>Senate,</hi> that if they pleaſed they might inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of our Lords power over their Daemons, by what was daily done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their eyes. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> c. 23. <hi>of his Apologie,</hi> defies the Heathens in the tarteſt Language. <hi>Set before your Tribunals</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>any Perſon that is poſſeſs'd, and let any Chriſtian command the Daemon to confeſs what he is, he ſhall confeſs himſelf to be a Devil, as he did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:59505:177"/>
pretend to be a God.</hi> And <hi>Origen,</hi> in his Book againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> triumphs in nothing ſo much as this. <hi>We have</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſuch ways of demonſtration, as far outſtrips all your Greekiſh way of proof, even the demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Power.</hi> To them I add <note n="*" place="margin">Cujus nomine adjurati de corporibus excedunt, querum verbis tanguam flagris verberati, non mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do daemonas ſe eſſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentur, ſed etiam nomina ſua edunt, illa quae in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plis adorantur.<hi>And a little after,</hi> Quia nec DEO, per quem adjurantur, nec Juſtis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Lactantius de Origine Erroris,</hi> Lib. 2. c. 15. Where he tells us, that the Devils are afraid of them that Worſhip the Living God.</p>
            <p>THIS way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration was moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, not only to the Conviction of Mankind, but alſo moſt terrible to the Devils Kingdom. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. FULLY adequate to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> could not reject this kind of proof; for they believed their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, becauſe founded by Miracles, which made the name of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo famous amongſt them; and now and then it was atteſted by the Miracles of the following Prophets. They could
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59505:177"/>
not then reject the Miracles of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> without the groſſeſt abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and inconſiſtency to their own Principles.</p>
            <p>AND as to the reſt of Mankind, it could not but convince the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous amongſt them; their being no Principles ſo much received by the Light of Nature, as this, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature only could change and renverſe at his pleaſure (and to ſerve the ends of his Providence) the Laws of Nature. So we find the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in the 28. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> when they ſaw that S. <hi>Paul ſhook off the Viper, that had faſtened on his hand, and felt no harm</hi>; They acknowledg'd it a Miracle, and quickly chang'd their Opinion of him. They formerly took him for a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, now they take him for a God. So deep is this ſenſe left upon the minds of all Men, that a Miracle is a ſufficient proof of Divine Authority. And now we ſee plainly that the demonſtration of the Spirit, at the firſt propagation of the Goſpel, was the moſt ſuitable and rational Evidence, whether for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing the <hi>Jews,</hi> or confounding the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59505:178"/>
               <hi>Daemons</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all Men; there was no proof more proper, none could be more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. Therefore was it ſo pertinently alledg'd by our Apoſtle, againſt the fooliſh cavils of them that underſtood not the nature of ſuch a mighty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.</p>
            <p>I MIGHT now vindicate what I have ſaid concerning Miracles, from the Objections of the <hi>Jews and Pagans,</hi> but they are ſo fooliſh and trifling, that they need not be nam'd. When they object that they were wrought by the power of <hi>Magick</hi>; we need no other anſwer, than that of our <hi>Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>; who told them, that the <hi>Devil</hi> was not ſuch a fool as to employ his power againſt himſelf, ſince it was undeniably manifeſt, that no diſcipline did ſo viſib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and irreconcileably oppoſe all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Arts and Charms, as did the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> So a great number of them that had followed thoſe curious Arts, brought their coſtly Books to the Apoſtles and burnt them. And when they endeavour'd to alledge that equal Miracles have been done by others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59505:178"/>
the <hi>Pagans</hi>: 'Tis ſo idle a ſtory, that they are far form believing it, who firſt invented it. The ſtory of <hi>Veſpaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's reſtoring a blind man to his ſight</hi> did proceed from the artifice of <hi>Egyptian flattery,</hi> and is reported by his own Hiſtorians with ſo much diffidence and reſerve, that it is ſcarce worth the naming. As for the prodigious ſeats of <hi>Apollonius Tianeus,</hi> we can look upon them as no other, than fictitious, and Romantick Fooleries, vouched by no competent Authority. Whereas the Miracles done by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> were not only of a different Nature from thoſe little Tricks of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi>; but were wrought amongſt great crowds of People, to the view of the World, and acknowledg'd by the moſt bitter and implacable of his Enemies. And this Power he had not only in himſelf, but beſtowed it on his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Beſides the full diſcovery of thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, depends on ſo much Hiſtory, that they cannot be contracted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch narrow bounds as I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>find'd to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:59505:179"/>THE Reſult of all is this, Such as deſpiſe the Goſpel do it upon the moſt unreaſonable grounds. For whereas they alledge that our Miniſtry was not attended with Wiſdom and Proofs borrowed from Philoſophy, they betray their Ignorance: For the Doctrine that we propagate and aſſert, being of its own Nature wholly Divine, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of all human enquiries, it muſt needs have its Proofs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations from Heaven. Without this it could not prevail, and when it is attended with this, it is impoſſible that it can miſs of its effect: So <hi>we come not with the enticing words of mans wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but in demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power.</hi> Now we find that thoſe Miracles were neceſſary at the firſt eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity, to point out the Perſon of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> to baffle the Devil, and to ſatisfie the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all Men, and that thus rationally we can give an account of the ſpeedy and univerſal propagation of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:59505:179"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> WE conſider the deſign, and ſcope of this Oeconomy. That their Faith might be built on the ſureſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, <hi>i. e.</hi> on the Power of God. And here I might reckon up the motives of Credibility, that obliged us to aſſent to the Chriſtian Religion. (if they can be numbered) But I chuſe to improve what is ſaid in one Word of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed be God,</hi> who hath ſo fully provided for our Illumination, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, that we might reſt in his Word and Teſtimony, with full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of mind: For the Apoſtles <hi>did not follow cunningly deviſed fables,</hi> when they made known unto us the Power and <hi>Coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let us give up our ſelves to it, without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and heſitation of Spirit, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely maintaining it, even unto Death: And above all endeavouring to adorn it by a Holy Converſation, <hi>adding to our faith, vertue; to vertue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance,</hi> &amp;c. Let us eſteem and love it, for its genuine Grandure, and Majeſty, even when it
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59505:180"/>
is not attended with the Ornaments of human Art. For <hi>how ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great a Salvation,</hi> that was firſt confirm'd by Miracles and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?</p>
            <p>LET us not deſire, that ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Truths be recommended to us chiefly, and only by human Art. So weak are we that we reliſh not Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, unleſs they ſmell of the Earth. When we hear the Word of God, the corruption of our Nature leads us to notice more the air, accent, and geſture of the Preacher than the great Truths that he recommends; and all theſe be they never ſo plain, innocent, and unexceptionable; they have their fate and cenſure, not from our unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed reaſon, but from that part of us that is carnal. I am not of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the Myſteries of the Goſpel are to be handled confuſedly, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, in a ſlovenly dreſs, ſuch gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments become not the Majeſty of that Religion, whoſe Miniſters we are. The Oracles of God deſerve that we ſhould Meditate in them, night and day. But we are ſo to ſtudy them

that we <hi>preach not our ſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord,</hi> and our ſelves your Servants for Chriſts ſake, that we may not think that the ſucceſs of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours depends on the skill and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of our Compoſures, but on <hi>God that giveth the Increaſe.</hi>

            <p>WHEN our <hi>Saviour</hi> appeared, the <hi>Church</hi> was ſadly over-run with the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Immoralities, and the moſt abſurd Superſtitions and Deluſions. The Law of God, which was in it ſelf <hi>pure, and juſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> 
               <hi>and holy,</hi> was perverted by their Commentaries; and made to truckle under ſuch deſigns, as were hateful to God, and ſubverſive of all true Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Their plauſible gloſſes, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt maxims, deſtroy'd the natural force of Religion, and withal they deceiv'd the poor People into an Opinion, that they themſelves were the peculiar fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites of God; even then, when our <hi>Saviour</hi> told them, that the <hi>publicans and the ſinners ſhould enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven before them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN we read the <hi>Sermon</hi> on the <hi>Mount,</hi> we find, that it was our Saviour's great deſign to plant, and eſtabliſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Diſciples, a manly, rational and heroick temper of mind; a higher kind of Philoſophy, than the <hi>Phariſees</hi>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:59505:182"/>
underſtood, or the <hi>Pagans</hi> pretended to. The rule of Life that he gave us was ſo accurate, and ſo ſuitable to our Nature, in its firſt and original conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that nothing can equal it for purity and holineſs. The wiſeſt ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the beſt thoughts of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> ſcattered here and there in all their books, are very far outdone in one <hi>Page</hi> of the New <hi>Teſtament.</hi> He removes our errors, prejudices and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, concerning God, our ſelves, and the rewards of another Life. He opens our eyes to ſee thorow the little tricks, hypocritical deſigns, and ſuperſtitious follies of the <hi>Phariſees.</hi> And by the moſt cogent proofs he forces us to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that there is no Religion ſo worthy of God to reveal, ſo proper for us to be taught in, as that ſyſtem of true Piety, and unaffected Morality, that he has brought to Light.</p>
            <p>WHEN I ſay <hi>Morality,</hi> I do not underſtand Morality, in the uſual lame and defective ſignification of it, as it regards our outward behaviour towards Man: But rather the whole of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſubmiſſion, and obedience to the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:59505:183"/>
firſt and ſecond Table of the Law. And in this true and comprehenſive notion, I affirm, that it was our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s deſign to advance it unto practice, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation amongſt Mankind.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion (take it all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) was rather Gods indulgence and toleration, than his law and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And tho it had the Seal of his Authority; yet it was not in it ſelf the beſt Religion, but the beſt that they could bear. When they returned from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the impreſſions of their ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude were not ſo ſoon worn off, but that their proneneſs to Idolatry, and former ſlaviſh diſpoſitions remain'd. And ever and anon upon all occaſions (for a long time after) they relapſe into their ſuperſtitions, and <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
            <p>IF we view them in the beſt periods of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oeconomy, their Religion was defective. Many things were plainly permitted, or tacitely conniv'd at, (as <hi>Polygamy and Divorce,</hi> and ſome degrees of <hi>uncharitableneſs, and revenge</hi>) which natural and uncorrupted reaſon diſlikes
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:59505:183"/>
and condemns. But when <hi>Our Saviour</hi> appear'd, it was then high time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the World from their beggarly elements; and to give us the true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Almighty God; the ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Worſhip; and the extent of his univerſal Empire over <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi>; and to form our manners by that accurate rule of his Doctrine, and Example: By which we were not only aſſured of Eternal Life, but partly (in a manner) put in the poſſeſſion of it. A ſcheme of Chriſtian Morals is given us in the <hi>Sermon</hi> on the <hi>Mount,</hi> ſo pure and angelical, that at firſt view, we are forc'd to acknowledge that <hi>it came down from the Father of lights.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip. 4.8.</note> We are exhorted <hi>to whatſoever things are true, honeſt, juſt, pure, lovely, and of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; if there be any vertue, and if there be any praiſe, to think on theſe things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO advance and facilitate the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of this Morality, was the deſign of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s undertaking, when we conſider the Goſpel in its uniform ſtrength and vigour, as alſo to calm the conſciences of men; to remove our fears; and to teach us to approach the Throne
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59505:184"/>
of God, with a generous aſſurance of mind; to bind us in the ſtrongeſt bonds of Society amongſt our ſelves, and to liberate us from the yoke of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. This was our Saviour<hi>'s</hi> buſineſs when he took upon him our Nature, <hi>when we beheld his glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 1.14.</note> 
               <hi>the glory, as of the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace, and Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I SAY, one great part of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was, to form us into true Morals. This is the comprehenſive character by which good men are diſtinguiſhed in the Holy Scriptures. <hi>In this the Children of God are manifeſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.10.</note> 
               <hi>and the Children of the Devil, whoſoever doth not righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</hi> Thus runs the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Job,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job, 1.1.</note> that <hi>he was a man perfect and upright, one that feared God, and eſchewed evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 15.</note>AND <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>religious man walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth uprightly, and worketh righteouſneſs, and ſpeaketh the truth in his heart.</hi> The great character of <hi>Moſes</hi> was, <hi>that he was very meek, above all the men upon the face of the Earth.</hi> And <hi>Cornelius</hi>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:59505:184"/>
the Centurion,<note place="margin">Acts, 10.1.</note> is ſaid to be <hi>a devout man, and one that feared God with all his houſe, which gave much alms to the People, and prayed to God alway.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT all along the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> the <hi>Phariſees</hi> are <hi>ſtigmatiz'd,</hi> that they were cold and indifferent in the great Morals of Religion, while they were very zealous, and pragmatick to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the rituals of it. They were <hi>blind guides, who ſtrain'd at a Gnat, and ſwallowed a Camel. They tithed Mint, Anniſe, and Cummin, and neglected the weightier matters of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN the whole of Religion is ſumm'd up in the moſt compendious manner, there is nothing elſe nam'd but <hi>the love of God, and our neighbour</hi>: Or, the moſt ingenuous expreſſions of both.<note place="margin">Mich. 6.8.</note> 
               <hi>What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> And our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.16, 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>that on the Love of God and our neighbour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 22.4.</note> 
               <hi>hangs all the Law and Prophets.</hi> And this is the ſame Doctrine that is preached by S. <hi>Paul, for Love is the fullfiling of the Law.</hi> And therefore
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:59505:185"/>
we find that the Prophets, upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, did endeavour to withdraw the thoughts of the <hi>Jews</hi> from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal drudgery of their Religion, to that Immortal Deity that was Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and to convince them that if their Sacrifices were not attended with the Love of God and their Neighbour, they could not be acceptable: The blood of Bulls, and of Goats, was no entertainment for him that made Heaven and Earth. A Soul diſengaged from the corruptions of Life, and animated in all its actions with true zeal and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, was the only acceptable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
            <p>AND the Rituals of Chriſtianity (if they are deſtitute of their true Spirit and Life) are of no greater value. <hi>Our Faith without works is dead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2.20. 2 Pet. 2.22.</note> in the language of S. <hi>James.</hi> And S. <hi>Peter</hi> compares our <hi>Baptiſm</hi> (if ſeparated from Purity of Manners) <hi>to the waſhing of Swine.</hi> And our Communicating without Devotion, is by S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to be <hi>our coming together to condemnation.</hi> It is the pure heart, and clean hands, the modeſt and ingenuous temper of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59505:185"/>
Spirit, that perfume our Faith, our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and our Aſſemblies. When we look into the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> this Doctrine runs through all its parts, and breaths almoſt in every Line,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.11.</note> 
               <hi>the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Men, teaching us, that denying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world, looking for the bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works.</hi> And,<note place="margin">1. Joh. 3.8.</note> for this very purpoſe <hi>the Son of God was manifeſted that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN all ages men have endeavoured to croſs, and oppoſe this part of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s deſign, and to reconcile (by little diſtinctions, plauſible, and artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al tricks) their Religion to their Luſts. Some Religion they muſt have, and that which renders them truly acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, penetrates too deep into the Soul, ſearches the Hearts and Reins, and teaches them to live in oppoſition
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59505:186"/>
to the corrupt Spirit of the World, and to lead captive ſecret thoughts and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations unto the obedience of Chriſt. The impreſſions of the Divinity are fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the Soul of Man; the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and fears of an after reckoning, haunt us whether we will or not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt needs invent a Religion, that is calculated to ſerve their deſigns, and to ſilence the troubleſome alarms of their mind.<note place="margin">Galat. 6.7.</note> 
               <hi>But be not you deceived, God is not mocked, for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap.</hi> Our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> ſet himſelf to undeceive the World in this great affair; and to remove the Phariſaical paint and varniſh from the Law, and to let us underſtand, that our God is not an Idol, that he values no Sacrifices, but ſuch as reſemble his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For he is a Spirit, and muſt be worſhiped in Spirit, and in Truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A SECOND part of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>'s deſign was, to give true repoſe and tranquillity to the Spirits of Men. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 11.38.</note> 
               <hi>and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> The inward diſorder of our Spirits is the cauſe of all our trouble; when the Light
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59505:186"/>
of the Goſpel removes our Errors, and by its beams warms our affections, the day-ſtar from on high ariſeth in our breaſts; our fears and dreadful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions are over; and there is a perfect calm and tranquillity. One great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> was, <hi>to bind up the broken hearted.</hi> The Souls of Men are at variance with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, until they are united unto God. He fixes their Spirits in their operations and choice, and creates within them that harmony and peace, <hi>which the World cannot give them.</hi> Then they are arm'd againſt all events and diſaſters; they are like a Rock of Adamant immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able againſt the moſt tempeſtuous waves and ſtorms; the winds may blow, and the ſtorms may threaten, and beat upon the Rock with the loudeſt roarings, but they are quickly beat back into froth and diſappointment. <hi>The righteous are like mount Zion which cannot be mov'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT it was a part of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>'s deſign to eſtabliſh this tranquillity of Spirit, appears from this very Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the Mount, where he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours by ſo many arguments, to fortifie
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:59505:187"/>
us againſt all fears, diſcouragments, and ſolicitude. The Wiſdom of God levell'd the ſtrongeſt arguments againſt the moſt deſperate diſeaſes; and therefore, the Doctrine of the Goſpel in all its branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es hath an admirable tendency to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate this peace. When we believe that all things are ordered and diſpos'd by an univerſal, infinitely wiſe, unlimited, and active Providence; With what acquieſcence, and ſerenity of Spirit may we give up all things to his conduct and government? <hi>Not a hair of your head falleth to the ground</hi> without his pleaſure. The nature and frame of all the Graces of the Spirit, the whole ſpiritual furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Goſpel naturally lead to peace, love, joy, and meekneſs. We are aſſured, <hi>that all things work together for good to them that love God; Even our light afflictions, that endure but for a moment, work for us a far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and eternal weight of glory.</hi> And the belief of this eſtabliſhes the mind againſt all the ſhakings of adverſity. And we may add to all the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, that we are frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to <hi>place our affections on the things that are above</hi>;<note place="margin">Col. 3.2.</note> to leave this World ('its
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:59505:187"/>
hurry and noiſe) and to get above it in our affections; and to view with ſatisfaction and eaſe (amidſt our loweſt depreſſions) that Country that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
            <p n="3">3. ANOTHER part of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>'s deſign was, to unite us together in the ſtraiteſt bonds of humane ſociety. In order to which he hath made Love the badge and character of his profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; So exactly fulfilling the Prophecies concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that in his days <hi>the Wolf ſhould dwell with the Lamb, the Leopard, and the Kid ſhould ly down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> i. e. that the fierceneſs of human Nature ſhould be baniſh'd, and all the rugged and uneven excreſcencies of paſſion, the boiſterous ſwellings of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſhould be filed off. <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> told, <hi>that every valley ſhould be fill'd, and every mountain brought low, the crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhould be made ſtraight, and the rough ways ſhould be made ſmooth,</hi> i. e. All injuſtice, fraud, and oppreſſion, all pride, hypocriſie and violence, ſhould give place unto everlaſting righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; every one ſhould keep his own poſt, and move in his own Orb, with
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59505:188"/>
contentment and ſobriety. Hence Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are exhorted not to repine at their condition; for as the members of the body natural muſt hold their diſtance and ſituation, ſo muſt the members of the body political.</p>
            <p n="4">4. ANOTHER part of his deſign was to liberate us from the Yoke of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. I only name this particular, I will not inſiſt on it at preſent.</p>
            <p>Now if the deſign of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was to reſtore true morality, the image of God, humility, patience, the love of God, and contempt of the World, and to diſcover the hypocriſie and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the <hi>Phariſees:</hi> Let us then enquire.</p>
            <p>In the Second place, IN what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances the Phariſaical Religion did croſs the Chriſtian; and we ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the manifeſt oppoſition of the one to the other. When we conſider
<list>
                  <item>1: THE Vices, that they were moſt addicted to.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="349" facs="tcp:59505:188"/>2. THE Prejudices, that they were blinded with.</item>
                  <item>3. THE Maxims, and ſhifts that they eſpous'd into their Doctrine, to defend their wickedneſs, and immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Do but conſider the Vices, that they were moſt addicted to. Pride, contrary to the humility of the Goſpel. Avarice, in oppoſition to that contempt of the World that our <hi>Saviour</hi> taught. Hypocriſie, that overthrows the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity recommended, and enjoyn'd by our Religion. Revenge, Cruelty, and Rebellion, contrary to the Loyalty, Meekneſs, and Obedience <hi>of our moſt holy Faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Antiq. 17.</note> We are inform'd by <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> (though he was himſelf much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the Sect of the <hi>Phariſees</hi>) that <hi>they were a crafty and ſubtile generation of men, and ſo perverſe even to Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they would not fear many times openly to affront them.</hi> They had a mighty aſcendent over the People, and by their long prayers, ſuperſtitious tricks, and disfigur'd faces, they got
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59505:189"/>
the Rable once of their ſide, and by their intereſt in the multitude, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came terrible to the Governours.</p>

               <note place="margin">Joſeph,</note>
               <hi>Alexander Jannaeus,</hi> when he lay a dying, advis'd his <hi>Queen</hi> not to irritate and diſpleaſe the <hi>Phariſees</hi>; and told her plainly, that <hi>this was the very thing that deriv'd the</hi> Odium <hi>of the Nation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that he had comply'd ſo little with that reſtleſs and pragmatick Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF the Vices of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> prevail amongſt the Chriſtians, what a reproach is it unto us, and to our Religion? When we remember that <hi>we are to obey for Conſcience ſake.</hi> We may eaſily ſee that there is nothing more oppoſite to Chriſtianity than Rebellion. And this very Sect amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtrove to advance their Religious Tyranny above the <hi>Higheſt Powers</hi>;<note place="margin">Greg. <hi>the</hi> 7<hi>th.</hi> Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>the</hi> 3<hi>d.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are ſmoothly told by ſome of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59505:189"/>
them, that this is not matter of Faith, but Diſcipline. I confeſs it is Diſcipline, and that of the ſevereſt kind for a <hi>King</hi> to be depos'd, and ſent to a Monaſtery as <hi>Childerick</hi> was. And the power by which this was done, is ſaid by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> to be acknowledg'd <hi>communi ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicorum ſententiâ</hi>; and I think, that he underſtood their Doctrine as well as any other.</p>
            <p>BUT the Genius of this Sect among the <hi>Jews</hi> will appear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IF we conſider the Prejudices wherewith they were blinded, and which kept them from believing our <hi>Saviour</hi> to be the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Now, leſt I ſhould ſeem to make up an account of their prejudices againſt our <hi>Saviour</hi> that is purely imaginary; I ſhall confine my Narration only to the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE <hi>Phariſees</hi> valued themſelves on the Authority of <hi>Moſes Chair.</hi> And this they magnify'd to that height, that they impos'd their dictates on all men for infallible Oracles. The People (they
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:59505:190"/>
thought) ſhould receive their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without ſcruple or heſitation. They only underſtood the Law, and the true meaning of it; and if any had been at any time ſo daring and preſumptuous, as to queſtion their Skill and Integrity, he was preſently Excommunicated. This was the ſevereſt Tyranny over Mens Conſciences; not to ſee with thoſe Eyes that God gave them was very hard: And yet thoſe very Men, that valued themſelves on the Authority of <hi>Moſes Chair,</hi> declar'd ſitting in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil from that very <hi>Chair, that our Saviour was an Impoſtor.</hi> So we have the <hi>Church</hi> in her Soveraign repreſentatives erring with a witneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 23.8, 9.10</note>BUT <hi>our bleſſed Redeemer</hi> reaſoned men into the belief of his Doctrine. It was with an eye to this pretended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſorbad his Diſciples to be called Rabbi, Father, or Maſter upon the Earth. We cannot think that ever he deſign'd to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the diſtinctions of Order and civil Dependance: (for there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution that eſtabliſhes the ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of inferiour degrees, upon ſuch
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:59505:190"/>
ſure and laſting Foundations as <hi>Ours</hi> doth.) Yet, in the place lately cited he reproves the imperious Vanity of them that requir'd a blind and implicite Obedience to their Command, that would oblige the People to receive all that they ſay without Examination or Tryal; and if any of his Diſciples would ſet up for a Rabbi, or Maſter in that ſenſe; he tells them plainly, that it was inconſiſtent with the weakneſs and dependance of humane Nature, <hi>for one was their Maſter even Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A SECOND Prejudice againſt our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his Doctrine, was the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their own Tradition, which they affirmed to have been deriv'd from <hi>Moſes,</hi> together with the written Law; and theſe Traditions they multiply'd unto infinite fancies, and ſcrupuloſities. So that their Religion now became an intolerable burthen to their memories. When any ventur'd to tranſgreſs their Traditions, they perſecuted him with ſpite and indignation. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of himſelf, that when he was a <hi>Phariſee, he was zealous of the Traditions of the Fathers; and that he thought himſelf

            </p>
            <p>WHEN they ſaw the Diſciples of our <hi>Saviour</hi> tranſgreſſing their little rules and obſervances, they rudely quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with him;<note place="margin">Matth. 15.2, 3.</note> and asked, <hi>Why do thy Diſciples tranſgreſs the Tradition of the Elders?</hi> And our <hi>Saviour</hi> anſwered, <hi>why do you alſo tranſgreſs the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God by your Tradition?</hi> And with the ſame ſeverity he again reproves their Superſtition,<note place="margin">Mark 7.8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>For laying aſide the Commandment of God, ye hold the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men.</hi> As if he had ſaid, you pretend by your Traditions to explain the Law, but your Commentaries make it not only more dark and intricate, but entirely overthrow it; and inſtead of ſolving one difficulty, you create a thouſand. And ſuch Reproofs as theſe are frequently mixt with our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Sermons. We are not to underſtand the univerſal Traditions of the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> than which there cannot be a better evidence of a matter of Fact; but we are here to underſtand the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Doctrines that creep'd into the <hi>Church,</hi> in its laſt and more degenerate
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:59505:191"/>
periods, by which men promoted their private Ambition, and impos'd their peculiar Tenents with no other deſign, than to raiſe their own Reputation, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ruins of Gods Law and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>A THIRD Prejudice was their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Diſpenſations. And this was indeed one of their moſt pernicious maxims by which they weakened the ſtrength of the Law upon Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> took notice of this groſs abuſe obliquely in the verſe before my Text: And more directly reproves it in the Goſpel of S. <hi>Mark.</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Mark 7.11.</note> Their Doctrine of the <hi>Corban</hi> was the moſt unnatural, and helliſh contrivance, that ever was hatched under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their Vow and Religion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert their Parents; as if the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Nature were to be ſhaken off, and evacuated, by the ties and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Religion; as if we could not be Religious in an eminent degree, unleſs firſt we renounc'd humanity and tenderneſs. When Religion undermines its own foundation, then it becomes the ſaddeſt and moſt incurable Diſeaſe.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59505:192"/>
Chriſtianity rectifies the diſorders of our Nature, and yet ſome Chriſtians pretend Religion to authorize the moſt barbarous villanies; and have invented little arts, and knaviſh ſubterfuges to hide their hypocriſie and deſign, under the vizor of Religion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A FOURTH Prejudice againſt the Simplicity of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Doctrine and Appearance, was the ſplendor of their outward Worſhip and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. They doated on the <hi>Temple of Jeruſalem,</hi> and thought that God had confin'd his favour peculiarly to that place. So they look upon the Fabrick of it with Tranſport and Admiration, <hi>The Temple of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 7.4.</note> 
               <hi>The Temple of the Lord are theſe.</hi> And it ſeems that our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Diſciples looked on the the <hi>Temple</hi> with more than ordinary fondneſs; when he told them, that <hi>there ſhould not a ſtone of it be leſt upon another.</hi> There were three things in this Religion, that dazl'd mens eyes, and inchanted their affections. 1. The outward Pomp, and Splendor of it. 2. The Severities of ſome outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances. And 3. Their corrupt Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59505:192"/>
by which they forc'd their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (contrary to its original purity) to comply with their Luſts; and all theſe things made it a Religion wholly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>I MIGHT name their pride and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs towards all that differ'd from them; their ſuperſtitious niceneſs in little things, in tithing Mint, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe, and Cummin; and their mighty Zeal to make Proſelytes. All which are over and over again reprov'd in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW when they ſtood upon ſuch unreaſonable prejudices, and defended their Doctrines by little diſtinctions, and maxims of their own invention; They could not but be proof againſt the Doctrine and Miracles of our <hi>bleſſed Saviour.</hi> 1. They taught, that if men obeyed the Law externally, they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not trouble themſelves, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the heart. And with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to this pernicious Maxim, our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells us in the Text, <hi>that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:59505:193"/>
we ſhall in no caſe enter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> We could not exceed the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in that kind of Religion, to which they were moſt addicted: And therefore our Religion muſt needs be of another ſtamp entirely, <hi>pure, gentle, eaſie to be intreated, full of good works without partiality, and without hypocriſie.</hi> 2. They thought that they might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for moral Miſcarriages, by long prayers, and bodily ſeverities. And they would gladly ſubmit to any thing, rather than reform what ought to be truly amended. 3. They believ'd they might merit eternal Life by the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of one Precept; though they liv'd in the habitual contempt, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of all the reſt. Such a Precept they took their <hi>Sabbath</hi> to be.</p>
            <p>WHEN we view the pure, and unaffected complexion of our Religion, how great an Enemy it is to all unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſhifts and diſguiſes; how generous and refin'd, above that Spirit that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in the World; how amiable in the Eyes of God and Men; then I ſay, we may eaſily perceive, that there is nothing more oppoſite unto it, than
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:59505:193"/>
that peeviſh ſuperſtition and hypocriſie, that prevail'd in the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> when our <hi>Saviour</hi> appear'd. And to the end that we may feel the force of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to the beſt advantages: Let us obſerve the following Directions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE muſt underſtand our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thorowly;<note place="margin">Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and fix it in our Souls by the moſt accurate, and ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. For though the motives of Chriſtianity be of that moment, that they may eaſily conquer our Souls; yet, unleſs they are duly applyed by Thought, Reaſon, and Meditation, they looſe their force and efficacy; and they never impart to us the leaſt degree of ſpiritual courage and activity. God aſſaults our Reaſon in the firſt place, and when we are overcome by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are then <hi>a willing People</hi>; we are Subjects by our choice, and not by conſtraint: Therefore are we frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to view and conſider the motives, and arguments of our Religion, and weigh them in the balance, againſt the difficulties that oppoſe us. That when we have examin'd, and ſeriouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated whatſoever makes for or againſt
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:59505:194"/>
our being Chriſtians; we may go forth to meet our Enemy, with ſpiritual fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture and ſtrength. Shall the World and its triffling Intereſts (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we are convinc'd of its empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vanity) take up ſo many of our Thoughts? And ſhall we forget our immortal Souls, and the Judgment to come? Religion enters the Soul by Meditation, and no Man can be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, but by the acts of his Mind. It is a reaſonable ſervice that we are call'd to, and to make us continue in it with delight, our Reaſon muſt be firſt engag'd. How neceſſary this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is, our <hi>Saviour</hi> repreſents in the Goſpel of S.<note place="margin">Luke.</note> 
               <hi>Luke, What King go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out to war, doth not firſt ſit down and conſider, if with his ten thouſand he be able to meet him that comes againſt him with twenty thouſand.</hi> Or if a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to build a Tower, he firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes the expence and then he builds.</p>
            <p>SUCH as are haſtily engag'd in the ſervice of Religion, are frequently forc'd to retire with ſhame and diſhonour. And this is the uſual reſult of raſh and unſettled purpoſes, which men make in
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:59505:194"/>
the heat of their paſſion, and under the power of ſome tranſient conviction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE are always to perfer the Morals of Religion to its leſſer Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages,<note place="margin">Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and Ceremonies; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the laſt, are only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to advance the firſt. True Chriſtian Life is the Tranſcript of the Divine Nature; <hi>Be ye holy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.15, 16. Matth.</note> 
               <hi>as I am holy.</hi> And again, <hi>Be ye merciful, as your Father in heaven is merciful.</hi> There are ſuch legible impreſſions of the Divine Nature felt in the Souls of the Regenerate, that they attract his preſence, they are his peculiar habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where he fixes his reſidence. Nothing ſo enlarges the Spirit of a Man, as to fix his eyes on the Life of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to view with attention and delight, how much he was above the World, when environ'd with its terrors and flatteries. He ſpoke of the inviſible things, as one does of his own Country. He reaſon'd men out of their folly, by all the force, and weight of Heaven and Eternity. And if we allow him to ſpeak to our Conſciences, it is not poſſible to reſiſt his reaſonings. <hi>He went
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:59505:195"/>
about doing good.</hi> He made himſelf acceſſible to us by the interpoſal of his humanity; that we might ſee as well as hear the beauties of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. He taught us a Doctrine that is exactly calculated to refine our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; to make us better in all relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And by this rule we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the different pretences of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Parties. If they advance by the plaineſt and neareſt methods, true Piety, Innocency and Simplicity, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate them in the Spirit of Love, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Subordination; this is the ſureſt mark to know that they belong to the Houſehold of Faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE are here but <hi>Pilgrims and Strangers,</hi> we are ſo to demean our ſelves, as Candidates for Eternity. Our Chriſtian Life is but a flight from the World, and the more we are alienated from the Spirit that prevails in it; the more ripe we are for that incorruptible inheritance that is reſerv'd for us. Let us make the things of another World preſent to our ſelves by Faith, <hi>For the faſhion of this World paſſeth away.</hi> And we are ſhortly to appear before Gods
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:59505:195"/>
Tribunal, ſtript naked of all the thin cobwebs and excuſes, whereby we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to hide our deformities up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And laſtly, WHEN you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately reſolv'd, conſider the evil of back-ſliding and its dreadful conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. There are but few, who plainly and openly deny the Faith unto which they are Baptized; yet, many hundreds deny the Lord that bought them, by their wicked Lives and unchriſtian Practices.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.38, 39.</note> 
               <hi>Now the juſt ſhall live by Faith; but if any man draw back, my Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in him. But we are not of them who draw back into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but of them that believe to the ſaving of the Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>To God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, be all Glory, Praiſe and Dominion, for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>THE Chriſtian Church, from the Aſcenſion of our Bleſſed Saviour into Heaven until the Effuſion of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtles, was full of great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations and great fears; they had not yet quite broke off from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Jewiſh Church; yet they continued in their ſolitude and retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in the true exerciſe of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Patience, until our Saviour ſhould ſcatter his Royal Donatives upon his ſolemn and magnificent entrance into the Heavens. By which Gifts and Graces the Apoſtles were enabled to aſſert the Truth of our Religion boldly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the <hi>glad tidings of Salvation</hi> to all
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:59505:197"/>
Nations; and the Literal <hi>Judaiſm</hi> was to give place to the Myſtical; and the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was not only to be <hi>the Glory of his people Iſrael,</hi> but a <hi>Light to lighten the Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR Saviour after his Reſurrection gave all aſſurance to the Apoſtles, that he would ſend them <hi>another Comforter, when He was gone unto the Father,</hi> an Advocate to plead his Cauſe ſucceſsful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; one who ſhould inſpire them with ſtrength and skill to defie and reſiſt all the Calumnies and Slanders of Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore they ought not to give way either to grief, ſorrow, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency. For, all Power in Heaven and in Earth was given to their Lord and Maſter: He was higheſt in the Glory of the Father: He was not only declared to be the <hi>Son of God by his Reſurrection from the dead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.9, 10.</note> but <hi>God did highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt him, and gave him a Name which is above every Name, that at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in Heaven, and things in Earth, and things under the Earth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 24.</note> He inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them formerly in the Spiritual Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of his Kingdom, that they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:59505:198"/>
not be aſhamed of the Doctrine of the Croſs, that it behov'd <hi>Chriſt to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and to riſe from the dead the third day</hi>; to the end that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his Name, <hi>throughout all Nations, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at Jeruſalem</hi>; and withal, that He was not unmindful of his Promiſe that He made before He was crucified, <hi>now that he was riſen from the dead</hi>; but He aſſured them He would ſend the <hi>Promiſe of the Father</hi> upon them, ſo much to their comfort, ſucceſs and ſatisfaction, that the whole World ſhould take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it. In the mean time they were to remain quiet, and knit together at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> until this Promiſe was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
            <p>HE had before at their Ordination, and formal Admiſſion into the higheſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Church,<note place="margin">John 20.21, 22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>breathed on them, and bad them receive the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> By the which they were inveſted with a Legal and Authoritative Title to act as the Ambaſſadors of Jeſus Chriſt; to proclaim his Laws, to require the Obedience of all Nations, to convey this Power unto others, to erect a new Society<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſtinct
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:59505:198"/>
from all Secular Incorporations, to bind and looſe by the Cenſures of the Church; but ſtill, notwithſtanding of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they remain'd without ſtrength, until the ſolemn and magnificent Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> by which their Tongues being fired from Heaven, their oppoſers were not able to reſiſt the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by which they ſpake. Now, was the Prophecy of <hi>Joel</hi> fulfilled in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſenſe; and ſo S. <hi>Peter</hi> applies it to this aſtoniſhing and heavenly manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days, ſaith God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 2.16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>I will poure out of my Spirit on all fleſh, and your ſons and your daughters ſhall propheſie, and your young men ſhall ſee viſions, and your old men ſhall dream dreams.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE are who diſtinguiſh in the Writings of the New Teſtament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi>; and that the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſignifies the Power of Miracles, healing the Sick, caſting out of Devils, reſtoring ſight to the Blind, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Dead, by all which our Saviour proved himſelf to be the true <hi>Meſſias:</hi> And by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> they think we ought to underſtand the wonderful
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:59505:199"/>
Gifts of Utterance, of Languages, of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Myſteries, by which the Apoſtles were enabled in a moment to confound all the arts and oppoſitions of their enemies, to run down with evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence all the calumnies and reproaches invented either by <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> againſt the Perſon, Life, Doctrine or Miracles of our bleſſed Saviour.</p>
            <p>BUT we ſhall have a better view of this, when we fix our Meditations on that part of Scripture that I have read, and conſider it in all its mutual aſpects and relations, then I will endeavour to gather the ſeveral Branches of it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again in the Application.</p>
            <p>WE find that the Apoſtles did exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey the Command of our Saviour, they tarried at <hi>Jeruſalem waiting for the promiſe of the Father.</hi> The Text hath in it the accompliſhment of this Promiſe, and becauſe it is ſo peculiar to this day to commemorate the Effuſion of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt,</hi> with the higheſt Joy and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, I will invite your attention to theſe three Particulars in the words that I have read.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:59505:199"/>1. THE diſpoſition that the Apoſtles were in to receive the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, they were all with one accord in one place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. THE ſenſible Emblem of it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, 1. To their Ears in the ſecond Verſe; and to their Eyes in the third Verſe. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. HERE is the Accompliſhment of the Promiſe, the ſucceſs and the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it; <hi>they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, they began to ſpeak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider the Diſpoſition that they were in to receive it. <hi>They were all with one accord in one place.</hi> The Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cannot dwell in thoſe Breaſts that are gangreen'd with diſcords, jars and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities. All our wild paſſions and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly humours muſt be huſh'd into ſilence at the approach of this heavenly Gueſt; he chuſes for his reſidence &amp; habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thoſe pure and innocent Souls that breath nothing but love, candor, ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and meekneſs: the ſecret retirements of
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:59505:200"/>
the Mind where he dwells muſt be made ſmooth, even, and regular: the rugged and intricate circuits of Hypocriſie, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and Envy, are inconſiſtent with his Preſence. He loves to fix his reſidence where there are ſome beautiful Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of himſelf. The peaceableneſs, the charity, the mutual love and zeal of promoting the welfare of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſo remarkable in the firſt Chriſtians, that we muſt needs confeſs they were acted by a Spirit beyond the World: this peace, and love and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is ſo eſſential to the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that our Saviour made it the <hi>badge</hi> and Character of his Diſciples,<note place="margin">John.</note> 
               <hi>hereby ſhall all men know that you are my diſciples, if ye love one another.</hi> It is the fulfilling of the Law, without it there is no acceſs for our Prayers. We are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, when we bring our <hi>gift to the Altar,</hi> to leave it there unoffered, until we are <hi>reconciled to our brother.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5.23, 24.25.</note> And we are directed by the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to <hi>lift up holy hands without wrath or doubting.</hi> In a word, <hi>the wiſdom that is from above is firſt pure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 3.17.</note> 
               <hi>then peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, eaſie to be intreated, full of mercy, and good fruits, without partiality, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

hypocriſie.</hi> And a little before he telleth us, that <hi>bitter envyings and ſtrife</hi> are the Companions of that <hi>wiſdom that is earthly, ſenſual and deviliſh.</hi> Nay, this Hatred and Enmity makes up the very nature of the Devil, and if you could divide him and his Malice, he were no more a Devil, nor oppoſite to God: for <hi>God is Love, and they that dwell in God dwell in Love</hi>; and the frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions of Love, in the firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>John,</hi> give us to underſtand, that the Love of God and his Neighbour did actuate and enliven his Soul to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt warmth and Charity.</p>
            <p>WHEN we look upon the Apoſtles in this interval between Chriſts Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the effuſion of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> before they proclaim'd (boldly and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly) <hi>the wonderful things of God</hi> in the <hi>name of Jeſus,</hi> before they came forth with diſplayed Banners againſt the Kingdom of darkneſs, then it was that their Unity did miraculouſly ſupport' them, and what degrees of chearfulneſs and courage were found in any of them, came ſeaſonably to the relief of every one upon all occaſions. Their Unity

firſt ſtrengthened their Prayers, they went up to Heaven as the Evening Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and with united force prevailed. The Prayers of thoſe Souls that are knit in Charity ſoon fly to the Ears of God, they are raiſed above the Skies on the wings of ſervent Love; the Devotions that are harmoniouſly poured forth on Earth, reſound with an <hi>Eccho</hi> in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, as if the Inhabitants of the upper and the lower World had begun al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the moſt intimate friendſhip and familiar Converſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THEIR Unity among themſelves filled their Souls with great Tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and though they were not yet actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inſpired as afterwards they were with the gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>; yet by their unanimity they were ſo prepared for them, and thirſted after them, as the parched and gaſping Earth thirſts for the ſhowers of the latter Rain.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THIS Unity had with it alſo ſome foretaſts of the joys of Heaven. Thoſe triumphant Spirits that are above are twiſted together in the mutual Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Love, it is their Element where
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:59505:201"/>
they move, it is the life of their Soul, they cannot live without it either here or hereafter,</p>
            <p n="4">4. THIS Unity diſpos'd the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the Diſciples to a clearer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the truths of the Kingdom of Heaven. Truth is the true nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Mind, and this Truth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not in its force and influence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Soul is firſt alienated from all harſh, rugged and ill-natured Paſſions; Proud and unmortified Men may make a great oſtentation of Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but the truth all this time is not ſucceſsfully united to the eſſence of the Mind, and the retirements of the Conſcience; though the words that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it to our Ears may be lodg'd in the memory and imagination; when we come to know the Truth in its divine energy and ſtrength, then <hi>are we made free from ſin, and hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtles locked themſelves up from the noiſe of the World, and felt thoſe inviſible ſupports of Faith and Love, when as yet they had not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59505:202"/>
enough to venture abroad, but U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity cannot long be preſerved without uniformity, and therefore they are ſaid not only to be <hi>of one accord,</hi> but alſo <hi>in one place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Order and Diſcipline of the Catholick Church into which we are received by Baptiſm, oblige not only to inward peace, but alſo to an outward <hi>Decorum,</hi> and viſible Uniformity. The Church in the language of <hi>Solomon</hi> is <hi>beautiful as Tirzah,</hi>

               <hi>comely as Jeruſalem, terrible as an Army with banners.</hi> The comprehenſive Apoſtolick Canon is, <hi>that all things be done with decency and in order</hi>; and therefore are we exhorted by the Author to the <hi>Hebrews, not to forſake the aſſembling of our ſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the manner of ſome is,</hi> i. e. We are not to erect Altar againſt Altar, but to continue in the Communion of the Chriſtian Church, obſerving thoſe Laws and Rules, by which the ſpiritual Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſts Family has been beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the times of greateſt danger and perſecution. If we cut our ſelves off from Chriſts myſtical Body, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences are fatal and dreadful.</p>

               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:59505:202"/>THE publick Worſhip of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary is Chriſts Trophy over his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; his Standard erected and ſet up in thoſe very places where the Devil had his Altars; are not his Oracles now ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced, and his Sacrifices deſerted, where our Saviour is acknowledged King and Sovereign?

Worſhip, and the uniform Meetings of Chriſts Family upon Earth by Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Mutiny, Tumult, Schiſm, or Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? Is it not ſad to conſider how implacably Schiſmaticks are ſet to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the peace and order of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary? 'Tis true (as we ſhall have occaſion to conſider within a little) <hi>the Holy Ghoſt came upon the Apoſtles in cloven tongues of fire,</hi> but all fiery Tongues are not from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> A Sect there is of unquiet and reſtleſs Spirits, who have no Principles but what tend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and though it be no part of my deſign or inclination to rake into that Puddle of little Cavils and Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that have been boiſterouſly vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the beauty and order of our National Church, yet I would offer to the conſideration of the meaneſt Hearer theſe four Particulars; and then let them declare their thoughts of the preſent Schiſm, and Wall of Partition, that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have rais'd between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. CONSIDER; that they and their Practices are diſclaim'd by all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches. With what face do
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:59505:203"/>
they alledge that they themſelves are the ſtricteſt Patrons of the Reformation, who have deſerted all other Churches, and by their Principles now think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to keep the Communion of any ſetled Church in <hi>Europe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. ARE they not Nonconformiſts to themſelves; Their former Confeſſions of Faith; and their Ringleaders, as well as to the preſent Church? the windings and turnings of Errour are infinite, it leads them to a thouſand abſurdities, it hath no ſolid Baſis to reſt upon, but the preſent <hi>craſis</hi> of the Imagination, and as that changes its Figure, the Errour ſhifts its appearance, and comes forth with further improvements. And yet ſuch is the unlucky fate of all Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, that after all their refinings and Reformations, they ſtill retain ſome one thing or other that baffles and confounds all their childiſh and whiffling Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt the Church. I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance but in one Particular, which to this day is practiſed by the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and that is, they appoint Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and ſuch as are moſt eminently ſcandalous to wear Sackcloth in their
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:59505:204"/>
publick Confeſſions and Humiliations, to ſignifie their deep, ſincere, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned remorſe and contrition. And is not this a ſignificant Ceremony? and of human appointment too? and in the publick Worſhip of God. Let them turn the batteries of all their Arguments (by which they endeavour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all the decent, and univerſally received uſages of the Church) againſt this their own practice and if after all they conclude their practice to be juſt and reaſonable, they muſt in the ſame breath infer, that all their former Arguments againſt Rites and Ceremonies (impos'd by lawful Eccleſiaſtical Authority) are all of them Nonſenſe and Enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WHAT was it that might have been ſaid to prove any order of Men ſchiſmatick from the firſt plantations of Chriſtianity, which may not with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon be levell'd againſt them? and what is it that can be pleaded in their Defence, that may not more plauſibly be alledged in behalf of the moſt noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Schiſmaticks, that are <hi>known</hi> to be ſuch in the publick Records of the Church? And</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:59505:204"/>4. IF we ſhould quit our ground and leave the Field open to their Pride and Vanity, can they (in that caſe) upon their own Principles, ſecure themſelves againſt infinite fractions and ſubdiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? But I remember this is not the thing I deſign to ſpeak to, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend Uniformity as the ligament of that inward Peace and true Order, that Chriſt deſign'd ſhould flouriſh in his Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. HERE I take notice of their Faith and Patience from the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they laid hold on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, until the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.<note place="margin">

And for this very reaſon was called <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Grot. in Loc.</hi>

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:59505:205"/>
manner. The former Law was proclaim'd by Earthquakes, Fire and Thunderclaps, Smoak and Terrour, that ſhook the courage of <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, as we are told by the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews:</hi> But the New Law by a Method more heavenly and myſterious, <hi>the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and demonſtration of the Spirit.</hi> The Goſpel appear'd with Light and Majeſty to revive, not to terrifie the World that was ſunk in corruption.</p>
            <p>ALL this time, I ſay, from the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to <hi>Pentecoſt</hi>; the Apoſtles waited for the accompliſhment of the Promiſe, by which we ſee their Patience and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken Conſtancy. The Miracles that our Saviour had wrought in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and his Reſurrection from the dead did arm them againſt all doubts of his Promiſe; they reſted ſecurely on his Word, and though they felt not as yet the accompliſhment of it, yet were they rais'd in their hopes to a certainty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all diffidence and Unbelief; if we then but conſider the Unity and compoſure of their Mind, the Beauty, Order, and Uniformity of their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Society; the patience and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:59505:205"/>
of their Faith, until the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was accompliſhed, we may eaſily perceive in what an excellent diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were in to receive the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in that plentiful meaſure, and for thoſe ends that it was deſign'd for. And now we go forward to Conſider,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE ſenſible Emblem of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> as it ſtruck upon two of their nobleſt and moſt perceptive Senſes, their <hi>hearing</hi> and their <hi>ſeeing</hi>; the one the ſenſe of Faith, the other the ſenſe of Love.</p>

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="384" facs="tcp:59505:206"/>1. CONSIDER the ſtrength, ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and loudneſs of this ſound; ſo loud, that the ſound of the Apoſtolical Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>went out into all the earth,</hi>

as the Chriſtian, which made the South and the North, Eaſt and Weſt meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in their acknowledgments of the Bleſſed Jeſus.

            </p>
            <p>THE Meditation of this ought to enlarge our Souls with generous inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards the recovery of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, unto the acknowledgment of the Truth. How ought we to pray, that <hi>God would be pleas'd to make his wayes known unto all ſorts and conditions of men, and his ſaving health unto all Nations.</hi> There are no Charities ſo noble, nor ſo well plac'd, as when we <hi>convert a ſinner from the error of his way.</hi> The Goſpel is a ſovereign remedy to remove the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtupidity of the whole World, if we were zealous enough to promote it; how ſhameful is it for ſuch as have large Dominions and great Power upon Earth, that they are not more buſied in contriving Methods, how the ſound of the Goſpel may reach the utmoſt ends
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:59505:208"/>
of the Earth? How few of them that are born without the incloſure of the Church come over to our Religion now a days? And this is not to be imputed to our Religion it ſelf, but to our cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and indifferency about it; and that we do not live up to the height and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of its Rules; the mighty ſucceſs that it had in the Primitive Ages, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of all malice and oppoſition, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proves that it came from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And this leads me to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the next word that follows.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT <hi>came from heaven.</hi> We are told by the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 135.7.</note> that <hi>God bringeth the wind out of his treaſuries</hi>; but this <hi>wind</hi> that <hi>came from heaven,</hi> hath a nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer claim to Gods peculiar Treaſury, than thoſe Winds that are ſtor'd up in the dark Caverns of the Earth. This was the breath of God, it did not blow from the Earth, nor from Humane Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, nor from the higheſt Regions of the Air, but from Heaven it ſelf, from the Throne of the Moſt High. A <hi>Wind</hi> it was that blew with Majeſty, rather than Fury; Strength rather than Boiſterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they felt ſome heavenly Charm in
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:59505:208"/>
the noiſe that filled the room; it rais'd their attention and their ears to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing high and extraordinary; and the ſurprize of its ſwiftneſs could not hinder a ſecret joy, a mighty elevation of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which cannot be named, and which ſtrongly convinc'd the Apoſtles, that <hi>this wind came from heaven</hi>; and that it was <hi>the mighty voice of God.</hi> And this may appear, if we conſider</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE things that they utter'd when they were filled with it. A heavenly Doctrine, full of Light and Majeſty; a Doctrine that not only aſſured us of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, but taught us alſo the infallible Methods to arrive at it; a Doctrine, that filled our ears with new, ſublime, unheard of Myſteries; <hi>God manifeſted in the Fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on in the World, received up into Glory.</hi> How far were theſe <hi>great</hi> Truths beyond the Speculations of <hi>Plato,</hi> and the little Metaphyſical Subtilties of the <hi>Peripateticks?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS may appear, if we conſider the Change and Affections that this Doctrine
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:59505:209"/>
wrought in its Proſelytes; this <hi>wind</hi> did not blow them up into airy and fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick apprehenſions, into proud and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious thoughts; it taught no arts of gathering treaſures, nor of making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves great in the World, but it lifted their Souls above it, to the place whence it came; and it taught them to trample upon its glories, to deſpiſe its fears, and overlook all its ſplendor, and to <hi>ſet their affections upon the things that are above,</hi> where <hi>Jeſus</hi> is inthroned in the higheſt Power and Majeſty. Now 'tis evident, that no ſuch change could be wrought by Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cauſes for men acted by Natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples can go no higher than ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims can carry them; but to love God, <hi>to crucifie the fleſh, with the affections and luſts thereof,</hi> to forgive injuries, to deſpiſe the World, &amp; all the things that our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites formerly did headlong run into, muſt proceed from ſome Supernatural and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine force; it carries us above our <hi>own</hi> level, and makes us to feel, that <hi>He that is in us, is greater than he that is in the world.</hi> This Argument is frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on by firſt Apologiſts for our Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="391" facs="tcp:59505:209"/>3. IT appears to have been from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in its Method and Operation, and <hi>immediate</hi> Effects upon the Apoſtles, which exceeded all Art and Nature, that men illiterate and without education, (moſt of them come to a conſiderable Age) that they ſhould ſpeak the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages of all Nations, who a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore underſtood but one Language, and that the rudeſt Dialect of their own Nation. This wonderful matter muſt needs be referr'd to ſome ſupernatural Cauſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. LET us take notice where this ſound was heard; and the Text ſaith, that it filled the houſe where they were. The Inſpirations of the Holy Ghoſt are not caſual and fortuitous, but ordered by Infinite Counſel and Wiſdom. This is the <hi>wind</hi> that <hi>bloweth where it liſteth</hi> in the ſtricteſt ſenſe; it filled that houſe,<note place="margin">John 3.8.</note> it blew by diſcretion and election upon the houſe where the Apoſtles reſided; to let us (it may be) underſtand, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to the end of the World, is to be received in the fellowſhip of the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors; it is the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:59505:210"/>
precious Ointment firſt poured upon their heads; and from them to the skirts of the Church in all Ages. There are many Spirits gone forth into the World with a boiſterous noiſe, and they pretend their deſcent from Heaven; but if they have forſaken the fellowſhip of the Apoſtles, and broken the ligaments of peace and order, by which the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, as a Spiritual Society is knit together; if they run croſs to the Spirit of Unity, by which we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to believe the Communion of Saints, in that caſe we are quickly unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, they are certainly from below; they are not directed by the Wiſdom that is from above; nor have they their riſe from Heaven, but from the Earth, and are blown up by ſome ſubterraneous Vapours, that end in nothing but in a little vain glory, faction and popular applauſe.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in its moſt plentiful Effuſions came down upon the Apoſtles according to the nature of their high and difficult employment, and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Church at that time, and it was to fall in leſſer drops to the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:59505:210"/>
end of the World upon all that are ſent by God for the ſervices of the Altar, who have their Miſſion from the Apoſtles by regular conveyance and ſucceſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. FROM what was heard, let us go forward to what was ſeen, and <hi>there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire,</hi> and ſat upon each of them. 1. There appeared Tongues.<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Biſh.</hi> Andr. Ser. in loc.</note> The Apoſtles that were formerly ſilent, had now their tongues loos'd, they lifted up their voice like Trumpets, and ſpake the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things of God, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes from all Nations that were now at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were aſtoniſh'd to hear the poor <hi>Galileans</hi> open up the profoundeſt Myſteries ſo readily and ſo ſucceſsfully; their Tongues as if they were cloven by the finger of God ſpake thoſe words that were like ſparks of fire in the Souls of men: now they appear'd to be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Diſciples of <hi>him who ſpake as never man ſpake;<note place="margin">Matth.</note> who taught as one having au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>; whoſe words did reach the Souls of men with life and force, and pierc'd between the Soul and the Spirit; between the joynts and the marrow. It was then true of the Apoſtles, what was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:59505:211"/>
ſaid by the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.2.</note> 
               <hi>Grace is poured into thy lips, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath bleſſed thee for ever.</hi> The ſtreams of their heavenly eloquence ran ſmoothly and fluently, in Myſteries, in Revelations, in Reproofs, in Directions, in Counſels, in Wiſdom, in Knowledge, in Purity; not exactly limned and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd by elaborate periods and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial dreſſes, but in the greateſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, mixt with the greateſt power, they deliver'd their meſſage; how boldly and how pertinently did they confute the ſlanders of Infidelity? With what cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage did they upbraid the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> with the Murder of the Lord of Life? Who among their Scribes, and their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedeſt Phariſees durſt encounter the Wiſdom of S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> when once filled with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt?</hi> How flat are Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſonings againſt the Wiſdom of God? How feeble, and how dull are all contrivances againſt the Council of the Almighty? And now the Apoſtles found the Prophecy concerning the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in a great meaſure verified in his Diſciples, <hi>The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the Learned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 50.4.</note> 
               <hi>that I ſhould know to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:59505:211"/>2. THOSE Tongues were cloven. There are ſome Tongues cloven by the Devil, that can nimbly ſhuffle themſelves into different figures, and are ſo accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately vers'd in the little arts of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, that you may come much ſooner to their meaning, when you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand every thing that they ſay in a contradictory ſenſe; than when you ſwallow it down in the literal meaning. S. <hi>James</hi> telleth us,<note place="margin">Jam. 3.9.</note> that <hi>with the ſame tongue we both bleſs God, and curſe man</hi>; but the Tongues of the Apoſtles were cloven for a more noble end, <hi>viz.</hi> that they might divide aright the Word of God unto all Nations under Heaven, <hi>Parthians, Medes, and Elamites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> 
               <hi>and the dwellers in Meſopotamia, in Judea, in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia, Pontus, Aſia, Phrygia and Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylia, ſtrangers of Rome, Jews, and Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, Cretes, and Arabians, all of them heard the Apoſtles in their own language ſpeak the wonderful things of God.</hi> The Church was no longer to be confin'd to the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> but <hi>from the riſing of the Sun, to the going down thereof,</hi> the Worſhip of the Living and true God was to be ſet up in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:59505:212"/>
without diſtinction of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 4.</note> So our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that <hi>the hour</hi> was <hi>come,</hi> when the Worſhip of the true God was neither confin'd to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor the <hi>Mountains of Samaria,</hi> but that <hi>he ſhould be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in Spirit and in Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. THOSE Tongues appear'd in the ſimilitude of Fire; the Tongues of the Apoſtles were fired from Heaven; and this is evident, whether we conſider, 1. The Heat of their Zeal; or, 2. The Light of their Doctrine; or, 3. The Force, Activity and Succeſs of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Vid. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. apud Grot. <hi>Mat. 3.2.</hi> &amp; in loc.</note>1. I SAY, View the Heat of their Zeal; what a flame was kindled by it in the hearts of other men? How did they crowd into the Church, when there was nothing to be gain'd by it but Death, Diſgrace and Martyrdom? What a change was wrought upon the Spirits of men by the Light of the Goſpel? How earneſtly and how vigorouſly did they ſerve God, when they firſt came over from Paganiſm and Superſtition? How joyfully did they take the ſpoiling
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:59505:212"/>
of their goods?<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> And with what courage did they offer themſelves before all Judges, Courts and Tribunals, to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed for the Name of <hi>Jeſus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Next to this, let us conſider the Light that is in it: now the World was convinc'd, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was the Light of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the higheſt ſenſe;<note place="margin">John.</note> that He was <hi>the light come down from heaven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke.</note> 
               <hi>and the day-ſtar from on high that viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us.</hi> How ſwiftly did Error, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Superſtition flee before him? When the Enemy of Mankind did bend all his forces to retard obſcure his Victories, the Light of the glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt broke through thoſe Clouds and appeared in its Meridian Splendor, maugre all oppoſition:<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.</note> 
               <hi>When the Sun ariſeth, then man goeth forth unto his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> and the Beaſts retire into their Dens; but when the <hi>Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> thus appear'd, the <hi>Demons</hi> that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly enſlav'd Mankind, were forced to retire. Their Idolatrous Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies were deſerted, and made to leave the field to the triumphant Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of our Bleſſed Saviour. This Light look'd men ſo broad in the face, that
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:59505:213"/>
they were aſham'd of their former folly and wickedneſs; they ſurrendered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves captives to its clear diſcoveries and illuminations: for its evidence was ſo ſtrong and undeniable.<note place="margin">Acts 26.18.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, that it was the main ſcope of their Commiſſion and Deſign, <hi>to open mens eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and inheritance among them that are sanctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. FIRE did reſemble the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> becauſe of its Force and Activity; and when we conſider the ſucceſs of their Miniſtry, we muſt acknowledge, that the Power of God was engag'd to ſecond their Commiſſion. Who can, without the deepeſt aſtoniſhment, and Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods infinite Wiſdom, think of the Atchievments of thoſe poor men? When we remember what it was that our <hi>Saviour</hi> commanded, and by what means they were to put his Commands into execution, and what oppoſition they ought in all reaſon to look for, if they attempted any ſuch thing, what was it then that he did command them?
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:59505:213"/>
No leſs than to <hi>go and teach all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; i. e.</hi> to renverſe the eſtabliſh'd Laws, Sacrifices and Cuſtoms of the whole World; to deſtroy the Worſhip of all falſe Gods, to introduce the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical <hi>Judaiſm</hi> in the room of the Literal, of which the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo obſtinately fond; to reform the manners of all Mankind; to teach them to live by new Principles, and in hopes of diſtant and unſeen rewards; to mortifie and ſubdue inveterate prejudices, and their ſtrongeſt inclinations; to run up the Hill againſt the force of Cuſtom, Law and Example. In a word, to make the moſt incredible Changes in the World by ſuch men as were moſt unlikely to bring them to paſs; Muſt rude and illiterate Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks grapple with the Rabbies and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers of Eaſt and Weſt? By what Armies, by what deep Contrivances muſt this Deſign be ſet on foot? How ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous is the very thought of it to a man that ſtands no higher, than on the level of Humane Maxims? Yet this Divine Fire in their Tongues burnt up and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd the Worſhip of the Devil, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc'd his moſt famous Oracles, and brought the whole World, in a manner,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:59505:214"/>
under new Laws; and as a rapid and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent flame devours combuſtible matter without mercy, without reſiſtance; ſo the Chriſtian Religion pulled down the Rites, Cuſtoms and Solemnities of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, even then when the Learning, Zeal and Power of all Mankind were engag'd to ſupport it. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer than men</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.25.</note> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> the moſt unlikely means, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by his aſſiſtance, produce the moſt wonderful and aſtoniſhing effects; the methods that ſeem comtemptible to humane eyes overcome the wiſeſt and the moſt ſubtile contrivances; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and weakeſt arrow in his quiver, the clowniſh Fiſhers of <hi>Gallilee,</hi> will baffle and confound all the Sons of Wit and Speculation; the moſt accurate amongſt them (who had been train'd from their infancy in the Arts of Sophiſtry and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence) ſtood mute and ſtupid before thoſe new Philoſophers, who came to diſcover unto us life and immortality. The Topicks and the Methods of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Schools were ſwept down like thin Cobwebs, when this true Light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd; their curious Schemes were all rejected, and a higher Doctrine than any
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:59505:214"/>
that was formerly taught, was eſtabliſh'd upon no lower Principles, than <hi>the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and demonſtration of the Spirit</hi>; the little knacks of the Philoſophers that conſiſted moſt in the ſhufflings and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Words and Phraſes, vaniſh'd like aery Phantoms, when Truth it ſelf in its Meridian Splendor inſpir'd thoſe frail men, can we attribute this their Victory to any thing ſhort of God himſelf?<note place="margin">Jer. 23 29.</note> 
               <hi>His word is like a fire, and as a hammer that breaketh the rocks in pieces.</hi> So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles forc'd their way through Rocks, and pierc'd to the Center of mens Souls, and gain'd <hi>to the obedience of Chriſt</hi> thoſe hearts, that one would think were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inacceſſible; they pulled down <hi>ſtrong holds and lofty imaginations,</hi> and by their ſwift and univerſal ſucceſs, at ſuch a Time, and againſt ſuch Mountains of Oppoſition, they gave the World to underſtand, that their Miſſion was from above. And here are the Trophies and Triumphs of Chriſtianity, the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Propagation of our Religion made it evident, that this Fire that came down upon the Apoſtles in <hi>Cloven Tongues,</hi> was not a flitting and vagrant Meteor, unfixt and moveable, but a ſolid and durable
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:59505:215"/>
Light, which was to continue in the Church until the conſummation of all things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. HERE we may conſider the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the Promiſe contain'd in the fourth Verſe. <hi>They were all filled with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> That the Apoſtles were inſpir'd by God, is beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; and they who impute their Progreſs in the Converſion of Nations, their Languages and Miracles, their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Reaſonings and Revelations to any ordinary Cauſe, ſubvert the Principles upon which our Religion ſtands. All Civiliz'd Nations ancient and modern do acknowledge the poſſibility of a Divine Revelation; nay, that it is reaſonable for Mankind to expect it in ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Caſes, and moſt people plead it in favours of ſome one Cuſtom or other received amongſt themſelves; and if all men agree in this, that it is reaſonable to look for it, and that by the ſtrength of Reaſon, we may diſtinguiſh a true <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> from what is counterfeit: What ſhould harden men againſt the Chriſtian Religion, for the miraculous Inſpiration which the Church commemorates this

Day, hath ſtampt upon it all the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Divinity that our Souls can think of, even when they examine things moſt calmly and accurately.</p>
            <p>LET us therefore thank Almighty God, that he gave us the higheſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of our Religion, that he made our hope ſo ſixt, that it cannot be bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; for when we read that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> came down upon the Apoſtles in this manner, we may conclude infallibly, that our Lord is not only riſen from the dead, but inveſted alſo with the higheſt Power at the right hand of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Gifts and magnificent Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that he ſcattered amongſt his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects when he enter'd into the Heavens, ſufficiently convince us, that <hi>all power in heaven and in earth is given unto him.</hi>

               <hi>and let us exalt his Name together.</hi> This Effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles, is ſo full a proof of his Victory, that now we lean on his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with the greateſt tranquillity and aſſurance: <hi>He hath ridden proſperouſly, becauſe of truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 45.</note> 
               <hi>and meekneſs, and righteouſneſs; his right hand hath taught him terrible things; the enemies of his Kingdom fall before him; he hath broken them as with a rod of iron; he hath daſht them in pieces, like a potters veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; he is eſtabliſhed for ever King in Zion.</hi> The meditation of this fills our hearts with joy and gladneſs, that our Redeemer, who is <hi>bone of our bone, and fleſh of our fleſh,</hi> hath trodden all our enemies under his feet. <hi>We have this hope as an anchor of the Soul both ſure and ſteadfaſt,</hi>

               <hi>and which entreth unto that within the Veil, whither the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner is for us entered, even Jeſus made an High Prieſt for ever, after the order of Melchizedeck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOR are we to think that becauſe now he is encircled with Glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that he can be unmindful of us no more than he was when he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd

with our Infirmities, and as he made good his Promiſe to the Apoſtles, and ſent upon them the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to plead his cauſe againſt Infidelity, ſo we may rely on his Word that <hi>he will raiſe us again unto life and immortality,</hi> tho our duſt ſtould mingle with all the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Atoms of the Creation,<note place="margin">Phil. 3 21.</note>

            <p>AND let us thank our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſo early ſtrengthen'd the hands of the Apoſtles againſt Infidelity and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm by ſuch plentiful effuſions of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the <hi>Cataracts</hi> of Heaven ſeem'd to be opened, and the Apoſtles were made to ſpeak with irreſiſtible

Wiſdom; and the ſame Spirit is given unto the Church (in proportionable meaſures as her neceſſities require) to the end of the World, eſpecially to the immediate Servants of the Sanctuary, if they do not wickedly ſhut their Eyes againſt its light and beauty. The <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the Church <hi>are of Needlework variegated</hi> with the manifold Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Spirit; the interchangeable appearances of thoſe gifts that in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Figures make up the <hi>decorum</hi> of the whole, were not ſo entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to the Primitive Ages, but that his more immediate Servants are furniſhed in all periods of the Church according to the nature and difficulty of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> He doth not give all gifts to every one, but parcels them out with that heavenly diſcretion, that no man may ſay to his Brtoher, <hi>I have no need of thee,</hi> therefore the Spirit of Love ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth his Donatives ſo as at once to ſupply our Neceſſities and advance our Charity, that all of us might hang upon one another in the cloſeſt Relations and dependencies; the myſtical Body of the Church being knit together by Joints, and Bands as is the Natural.</p>

            <p>THIS Pſalm is <hi>David</hi>'s Appeal to the Omniſcience of God as to his own Innocence and Integrity, and it ſeems tacitly to refer to the Calumnies and Slanders propagated againſt him during the Reign of <hi>Saul</hi>; and therefore he puts his truſt in the ſtrength of the Almighty, that

he ſhould never be ſhaken by the fury and malice of his Enemies.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Verſe</hi> that I have read is but a part of that Appeal; and though our Engliſh Verſion reads it in the <hi>future,</hi> yet the ſcope of the Context, the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and coherence of the whole al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the reading of it in the <note n="*" place="margin">Vid.

This is certain that the cuſtom of Waſhing before Sacrifices, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had this Moral in its boſom, that all our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to the Divine Majeſty (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially our moſt ſolemn and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary) ought to be performed with the moſt accurate Preparation, purity of Mind, and recollection of Spirit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pſalmiſt, as a part of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:59505:219"/>THESE words have in them no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable difficulty; they are a plain alluſion to that known Cuſtom of Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before Sacrificing, both amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> All the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations were very frequent in their Waſhings, eſpecially before they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached their moſt ſolemn and ſacred Myſteries; and therefore I may the more ſafely apply this Text to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Myſtery amongſt the Chriſtians, which is the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper,</hi> which now requires in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner our Attention and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>IT is in it ſelf by the confeſſion of all Chriſtians, the higheſt Myſtery of our Religion, nay all the Myſteries of it gathered together in one; and therefore all the Graces of the Spirit ought to adorn our Souls when we come ſo near unto God; they meet together at this Solemnity all of them in their higheſt ſlight and Exaltation.</p>

            <p n="1">1. LET us conſider our Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to attend this Solemn and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Entertainment; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more clear if we conſider the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of him who enjoins it. God upbraided his People of old, that the <hi>Nazarites</hi> were more careful and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the original Rules and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their founder, than his People were of his Laws who was the Creator of Heaven and Earth. All the Sects of Philoſophers up and down the World, thought it their honour and their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to propagate the Opinions of the firſt of their Order.</p>
            <p>AND will our deareſt Lord and Maſter give us a Command of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conſequence, and dare we refuſe to obey it? This is an indignity to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, an immediate affront to his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty and Power. How highly
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:59505:220"/>
would an earthly Prince reſent an injury of this nature? Here is a Feaſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red noble and plentiful, and deſign'd to expreſs the higheſt kindneſs and reſpect.<note place="margin">Prov. 9. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5. Matth. 22.

            <p>WHEN we remember who invites us to this Feaſt, the <hi>Author and finiſher of our Faith,</hi> whoſe <hi>dominion is from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting to everlaſting, who came from the boſom of the Father</hi> to reſcue us from the bottomleſs Abyſs of our miſeries; is it not the higheſt impudence, the rudeſt affront to the Majeſty of Heaven, the moſt daring violation of his Laws, to ſlight his Invitation? When we add to this the conſideration of thoſe things that are provided for us in this Feaſt, we may eaſily ſee the folly of ſlighting it; the pardon of our Sins is ſealed, the peace and tranquillity of our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are confirmed, our ſpiritual ſtrength and fortitude are recruited, and we are enabled to grapple with all our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies more ſucceſsfully; we are ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened

            </p>
            <p>ARE not we by our baptiſmal Vows already liſted under his Standard? Are not we confederated with him when we are received into the Chriſtian Church? How inconſiſtent is it with our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Allegiance to reject the offers of his Love, and trample under foot his moſt ſolemn Commands? This is treachery and perfidiouſneſs in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
            <p n="2">2. CONSIDER the circumſtances of his Love wherewith this Inſtitution was appointed. He lived with his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples for a conſiderable time in the full exerciſe of Patience, Meekneſs, and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. He gave them an Example that they ſhould follow his ſteps; He train'd them up by his Sermons and by his Miracles in the diſcipline and knowledg of his Kingdom and Scepter; He fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (to their own conviction) baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled the contradictions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and endeavour'd to remove their prejudices by all the Methods that the higheſt Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs thought proper for their cure. He proved himſelf to be
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:59505:221"/>
the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> by many infallible Signs, and now at laſt when he had run out the courſe of his publick Miniſtry, and ſolemnized the laſt Paſſeover; and was ready to offer himſelf a publick Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory Sacrifice for the ſins of the World; he appointed this Sacrament as the higheſt, the laſt, and the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Seal and Pledge of his Love to the Church, the Abſtract and Memorial of all that he did upon Earth, and of all that he taught, and of all that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the World to come, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of thoſe great and rich Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that are procured by his Death and Paſſion; when we remember, I ſay, ſuch a confluence of endearing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, how can we refuſe our preſence and obedience? How ſtrong are the Charms of his Love? What heighth of Courage, what degrees of Conſtancy were neceſſary to ſupport him againſt the ſhock of ſo many Affronts and Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Who can read the Hiſtory of his Paſſion, and not ſee the inconceivable condeſcenſions of God? Who can view the progreſs of that Tragedy and not be aſtoniſhed; when we conſider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Love of God, that <hi>he
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:59505:222"/>
who was God took upon him the form of a ſervant,</hi> with no other deſign than to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the work of our Redemption, and that he drew the Map of his life and ſufferings in this raviſhing Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that the Church might remember the glorious Adventures of his Love by this Euchariſtical Sacrifice, how mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous is the ingratitude, if we ſeem to neglect it.</p>
            <p>IN <hi>that Night wherein he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed,</hi> how Emphatick and how full of Love are theſe words, the fury of his Enemies, the rage and malice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the treachery of one of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, the faintneſs and weakneſs of all of them, could not ſo divert his thoughts, but that our greateſt concerns were next his very heart; and leſt we ſhould forget ſuch glorious things, he abridged the Hiſtory of all the Goſpel in this one plain Rite and Inſtitution. His Life and Doctrine, and all the proofs of our Religion he ſums up in one eaſie Ceremony; ſo that this Sacrament is the <hi>Compend</hi> of all Religion, the very Holy of Holies, and the top of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian joy and comfort; if we conſider
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:59505:222"/>
ſuch circumſtances ſo engaging, in the firſt Inſtitution of this Sacrament, we cannot refuſe our attendance if we break not thorough all the bonds of Piety and Humanity, and renverſe all the Laws of gratitude and good nature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE may eaſily diſcern our Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it from the practice of the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and the value put upon it by the whole Church. The Apoſtles and their Succeſſors for the firſt three hundred years were very frequent in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Sacrament, it was a part of their daily Worſhip, when the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtian Church was vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſervent; they could not live without the daily commemoration of the Love of Jeſus. This Sacrament was the moſt ſubſtantial and higheſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial that he left for the ſupport of the Church until his ſecond coming again; therefore the Chriſtians of all Ages look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it with ſo much veneration and regard, that as they judged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to come unto it, ſo they approached it with the ſtricteſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, with all the ſolemnities and care of Faſting, Prayer and Humility. The
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:59505:223"/>
univerſal deluge of Atheiſm and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that overflows the whole Iſland in which we live is much to be imputed to the contempt and neglect ot this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WE are obliged to this Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, becauſe it is the peculiar Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of Chriſtianity, the badge of our Religion, and the livery of the <hi>Crucified Jeſus.</hi> The Rites of all Religions had ſomething in them to diſtinguiſh both the Deity that was worſhipped, and the Votary from all others; The whole Syſtem of the Levitical Oeconomy was but a diſtinction of the <hi>Jews</hi> from all other Nations, and all the Rites of that ancient Law were either oppoſite to the <hi>Zabian</hi> Cuſtoms, or directly tended to preſerve them from Idolatry. The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> Sacrifices every where had ſome one ſignificant Ceremony or other by which they were diſtinguiſh'd from the Worſhip of other Idols, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by this <hi>Myſtery</hi> are ſeparated from the reſt of Mankind who are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>houſhold of Faith.</hi> This Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the Church is the moſt ſolemn of all our Myſteries, or rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:59505:223"/>
of all of them together, it hath no foundation in, nor directions from the light of Nature; and therefore it derives its dignity and obligation from the pure Inſtitution of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Hence it is that when Men are guilty of ſins againſt the Moral Law, their Conſciences do accuſe them, and the remembrance of their folly proves uneaſie to them; but they live in the wilful neglect of this Sacrament for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, and yet they are as quiet and undiſturbed in their omiſſions as if they were the moſt innocent; the reaſon is, becauſe natural Conſcience prompts not to it, it hath its <hi>original</hi> immediately from our Saviour's Authority, and this conſideration alone makes us inexcuſable if we neglect it, becauſe by it we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the reſt of mankind; it is ſo peculiar to our Religion, that we ſeem to renounce it, unleſs we ſhew the higheſt zeal for it and affection to it. <hi>Do it</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>in remembrance of me.</hi> There is no Order of Men have any ſuch Inſtitution; it is our <hi>Characteriſtick</hi>; that wherein we triumph; that wherewith we are reproach'd by the <hi>Pagans</hi>: that whereby we expreſs our love to our Bleſſed Saviour, and avow our ſelves to be his Diſciples in the face
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:59505:224"/>
of all danger and diſgrace. This very conſideration ſhould move us the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſince by it we expreſs the pureſt love and affection to his immediate Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Obedience; therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>by this we ſhew forth the Lords death till he come,</hi> i. e. we open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſplay it, we are not at all aſhamed of it, we flee unto it in our greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and at the hour of death as to our ſafeſt Sanctuary and Refuge. This is the ſtrong Tower that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends us from the wrath of God, the accuſations of Devils, and the remorſe of our own Conſciences. We are in this Sacrament to <hi>ſhew forth the Lords death,</hi> 1. To God, as our Atonement. 2. To Men, as our Profeſſion. 3. To De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.15, 16.</note> as our ſtrongeſt Refuge and Defiance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE ſhew it forth unto God as our Atonement. We come unto God the Father under the covert of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, <hi>Having therefore ſuch a high Prieſt, we may come boldly unto the Throne of Grace</hi>; a high Prieſt, <hi>who is holy, harmleſs, and undefiled to whom all power in Heaven and in Earth is given,</hi> who is now returned from the Grave victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and by his Blood makes Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:59505:224"/>
for us in the Holy of Holies; <hi>he lives for ever at the right hand of God</hi>; it is by this Blood and Sacrifice that we plead ſucceſsfully for mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. This is the argument that God himſelf cannot reſiſt (if urg'd by Faith and Charity.) Our Saviour is the great favourite of Heaven, and interpoſes in in all our neceſſities, we lean on the Merit of his Sacrifice as on the ſureſt Pillar of our hope and confidence; and therefore we come unto God by him as by our Surety and our Advocate, and <hi>if he gave us his Son, how ſhall he not with him alſo give us all things we need.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. WE ſhew it forth unto Men; we openly proclaim that we will not deſert his Standard, that we are not aſhamed of Chriſt crucified; that we are Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Croſs in the ſtricteſt ſenſe;<note place="margin">Matth. 5.16.</note> that we glory in it as our moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Character; that we are reſolved to <hi>Let</hi> our <hi>light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee our good works, and glorifie our Father which is in heaven</hi>; and not to deny him before Men either in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion or in our practices; for <hi>he that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the name of Jeſus muſt depart from all iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="422" facs="tcp:59505:225"/>3. WE ſhew forth his Death and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in open defiance of all the Powers of Hell,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.34, 35.</note> 
               <hi>Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.</hi> By the Death of Jeſus our mouths are opened unto Songs of Triumph and Defiance, and filled with joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the Devils may tremble unto fear and deſpair when they ſee us liſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Standard of ſo great a Captain, ſo famous a Warriour, ſo ſtedfaſt, and reſolute a Friend, <hi>who for us and for our Salvation came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> All their objections are ſilenced, we have our feet upon a Rock, and all the Armies of darkneſs cannot reach us; the Legions of Hell may cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their moſt terrible appearances, and tell over all the ſad ſtories of our miſcarriages, and aggravate them to the higheſt, and declare how often we have ſinned, and in what inſtances we have provoked the Majeſty of God, againſt what Light, what Reproofs, what Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations, and what checks of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience we have repelled, how long we
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:59505:225"/>
have neglected our repentance, and how much we have abuſed his Patience; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all theſe formidable accuſations, the Chriſtian hath one ſolid anſwer, and that is, the <hi>Death of Jeſus</hi> and his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant <hi>Reſurrection from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. OUR Obligation doth appear from the efficacy and excellency of this very Sacrament. It is the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt the frailties of our Nature, the frequent aſſaults of Temptation, and the wiles and ſtratagems of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. There is nothing diſcourages our Adverſaries more than when we reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely prepare our ſelves to receive the Holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper. It is the moſt ſovereign Remedy againſt our moſt habitual Vices, our moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Prejudices, our moſt ſtubborn evil Habits. It is the moſt ſignificant and ſenſible repreſentation of the Death and Paſſion of our Lord and Saviour; and therefore all the Graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit do meet in their vigour and exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at this Sacrament.<note place="margin">Cypr.</note> This made ſome of the Ancients admit ſuch as had fallen in the time of Perſecution ſooner to the peace and Communion of the Church,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:59505:226"/>
than their ordinary diſcipline did allow, becauſe there was a Perſecution ſhortly to follow; therefore it was not thought fit to leave ſo many deſtitute of ſo ſtrong a Cordial in time of danger, but were the rather admitted to this higheſt act of Communion, that they might be ſtrengthened againſt the next Encounter of the Enemy. When we remember how ſoon our higheſt zeal grows remiſs, our Devotion cold and flat, our Purpoſes wavering, our evil Habits grow ſtrong, and our Enemy gains ground of us, and the Spirit of God begins to withdraw from us, and we cannot tell how ſoon we may be judicially hardened againſt the moſt effectual Remedies of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: How great need have we then of ſuch a ſtrong Remedy againſt our faintneſs and wearineſs, to ſettle and confirm our reſolutions? to blow up our zeal into a bright and unquenchable flame? to make us <hi>one</hi> with Chriſt? to make us live no more the life of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but <hi>the life of the Faith of the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. OUR Obligation to <hi>frequent</hi> this Sacrament doth appear from the nature
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:59505:226"/>
of the Myſtery it ſelf: for it reſembles in its ſpiritual tendencies and deſign the Feaſt upon the remainders of the Sacrifice,<note place="margin">Vid. Dr. <hi>Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth.</hi>
               </note> by which Feaſt the Votaries did ſolemnly reſign themſelves to the ſervice and worſhip of that Deity, of whoſe Sacrifices they did eat.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16, &amp;c.</note> It is upon this ground that the Apoſtle proves the unlawfulneſs of Chriſtians going to the Idol-feaſts upon the invitation of their <hi>Pagan</hi> Friends: for by juſt interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuchſ as frequented the Idol-feaſts were by the ſolemnities of their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip oblig'd to adhere to the ſervice of that Idol, ſince they were <hi>partakers of the Altar of Idols,</hi> they had the moſt ſolemn <hi>fellowſhip with Devils</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle concludes, that they could not be <hi>partakers of the Lords table and of the table of Devils.</hi> When we come to this Sacrament we are in the ſtricteſt league and union with Jeſus Chriſt, and conſequently we proclaim to the World that we are entirely his, that we not only renounce all idolatrous Worſhip, but that we adhere to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and obedience with greater zeal and fidelity.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:59505:227"/>7. And laſtly, OUR Obligations do appear from the vanity and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of thoſe Excuſes that are ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretended to divert Men from this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. LET us conſider their Excuſes from their buſineſs and incumbrances, as if their worldly Affairs might engroſs their whole time.<note place="margin">Matth. 22.4, 5, 6.</note> 
               <note place="margin">Luke 14.18, 19, 20.</note> This is to contemn and deſpiſe all the glad Tidings of the Goſpel, to prefer their meaneſt things to their greateſt Concerns, to diſſemble with the Almighty, who knows that our time is not ſo narrow, but that we have leiſure to look after our Souls. But what do we gain by ſuch fooliſh and treacherous Excuſes? Can we hide the darkeſt retirements of our Soul from the Omniſcience of Heaven? Or is there any thing ſo directly oppoſite to the nature of God, as this perfidious Hypocriſie? It is true, <hi>We cannot ſerve God and Mammon</hi> both together, yet we may look after our worldly Buſineſs in ſubordination to our Souls; but if we muſt ſo ſerve our Mammon as to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Solemnities of Religion, we
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:59505:227"/>
then plainly make it our God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the hopes of Chriſtianity. I do not deny but that at ſome time or other a Man may be ſo entangled, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without extraordinary inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence give his attendance at the Lords Table: but when his buſineſs is made his ordinary excuſe, we may reaſonably preſume that he loves this World more than God, and the promiſes of another life, and conſequently that this World is the Idol which he worſhips with the ſtrength and activity of his Soul. Our Saviour lays down this Maxim, that <hi>where our hearts are, there our treaſure is alſo.</hi> Whatever the Object is that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours moſt of our time, and takes up our ſtrongeſt thoughts, deſires and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, that of neceſſity muſt be our God, ſince we beſtow upon it the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt adoration, love and eſteem. Let us not then ſo often excuſe our abſence by our wordly Affairs, leſt we ſhould come at length to ſay that there are no portions of our time due to God, nor to the thoughts of another life. But when we invite you to the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we do not perſuade you to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don your buſineſs for ever, that may
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:59505:228"/>
again return in its ſeaſon, and with the greater ſucceſs too, when you <hi>acknowledg God in all your ways,</hi> and are ſenſible that his Providence interpoſes in the meaneſt accidents of our life: Nay this pretended excuſe from the variety of our incumbrances is againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe of Mankind; for all Nations have allowed large portions of their time for their publick Devotion, and they reckoned that the more religious they were, by ſo much the more they proſpered.</p>
            <p n="2">2. SOME excuſe themſelves by the multitude of their Scruples, and that they cannot compoſe their Conſciences after their moſt ſerious endeavours. In that caſe they are obliged to go to their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Guides, who are ſent by God to inform their Conſciences to confirm their Faith, to clear and explain the nature of this Myſtery, and to direct them in all the ſteps of their approach towards it; we cannot then be excuſed by our Scruples when they might be removed in the regular Method of Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

And without all doubt unleſs they are ſincere and peremptory in their penitential reſolutions, they ought not to thruſt themſelves ſo near the preſence of the Almighty; but ſuch as are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the ſight of their ſins, and can appeal unto God that they deſire now at laſt to be freed from their burden, this Sacrament in its nature and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency is deſigned for them, for penitent and broken-hearted Sinners, for <hi>he came not to call the righteous but ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> The danger of receiving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily is very great, but the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of contemning and vilifying a plain Inſtitution of our Saviours, perhaps, is of an equal if not of more terrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. For they do nothing leſs than <hi>provoke the Lord to jealouſie,</hi> i. e. they ſet up other Gods to worſhip, and trample upon his moſt ſacred and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Inſtitutions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THEY excuſe themſelves from their hopes of after amendment and greater preparations; but this is the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:59505:229"/>
moſt pernicious ſubterfuge that can be invented. Our time runs away, our ſpiritual ſtrength is decayed, our Hearts are more and more hardened againſt the Goſpel; and is it ſafe for us under ſo many diſadvantages to delay our Cure one moment longer? <hi>Now while it is called to day harden not your hearts as in the provocation;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſalm 95.</note> and do not fright your ſelves from your Duty by ſuch idle and impertinent Excuſes; that becauſe your preparation is neceſſary, your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is excuſable. Such reaſonings are intolerable, we ought to conclude ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that becauſe our preſence is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible, therefore our preparation ought to be the more accurate and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. When we conſider the whole Affair more maturely, we may eaſily ſee that they who make light of the holy Sacrament ſeem to renounce their Baptiſm; ſince the Vows of Baptiſm are again reinforced and made ſtronger, and if we do not diſown them, why do not we gladly renew them?</p>
            <p>IN the ſecond place, I promiſed to direct your approaches to the Holy Table. All which may be ſumm'd up
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:59505:229"/>
in the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Let a man examine himſelf and ſo let him eat of this bread. for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf.</hi> Which laſt words the Apoſtle added not to keep us back from the Communion, but to make us more impartial, ſtrict, and accurate in our trial and preparation. It is groſs ſtupidity and ignorance to think that by ſhunning the Sacrament of the Lords Supper we may eſcape damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the very ſins in which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue unreform'd, and which indiſpoſe us for the Euchariſt, are the true cauſes of Damnation; there is no help then but to be rid of our ſins by the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous remorſe and Contrition, <hi>to ſearch and try our ways,</hi> and <hi>to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto God,</hi> in the uſe of all his holy Inſtitutions. And that I may direct you in this previous examination and trial; Let me adviſe you in the</p>
            <p>Firſt place, To retire for ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time where you may take your ſelf alone for the ſubject of your thoughts and reflections. Certainly this work cannot be perform'd in a hurry, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:59505:230"/>
a ſerious and ſober conſideration: the Memory muſt be employed to bring back our ſins to our preſent view: the Judgment to determine without fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy and diſguiſe what the ſtate of thy Soul is, and the Affections muſt be wrought upon ſuitably to our condition. Examination of <hi>ones</hi> ſelf is one of the moſt difficult undertakings, the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is intricate, and our Hearts are deceitful, and we are apt too often to extenuate the groſſeſt follies and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages by favourable and benign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations: therefore are we to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from the noiſe and clamour of the World, that our Souls may be clear and ſerene like thoſe Regions of the Air, that are above Storms and Tempeſts: where no Vapour, no Wind can enter: we are to apply the utmoſt ſtrength of our Souls to this one thing, and therefore we are to gather our thoughts into a reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected frame, and not ſuffer them to wander abroad until we have brought this Affair to ſome deſirable event.</p>
            <p>WE are to meet with God in the moſt comfortable and ſublime Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and to dreſs our Souls in their

We are to come to this Feaſt with pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and to arm our ſelves with the whole armour of God, and againſt every Limb of the body of Death. We are to ſet the pure Law of God before our Eyes, and faithfully to compare our actions with it, and do you think that this can be done by a ſuperficial glance? or can we renverſe ſo eaſily what is ſo deeply rooted in our Nature and frame: can we by the ſlighteſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt overturn the works of Satan?<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.14.</note> When we remember that we are to be judged for <hi>every ſecret thought,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>THE Grace of God cannot grow to any ripeneſs and perfection but in the Soul that is truly humble, and that ſenſibly feels it ſelf in the moſt deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute condition, unleſs our Saviour ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily interpoſe for our recovery, and there is no Method ſo proper to make us truly humble, as to ſee our ſelves without diſguiſe, naked, as in the ſight of God. When we are ſtript of our Excuſes, and artificial coverings, by which we endeavour to hide our ſelves from our Neighbours, then we ſee the vaſt diſtance that is between the pure Laws of our Religion, and our looſe, careleſs and diſordered lives. God is preſent with us at all times, and his Eyes pierce to the Center of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; Let us therefore go to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:59505:232"/>
of the Sore, and examine our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by that infallible Rule of his Word, and then we muſt condemn our ſelves in the moſt ſerious, and afflictive ſtrain of true remorſe and contrition; and therefore we find that the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saints have been moſt accurate and impartial, in cenſuring their own ſins and tranſgreſſions, they were more ingenuous than their moſt watchful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to aggravate their own follies.<note place="margin">Pſalm 73.21.22.</note>

            <p n="3">3. WE are to approach this Sacrament with ſtrong reſolutions at laſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on our ſins. Let us reaſon our ſelves out of our former idleneſs and ſloth; if we are truly griev'd for our ſins, we muſt break thorough the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Obſtacles that formerly kept us in bondage. Is there no ſtrength in this Sacrament to break thoſe Iron bars by which we are ſhut up under the power of our ſins? Are our bonds ſo ſtrong that they cannot be ſhaken off? Are our Appetites ſo violent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:59505:232"/>
that they cannot be reſiſted? Were not others encompaſſed with the ſame fleſh and infirmities, and yet happily made free? And ſhall <hi>we</hi> miſerably groan under the load of our ſins, even though we feel that they make us hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God? Nay, let us caſt our ſelves under the compaſſionate Eye of our bleſſed Lord and Maſter, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him, that he would let us feel the <hi>power of his Reſurrection</hi>; and break our Captivity, that he would let us know that <hi>He that is in us is ſtronger than He that is in the World</hi>; that his Wiſdom and Strength may interpoſe to help our weakneſs and folly; that He would gird his victorious <hi>Sword upon his thigh,</hi> and eradicate our evil Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits: <hi>Let God ariſe, and let his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be ſcattered,</hi> and fly before his preſence.

               <note place="margin">Phil. 1.6.</note> The goodneſs of God and the incomprehenſible Love of Jeſus are immovable Pillars of our Faith; and therefore we are to fill our Eyes with a proſpect of Mercy. He will not deal rigidly with us, neither will he upbraid us with our former guiltineſs, when we are proſtrate at his feet, when we plead with him by his boundleſs Compaſſion and the Abyſs of our miſeries. The <hi>Blood of Jeſus</hi> is the true Atonement, and <hi>propitiation for the ſins of the World</hi>; So reaſons the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9.13, 14, 15.</note> that <hi>the blood of Jeſus</hi> muſt be of (infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely) <hi>greater force than that of Bulls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heiſer; for he offered himſelf without ſpot unto God,</hi> and that through the <hi>eternal Spirit, and therefore he lives for ever to make interceſſion for us,</hi> and if we believe the ſufficiency and merit of his Sacrifice, we muſt alſo be perſuaded of the real effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of this Sacrament to convey the
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:59505:233"/>
Merits of Chriſts blood to every peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Communicant. This may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcern'd by its contrary influence on the prophane and impenitent; If <hi>he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation,</hi> then certainly it it muſt convey life, ſtrength, light and comfort to the truly penitent. Indeed, when we look narrowly to the nature of it, it is one of the ſureſt Pillars of our Faith; for <hi>this we do in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Death and Paſſion</hi>; and <hi>his blood that ſpeaketh better things than the blood of</hi> Abel, is ſtill of the ſame force and value with God. Let us not therefore entertain narrow Notions of the Almighty as if he delighted <hi>in the death of ſinners,</hi> as if he took pleaſure in their miſeries; for <hi>God is Love,</hi> and it is below his infinite Majeſty to cruſh to ruin and deſtruction ſuch as appeal to his Mercy. If thou hateſt thy ſins, if thou perceiveſt how vile they make thee, and how miſerable, if thou implore the goodneſs of God to deliver thee, thy freedom is already begun, and God will advance it into a full Victory.</p>

He is thought mean-ſpirited, low and abject that is ready to forgive an injury, yet it is the height of true Courage and Magnanimity, if we conſider the whole Scheme of our Religion, how much it is twiſted with meekneſs, gentleneſs, and charity; or the ſupreme Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, to whom <hi>Vengeance</hi> doth belong, our own in inward Peace and

Tranquility, or the order and ſettlement of publick Societies, we cannot refuſe to comply with our Saviour's directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 3.12, 13, 14.</note> and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands us, that as we deſire to approve our ſelves the <hi>Elect of God, holy and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that we put on bowels of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, long ſuffering, forbearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if any man have a quarrel againſt any,</hi> and that above all <hi>we put on Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which is the bond of perfectneſs.</hi> True and univerſal Charity is the great glory and perfection of our Religion, in which Chriſtians ought to outſhine all others. It is that by which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble our Father above, and prove our ſelves to be <hi>his off-ſpring</hi> in the higheſt and trueſt ſenſe.

               <p>THE firſt Sentence that I have read, is placed in the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpiece of the Office for the <hi>Burial of the Dead</hi>; the clear foreſight we have of our after ſubſiſtence, being the only, and the ſtrongeſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt the Terrors of Death, and the Solemnities of our Entrance into the Grave. What more proper to be told the <hi>Siſters of Lazarus,</hi> than that which rais'd their thoughts from the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth, to that State of Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Vigour, to which we ſhall arrive one day, when we ſhake off the Diſhonours of Weakneſs and Mortality. The Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> is the great Pillar of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> the Corner-ſtone of our <hi>Religion</hi>; our Hope is founded on <hi>it:</hi> and, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, our Belief without it is but one continued Fable and Impoſture. This alone hath in it the Strength and Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſcence of all Conſolation; and there is no remedy againſt our preſent Trouble,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:59505:239"/>
but to believe our condition ſhall be changed into a better. Humane Nature feels it ſelf relieved by no other thought, than the ſure proſpect of our happineſs to come: The wiſe ſayings and pretty knacks of the Philoſophers, who had no view of the Reſurrection, did avail but little to ſupport the Mind againſt Grief and Sorrow. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> concludes, <hi>that if in this life only we had hope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cor.</note> 
                  <hi>we were of all men the moſt miſerable.</hi> There was indeed a general Tradition of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul, that had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread Mankind; and ſo much we might gather from the Writings of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Seneca.</hi> But to believe, that the diſpers'd parts of a Mans Body ſhall be rang'd and diſpos'd into their true order and ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, after they have been ſcatter'd thorough all the Corners of the Earth, that they ſhall be reduc'd unto a temper fit to ſerve the Soul in all its Vital Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that thoſe Atoms ſhall be joyn'd to that Spirit from whom they have been ſeparated, <hi>was</hi> and <hi>is</hi> the peculiar Belief of the <hi>True Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE cannot think of our utter Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, without horror and amazement;
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:59505:240"/>
we are naturally enemies to <hi>Sadduciſm,</hi> and <hi>death</hi> in its ſtricteſt Notion. The moſt barbarous Nations have ſomething in their Rites and Religious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that carry their thoughts beyond the Grave.<note place="margin">Abitic, laetum, fera, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, feſtus abitionem anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui dicebant mortem. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Meurſium lib. de fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere, cap. 1.</hi>

               <p>IT is needleſs for me, or my deſign, to trouble you with the more accurate inquiry of the order and coherence of thoſe Words that I have read, either out of the Goſpel, or the Epiſtle, though we ſhould disjoin them from their neighbour places, yet they are entire in themſelves, full of light and comfort; <hi>Martha</hi> told our <hi>Saviour</hi> (her Faith now being almoſt overcome with Grief) <hi>that he was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in favour with God,</hi> and ſo probably might prevail with him, and obtain any thing he deſired: Our <hi>Saviour</hi> aſſures her, that her <hi>Brother ſhall riſe again</hi>; this puts ſome life into her expectations, and ſhe ſeemed artificially to wave what ſhe hoped; and did inſinuate that ſhe underſtood him of the general Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:59505:241"/>
But he quickly ſaw into the darkeſt receſſes of her mind, and told her plainly, that there was no neceſſity to let her thoughts fly ſo far off, as the general Reſurrection: He who was the firſt efficient cauſe of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the Author of Life, was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf preſent, and ſo might when he pleas'd raiſe his ſubjects and followers from the captivity and diſhonours of the Grave.</p>
               <p>FROM both the places that I have read, I invite your attention to Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, <hi>Firſt,</hi> On the Reſurrection of our <hi>Saviour, as the Author and finiſher of our Faith. Secondly,</hi> Our Reſurrection who believe in him. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Intereſt that we have in his purchaſe by our adherence to him, and dependence on him. <hi>He that believes on me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> THAT our <hi>Saviour</hi> did raiſe himſelf from the dead is certain, elſe our Religion is but a fable and a lying vanity. It is S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s own Inference to the <hi>Corinthians, If Chriſt be not riſen, then our faith is in vain, and we are yet
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:59505:242"/>
in our ſins.</hi> And ſo our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells the Diſciples,<note place="margin">Luke 24. v. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>that Chriſt muſt needs ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and riſe from the dead the third day.</hi> The Spirit of Prophecy did enlighten the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> and foretold the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, glories and triumphs of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>

All thoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions have the Reſurrection of our <hi>Saviour</hi> in their boſom, and without it they are nothing.

It was no wonder that the ſtoureſt Philoſophers amidſt all their ſpeculations, could not reaſon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into this compoſure of Spirit at the aproach of Death; for the ſtrength of all their Arguments was but of little value to calm the tempeſts and the fears that aroſe in their Breſts, when this Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Nature drew near them: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can allay thoſe commotions but the ſtedfaſt belief of the Reſurrection, and the hopes of Immortality. Then may we ſay in the language of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Yea, though I walk thorow the valley of
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:59505:247"/>
the ſhadow of death I will fear no evil, for thou art with me, thy rod and thy ſtaff they comfort me.</hi> And is not this enough to make thee quiet and reſigned, that thou art aſſured when thy Soul goes to the inviſible regions of Light and Purity, thy Body alſo (however ſcatter'd, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and diſpers'd) ſhall again be rejoyned to thy Spirit? And ought we to doubt of the Divine Power to accompliſh this? Since the forming of our Bodies in the Womb from ſo ſmall a beginning, unto ſuch a beautiful ſtructure, furniſhed with ſo many exact Proportions and Features, was no leſs the effect of Divine Power, than the raiſing it again when reduced to duſt and aſhes. How chearfully did the firſt Martyrs ſacrifice their Bodies for the love of <hi>Jeſus?</hi> The Executioners might divide Soul and Body, but they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy neither, they might cut, and pierce, and launce and throw their fleſh to the wild-beaſts, but ſtill they were within the Territories of their great Creator: And when the <hi>voice of the Arch-Angel ſounds, the dead</hi> are made to <hi>hear it,</hi> and the <hi>Sea</hi> muſt give an account of its dead; and the <hi>Earth</hi> muſt open her dark vaults and cayerns, and thruſt up her Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:59505:248"/>
to appear at the publick Rendeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouze of the Reſurrection, to receive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they have done in the Body.</p>
               <p>ARE we raiſed from the dead? We ought to treat the bodies of our dead with care and honour: All civiliz'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions agree in this, nor can there be a piece of greater barbariſm and inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than to deny the rites of Sepulture,<note place="margin">Vid.

Now the Earthly Tabernacle drags and pulls down the Soul to low and deſpicable Enjoyments; then, the Body is made ſtrong and refined to comply with the higheſt Capacities and Inclinations of the Mind.

               <p>HOW ſtrongly do we then feel our ſelves united to our true and immovable Happineſs, and aſſimilated to the Bleſſed Temper and Imployment of the Hoſts of Heaven, and the Spirits of <hi>juſt men made perfect.</hi> When inſtead of this load of clay, the uneaſie weight that holds our Spirits in Captivity,<note place="margin">2.

               <p>WE cannot expreſs the glory of the Body after the Reſurrection better than in the language of the Scripture. <hi>There is one glory of the Sun,</hi>

reaſon our ſelves out of our fear and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, to get above the terrour and the thought of our diſſolution, and ſtrengthen our ſelves in view of the Glory that is to come! Let us ſay in the words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi>

               <p n="5">5. But fifthly, THE belief of the Reſurrection arms us more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the terrours of Death.

               <p n="6">6.

When we form to our ſelves the moſt perfect Idea's of Valour, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and generoſity, then we have the beſt Notion of that great Soul that once lodged in that Tabernacle; All the Projects of his Mind were beyond the common Level.

He began to bear Arms when as yet he had not ſtrength enough to manage them, the vigour and alacrity of his Spirit out running the growth of his body; He then, when but a Child lodged no thought in his Breaſt but ſuch as were daring, great and difficult.

                     <hi>St.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews.</note> he gave all the proof of a docile and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Spirit far above any of his School-fellows: but his Mind (that always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd extraordinary Enterpriſes) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be weary of an unactive life. Then it was that he was made Captain in that Regiment that went to <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt the Rebels, under the Command of an <hi>old</hi> and <hi>experienced</hi>

for the greateſt actions. There are no words ſo proper for this period of his life, as thoſe we meet with in the life of <hi>Agricola,</hi>

               <p>AFTER this, <hi>General Drummond</hi> and all his Aſſociates became ſo odious to the prevailing Faction of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters,</hi> that (until the Mock-repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

He himſelf could not afterwards give an account of that conſternation that ſeized his Spirits; All that's black and terrible invaded his Soul at once, the moſt diſmal Paſſions ſtruggled within his Breaſt, confuſion and indignation poſſeſt his Heart, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the force of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the belief of Providence could have preſerved his Mind from ſinking. How can his great Soul but burſt forth into all expreſſions of Sadneſs, to ſee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous Villany lift up its head withy ſo much rage and inſolence, and defie the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and pull down his <hi>Image upon earth,</hi> and ſacrifice the <hi>beſt of Men,</hi> the <hi>beſt of Kings,</hi> to the fury and hypocriſie of the Rabble.</p>

All of them are evidences that the ſoreſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſters could not break his Spirit.

                  <pb n="486" facs="tcp:59505:258"/>THE <hi>Emperour of Ruſſia</hi> quickly took notice of him, and immediately he was made a <hi>Collonel,</hi> and ſoon after <hi>Lieutenant General</hi> of the Strangers.

But that was it he was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; He drew up his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Men behind ſome Shrubs which had a Marſh at each end of them, and planted the <hi>Swans feathers</hi> before them: The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Horſe came to aſſault them in that Poſt with extraordinary briskneſs, but were received with ſo much or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

To manage a Retreat with ſo ſmall a body of Men, in view, and upon the Noſe of ſo ſtrong an Enemy, was a proof of Conduct and Valour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to any thing that we meet with in Hiſtory.</p>

                  <hi>Dalyell</hi>; and how he behaved for twenty years after his return to his Country, the whole Nation knows, and Envy it ſelf (that ill natured Vice that ſullies the brighteſt Innocence) durſt never aſſault him plainly, and openly. For under the preſſure of the ſaddeſt diſadvantages, he never harbour'd one diſloyal thought: Such as had occaſioned his diſgrace with <hi>the late King</hi> never appeared above board, and ſuch of the great ones as might be ſuſpected to have whiſper'd againſt him plainly diſown'd it: And this Tranſient Cloud (blown up by the breath of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,) ſerved only to highten his honour and reputation; which makes me apply to him, what <hi>Tacitus</hi> hath of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly named <hi>Agricola: Suis virtutibus ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mul, vitiis aliorumque in ipſam gloriam praeceps agebatur.</hi> His Loyalty was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, as it was <hi>tryed more than ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen times in the fire of afflictions,</hi> it did not change with the mode and faſhion, it did not depend upon the <hi>Gazette,</hi> and <hi>News-Letters,</hi> but was immoveably found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the rules of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> 13. <hi>Not only for wrath but for Conſcience ſake.</hi> When the <hi>Prince</hi> is on the Throne, then multitudes of Men

offer their Services; but General <hi>Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s Loyalty did bide the teſt of all hardſhips and ſufferings. It was not gold and ſilver, ſoftneſs and plenty, luxury and eaſe that bore up his Spirits; but the rewards of a good Conſcience, long and cold Nights, bitter northen Froſts, and the murmurs of the River that runs by this houſe, together with the crowd of his uneaſie thoughts for ſome years made up his ordinary Bill of Fare: The Foxes and Connies became frequently his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and he had no other habitation than their Retreats amidſt Rocks and Deſarts, his love to his <hi>Prince</hi> took up his thoughts, his time and his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. And thus he lived, and thus he died, Praying for <hi>His preſent Majeſty</hi> with all the marks of Gratitude, true Zeal and Chriſtian Charity; So that I may truly apply to him the Character that <hi>Velleius Paterculus</hi> beſtows upon <hi>Lucius Emilius Paulus.</hi>

His advice was always temper'd with Prudence, Caution and Foreſight; he underſtood Mankind exactly, and the particular genius of this Nation, ſo, all his Counſels were even, calm and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, never ſurpriz'd or hurry'd unto any thing precipitate or indeliberate. No Man ever had the reſolution of a <hi>Great Captain,</hi> and the gravity of a <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> more happily contemper'd.</p>

WHAT need I mention his affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and candor, his charming, inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and pleaſant Converſation? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tempeſtuous, nothing rough, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſorderly in his Behaviour, he was of eaſie acceſs to all ranks of Men, and knew that Men in high Places can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live without their Inferiors. And if at any time his Anger broke forth into any appearances of Indignation, it was to chaſtiſe and drive from him what is baſe, unjuſt, ungentile, mean and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Will you conſider him in his more familiar Relations, as a Neighbour, as a Husband, as a Father, as a Friend, how amiable in all of them did he appear? Friendſhip ſeemed to be his very Element and his proper Air; And as none knew better how to make a choice, ſo none more ſtedfaſt to that ſacred tye. The laſt words he ſpoke diſtinctly, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Friendſhip to a Perſon of Quality,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Perth</hi> Lord High Chancellour of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

proper ſtandard of Vertue, fit for the imitation of the preſent Age, and the commendation of Poſterity. Would God there were but many ſuch in our Nation, who truly needed ſo little the artifice of Flattery, and deſpiſed it as much as our <hi>Deceaſed General.</hi>

               <p>BUT <hi>my Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> when I have ſaid this, if I had no more to ſay, perhaps I had ſaid nothing. All that is ſplendid and glorious in the Eye of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, is nothing in compare with the Spirit of true Religion. In all his Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and in all the different Occurrences and Periods of his Troubles, he had deep impreſſions of the Divinity. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in him was not an idle ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but broke forth and ſhined in all his Actions, his devotions to God were fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, ſincere and conſtant. The expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his Charity to his Neighbours were full of affection, love and ſincerity: He took his Characters of a Religious Man, not from the dreams and fooleries of Enthuſiaſm, but from the plain words of S. <hi>James, Who is a wiſe man and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with knowledge amongſt you? Let him ſhew out of a good converſation his

Let us follow him to his Death Bed, and ſee his behaviour there.</p>
               <p>BEING of a vigorous and cleanly Conſtitution, he lived to the Age of Seventy notwithſtanding of the conſtant fatigue of his Life: When he felt that his Diſeaſe was like to prove ſtubborn, and that it reſiſted the skill and care of the learnedſt Phyſicians, he ſent for a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and grave Divine of our Church,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris.</hi>
                  </note> with whom <hi>he took ſweet Counſel,</hi> how to order his Soul for its laſt flight to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World: And in this interval, gave all evidences of the greatneſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Spirit.</p>
               <p>ONE of the Phyſicians that waited on him, did with all modeſty and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion inſinuate that their endeavours
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:59505:264"/>
were like to have no ſucceſs; He received the news of Death with all compoſure and equality of Spirit, he never knew what fear meant, and he met the <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> not with that reſolute ſullen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtupidity, (that is ſometimes obſervable in the moſt profligate) but with all calmneſs and reſolution, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the ſtrength of Faith, the hopes of Immortality and the Majeſty of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion.</p>
               <p>THE frequent attacques of a lingring Diſeaſe had now brought him upon the coaſts of Eternity, he ordered his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affairs with that ſpeed and diſcretion that was always viſible in all his actions, he gave his Fatherly Advice and Bleſſing in the moſt Chriſtian and compoſed manner to his deareſt Relatives,<note place="margin">Viz. <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thallen</hi> &amp; his Lady.</note> and marks of his Favour and Bounty to all his Servants. And all this with that exactneſs of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and undiſturb'd Judgment that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attended him, he omitted nothing that was to be done: And then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched ſuch as were about him, <hi>in the Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to give him no more trouble about worldly Affairs, ſo be left the World in his Thoughts and
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:59505:264"/>
Meditations, and looked ſtedfaſtly to <hi>the things that are above,</hi> and by frequent flights and ejaculations to Heaven was looſed from the Body (from all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and concerns of it) before he left his earthly habitation. How weak are the ſtrongeſt Chains that tye us to the Earth, when we are thus illuminated, when we are near our heavenly Country, when the Soul begins to taſt of the <hi>rivers of pleaſure that are at Gods right hand?</hi> Then ſhe gathers together her ſpiritual Forces, and the World becomes ſo inſipid, that ſhe can reliſh nothing but the Fruits of <hi>the Tree of Life.</hi> O happy day! when we have run thorow the difficult ſtages of a weariſom World, we then can ſay in the Apoſtles Language, <hi>We know that if this our earthly houſe were broken down, we have houſes with God not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LET us enter into the Grave before we are carried thither, and from thence view the various toſſings of mens thoughts to ſcramble together the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt pieces of the Earth, how ſoon do the glories of it vaniſh into a ſhadow, and the painted nothings that we fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:59505:265"/>
admire are found empty and unſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Are thoſe the things we are to hunt after? Are we made for them?

Upon this occaſion, we are to lift our Eyes from the <hi>Coffin</hi> where his earthly remains are laid, to the place and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and employment of his <hi>Soul,</hi> where we ſhall be cloathed with Light as the Angels of God and encompaſſed with the beams of Glory, where we ſhall have the <hi>palms of victory put into our hands, crowns upon our heads,</hi> and in our mouths <hi>the ſongs of the bleſſed</hi>; where we ſhall ſit with the <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> when we enter the City of Peace and of everlaſting Reſt in the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi> How can we but ſigh and groan for our deliverance from our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Bondage? When ſhall we be ſet at

liberty from Corruption and Vanity, and ſatisfi'd with his Divine Likneſs, when we ſhall for ever ſolemnize the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptials of the Lamb, and behold <hi>God face to face,</hi> and ſhall be changed unto his Glorious Image, when we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Company of thoſe Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims that fly round about the Throne, and ſing to all Ages of Eternity, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> Does not the view of this Glory overcome our Spirits, and diſengage us from the Earth? Why ſhould the trifling intereſts of vanity ingroſs our thoughts, and the little apparitions and dreams of the Earth enchant us? O Chriſtians think more frequently of your Country and of the incomprehenſible Love of God, that <hi>ſent his Son to redeem you</hi>; of the whole ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of that excellent Religion, of the excellency of our own Souls, and <hi>the light of his Countenance that is better than Life.</hi> Let us ſteal frequently out of the hurry and noiſe and impertinence of our little buſineſs, unto thoſe Regions of Light, and Peace, and Purity, <hi>unto Mount Zion,</hi>
