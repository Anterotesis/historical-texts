            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THESE Words are a Caution given by our Blessed Saviour to his Disciples, to have a Care what Persons They admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be their <hi>Guides,</hi> and <hi>Instructors,</hi> in <hi>things pertaining to Religion.</hi> That They should not blindly follow Every One who should pretend to lead Them, but should first diligently prove, and Examine them: And know whether They were indeed the <hi>true Ministers of Christ</hi>; Or whether they were not rather <hi>False-Prophets,</hi> whose design was not to instruct, but to deceive; <hi>Beware of</hi> False-Prophets, <hi>which come to you in</hi> Sheeps-Cloathing, <hi>but inwardly they are</hi> Rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Wolves: <hi>Ye shall know them by their Fruits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my Discourse upon which Words, I shall</p>
            <p n="1">I. Endeavour to Give you a clear account of the true <hi>Meaning</hi> of our Saviour in Them. And having done this, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:107487:3"/>II. To shew you what <hi>Vse</hi> We ought to make of them.</p>
            <p n="1">(1<hi>st.</hi>) In General; with Relation to all such as shall at any time pretend to <hi>Preach the Gospel</hi> of Christ to us.</p>
            <p n="2">(2dly.) In particular; As they may be more immediately applied to the Subject, and Solemnity, of this day.</p>
            <p>And, I. Let us Enquire, what is the true <hi>Meaning</hi> of that <hi>Caution,</hi> which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour here Gave to his Disciples: <hi>Beware of False-Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order whereunto, I shall distinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these two Things:</p>
            <p n="1">1st. Who They were whom our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Represent to them, under the Name, and Character, of <hi>False Prophets?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. What those <hi>Fruits</hi> are, by which He directed them to discover, and to avoid Them.</p>
            <p n="1">1st. As for the former of these, The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whom our Saviour here design'd to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to his Disciples, under the Name, and Character of <hi>False Prophets</hi>; They may be reduced to these two kinds: Either, 1<hi>st,</hi> Such as shou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d pretend to set up themselves as Men <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> in an <hi>Extraordinary-Manner</hi> to Reveal hi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Will to Mankind, tho' indeed They were never <hi>Sent by Him</hi>: Or, 2<hi>dly,</hi> Such as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107487:3"/>
should pretend only to <hi>teach,</hi> and <hi>expound</hi> the <hi>Common Doctrine of Christ</hi>; but yet under the colour of that, should deliver their own Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; and so <hi>Preach Themselves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv 5.</note> 
               <hi>and not the Lord Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Former</hi> of these, Our Saviour spake to his Disciples <hi>Mat.</hi> xxiv. 11, 24. When He told Them, That <hi>False Christs, and False-Prophets should arise, and should deceive many:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mark</hi> xiii. 22.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore warn'd Them not to be Deluded by them.</p>
            <p>Of the latter kind are all Those who in the several Ages of the Church, have Preached in the Name, and pretended to deliver only that Pure Doctrine of Christ, which was deliver'd by Him to his Apostles; and by them Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Church; but yet have mingled their <hi>Own Errours</hi> together with it: And by means thereof have brought in <hi>Damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 1. Scandalous to Christianity, and dangerous to the Souls of all Those who have unhappily suffer'd Themselves to be mis-led by Them.<note place="margin">

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Now that Those of this latter kind, no less than those of the foregoing, are truly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the Name, and Character, of <hi>False-Prophets,</hi> the language of the <hi>New Testament</hi> will not suffer Us to doubt.

               </note> than to be a Publisher of such Things as were before unknown; and, for the Confirmation of which, He who did so, was therefore to be, in an Extraordinary manner, both Commissioned, and Inspired by God.</p>
            <p>The truth is, tho' the former of these Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of the Word <hi>Prophet,</hi> was the more Common under the <hi>Old Testament</hi>; when such kind of Persons were wont to be frequently sent by God to Mankind; yet this latter seems to be the more proper, and standing import of it, under the <hi>New.</hi> And the additional Character which is here Given to those of whom our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour spake, that they should come in <hi>Sheeps-Cloathing,</hi> that is to say, under the Habit, and Appearance of Disciples; in the Name of Christ, and as Pastors of his Flock; plainly shews that They were not to be the Publishers of any new Doctrine; but to pretend, at least, to Teach that Old-Religion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb</hi> xiii. 20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> v. 4.</note> which our Blessed Lord, the Great <hi>Shepherd</hi> of <hi>the Sheep,</hi> once for all, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to the Saints. <hi>Jude</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>So that however then I would not exclude the other signification of the Word <hi>Prophet</hi> from having been, in part, intended by our Saviour, in the Caution before us; And according to which, it is certainly our duty to <hi>Beware of False-Prophets</hi>; that is to say, of such as shall Go

about to Preach a <hi>new Religion, totally different from that</hi> of the Gospel; (which was, in Effect,<note place="margin">

               </note> the Case of some of the most Early Hereticks, in the first Ages after Christ; and of that Great Impostor <hi>Mahomet</hi> afterwards:) Yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but look upon the more General Design of our Blessed Lord to have been, to Caution us against those, of whom we have commonly more need to <hi>Beware</hi>; I mean, The <hi>Ordinary Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Gospel.</hi> And concerning whom it is without Controversy our Duty, and should be our Care too, to take heed that We do not suffer our selves to be mis-led by Them: Whilst instead of delivering to Us the pure Doctrine of Christ, they teach only their own Inventions; and, by so doing, both corrupt our Faith, and (without Gods Infinite mercy,) Expose Us to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Ruine and Destruction.</p>
            <p>And this may suffice to shew, who the <hi>False-Prophets</hi> are, of whom our Lord in the <hi>Text,</hi> Requires us to <hi>Beware.</hi> Let us consider,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. By what <hi>Marks</hi> we may <hi>Discover,</hi> and so be enabled to <hi>Avoid</hi> them.</p>
            <p>Now the Rule laid down by our Saviour in order hereunto, and again Repeated by him, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. is this; <hi>Ye shall know them by their Fruits.</hi> And those may be of <hi>two kinds</hi>: Either, 1st. The <hi>Doctrine</hi> which they Preach, and would Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose on those to whom they deliver it, for the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107487:5"/>
True Doctrine of Christ; Whether with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Manners</hi>; to what we are to <hi>Believe,</hi> or what we are to <hi>Do,</hi> in obedience to his Gospel. Or, 2dly, By their <hi>Fruits,</hi> we may Understand, the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of their <hi>Doctrine</hi> on the Minds, and Consciences, of those who are Guided by Them; and the natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency which it has, either to promote that Piety which our Saviour came into the World to teach; or to lead men into any Wickedness contrary thereunto.</p>
            <p>These are the <hi>Fruits</hi> by which we may judge what the <hi>Prophet</hi> is who comes to us; Whether He be indeed a <hi>True-Prophet,</hi> and as such to be received by us; Or whether He be only a <hi>Woolf in Sheeps-cloathing,</hi> and of whom we are therefore to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware. And from all which we may now lay down these <hi>Three Rules,</hi> as containing the summ of our Saviour's Advice to Us, with relation to this Matter.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi>; If such a <hi>Prophet</hi> shall deliver this False-Doctrine, (whether in the business of <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Manners</hi>) not of his Own Motion, but as Commission'd by some <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Society of Men, calling themselves a Church,</hi> so to do; Then that <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Society of Men,</hi> which do's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission him, must be look'd upon to be a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,</hi> and <hi>Erroneus Church</hi>; and be no less avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Us than He who is so Sent, or Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n'd by it.</p>
            <p>And thus have I endeavour'd to give you a clear Account, of the <hi>direction</hi> of our Blessed Saviour in the Words before Us: I Go on now to the Use I proposed.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To make of this Caution; (1<hi>st.</hi>) In Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; as it respects <hi>All</hi> Those who shall, at any time, Pretend to be our <hi>Guides</hi> in <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi>: And, (2<hi>dly.</hi>) In parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; As it may be, in a more especial manner, Applied to the Solemnity of this Day.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:107487:6"/>(1<hi>st.</hi>) Of the General Use we are to make of this <hi>Caution</hi>; As it respects All Those who shall, at any time, pretend to be our <hi>Guides</hi> in <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here, 1<hi>st.</hi> If it be Our duty to <hi>Beware of False-Prophets</hi>; and if the way of Discovering of them be, To <hi>Know Them by their Fruits</hi>; that is, as I have now shewn, by the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which They Teach, and the <hi>Practises</hi> which They allow of; then it must follow, That it is not only lawful for Us, but our Duty, in Obedience to this Command, to Examine the Doctrine which our <hi>Spiritual Guides</hi> propose to Us; And to Compare it with that of Christ, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: And either to receive them as true, and lawfull Pastors, if what they Teach be Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereunto; Or else to reject them as <hi>False-Prophets,</hi> if it shall appear to be Otherwise. And indeed, However some, the better to maintain their usurped Authority over the Consciences of Men, have set up another Method; and told Us, that the <hi>Prophet</hi> is to Give Credit and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> not the <hi>Doctrine</hi> to the <hi>Prophet</hi>; And, in consequence thereof, have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Men to Examine what is deliver'd by Them, and made them Believe that it is sufficient that They have it from such hands as can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mistake Themselves, nor Mis-lead Others: Yet not only our Reason directs us to a contrary
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107487:6"/>
Procedure, but the Holy Scriptures themselves every where exhort Us to <hi>Examine</hi> what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to Us; And not take any thing, at all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, in a matter of such Vast concern, as it must needs be to Us, to be <hi>Guided a-right</hi> in those things which regard the Glory of God, and the Salvation of our Immortal Souls.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that we are commanded, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Not to <hi>Believe every Spirit, but to Try the Spirits whether they are of God; Because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> False-Prophets <hi>are gone out into the World,</hi> Jo. iv. 1. At other times, to <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> Jo. v. 39. And of <hi>Our selves to judge the things that are right,</hi> Luke xii. 57. And as for what concerns the Authority of any man, or <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Men,</hi> to the contrary; are told by <hi>St. Paul, Gal.</hi> 1.9. <hi>That tho' They</hi> (the Apostles of Christ) <hi>Or an</hi> Angel <hi>from Heaven should preach any other Gospel unto Vs, than that which We have received, They should be Accursed.</hi> And if an <hi>Angel from Heaven,</hi> or an <hi>Apostle</hi> should he rise from the dead, and preach to Us, must not be received any farther than what He delivers shall appear to be agreeable to the Gospel of Christ; much less ought We not either without all Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Receive, or against the plain Authority of <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> to submit to, the Pretensions of Designing Men; Who the more they set up their <hi>Own Infallibility,</hi> and decline the Tryal of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107487:7"/>
               <hi>God's Word,</hi> the more ought they to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected by Us; and the more narrowly to be enquired into, that We be not deceived by them.</p>
            <p>But, 2<hi>dly.</hi> Since our Saviour deliver'd the <hi>Caution</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> not to his <hi>Apostles</hi> only, but to the whole Company of his <hi>Disciples</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 1. <hi>Luk.</hi> vi. 17.20.</note> to all Those who came to him, and offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be Instructed by Him; it will follow farther, That this Right of <hi>Examining</hi> what is proposed to Us, in <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> is not any special Privilege of the Pastors, or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church; but is the Common Right, and Duty, of All Christians whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: Who as they are All concern'd to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in what they Believe and Practise, in such Cases as these; so are they All required, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto,<note place="margin">11 <hi>Thess.</hi> v. 21. 11 <hi>Jo.</hi> iv. 1.</note> to <hi>Beware of False Prophets,</hi> and to <hi>Try them by their Fruits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this may serve yet farther to shew the little regard we are to give to their Pretences who tell Us, that the Judgment of these Things belongs only to the <hi>Church</hi>; that is, as some of them interpret it, to the <hi>Pope,</hi> as successor of <hi>St. Peter,</hi> and if (we will believe them) <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>: As others understand it; to the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Chief Pastours</hi> of the Church; And to Them not separately, and alone, but conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together into a <hi>Synod</hi>; And that, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107487:7"/>
not in any Particular Church; but in the Catholick; to Them, or Their Deputies, lawfully met together, in a <hi>General Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For tho' it is not to be doubted, but that what is fairly debated, and orderly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon, in such an Assembly; (where it is fully Assembled, and permitted freely to judge, and determine, according to the Holy Scriptures;) must needs be of more Authority; and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may be more sure, than what is resolved by Every single Christian apart: Yet, when all is done, as every particular Person is to Answer to God for his Own Soul, so he must Examine, as far as He is Able, both <hi>What He Believes</hi> and <hi>How He Practises</hi>; and upon <hi>What Grounds</hi> he do's Both; And not follow any <hi>Assembly,</hi> tho' of never so much Seeming Authority, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that which is of much Greater Authority than any <hi>Humane Assembly</hi> whatsoever can be, I mean, The <hi>Word of God.</hi> And it may as well be said that all the other Parts of Christian Piety, delivered by our Saviour,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> v, vi, vii,</note> in these Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, belong not to Single Persons, or to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Christians at all, but only to the whole Church, or at least, to the Pastors and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of it; as that this Command of <hi>taking heed of False Prophets,</hi> and of <hi>Knowing them by their Fruits,</hi> is the Business of Such only, and not the duty of every Private Person.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:107487:8"/>But, 3<hi>dly;</hi> and to conclude these General Reflections. If such be the case, that it is not only lawfull for, but the Duty of, every Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> and to Examine what is Proposed to him; and to satisfie himself Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the true Doctrine of Christ or no: Then it will follow farther, That if upon such a Proof of what is tender'd to Us by any <hi>Person,</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> whatsoever, we should chance to be clearly, and evidently convinced, that they have departed Themselves, and would draw away Us, from the pure Faith of Christ, deliver'd to Us in the Holy Scriptures; it is our duty to take heed that we do not follow them in their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy; but resolve rather to forsake <hi>Them,</hi> than to abandon that <hi>Gospel,</hi> which both They, and We, are commanded to adhere unto.</p>
            <p>That it is possible for Men either by Interest to be Corrupted; by Prejudices to be byass'd; or thro' Infirmity to be deceived; and by any, or all of these Means, to fall away from the Purity of the Christian truth; both the <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Humane Nature</hi> assures us; and the very <hi>Caution</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> do's evidently sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>That by a Careful Attention, and diligent Enquiry into the Doctrine deliverd to Us in the Holy Scriptures, we may be able to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver when they do so; and to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107487:8"/>
Truth, and Falsehood; Right and Wrong, as to these matters; not only our Saviour's Command to do this; but the plainness where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with most of those things are delivered, which make up the summ of what is necessary for us to Believe, and Do, in order to our salvation, Effectually shew.</p>
            <p>But then to what purpose should we trouble our selves to <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> and to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand our Religion, and to know that we are dealt fraudulently with, by our <hi>Guides,</hi> in it; if after all, there is no Remedy: But we must follow our <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Pastors</hi> of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they teach Us the true doctrine of Christ; or whether they lead Us into Damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, destructive of the very Fundamentals of it.</p>
            <p>And yet how Confidently do some Men here also, rise up against Us: And tell Us, that we must Believe them before our <hi>Own Reason</hi>; nay, and (in effect) before <hi>God</hi> Himself? That 'tis <hi>Schism,</hi> and <hi>Heresie,</hi> and I know not what besides, to doubt of, or differ with them, in any thing that they require us to Believe. And that much better were it for us to shut our eyes altogether, and Go on blindfold under their Conduct; than to follow the clearest Light that <hi>Scripture, Reason,</hi> or even <hi>Sense</hi> it self, can Give us, in Opposition to their Errors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:107487:9"/>But let them assume what Authority they please to themselves, and raise what Clamours they can against us; When all is done, this Conclusion will remain firm as Heaven, and clear as any first principle of <hi>Science</hi>; that if the <hi>Scriptures</hi> be,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> xv. 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19</note> as we all agree that they are, <hi>the Word of God</hi>; and were written for our Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; then we must follow the Conduct of Them: And hold fast to the Truth which they deliver, tho' not only a Company of assuming Men, calling Themselves the Church, (but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what Grounds, no body could ever learn,) and pretending to Infallibility; (in Despight of the Grossest Errors;) but the whole World should conspire together, to Oppose Us in it.</p>
            <p>And thus have I shewn you, what that <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vse</hi> is, that we ought all of Us to make, of this Command of our Saviour, to <hi>Beware of False-Prophets</hi>; and, to <hi>Know them by their Fruits.</hi> I proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">(2<hi>dly</hi>) To that more <hi>particular Application</hi> which I proposed to make of it, to the Subject of this Days Solemnity.</p>
            <p>I shall not need to tell you, that we are now met together to Bless God for those wonderful <hi>Deliverances,</hi> which He has twice afforded Us of this <hi>Nation</hi> upon <hi>this</hi> very <hi>Day,</hi> from the Designs of Those who are the professed <hi>Enemies</hi> of our <hi>Religion</hi>; and who have never Ceased, from the

first Beginning of the <hi>Reformation</hi> among Us, to do what in them lies to subvert <hi>That,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy Us, upon the account of it.</p>
            <p>But of all the measures that were Ever taken by them in order thereunto, never was there any more Remarkable than that which was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have been Executed on <hi>this Day</hi>; had not God, by a miracle of his Providence, discovered, and disappointed it.</p>
            <p>A Design it was, so Black, and Horrid, that we find many among Themselves ashamed to own it. And therefore, They either altogether deny that there was ever any such <hi>Plot</hi> carried on by Those of their Communion: Or else, pretend,<note rend="inter">Papists Apology, <hi>p.</hi> 31.

            <p>And here then let us stop, and not proceed to any following Instances of their Cruelty, and Perfidiousness: But from what has been already alledged, both of their <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> as to these Matters; Go on, finally to Consider, Whether such <hi>Principles,</hi> and such <hi>Actions,</hi> can ever be Reconciled, either with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Rules</hi> of Christianity. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1st. Let them tell Us, if they can, where in all the Scriptures of the New-Testament, either the Title, or Promises of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> are appropriated to the <hi>Roman Church</hi>; or indeed to any other <hi>Particular Church,</hi> or <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> whatsoever: Or what Reason can be given for that Fundamental Arrogance, on which All the best of their Pretences are built, why <hi>They,</hi> any more than <hi>We,</hi> should be Called, or Accounted, <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Catholick Church upon Earth</hi>?</p>
            <p>The Truth is, it is a Contradiction in terms, for either of Us to Assume to our selves such a Character. The <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> is the <hi>Whole Church</hi>; of which every <hi>Particular Church,</hi> (as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c.) are Parts. And to say that any <hi>One</hi> of These, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive to <hi>All Others,</hi> is the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107487:16"/>
to say, that a <hi>Part</hi> is the <hi>Whole</hi>; which, I think, is as plain a Contradiction as can well be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Any.</p>
            <p>Nay, but what if the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> be so far from being the <hi>Catholick,</hi> or <hi>Vniversal Church,</hi> that it is not so much as <hi>A Catholick,</hi> that is, any <hi>Sound,</hi> or <hi>Orthodox Part</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>? Let me not be thought, to speak any thing with a design to Raise in your Minds a wrong Notion against any: But for the sake of Truth, and out of the Concern which I have for your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, I must freely declare; that, after the best Examination I have been able to make into her Principles, and Constitution; I do, in my Conscience, believe the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> as it is at present Established, in Matters of <hi>Faith, Worship, Morals,</hi> and <hi>Government</hi>; to be by far the most Corrupted of any Christian Church, that I know of, in the World; and in which <hi>Salvation</hi> can the <hi>most hardly,</hi> if at all, be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. But</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Were the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> all that she pretends to be; and <hi>Our Church</hi> all that ever it has been call'd by it: Yet how comes this to Give them a <hi>Civil Authority</hi> over Us? <hi>Christ</hi> med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled not with Mens <hi>Temporal Interests</hi>: He taught no Doctrines of Cruelty and Uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness. He <hi>Founded</hi> no <hi>Dominion</hi> in <hi>Grace</hi>: Nor ever Pretended to <hi>Depose Kings,</hi> and <hi>Give
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107487:16"/>
away Kingdoms.</hi> On the contrary, We know, How He would not so much as Arbitrate in a private Controversie: <hi>Luke</hi> xii. 14. But declared freely, that <hi>His Kingdom</hi> was not of <hi>this World; Jo.</hi> xviii. 36. Nor were his Disciples to Expect any thing beyond Other Men, except it were Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Losses, and Persecutions in it. <hi>Mat.</hi> x. <hi>Luke</hi> ix. 23. <hi>Jo.</hi> xv. 20. xvi. 2. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Hence we read that when upon the account of his Adherence to the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> (which was plainly a <hi>Religious Concern)</hi> a Certain Village of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> deny'd Him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Humanity of a Nights Lodging; and some of his Disciples were so Hot upon it, as to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire Him to Revenge Himself by <hi>Fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> for the Affront; All the Answer They got was this Reproof, which One would have thought might alone have been sufficient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer all these kind of Pretensions for ever, That <hi>They knew not what manner of Spirit they were of; Luke</hi> ix. 55. <hi>For,</hi> says He, <hi>the Son of Man came not to destroy Mens lives, but to save them.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Our Saviour Christ, has not only no where encouraged any Proceedings of this kind, but Has every where delivered such Doctrines, as are utterly Irreconcileable with Them. That <hi>We must be Subject to Principalities and Powers, and Obey Magistrates. Tit.</hi> iii. 1. That we must do this, <hi>not only for Wrath, but also for Conscience
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107487:17"/>
sake: Rom.</hi> xiii. 5. That We must <hi>Love our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>; Must <hi>Bless them that curse Vs; Do Good to them that hate Vs; and Pray for them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightfully use Vs, and Persecute Vs. Mat.</hi> v. 44. That We must not <hi>Avenge our selves</hi>; but <hi>leave</hi> that <hi>to Him, of whom it is written, Vengeance is mine, I will Repay saith the LORD. Rom.</hi> xii. 19. <hi>That we must not Root up the Tares before the Time,</hi> but <hi>suffer them to Grow till the Harvest; and that the Separation shall be made by God, and not then by Vs. Mat.</hi> xiii. 29, 30. That we must <hi>bear with Those who are Weak in the Faith; Must In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct Them in Meekness</hi>; and Endeavour to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Them from the Error of their Way, that they may be Saved. Rom.</hi> xv, 1. <hi>Galat.</hi> vi. 1. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> v. 14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 24, 25, 26. <hi>Jam.</hi> v. 19·</p>
            <p>These are the Doctrines of the Gospel: And accordingly we know how our Religion Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the World, not by <hi>Doing,</hi> but by <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</hi> Not by <hi>disturbing Kingdoms,</hi> and <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of Governments</hi>; but by patiently <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting</hi> to all the <hi>Evil</hi> that the <hi>Rage of Men,</hi> or <hi>Malice</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> could bring upon the Professors of it.</p>
            <p>And when this is so, what can we conclude but that certainly either the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> have given Us a very wrong Account of the Doctrine of Christ; and that neither the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> nor Those who were Instructed by them,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107487:17"/>
Understood their <hi>Own Rights,</hi> and what <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> their <hi>Ecclesiastical Character</hi> Gave them over <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Countries</hi>; (at least in Order to <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>:) Or that, if they did, then these Men in <hi>Teaching,</hi> and <hi>Acting</hi> as they do, in these Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, must have utterly departed from the Truth of Christianity; and have only the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Prophets</hi>; the <hi>Cloathing</hi> of <hi>Sheep</hi>; whilst in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity they are <hi>Ravening Woolves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which being thus Resolved, I do not see what other Conclusion we can draw from these Premises, than that which our Saviour, in the <hi>Text,</hi> Recommends to Us; which is, To <hi>Beware of Them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed so we have all the Reason in the World to be, whether We consider our Souls, or Bodies; The <hi>Interests of this present Life,</hi> or the <hi>Hope of that which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, <hi>First,</hi> As to the <hi>Concern</hi> of our <hi>Future State</hi>; If it be possible for any Errors to <hi>destroy Salvation,</hi> which are not Expresly Contrary to the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi>; tho' in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Consequence of them, They do plainly Overthrow the Chiefest of them; Then I am perswaded that the <hi>Errors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> will, of all Others, be found the most likely so to do.</p>
            <p>And, for the <hi>Other Thing</hi> mentioned, our <hi>Present Interests</hi>; How far they must be affected by the
