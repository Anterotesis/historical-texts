            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Have thought good to publiſh at this time, this Anſwer of Mr. Dury's to Mr. <hi>Salt-marſh,</hi> though written ſome years ago, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year <hi>1646.</hi> becauſe it may be now happily more ſeaſonable, then when he firſt did Penne it. It was not publiſhed then, becauſe ſome other Anſwers were then put forth, which did ſeem to give ſatisfaction to the multitude, though they were not written ſo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npartially, and with that moderation of Spirit: But ſeeing the times ſeem to be now ripened for ſome kind of Settlement, and the inconveniencie of the Delay, which Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> did then plead for, is more fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered then was then fore-ſeen; hence perhaps it may fall out, that the way of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprejudicate Orderlineſs, which is here held forth, may be

thought worth ſome due Conſideration amongſt the Churches, and by Gods bleſſing may prove ſome help to ſuch as are willing to Aſſociate themſelves without any pretence to Worldly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to impoſe the ſame upon others, but onely to make uſe amongſt themſelves of Goſpell-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for mutuall Edification. Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> did then ſtumble at the pretence of Power to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Churches of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Way, with Authority over others, which perhaps might be in the thoughts of ſome Miniſters; but I ſuppoſe it is now evident, that none do any more affect any ſuch Dominion over their Neighbours as he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; yet that there ought to be ſome Orderly Way of Government in the Societies of Saints, which are the Houſe of God, I ſuppoſe will be without all diſpute; and how far that may be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled amongſt the Saints, and approved by a State, this Treatiſe will in ſome meaſure I hope mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. And that Mr. <hi>Duryes</hi> meaning may not be miſtaken, as if he would have the Magiſtrate to impoſe by Humane Authority, the Ordinances of Chriſt, which he counts ſuch, and ſuffer none to have liberty but ſuch as practiſe the Way which he approves: I have added unto this Treatiſe, a Diſcourſe which the Author ſent unto me upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

            <p>YOu know you can command the diſcovery of my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all things, which have any reference to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Truth, and the Counſels of Peace. Therefore although Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> his Pamphlet is ſcarce worth the Anſwer, yet I ſhall not leave your deſire unanſwered, ſo far as my poor Talent can be uſeful in this kind, and time will permit. Some ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Conſciences (as theſe times are) may be ſtaggered with his Suggeſtions: and there is a Method of Error in that way of ſtarting matters which he has followed, fit to ſeduce and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle the ignorant, and ſuch as are partially prepoſſeſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Brethren; and yet he perhaps himſelfe without any ſet purpoſe may be unawares led into it; for a deceived heart doth turn men aſide, that they cannot deliver their own ſouls. Sure I am he is full of prejudicate thoughts, and by reaſon of the ſame hath loſt his true Aime, and the way of Reſolving his own Querie. For he that makes a Querie, ſhould at leaſt ſeem to make a doubt thereof, and then endeavour either to ſhew, or to ſeek the way how to reſolve it without partiality. But Mr. <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſh</hi> ſeems not to intend any ſuch thing; becauſe his whole Diſcourſe is framed onely to raiſe doubts in the weaker, and not to crave the opinion of any, or to receive the reſolution of his Querie from the Wiſer. Perhaps ſome good opinion of his own Sufficiency, (ſure is was no fear of inſufficiency) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine ſo weighty a matter, hath made him thus forward to perſwade the continuance of our Unſettlement in Government. But I ſuppoſe his ingenuity may be ſuch, that although he made at firſt no doubt of determining his Querie; yet his Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thereof may be made upon after thoughts doubtfull to himſelf. Therefore I ſhall endeavour as briefly as may be, to let you ſee how a Doubt of this nature ſhould be reſolved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:41545:4"/>But before I enter upon this Taske, I would deſire him (if I were acquainted with him) to Anſwer a Queſtion, whereby he would perhaps clear a doubt of mine, touching his Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity in handling this Querie; which when I have done, I ſhall tell you how I purpoſe to proceed in Anſwering it.</p>
            <p>My Queſtion is, Wherefore in the place of the Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8. (quoted in his Title Page) he hath changed the words of the Text, putting in ſtead of <hi>Edification,</hi> the word <hi>Inſtruction</hi>? There is no likelihood that this is a fault of the Printer; or if it had been his fault, that it would have been left uncorrected, the words being ſo much different. But every one that readeth Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> his Diſcourſe, and taketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his Aime, will eaſily find that the one word is purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put for the other, to foreſtall the mind of the unwarie and ſimple Reader, by whom Quotations are not examined, with a Notion as from the Word of God, which may prepare him to receive without ſcruple that which he intends afterward to inſinuate and deliver. Namely that it is fit the Miniſteriall Charge ſhould be reſtrained by the Civill power onely to Teaching. If this be not his aime, I would pray him to let me know ingenuouſly how the alteration doth come? But if he had this ſubtilty in his Aime, as a man may ſuſpect he had; then I muſt tell him ingenuouſly, that I wonder he durſt do ſo, not onely in a matter of ſuch conſequence, but chiefly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Word of God. I ſay again, I wounder he ſhould dare to do ſo in reſpect of the Charge which the Apoſtle gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him, <hi>To hold faſt the form of ſound words delivered unto him,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.13. For if this be his practiſe to alter the ſound words of the Spirit, I would tell him that in ſo doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he doth make his firſt words of his Title Page to be found falſ; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he doth pretend the advancement of Truth and Peace. For if he dare preſume to corrupt the Word of God, for the eaſier Introduction of ſome opinion of his own; what Truth can we find to be in him? or what Peace can he expect from any that perceiveth this deceitfull dealing, and how will he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it to God, that ſaith, <hi>Add thou not to his Word, leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a lyar,</hi> Prov. 30.6. He that doth alledge the Word falſely, will have no great care to divide it
<pb facs="tcp:41545:5"/>
rightly, and apply it truly. I ſpeak this upon a ſuppoſall, which I would have him to take away, by ſhewing how the Word of the Text comes to be Changed. For I rejoyce not in iniquity, but in the Truth as Charity doth command me to do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.6.</p>
            <p>Now I will tell you how I purpoſe to proceed in Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Querie, if God permit.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I will reflect upon the Queſtion in it ſelf, as a matter of ſerious Deliberation, which may be conſidered for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Truth and Peace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I intend to reflect upon the Queſtion, as he doth handle it, to obſerve what Truth is in his Deciſion, and how farre the Way which he doth ſuggeſt, is like to produce Peace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I will endeavour by Gods Aſſiſtance, to ſughe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, I conceive that by the word <hi>Church,</hi> is meant a certain number of Souls called out of the world to be Saints; and joyned together in the true profeſſion of Chriſtianity. Or thus: The Church is the Company of Souls, as they are Chriſts ſubjects in the world.</p>
            <p>I reflect here upon Men as ſouls, not excluding their bodies; becauſe the ſoul is the immediate ſubject upon which Chriſt doth work; and becauſe men as they are bodies and have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtates, are properly the immediate ſubjects upon which worldly Kingdoms work. Yet I do not deny but ſouls are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in ſome kind ſubjected to Superior Powers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. but that is onely in relation to the bodily life which they have: and ſo are Bodies in like manner ſubjects unto Chriſt; namely in reſpect of that ſpiritual life whereby they are acted through their ſouls. So we ſee that one and the ſame perſon is two wayes in ſubjection: one way to Chriſt, another way to the Civill Magiſtrate; and if the diſtinction of this two-fold ſubjection be rightly underſtood, and the true foundation thereof cleared, many doubts otherwiſe inſoluble will eaſily be decided concerning the limits and joynt conſiſtence of the Civil &amp; Eccleſiaſtical Powers. For as the Soul doth relate the Body in ſpirituall matters, ſo doth Chriſts power in the Church relate to the ſubjects of a State: and as the Body doth relate to the Soul in outward matters, ſo doth the Civill Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41545:6"/>
relate to the Church of Chriſt, that is to Men as they are his ſubjects. The properties of theſe relations will determine the Spheres of theſe Powers, according to the extent of the influence of their vertue each upon other; and according to the ſubordination of their ends unto the happineſſe unto the Whole.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I conceive by that which is called Government in General, that is meant the right ordering and guiding of Subjects in the courſe of their life towards the proper end thereof; and conſequently by Church-Government in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, I muſt conceive the right ordering and guiding of mens ſouls by Chriſts power in the courſe of their ſpirituall life, tending to ſettle them in a perpetuall communion of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with God the Father and Himſelf.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By the Kingdome I underſtand the ſociety of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh men, as they are united in their outward life under the Government and Laws which are ſettled for their Peace and Safety therein.</p>
            <p>Now when the Queſtion is of a Church-Government over this Kingdome; the meaning is of a Government that ſhould be ſettled in and throughout the Kingdome, namely in all the Churches thereof; and not over and above the Authority and Power of the Kingdome. For as the Soul is not properly over the Body, but in it, and this not under the Soul, but united to it, and both are in the ſame perſon: ſo we may conceive of the Church and Kingdome; that as the Kingdome is a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Society, the Church is not over it, nor it under the Church, but both are united together in one Chriſtian State; as the life of the ſoul by the Spirit; and of the Body by the outward ſenſes, are in one and the ſame Man. Thus then the words are to be underſtood in reſpect of the matter of the Queſtion; in reſpect of the Scope or Thing queſtioned, we muſt alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what is is meant by a <hi>Settlement,</hi> and by a <hi>haſty</hi> ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by that which is called <hi>fitneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conceive that by a Settlement is meant here, an Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Determination of all things belonging to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Souls, as they are to be practiſed throughout the Churches of this Kingdome: ſo that in caſe of diſobedience, ſuch as are refractory againſt that determination, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41545:7"/>
the publique Peace by diſorderly walking, ſhall be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuffer what the Power of the State ſhall inflict upon them.</p>
            <p>By the haſtineſſe of this Settlement, I conceive is meant, not any raſh or unadviſed ſpeed; but the ſuddenneſſe of that determination without further delayes, proceeding from debatements and deliberations concerning the ſame.</p>
            <p>And by the fitneſſe of ſuch a Settlement, I ſuppoſe is meant the conveniency, and uſefulneſſe of the thing, for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good both of Church and State, and the private bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of ſouls therein.</p>
            <p>As for the limitations added to theſe parts of the Querie, I wiſh they had been more plainly ſet down, for I doubt of his meaning therein; but that You and He may not doubt of Mine, I will declare it; that if I take not His aright, He may (if he think good) rectifie my miſtake.</p>
            <p>I conceive then by that which he doth call, <hi>Power commonly deſired in the hands of the Miniſters</hi>; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t he doth mean the way of Judicature in Church-Matters, as the Aſſembly hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it to be ſettled in this Kingdome; of which that he may have a right Character (for I doubt he is miſtaken, and not rightly informed of the way.) I will tell you briefly, that it is a Power of Order and Diſcipline in the Houſe of God; that this Power is not in the Perſons, and hands of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters alone; but in the Office of the Elderſhip, wherein the Miniſter is the leader of the reſt: that this Elderſhip is made up of Men, gifted, and freely choſen to and for the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation by the Brethren, and appointed with the Miniſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r over all matters of Church-concernment. That their Office and the Power belonging to it, is not otherwiſe deſired in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, then as the word of God doth warrant it to be practiſed, and the example of the beſt Reformed Churches hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be practicable.</p>
            <p>By all which you ſee that I muſt underſtand his Querie, as concerning the matter thereof thus. Namely that the thing whereof he doth ſpeak, is concerning the ordering and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of ſpirituall matters belonging to the ſouls of men, which by Chriſts power over his ſubjects, is to be executed in the Office of the Elderſhip, according to the Scriptures; to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41545:7"/>
bring the Congregation of Saints to a perpetuall communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, which is their happineſſe.</p>
            <p>Of this thing he doth make a doubt; Whether it be fit ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to ſettle it in this Kingdome or no? But the doubt is not abſolutely of the thing in it ſelf; (for who will call that in queſtion?) but of the fitneſſe in reſpect of the limitation annexed, which is to be determined according to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of true Religion and State.</p>
            <p>It had been worth his labour to have made a deſcription of thoſe Principles, that we ſhould not miſtake him in the main matter whereby he would have us to regulate our thoughts in the deciſion of the doubt: for except He and I underſtand one another in the ſame Principles of Religion and State, we ſhall never be able to ſquare out the concluſion of fitneſſe or unfitneſſe after the ſame proportion: for if he meaſure not his cloth by the ſame ell which I have; or I by that which he hath, He and I ſhall never agree in the length and bredth thereof. I'l then tell you my thoughts, which if he reject not, we may come to agree in.</p>
            <p>By Religion, I underſtand a tie whereby the Conſcience is bound to ſubject the ſoul to God in his true worſhip.</p>
            <p>This tie of Conſcience is made up of a Three-fold Coard, which cannot be broken or untwiſted without the overthrow of the ſubſtance of Religion.</p>
            <p>The firſt is the Doctrine of Truth; by this the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is bound to know God, and believe him.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is the practiſe of Godlineſſe; by this the Will and Affections are bound to love God, and yeeld themſelves to him in obedience.</p>
            <p>The third is the Confeſſion and Profeſſion of both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer before Men. By this the whole Man in his bodily ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is made a living and acceptable ſacrifice unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1.</p>
            <p>The two firſt Coards are twiſted together in one by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, when he ſtyleth his Apoſtleſhip a ſervice of God, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Faith of his Elect, and the acknowledging of the Truth after Godlineſſe,</hi> Tit. 1.1. Where we may obſerve how theſe things lie together. 1. The Apoſtle is Gods ſervant for his Elects ſake; namely to bring them by the Preaching of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41545:8"/>
Goſpell, to the obedience of Faith, as he expreſſeth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5. &amp; 16.26. 2ly. His preaching doth this by the propoſall of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which i after Godlineſſe; and this Truth when it is acknowledged, begetteth Faith. 3ly. Obſerve the cennexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this acknowledgement with Godlineſſe, to be this; that it is not onely inſeparable from it, but that the Truth beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Faith, is meaſured by Godlineſſe, and commenſurable to it. So that as nothing is to be counted Godlineſſe, which doth not proceed from the acknowledgement of Gods Truth; ſo nothing is to be counted a Truth begetting Faith, without the practiſe of Godlineſſe. But when Gods Spirit doth twiſt both theſe together upon the conſcience of the Elect, then the obedience of Faith is begotten in them, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name of our Chriſtian Religion, as it is inwardly before God in the heart: whereunto if the outward profeſion or confeſſion of the mouth before Men, be joyned, which is the third Coard of this tie; then Religion is fully compleated in the whole man. And this third Coard is joyned by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle unto the two former, as a means no leſſe neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation then they. This you have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9, 10, 11. where ſpeaking of the ſumme and ſubſtance of our Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he ſaith thus. <hi>If thou confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved: for with the heart man believeth unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto ſalvation: for the Seripture ſaith, whoſoever believeth on him ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſhall not be aſhamed in two reſpects: Firſt in reſpect of the event and effect of his Faith, that without fail ſalvation promiſed ſhall follow upon it, and he ſhall not be fruſtrate of his expectation. Secondly, In reſpect of the duty by which his Faith is to be operative towards ſalvation, namely by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the truth of his Faith and Obedience: for if he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this Truth wherein Chriſt doth reveal himſelf unto him, and be aſhamed of Chriſt; then Chriſt will deny him before his Father, and be aſhamed of him alſo, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8 38. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.33.</p>
            <p>Theſe three things then make up the Truth of Religion; and except all three be taken together, the tie of ſubjection unto God is not compleat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:41545:8"/>Thus I have told you as briefly as I could, what I mean by true Religion; now we come to the Notion of Principles.</p>
            <p>By the Principles of Religion and State, I ſuppoſe he doth mean the fundamentall Maximes, Poſitions, and Rules of Doctrine and Practiſe, upon which Chriſtianitie is grounded; and whereupon the peace and proſperity of the Common-Wealth is ſettled.</p>
            <p>Now what theſe Principles are, by which the whole point of doubt is to be determined, he ſaies nothing expreſly to any purpoſe, but onely inſinuates the matter ſuſpiciouſly; and as it ſeems to me for little inſtruction or edification.</p>
            <p>I muſt then let you know, that the Principles of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt needs be Three-fold, according to the three tyes of Conſcience hereafter mentioned; namely Principles of Truth in Doctrine: Principles of Practiſe in Godlineſſe; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Principles of our publique Profeſſion of both theſe.</p>
            <p>The Principles that are fundamentall in Doctrine, are all ſuch Truths and Poſitions which bear a Character of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, or are ſpecially recommended to our Faith, as matters of great importance; as that of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Without controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie great is the myſterie of Godlineſſe: God was manifeſted in the fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit &amp;c.</hi> And that of 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that Jeſus Chriſt of the ſeed of</hi> David, <hi>was raiſed from the dead according to my Goſpell,</hi> and ſuch like, which may have a two-fold Character of Fundamentality, either by ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words declaring their abſolute neceſſity; as when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Verily, verily, except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of God</hi>; or by the importance of the matter in it ſelf; though without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation thereof in the expreſſion; as when it is ſaid, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17.</note> it might be inferred from the innate proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of juſtice, and of life depending upon Faith; that Faith is abſolutely neceſſary for ſalvation, although the Apoſtle elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where had not ſaid, <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Characters of fundamentall Truths, I thus briefly hint at onely; to ſhew what muſt diſtinguiſh a Principle from another Truth, in caſe we ſhould have need to judge of ſome Poſitions: Whether they be Fundamental or not; and it is good to walk by known Rules, for otherwiſe we walk not in the light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41545:9"/>And as in matters Doctrinall, ſo in matters of Practiſe there are fundamentall Duties, ſuch as is that of <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all periſh:</hi> and that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Follow peace with all men and holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord</hi>; and from that which the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.5. concerning Charity, <hi>That it is the end of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> might eaſily be concluded; that Charity is a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Duty, although he had not ſaid elſewhere, <hi>If I have not Charity, I am nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.2.</p>
            <p>And as in the inward Truth of Faith and Godlineſſe; ſo in the outward Profeſſion, there are Fundamental Rules to walk by, which in this caſe I ſuppoſe will be moſt conſiderable: becauſe I think that in matters of Faith and Practiſe, ſo farre as theſe relate to the New Creature in the inward frame of the mind towards God, there will be no cauſe of diſpu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e amongſt us. But in the outward Confeſſion, Profeſſion and exerciſe of Religious Duties, as they are to be upheld by way of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Gods glory amongſt men; I ſuppoſe the chief doubt of this Queſtion doth lie.</p>
            <p>Therefore to reſolve the ſame, the Principles of this kind are more diſtinctly to be thought upon: and to this effect, I conceive that the outward Profeſſion of Religion is the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Witneſs-bearing and opening of our ſelves, to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the Truth of our Faith and Obedience due to God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men; which can be done onely two wayes, by Word and Deed.</p>
            <p>We bear witneſs to the Truth by word of mouth two waies: Firſt, when we worſhip God publiquely, calling upon his name in Chriſt the Lord, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.11. and giving praiſe unto him through Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.9, 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. and when we joyn with thoſe that call upon him out of a pure heart in the profeſſion of his truth, and ſay Amen to that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 16.</p>
            <p>Secondly. When we give an account to every one that asketh a Reaſon of the Hope that is in us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. We bear witne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to the Truth in deed, in three ſorts of Actions. Firſt, In the Actions whereby we ſhew that we are in Covenant with God through Chriſt. Secondly, In the Actions whereby we maintain Communion with the Saints, the Members of Chriſt.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41545:9"/>
And thirdly, By the Actions whereby we maintaine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Miniſters of the Word, the ſervants of Chriſt in their Miniſteriall Charge towards Us.</p>
            <p>In the firſt of theſe, our Actions are conſidered as ſingle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Us. In the ſecond, they are conſidered as co-ordinate to our Brethren: In the third, as ſubordinate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ordinances of God in the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>In all theſe Reſpects, there be certain Fundamentall Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Principles of Walking, which if a Chriſtian doth not know and conſcionably intend, he doth ſin againſt the Truth of his Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of the firſt, we are commanded to walk worthy of God as dear Children, and followers of him, as being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to his Kingdome and Glory, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5 1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44, 45, 46, 47, 48. to do all our matters without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings and diſputings, being blameleſſe and harmleſſe in a crooked Generation; and holding forth the Word of life, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. and to this effect, all that are in Covenant with God through Chriſt in their profeſſed ſubjection to the Goſpell, muſt intend two main things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As his Diſciples, to be baptized into his death, to ſerve him by bearing his Croſs, and by being crucified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by unto the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Such as thus ſerve and follow Chriſt, muſt walk openly in the light before men, and not cloſely and in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20, 21, 22 &amp; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of the ſecond, we are commanded to ſerve others through love, not uſing our freedom to give occaſion to the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13.</p>
            <p>To walk in all lowineſſe and meekneſſe, forbearing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in caſes of offence, and endeavouring to keep the unitie of the Spirit in the bond of peace, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.2, 3. and to bear one anothers burdens, <hi>Gal,</hi> 6.2.</p>
            <p>And to this effect:
To conſider one another, to provoke each other to love and to good Works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24.</p>
            <p>Not to forſake the Aſſemblies, as the cuſtome of ſome was, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. And ſtill is to partake in the Aſſemblies the Ordinances in an orderly way, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>per. totum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41545:10"/>To remember the Poor, by diſtributing to the neceſſities of the Saints, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.13.</p>
            <p>To avoid ſuch as make Schiſmes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. or bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Goſpell, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9.</p>
            <p>To admoniſh and warn ſuch as are under ſin, and give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. &amp; 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14. &amp; <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3.14.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of the third, we are commanded to ſubmit to the Rulers that are over us in the Lord, and watch for our Souls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. to hearken unto their preaching, and admonitions, with reſpect unto them for their Works ſake, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12, 13. &amp; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. to joyn in Prayer with them in publique, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.4. To partake of the Sacraments, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24, 25, 26.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Fundamentalls of our publique Profeſſion in the common practiſe of all men: ſome things there be which belong to the practiſe of Miniſters in a peculiar manner, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are bound to manifeſt the Truth of Chriſtianity in their ſpeciall Callings, which are chiefly theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They muſt be called as <hi>Aaron</hi> was, and not take the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Miniſtry to themſelves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Being called, they muſt keep the Charge of the Houſe of God, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.7. &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.

            <p>According to theſe Principles and Maximes, the publique profeſſion of Religion muſt be maintained in the World: As for the Principles of State, I will not reflect upon the Intereſts of worldly men in State-Matters, which are conſtant in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but in the changeableneſſe of Circumſtances. But look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a State, as it is a Nation united together by Lawes for their own Peace and Safety, the main Intereſt thereof is this; That the Mutuall Duties of Magiſtrate and Subjects, be rightly performed.</p>

            <p>Thus I have briefly lookt upon this Querie, ſo farre as it ſeemeth requiſite to diſcover the properties of the matter which it containeth, that from thence the deciſion of this doubt may reſult, by comparing and laying matters together to find their due proportion, towards that which is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intended to be found out. The points then where the doubt lyeth, are theſe Three, ſo farre as I can underſtand the matter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether yea or no the Right Ordering and guiding of Mens wayes under Chriſt, according to the Scriptures, by the Elderſhip, to bring them to Communion with God; ſhould be approved, and without further delay, Authoritatively ſet Up, and determined in this Kingdome?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether ſuch a Determination doth ſtand with the Fundamentall Maximes of ſaving Truth, of Godlineſſe, and of the publique Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, as a thing conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and uſefull for the Churches?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether or no by the Fundamental Duties and grounds of Juſtice and good Order ſettled in this Kingdome, ſuch a Determination be not profitable for the maintaining of Peace and avoiding of Confuſion in the State?</p>
            <p>Now all the ſtreſs doth lie upon the ſuddenneſs of the Determination; Whether namely, that be expedient in all theſe reſpects yea or no; where again we muſt call to mind, that by ſuddenneſs, is not meant a raſh haſtineſſe without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation; but onely a ſuſpenſion of further Deliberations, to fall orderly to the execution of that which is already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and needeth no further debate in the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Therefore to come to the Compariſon of theſe Matters, with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41545:11"/>
this point of doubt; we muſt ſee what the Conſiſtencie or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencie will be in every one of the forenamed particulars with this kind of Settlement.</p>
            <p>Firſt then we reflect upon the Right Ordering and guiding of Mens wayes under Chriſt, (which is the proper work of Church-Government.) And doth not this deſerve to be ſet a foot as ſoon as may be? is there no danger in delaying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe a thing of ſo great concernment? doth not this tend directly to the ſalvation of mankind, to Gods glory, and to the good of his Church? why then if it may be ſettled in any degree, as in ſome degree it now may, ſhould it be differred? is it no diſhonour to Chriſt to neglect, or refuſe to ſettle his Ordinances? If then the Right Ordering and guiding of Mens wayes under Chriſt, is rather inconſiſtent with a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, then with a ſudden Settlement; I may refer it to himſelf to conclude what ought to be done.</p>
            <p>But you may perhaps ſay; No man ever doubted of this; that the Right Ordering and guiding of ſouls under Chriſt ſhould not be delayed, but rather ſpeedily ſettled when it may be had: but we are not ſure, that the Government ſued for, is the Right Ordering and guiding of Souls under Chriſt, therefore we may ſuſpend the Settlement. I anſwer, if this be the exception; then he ought to have ſhewed Us rather wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he makes this doubt: then wherefore all Government ſhould wholly be made void and unſettled? For when a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is made of Church Government in Generall, no body will otherwiſe conceive of it then under this Notion; that it is to be taken for the Right Ordering and guiding of Mens lives under Chriſt; and this being granted, who dare ſay that it is not fit, that ſuch a Government ſhould be ſettled without delay amongſt thoſe that ſue for it? But let us admit of the exception, as it may come under the limitation which is made of <hi>Power commonly deſired, &amp;c.</hi> And upon this ground, let the Queſtion be thus:</p>
            <p>If the Power commoly deſired, be not in the hands of the Miniſters alone (as formerly hath been declared) but in the Office of the Elderſhip, and that according to the Scriptures; then Querie, Whether this be inconſiſtent with a ſudden Settlement, yea or no? Whether the Right of Guiding and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41545:11"/>
Over-ſeeing Mens Souls, be committed in the Scripture to any but unto the Elderſhip? Whether in Nature, it can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to any more properly then unto them? Whether a free choſen Elderſhip, is not to be truſted with the Charge of Souls in ordinary, rather then any other ſort of men whatſoever? and if all this be ſo, what inconſiſtencie then is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Power, and a ſudden Settlement? Where is the danger? nay, is it not rather dangerous and unjuſt, to refuſe it by a needleſſe delay? But now his expreſſion running under the Generall Terms of <hi>Power commonly deſired in the hands of the Ministers,</hi> doth infuſe a prejudice, and miſ-inform people of the Miniſters deſire: whereby he doth maintain a jealouſie in the minds of the ſimple againſt his Brethren; and if by this means a diſreſpect is caſt upon the Miniſterie it ſelf; and if he in ſo doing, doth ſtrengthen the hands of a prophane and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Generation, which ſeeketh nothing more, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject wholly the Yoke of Chriſt, and live without controle in all diſorderly wayes: If I ſay by this manner of dealing in this matter, he doth all this; I leave it to the ſerious diſquirie of his own Conſcience; whether or no he ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and uſe means, to redreſs theſe evills whereunto he gives occaſion.</p>
            <p>As for the Fundamentalls of Truth and Godlineſſe; is it any way inconſiſtent that there ſhould be a preſent Settlement of Elderſhip, which cannot be imagined to be without power to deal by Scripturall wayes, and lawfull means with ſuch perſons as overthrow the Faith, and are heretical, ſcandalous, and diſorderly?</p>
            <p>Doth not the Apoſtle injoyn <hi>Timothy</hi> in the very firſt place, to take notice of thoſe that Teach other Doctrine; <hi>to charge them not</hi> to do ſo; that is with Authority to repreſs them? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. Is there not a Woe denounced to thoſe that give Scandalls? <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.7. And is there no cauſe to grieve for the Abominations committed without controle within the Church, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. and if we ſhould grieve for them; ſhould not means alſo be uſed which God hath appointed, to take them out of the way? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. why then ſhould we hinder a Settlement of thoſe Means? Is there any danger in a ſpeedy courſe to repreſs prophaneſs, to rectifie diſorderlineſs, and to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41545:12"/>
cure ignorance? and what benefit can redound to Godlineſs, by deferring the Diſcipline and Order by which it ſhould be upheld? Truly it is ſo farre from thence, that even a great and dolefull diſadvantage doth come thereby to the Goſpell, to the weak in Faith and ſimple ones, and to all the upright in heart, who are made fad by theſe Diſtractions: and that any who beareth the name of a Miniſter of Chriſt, ſhould help to increaſe their ſorrows by obſtructing the remedies, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving all wayes of Government; is a double grief to Godly ſouls.</p>
            <p>And if in the Nature of Truth and Godlineſſe, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be found inconſiſtent with this Settlement, but all doth call for the haſtening of it; what ſhall we conceive of the publique Profeſſion thereof? is it to be imagined, that the Fundamentall Maximes of the Religious Profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, ſhould afford any thing whereby a Settlement of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Church of God ſhould be diſwaded? Is not God the God of Peace and Order, and not of Confuſion? Nay, doth not every part of that Profeſſion call aloud for a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Government with all poſſible ſpeed?</p>
            <p>Firſt, look upon Chriſt the Apoſtle and High Prieſt of our Profeſſion, is He not upon his <hi>Throne, and in his Kingdome, to Order it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1.</note> 
               <hi>and to eſtabliſh it with Judgement and with Juſtice?</hi> Iſai. 9.7. Hath he hitherto ſhewed <hi>no judgement to the Gentiles?</hi> Mat. 12.18. And if we do acknowledge him the King of Souls, and our King to whom we have given up our Conſciences in the Covenant of Grace, and with reſpect hereunto in a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Covenant one with another. And if we make this our greateſt glory to be counted his Diſciples, and to be under the Government of his Diſcipline: ſhall we deliberate yea or no, whether we ſhould ſuffer his wayes of judgement to take place amongſt us? will he not be angry if we demurre upon the Matter? and ſhall we eſcape perdition if we lie under wrath? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. Truly there can be no cauſe ſo pregnant to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle his anger againſt a Nation, as is this very neglect of giving him his due over Mens ſouls.</p>
            <p>As for the Duties of this Profeſſion, whether requiſite in the Members or the Miniſters of the Church; do not they all highly oblige us to further a ſpeedy ſettlement of Government? are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41545:12"/>
they not all either wholly interrupted in ſome places for want of it; or every where under contempt and in diſorder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Government is no where ſettled?</p>
            <p>For if all are bound to follow Chriſt Profeſſedly even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Croſs; are they not then alſo obliged in conſcience, even though they ſhould ſuffer perſecution for it, to further the Settlement, of that power wherein Chriſt may Rule over them by his Ordinances? And if all are bound to walk open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and orderly in the publique light; and if this cannot be done in a ſociety of Saints, without an agreement and ſome ſettlement in the wayes of Chriſts publique Ordinances (wherein every one that is called by his name, and doth glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his ſervice, may find directions how to approve himſelf, without blame in the midſt of a crooked Nation;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15.</note>) then it is evident that every one is bound in conſcience to deſire this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of Saints in Government; and the ſettlement of their wayes in the Ordinances of Chriſt without delay: but the firſt is true; therefore alſo the ſecond.</p>
            <p>And if we are alſo commanded to endeavour to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace without delay; and this cannot be brought to paſſe effectually, without an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſettling of Church-Government; then certainly we are all bound in conſcience to ſeek this Agreement without delay; but we are all commanded to endeavour the firſt, without delay; and it cannot be had without the ſecond; therefore we are alſo bound in conſcience to ſeek for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond without delay.</p>
            <p>Again, If Chriſtians in their publique Profeſſion, are bound to conſider one another as Members of the ſame body, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke daily each other to love and to good works; and this cannot be done without the ſettlement of their Comember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip under Chriſt in his Government; then the Settlement of this Comemberſhip under this Government, is to be intended without delay; but that ought to be done daily, and cannot be done without this; therefore this Government ought to be ſettled without delay.</p>
            <p>If Chriſtians ſhould come orderly to the Ordinances of the Covenant, and renew the Memoriall thereof in the Houſe of God as often as may be; for the ſtrengthening of their Faith,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41545:13"/>
and mutuall Edification in love; and this cannot be done comfortably, without the advancement of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a Settlemen; then the Government ſhould be ſettled without delay: but the former of theſe Duties is requiſite, and cannot be done without the latter; therefore the latter is to be put in execution without delay.</p>
            <p>Furthermore all are bound to preſerve themſelves from the guilt of Schiſme, and to avoid ſuch as give occaſion thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; but without the Settlement of ſome wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, and agreement in Government, it is not poſſible to do this effectually, or to avoid the ſcandals of Diviſion; therefore the Settlement of the way of Government, is to be intended without delay.</p>
            <p>And concerning the Duty of mutual Admonition, to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the unrulineſs of Brethren, and to take away publique Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; is it poſſible to perform it to any purpoſe of Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without an agreement and ſettlement of the wayes of Brotherly Relation, under the Government of Chriſt in his Ordinances, of Judgement? and if without this, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done: are not thoſe guilty of all the Offences which now are Remedileſs in the Churth and State for want of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; who diſſwade the Settlement thereof?</p>
            <p>Thus we find nothing in the things which all ought to do in the publique Profeſſion of Chriſtianitie, which is any way inconſiſtent with the Settlement of Church-Government; but contrariwiſe every thing doth mainly require it: and if we look further upon the things which are Fundamentally to be done by the Miniſters in their publique Profeſſion of the Goſpell, either in generall for the keeping of the Charge of Gods Houſe, or in particular, for the Preaching of the Word; for the Ruling of the Flock, for the ſetting forth of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, by labouring publiquely in Prayers, and adminiſtring of the Sacraments without diſorder and confuſion: If I ſay we look upon theſe Duties of the Miniſteriall Profeſſion, to ſee what their conſiſtency is with a Settlement of Government without delay: do not all theſe Duties utterly looſe their edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying vertue, and become a kind of reproach and deriſion to the prophane World, for want of this Settlement of Church-Government amongſt Us? And doth not this neglect of Gods Houſe bring a guilt upon the State; becauſe we will have our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41545:13"/>
own worldly ends, before we give Chriſt his ſpirituall Righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> over us? Therefore nothing doth more require this ſuddain Settlement of Government, then the Miniſteriall Duties of the Publique Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>As for the true Principles of State, which can be none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then theſe. 1. That Juſtice ought to be maintained by wholſome Lawes and Statutes. 2. That good Orders ought to be ſettled in all Publique Societies. 3. That Confuſion and the cauſes of Strife and Diviſions, ought to be prevented. 4. That the Means of Peace, of Love, and Safety, ought to be procured and ſettled by publique Authority: I ſay, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of all theſe Maximes, if a needleſs delay of ſettling Church-Government, be wholly contrary to their ſenſe and purpoſe; then I ſuppoſe it will not be thought good Policie to deferre that Settlement any longer, then it is impoſſible to eſtabliſh it: But there is no ſuch impoſſibility now, for the State of this Kingdome; to ſettle by their Authority the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſts Power amongſt their Subjects; therefore it is wholly inconſiſtent with the true Principles of State, as well as of Religion to deferre any longer the Settlement of the ſo much longed for Church-Government.</p>
            <p>I love not to play the States-man, and to reflect upon the Intereſts of Parties, to ſhew the Advantages which each might reap (ſo farre as their ends are laudable) from this Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts Power amongſt us: nor will I enter upon the Conſideration of all the dangerous Conſequences which the long diſcontinuance and unſettlement of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth threaten the State withall from within to weaken it, and from without to betray it to cunning Adverſaries that lie in wait to take advantages: I ſay, I love not to dive much into theſe things, although the laſt might to good purpoſe be inſiſted upon here, (chiefly in reſpect of the Deſignes of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and Prelates, who will never gain ground upon us again, but by our inward unſettlement.) But one thing I will ſay; that as it is a high diſhonour unto God, and the greateſt that a State can do unto Chriſt; not to allow him to Order and guide his own Houſe, by his own Lawes within their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories; and by his own Officers rule his own Subjects, which are the ſouls which he within their habitations hath bought,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41545:14"/>
and doth call unto himſelf; ſo he will no doubt ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge ſuch an injurie with deſerved judgements; and put down the Power and Authority of thoſe in this World, that will not ſuffer his Power and Authority to take place in his Mount Sion.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.</note> He will break them with a Rod of Iron, like a Potters Veſſel all to pieces: Therefore be wiſe now O ye Kings, and be ye inſtructed ye Rulers of the Earth.</p>
            <p>And if the Tenor of the Nationall Covenant hath been judged a true Maxime of State, to unite and ſettle the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms both joyntly and ſeverally in Peace; and is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Conſcionablely by all, as a thing ſworn unto by the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Repreſentative Body of the Kingdom, who in the preſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of the Great God of Heaven and Earth (who will not ſuffer thoſe to be unpuniſhed that take his Name in vain) have bound themſelves to perform it: Then I ſuppoſe that the needleſs (that is to ſay, the meer Politicall, Subtile and Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) delay of ſettling that Church-Government which is moſt Conſonant to the word of God, and the example of the beſt Reformed Churches, will not be found expedient, but very hurtfull to the whole State and the Members of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: for if their Oath hath made this endeavour of ſettling this Church-Government when it can be done, a neceſſary dutie unto them in reſpect of the State; then I hope that they will underſtand thus much, that he who knoweth the Secrets of all hearts, will be able to diſcern the purpoſe and aime, for which the performance of ſuch a Duty when it may be performed, is deferred, no State end will give him ſatisfaction in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and we all (I ſay, we chiefly that are Remembrancers on Gods behalf to Men of their Duties) ſhould let the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate as well as others, know what God requires of them: we are bound to put them in mind of their Dutie in this caſe; namely that God expects a performance of vowes made unto him without all delayes; and that he doth not allow of any By-ends, in a buſineſſe to which the Conſcience hath bound it ſelf towards the Lord: Therefore the counſell of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> is to be laid to heart, which ſaith thus, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.4. When <hi>thou voweſt a vow to God, deferre not to pay it, for he hath no pleaſure in Fools; pay that which thou haſt vowed:</hi> In a word then to perſwade the Magiſtrate to deferre the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41545:14"/>
of his Vow to God upon State Conſiderations, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic intents, is to perſwade him to play the foole and to be guiltie of the judgement denounced in that Woe, which is threatned them that are wiſe in their own eyes, and prudent in their own ſight, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.21. Let therefore no man deceive himſelf; if we are Chriſtians not in Word, but in Deed, we muſt believe that all the wiſdome and State Politie of this World, is meer fooliſhneſs with God; becauſe it is written, <hi>That he will take the wiſe in their own Craftineſſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.18, 19.</p>
            <p>I have done with the Firſt Part of this Diſcourſe, wherein I have endeavoured to ſhew you an Unpartiall Way of reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Doubt which he hath prepoſed: Now I come to the Second Part, wherein I am to look upon his Manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding for the Determination thereof, to ſee how farre it doth reach the Aime of advancing Truth and Peace.</p>

               <head>Concerning the firſt.</head>
               <p>In the firſt Head I find two Pre-ſuppoſalls which he takes as granted.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this. That which a People is not fit to receive, by reaſon of their ignorance, or want of ſutableneſſe; is not haſtily to be impoſed upon them.</p>
               <p>The Second is. That which a People ought to receive by reaſon of the Unlawfulneſs or Uſeleſſeneſs of the thing, that ought not to be impoſed upon them.</p>
               <p>The firſt Aſſertion, is the ground of his firſt and ſixt; and the Second of his ſecond <hi>Section.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the firſt is not to be granted without a limitation; for ignorance and want of ſuteableneſs in a People, (except it be found altogether invincible) doth not excuſe them from Obedience: Nor ſhould good Lawes and Government, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a People may be inſtructed, and made ſuteable to perform
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41545:15"/>
neceſſary Duties, be left off, becauſe formerly they have not been well taught. Nay in humane Government, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may be aſſerted for a Truth; namely that where a People is ignorant of their Dutie, and doth want ſutableneſs to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it towards Superiours, there Government ought to be conſtituted without delay; leſt their Unrulineſs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teachableneſs become Habituall: for the want of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth make a People wild. Thus then the Aſſertion is not Univerſally true.</p>
               <p>But perhaps he will ſay, That in matters of Religious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, it will hold true; becauſe the word of God doth bind no man further to practicall obedience and ſubjection to Government, then he doth underſtand the nature and grounds of that Government to be of God. For it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5. <hi>Let every man be fully perſwaded in his own mind,</hi> and verſ. 23. <hi>Whatſoever is not of faith, is ſinne.</hi> From this place he inferres, That if a People be not taught the nature and grounds of that Government, it ſhould not be impoſed upon them: How this Conſequence doth follow, we ſhall ſee anon, when we examine the Reaſoning of his firſt Section: But here I will intimate onely, that the Apoſtles words are not given as a Rule of Subjection, relating to Government; but as a Rule of Freedom, relating to Diſcretion, whereby every one is to look to his own private wayes: For in that 4th. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the Apoſtle doth teach Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Rules of mutuall Forbearance and Moderation, in judging one another for matters of Indifferencie, ſuch as are meats and dayes: in theſe things he forbid; the ſtrong to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the weak, &amp; the weak to judge the ſtrong, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.3, 4. And he willeth every one to be fully perſwaded in his own mind concerning that which he doth, that he may not do it either with offence to others, or doubtingly within himſelfe: if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe befall him, the Apoſtle declares it to be a ſinne, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. till the end of the Chapter, and chiefly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Man that doubteth in the laſt Verſe of the Chapter, he ſaith; That if he eateth not with Faith, he is damned, becauſe whatſoever is not of Faith, is Sin. Thus we ſee that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks clearly of a Rule, by which every one is to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern himſelf in his own private actions: namely that he ought
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41545:16"/>
to abſtain from that which he cannot do in Faith, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is not fully perſwaded in his mind. Now how from a Precept of this kind, a Conſequence will be rightly drawn to conclude: that it is not fit that any Church-Government ſhould be haſtily ſettled in this Kingdom, is not clear to me at the firſt ſight; for, becauſe a Chriſtian may abſtain from doing that whereof he is in doubt, and ought to be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in his own mind, that what he doth is lawfull; that therefore no Church-Government ſhould be ſettled in this Kingdome, ſeemeth to me no good inference. For if the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> to whom theſe Rules were given, were under Church-Government (as is apparant they were by <hi>Ch.</hi> 12.4.5, 6, 7, 8.) and if this doubting in private Caſes of practiſe was inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto them, and did not exempt them from that Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor did make Church-Government a thing unfit for their edification in Godlineſſe; I know not why it ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt this people from the ſame Obligation, or be unfit for their Publique Edification.</p>
               <p>But let us come to his proofe of the Concluſion, drawn from theſe Rules.</p>
               <p>In the firſt <hi>Section,</hi> he ſaith thus; That no Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be ſettled upon this People: becauſe, if any be ſettled, it will bring this People either to a neceſſity of ſinne againſt God; or of miſery in the World: His general ground then is this; Whatſoever may occaſion a People either to ſinne againſt God, or to become miſerable in the World, is not fit to be brought upon them.</p>
               <p>This he takes as an Univerſall Truth, and doth preſuppoſe it as a thing undeniable: but to ſhew that it is a falſe ground, and not to be admitted without limitation: I may conclude from it in his way of Reaſoning, as wel that the Goſpel is not to be offered to a People, as that no Church-Government is to be ſettled amongſt them. For if the Goſpell be preached, and Chriſt offered to a People in the Covenant of Grace, they are brought thereby under a neceſſity, either of ſinning againſt God if they receive not Chriſt, or of being perſecuted and miſerable in the World if they receive him. For it is ſaid, That all that will live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. and the world is condemned of ſinne, <hi>if it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41545:16"/>
believe not in him,</hi> Joh. 16.8, 9. So then ſeeing God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed this neceſſity to follow the Goſpell preached, or the preaching of it; it is no Truth to ſay; That whatſoever bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a People on a neceſſity, either of ſinne or miſery, is not fit to be brought upon them, for the preaching of the Goſpell doth this; and it is abſurd to ſay, that the preaching of the Goſpell is not fit to be brought upon them.</p>
               <p>But he will ſay perhaps, that the Caſe is different; either that there is a greater neceſſity of Preaching, then of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Church-Government; or that the Cauſe of this neceſſity is not proper, and <hi>per ſe,</hi> by it ſelfe following the nature of the Goſpell, but onely accidentall in reſpect of the world.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That he will never be able to ſhew a greater ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the one then of the other; he may perhaps ſhew that the one may go before the other; na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ly that Teaching muſt be firſt; but that upon Teaching, the Obſervation of all Chriſts Commandements (under which the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Church-Government are comprehended) muſt needs follow, is clear, from the Fundamentall Commiſſion given to the Apoſtles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. and he that doth charge <hi>Timothy</hi> to preach in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2.</note> doth alſo charge him in the ſame place to watch; and elſewhere with no leſs earneſtneſs to obſerve all the Rules of Government, without preferring one before another, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5 21. And we have ſeen heretofore, that the Principles of the Outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion, are no leſſe eſſentially requiſite in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, then the Principles of Faith, although the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Faith are firſt in Order. So then he cannot plead a greater neceſſity of the one, then of the other.</p>
               <p>But then when he ſaies, that the Goſpell is not by it ſelf a proper Cauſe of Perſecution and Miſery, but onely acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, by reaſon of the evill world which hates the Godly without a cauſe. I ſay, that herein he gives himſelf an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, concerning the matter of Government: for the ſettling of the Government which Chriſt hath ordained, is no cauſe either of Sin or Miſery by it ſelf; but onely accidentally by reaſon of the ignorance and wickedneſſe of our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: from whence you ſee that the generall ground of his Reaſoning in the firſt <hi>Section,</hi> is not true, as he doth preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41545:17"/>
it; namely that whatſoever doth neceſſitate a People ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſinne, or to be miſerable, is not to be impoſed upon them: but to make it true a limitation is to be added thus; Whatſoever in its own nature and propertie, and not acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, doth neceſſitate a People either to ſin or miſery, that is not to be impoſed upon a People: but then if you expreſs according to this preſuppoſal, the Aſſumption or ſecond Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his Argument, thus: Now the ſettling of Church-Government doth in its own nature and property, and not accidentally, neceſſitate a People either to ſin, or to be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; this you ſee is evidently falſe, and therefore the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which he intends to inferre, doth not hold true; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that no Church-Government ought to be ſettled upon this People.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee that the very ground of his Reaſoning is a hidden fallacie, fit to deceive ignorant people, and plauſible to a naturall mans Capacity, but no wayes agreeable with Gods Truth and counſell in the diſpenſation of the Goſpell. For God hath determined that all men ſhall be brought to this neceſſity in ſome degree more or leſſe, for the tryall of their Faith and perſeverance.</p>
               <p>But you perhaps will ſay, that he makes not this the chiefe ground of his Reaſoning; but that he ſeems onely to touch it as an inferrence following upon the precedents, to ſhew the inconveniencie thereof. I Anſwer; If it be no inconveniency in Gods Counſell, then his Counſell to reject all Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment upon this ground, is contrary to Gods Counſell; and he ſpeaks in this Matter as a naturall Man to pleaſe Men, rather then God.</p>
               <p>Having thus diſcovered the deceit of his main ground of Perſwaſion, you may eaſily perceive that the Superſtructures will fall; but that we may further ſee the force of his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and the Coherence of Matters which he layes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let us proceed to ſet all his Arguments in their Order di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>
               <p>Thus then he doth Reaſon.</p>
               <p>That which bringeth upon a People a neceſſity of Sinne or Miſery, is not to be impoſed upon them. The ſettling of any Church-Government will do this, <hi>Ergo,</hi> no Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be impoſed upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:41545:17"/>The firſt Propoſition of this Argument hath been now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and found falſe; his Diſcourſe runnes upon the proof of the Second; namely that the ſettling of any Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, will bring this People to the neceſſity of ſinne. Thus.</p>
               <p>That which will put this People upon the Practiſe of that wherein it is impoſſible they can be fully perſwaded in their minds, will put them upon the neceſſity of ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5. But the ſettling of any Church-Government, will put them upon the practiſe of that wherein it is impoſſible they can be fully perſwaded in their minds: <hi>Ergo,</hi> It will put them upon the neceſſity of ſin.</p>
               <p>Here again the Major or firſt Propoſition, is not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted without a Reſtriction, thus</p>
               <p>That which in its own nature, and by it ſelf, will put this People upon the Practiſe of that wherein it is impoſſible they can be fully perſwaded in their mind, will put them upon the neceſſity of ſinne, if they do it; now with this Reſtriction the ſecond Propoſition is falſe: for it is not true, that the ſettling of any Church-Government whatſoever, will in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by it ſelf, put them upon the Practiſe of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they cannot be fully perſwaded in their minds. Therefore this Concluſion is falſe, namely that the Settling of any Church-Government whatſoever, will put them upon the neceſſity of ſin.</p>
               <p>Here again you ſee plainly the falacie; but he not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this, hath gone on in his Reaſoning to prove the other Propoſition; namely that the ſettling of any Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment whatſoever, will bring the People upon the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of that wherein it is impoſſible they can be fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their minds; and to make this good, he Argues thus.</p>
               <p>A People that is generally untaught in the nature and grounds of all Church-Government, will be brought upon the Practiſe of that wherein it is impoſſible they can be fully perſwaded in their minds, if the ſettling of any Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be brought upon them. But this People is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly untaught in the nature and grounds of all Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they will be brought upon the Practiſe of that wherein it is impoſſible they can be fully perſwaded in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41545:18"/>
their minds, if the ſettling of any Church-Government be brought upon them. Although all this were granted, yet the former grounds not being ſound, the Conſequence by which his main Concluſion is to be inferred, will not hold: But let us now examine the Truth of theſe Propoſitions alſo in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, I do not ſee that the firſt Propoſition of this Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme is true, and that this is a good Conſequence; namely becauſe a People is unraight, and not able to judge of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and grounds of Church-Government, that therefore they will be put upon the Practiſe of that wherein it is impoſſible they can be fully perſwaded, in caſe they be brought under Government. I ſay, that there is no neceſſary Coherence of the firſt part of this Propoſition with the latter. 1. Becauſe the ſettling of the Government may be ſuch as ſhall bring its own light with it, and convince thoſe that receive it of the nature and the grounds thereof. 2. Becauſe the ſettling of it may be ſuch, as will not put them upon any Practiſe whereat they ſhall ſcruple: For both the Government and the way of ſettling it, may be ſo Moderate and Sutable to tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; that they ſhall not be conſtrained to any thing whereof they cannot be fully perſwaded. 3. Becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made out, that every one who is to be under Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church, muſt needs underſtand the whole nature and grounds of the Government; or elſe be obliged to refuſe all obedience thereunto, for fear of being put upon the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of ſomething whereof they cannot be fully perſwaded: Is it not enough to be aſſured that the Government ſhall not urge any ſuch Practiſe upon them? And if they know that they ſhall not be led with Rigour, but with Judgement; that the Loſt will be ſought, the Broken bound up, the Sick ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.16.</note> and that which was driven away, brought back; will not this be ſatisfactory? I do not intend to diſſwade any from endeavouring to ſatisfie themſelves, to the utmoſt of their abilities in any thing whereof they doubt, but rather wiſh that all may be as the <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>reans</hi> were, Noble in ſearching out all Truths. Nevertheleſſe I do not ſee it either needful or uſeful, that men ſhould walk ſo ſcrupulouſly and partially as this Poſition ſeemeth to allow: For the wiſdome which is from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41545:18"/>
above, is without Partialitie. 4. Nor do I ſee that the place of Scripture, wherein the Apoſtle doth exhort every one to be carefull of his own private wayes, to do all in Faith, and with a full perſwaſion of mind, doth oblige him that hath this care of himſelf, to judge alſo the actions of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours in the wayes of Government, ſo narrowly that he muſt needs know all what they do, or elſe be ſubject in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It is another thing to be fully perſwaded in mine own mind of that which I muſt do; and another to be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the nature and grounds of Duties belonging to the Government, which is intruſted unto others: I may do the former, and ſatisfie my ſelf in what concerns my ſelf, and yet may be ſafely ignorant of the latter. So then I do not find this to be a Truth, that the ſettling of a Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon me who am not fully informed of the nature of it, will put me upon the Practiſe of that whereof I am not fully perſwaded, except I be obliged to adminiſter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I underſtand not, (for then I confeſſe I am put upon the Practiſe of that whereof I am not perſwaded.) But if I be not obliged to do this, and am left free to do what is good for me to do: How is it true, that by the ſettling of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I am put upon the Practiſe of that whereof I am not fully perſwaded? If you ſay, although you be not obliged to Practiſe the Government, as one to whom the Duties of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are intruſted; yet you will be obliged by way of obedience, to Practiſe that which the Government ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn you to do, and that may be for ought you know, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereof you are not fully perſwaded. To this I Anſwer; that it is no Charity in me, to ſuſpect that the Government will put me upon any ſuch Practiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if it doth, then it will be time to ſhew my grievance; in the mean time I think it not juſt, becauſe I may think that ſome ſuch thing may fall out; that therefore I ſhould diſſwade all from admitting of any Government whatſoever, till all my Apprehenſions be cleared. Do not I in this caſe not onely want Charity, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo take too much upon me, to have all unſettled till I be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied? why ſhall others that deſire to be under Government, and are ſatisfied in the nature and grounds of it, be deprived of the benefit thereof for my ſake? or why ſhould I put fears
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41545:19"/>
and jealouſies in their minds, to alienate them from the love of Government? is not this to ſeek my ſelf more then the Publique?</p>
               <p>But his Aſſumption or ſecond Propoſition, ſaith, That this People is generally untaught in the nature and grounds of Government; and therefore it may be ſaid, that he ſeeks not himſelf in this ſo much as the Publique.</p>
               <p>To this I Anſwer, That I deſire not to judge him in his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Aime, God alone doth know the Secrets of Hearts; but two things I muſt add: Firſt, That the Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of his way of Reaſoning may have ſuch an aime; and therefore that he gives cauſe to ſuſpect that he may perhaps be guilty thereof. Secondly, I ſay, That I ſee no Cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the thing which he ſaith of this People, is true in the ſenſe which his words tend or ſeem to inſinuate. For I am perſwaded that this People doth generally know, that there is a neceſſity of ſome Government, and that the beſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is that which is ſettled according to Gods will, and conſequently that it ought to be ſo ſettled; and that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the Miniſtery to have the Adminiſtration of it; and that they ought to obey and ſubmit to thoſe that are ſet over them in the Lord: and that as the Miniſter is not to Rule over them according to his own will, but according to Gods will revealed in the Word; ſo that they ought to yeeld to every thing whereof they ſhall be convicted from the Word, that it is to Gods will. I ſay, I ſee no Cauſe to believe but that this People is generally thus much taugh, or at leaſt ſo much advanced towards the apprehenſion of theſe Truths, that if they but hear them delivered; they will ſincerely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereunto: and this I conceive is enough to make them capable of Government. Therefore although I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that many are untaught in the particular way and grounds of that Government which God hath appointed in his Houſe: yet I cannot be ſo uncharitable, to think, that whenſoever it ſhall be made known unto them, they will be incapable to underſtand it. For beſides the grounds which they have already received in the common way of Proteſtancie, which certainly have brought them thus far; we have large promiſes in the Scripture, and particularly in the 35. of <hi>Iſai.</hi> to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41545:19"/>
aſſure us, that when the Kingdome of Chriſt ſhall be ſettled in the Earth, the Blind, the Deafe, the Dum, the Lame, and ſuch like, ſhall be inabled to ſee, to hear, to ſpeak and to leap; and that the way ſhall be made ſo plain in Holineſſe, that the Wayfaring men though fooles, ſhall not erre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. Therefore although it may be true, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the People is untaught of the nature of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; yet I am perſwaded, that ſo many as have any knowledge of Catecheticall Principles, though but generall, will be capable inſtantly of all that which is needfull to be known to admit of the Government: therefore it is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, becauſe the multitude is not yet fully taught and made to underſtand the Reaſons of Government, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Government ſhould be ſettled upon them: for the very ſettling of that Government which Chriſt hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, will carry light with it, and make them all to underſtand the nature of the thing, better then all the Diſcourſes which either He or I can make of it. For theſe Cauſes his whole Diſcourſe in this Matter, is wholly impertinent; nor doth it follow at all, that although this People were wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught in the nature of the Government, that therefore it ought n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t to be ſettled upon them.</p>
               <p>Thus I have done with his firſt <hi>Section</hi>; to let you ſee the Unreaſonableneſſe of his Reaſonings therein.</p>
               <p>In the following <hi>Sections,</hi> I ſhall not need to be ſo exact and large, becauſe I will not meet with any thing that doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect ſo much upon Conſcience as this doth: or is ſo plauſibe and likely to entangle the thoughts of the Simple.</p>
               <p>The ſixt <hi>Section</hi> is to be conſidered in the next place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath greateſt affinitie with the firſt. For the firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Argument from the Peoples ignorance; and Sixt, from their want of ſutableneſſe to yeeld Obedience. But his Words and Senſe are ſo obſcure, as if he were afraid to be Underſtood, and did ſpeak to ſome body in the Clouds of the Aire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he ſaith thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is againſt the nature of Chriſts deſcription of himſelfe, and againſt the ſutableneſſe which he doth preſs for, amongſt all ſuch as ſhould ſubmit to his Commandements.</hi> And to make this appear, he doth alledge places, where it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt doth not cry
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41545:20"/>
nor ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rive,</hi> Mat. 12.19. and that <hi>his yoke is eaſie,</hi> Mat. 11.29. and that <hi>his Commandements are not grievous,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.3. and that <hi>he putteth no new Wine in old Bottles,</hi> Mat. 9.17. then he ends with theſe words, <hi>All which cannot be fulfilled in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiall Congregations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is his meaning? is it this; that to ſettle a Church-Government in the Churches of Chriſt, is againſt the nature of Chriſts Deſcription of himſelfe; and againſt the ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that de doth preſs for in his Subjects? can any thing be ſaid more falſ then this? For is it not the very end of Church-Government, to make Mens lives conformable unto Chriſt, and to make them ſutable to ſubmit to his Commandements? But if he means not to ſpeak of Church-Government, as a thing inconſiſtent with the life of Chriſt, and the ſubmiſſion to his Commandements, he ſayes nothing to the purpoſe of his Querie. And if the ſettling of Church-Government ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, is one of the moſt effectuall Means to take Men off from ſtriving and crying in the ſtreets, to make them find Chriſts Yoke eaſie, and his Commandements not grievous, and to put them in a new frame of life to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new Bottles, wherein the Wine of ſpirituall wiſdome and comfort may be kept without ſpilling; then the ſettling of Church-Government is no wayes againſt the nature of Chriſt life, and the properties of ſubjection due to him: but the ſettlement of Church-Government according to the Scriptures, is one of the moſt effectuall Means to do all this; therefore the ſettling of Church-Government, is no way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the nature of Chriſts life, or Deſcription of himſelf, and againſt the properties of ſubjection due to him, or the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe which he doth ſeek in thoſe that are to ſubmit to his Commandements.</p>
               <p>But his meaning is perhaps, that the Conſtitution of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over Parochiall Congregations is againſt all this: or as he ſayes, that all this cannot be fulfilled in any Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall Congregations. If this be his meaning, he might have ſpoken plainer, and ought to have given ſome proof thereof. For he could not be ignorant of this, that many Godly and zealous Miniſters will ſay, that they have experience of the contrary; namely, that in ſome Parochial Congregations all
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41545:20"/>
this is done; when with the faithfull Diſpenſation of the Word, the Diſcipline and Charge of Gods Houſe is carefully kept by the Miniſter: and it is apparant, that one of the chief cauſes of Striving and Crying, is the want of true Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which makes Chriſts Yoke uneaſie to Mens ſouls: and if he appeal to experience, it will not be found that in the Parochiall Congregations hitherto ſettled in the Reformed way, ſo much Diviſion, ſuch crying out and ſtriving, and ſuch Diſturbance of good Order hath been, as in the Churches which are called Separatiſts, or Independents. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is clear, why it falls out to be ſo; becauſe their Principles of Government lead them rather to walk by themſelves, and at a diſtance from all others, then to keep the Unity of the Spirit with their Brethren without partiality. The name of a Parochial Congregation, becauſe it is of old in Uſe, perhaps is taken for an old Bottle, by way of alluſion to Chriſts ſpeech; but an old Pariſh in Name, wil be a new Congregation in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when it is caſt into another frame of Government then formerly it was in: and it will be found that nothing is done in any Congregationall Church, for Orderly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mens wayes under Chriſt, which in the Reformed Pariſh-Congregation, can not be done with leſſe ſtirre, and as effectually, if the Government were once ſettled.</p>
               <p>So then in this <hi>Section</hi> I find no Argument at all, but a bare Aſſertion, wherein is ſo much obſcurity, that it ſeems to me, he did either not intend to be underſtood, if he ſpeaks to his Queſtion: or if he ſpeaks not to it, but would take the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ſpeak ſomewhat to no purpoſe, or to ſome other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then his Queſtion, he might have been more intelligible if it had pleaſed him, and not left us to gueſſe at his meaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Men that would convince and perſwade, ſhould not walk in darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Second <hi>Section</hi> is alſo reduced to the firſt generall Head, becauſe it is taken from the Unlawfulneſſe or Uſeleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of bringing the deſired Government upon the People.</p>
               <p>The Argument runnes thus:</p>
               <p>That which is dangerous to bring a People under a Popiſh implicite Obedience, by forcing on them a Practiſe of that which they ſcarce know, or know but in part, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qently
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41545:21"/>
is contrary to the Nationall Covenant, ought not to be ſettled upon them; but the ſettling of any Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment haſtily, as it is commonly deſired, doth this, and is contrary to the Nationall Covenant: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it ought not to be ſettled upon them.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer is; That the Church-Government deſired, ſuch as we have formerly deſcribed, doth none of all this, and therefore may be ſet up without danger: and the Godly Miniſters of this Kingdom will call this a falſe accuſation againſt them, and injurious to the Government deſired: nor doth he give any proof of what he ſayes, but as if it were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have ſaid ſo; he doth alledge onely the Peoples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to that which the State ſets up; ſaying, that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſheweth, that the Peoples Conſciences doth reſolve it ſelfe in this Querie; Whether the Religion be eſtabliſhed by Law or no?

                  </gap> Argument is this; that becauſe the People doth ſcarce know, or knows but in part that Government which is to be ſettled, that therefore the Government will bring them under a Popiſh implicite Obedience; I deny the Conſequence: for although the People be ignorant, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to do things by an implicite Faith, yet it is no fault in the Government that they are ſo, nor will the ſettling of the Government make them to be ſo; but the contrary will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther follow.<note place="margin">

But he ſayes, the Government will force a Practiſe upon them without knowledge: I ſay, that he doth in this Calumniate his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41545:21"/>
and traduces the Government deſired without cauſe, to ſtrengthen the prejudices and unruly affections of ſome that hate all Settlement of Order. Nay, but the People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves their Conſcience in this Querie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whether the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be ſettled by Law or no? even now the fault was in the Government, that it would force them to practiſe what they knew not; now the fault is in them that will not practiſe till they know that which is warrantable by Law; whence I can gather none other Argument but this: If the People doth too much reſpect the Authority of the State for the ſettling of Church-Government over them; then no Government ſhould be ſettled by the State; but the People doth ſo: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Who will admit the Conſequence of the firſt Propoſition? and yet except this be preſuppoſed, nothing can be made of his Diſcourſe. But he will perhaps ſay, they do not onely reſpect their Authority, but they are ſuperſtitiouſly devoted to it. I Anſwer, <hi>Dum vitant ſtulti vitia in contraria currunt,</hi> Fools are alwayes in extreams; becauſe ſome extreamly affect humane Lawes and Authority; will you therefore have no divine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances ſettled? and doth this follow; that the State ought not to ſettle any Government, becauſe the People is too much devoted to their Authority? ought they not rather to be ſo much the more carefull of their duties? ought they not rather to make uſe of their intereſt in the Peoples affections, to ſettle that Government which Chriſt doth require in his houſe? As for the People their error to reſpect man too much in divine Matters, muſt in due time be rectified; and this can be done more advantagiouſly when the Government which Chriſt hath appointed is ſettled, then when nothing is ſettled, but all is in Confuſion.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, that having found ſo much falacie in all theſe Arguments, and ſo little Coherence in them with the main Querie; I have no Cauſe to give any aſſent unto the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive which he doth aſſert; namely that it is not fit that any Church-Government ſhould be ſettled haſtily, and with the Power commonly deſired in the hands of the Miniſters.</p>
               <p>But before I leave this Head, I muſt obſerve that the whole ſtrain of theſe Arguments doth runne beyond the Querie, and intendeth to make good rather this Aſſertion, that no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41545:22"/>
at all ſhould be ſettled, then that which the Querie doth mention. For if the Peoples ignorance of the nature of Government, and their want of ſutableneſſe to be conform to Chriſts Deſcription of himſelfe, be ſufficient cauſes why Government ſhould be ſuſpended; then not onely the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment commonly deſired, but all other Government whatſoever may be ſuſpended upon the ſame grounds; and perhaps the aime is rather to hinder all, then that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired: For the way of Reaſoning doth not ſo much aime at the reſolution of the doubt propoſed, touching the Fitneſſe or Unfitneſſe of the Government commonly deſired, as to take off mens thoughts from the Neceſſity of any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all. Nor will it ſerve his turn to ſay, that the General is made good onely, to the end that the Particular may be inferred the more ſtrongly. For I ſay, except it be his opinion that No Government at all ſhould be ſettled in the Church, neither in reſpect of God nor Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither in Spiritual nor in Naturall Actions, which relate into the inward or outward ſtate of Souls: I ſay, except he be of this meaning, he ought not to have ſhot beyond his mark; and if he be of it, then he ought to have put his Querie in other terms. But if he means not to ſtrike at all Government, then he ſhould have been ſo ingenuous as to remove this ſtumbling block, which every one that reads with attention, his Diſcourſe will inſtantly meet withall.</p>
               <p>Thus I have done with the firſt Head; now I come to the Examination of the Second.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Concerning the Second.</head>
               <p>In the Second Head, Arguments are taken from the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Chriſt, of his Apoſtles, and of the Authors of the laſt Reformation.</p>
               <p>The generall Argument is this.</p>
               <p>That which Chriſt and his Apoſtles practiſed in their way of ſettling Church-Government, we ought to follow; and that which the firſt Reformers of Religion failed in, we ought to avoid. But Chriſt and his Apoſtles practiſed a ſlow, and not a haſty way of ſettling Church-Government: and the firſt Reformers failed in making too much haſt, therefore we
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41545:22"/>
ought to follow a ſlow, and not a haſty way of ſettling Church Government.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer to this Argument is, that all may be granted which it concludes in ſome ſenſe, if namely ſlowneſs and haſt be taken in a right ſenſe; that is, if by ſlowneſs, be meant not a lingring, but a conſiderate delay; and by haſt, not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate, but a prudent ſpeed; then the Concluſion is true. And I ſuppoſe that hitherto this counſell hath been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and wil be followed by thoſe that are in place of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But yet becauſe the premiſes according to his ſenſe are doubtfull, and may be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood; yea and cannot be rightly underſtood as they relate his ſcope; to make it good, therefore we muſt take them into Conſideration.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, that the firſt Prepoſition is to be granted with this limitation; namely, that we ought to follow the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles, in that wherein the Caſes are alike, and their Actions not extraordinary, but of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary nature and imitable. Now then if he can make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that in the ſettling of Church-Government, our Caſes and theirs are alike, and that their Actions were hot of an extraordinary nature, but imitable by Us in all things; then he will ſay ſomething to the purpoſe, and may inferre that their ſlowneſſe and ours ought to be of the ſame extent. But then if we reflect upon the ſecond Propoſition, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to his purpoſe in hand, and as he intends to apply it. I ſuppoſe that his ſenſe of ſlowneſſe and haſtineſſe, will not be applyable either to Chriſt and his Apoſtles, or to the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of Religion in our times. For the ſlowneſſe which he ſeeks, is a Dilatory and lingering off putting of matters rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to be done: and the haſtineſſe whereof he accuſes the firſt Reformers of our Religion, is an inconſiderate Precipitation whereof I doubt they were not guilty. I ſuppoſe then he will be found in an error, either in reſpect of the Caſes, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Application of them to us.</p>
               <p>Three Sections belong to this Argument; the Third ſpeaks of Chriſt: the Fourth, of the Apoſtles; and the Fifth; of our laſt Reformers.</p>
               <p>In the proceedings of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, he ſuppoſes there was a Dilatory ſlowneſſe in ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tling Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41545:23"/>
which I ſuppoſe was not at all therein: and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the firſt Reformers for too much haſtineſſe, which I conceive he hath no reaſon to do: Let us then conſider the Particulars.</p>
               <p>Concerning Chriſt, he would inſinuate that he did proceed in a Dilatory ſlow way, by this Argument, applyed from his Practiſe to us.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt did not ſettle his Government by Miracle haſtily, and over a People not enlightned; then there is no Morall Neceſſity of ſettling it ſo ſoon as may be; according to the deſire of ſome. But Chriſt ſettled not his Government by Miracle, nor over a People not enlightned therein: therefore there is no Morall Neceſſity of ſettling it ſo ſoon as may be, according to the deſire of ſome.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer is, that the Major Propoſition, is a <hi>Non-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur</hi>: For it is no conſequence. If Chriſt ſettled not his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Miracle: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the ſettling thereof by Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Means as ſoon as may be, is not neceſſary: for it was not expedient to be ſettled by Miracle, but by the Ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Apoſtles; and yet it appeareth to have been done as ſoon as could be without all Dilatory ſlowneſſe. For the Prophets tell us, that the Settlement of the glory of the Church under the Goſpell, which could not be brought to paſſe without the Settlement of Government therein, ſhould <hi>be haſtened in its own time,</hi> Iſai. 60.22. and that the promiſe of the way wherein the Juſt ſhould live by Faith, <hi>ſhould not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arry,</hi> Hab. 2.3, 4. Now that which is ſaid to be haſtined, and not delayed, cannot truly be ſaid to be ſlow: for nothing is properly ſlow which comes at his time appointed. And to make this yet more apparant, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt would ſettle as ſoon as could poſſible be, the Government of his Church: let us conſider that which in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.4. is ſaid of him, <hi>viz. That he ſhall not faile, nor be diſcouraged, till he ſet judgement in the earth.</hi> This promiſe doth aſſure us of two Things: Firſt, That Chriſt would not differ by faint-heartedneſs, or want of ſtrength, the execution of his Work; and conſequently, that he would not be ſlow in it. Secondly, That the iſſue of his Work ſhould be to ſettle judgement in the Earth, which is the effect of Church-Government: whence we may directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41545:23"/>
that the Settlement of Government in the Church, is a matter of Primary and Morall Neceſſity; becauſe without it, Chriſt could not ſettle judgement in the Earth, which was one of the ends of his Miniſtry amongſt Men.</p>
               <p>Divers other things might be Anſwered concerning this example of Chriſt, and the way of his Miniſtry amongſt the Jews (as that it was not his proper work in the fleſh, to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle another Church-Government amongſt the Jews, then that which his Father had ſettled; but that he was to be to them a Miniſter of the Circumciſion, to confirm the promiſes to the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. And that the Change of Government was the proper work of the Spirit, by which Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhould have one acceſſe to the Father, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.18. And therefore could not be done till after his Reſurrection, when the Spirit was to be ſent forth) but this will ſuffice to ſhew that it was primarily neceſſary in him to eſtabliſh his Church-Government as ſoon as could be in the ordinary way of his Miniſtry; and if Chriſt was not ſlow, but made all the ſpeed he could in his way; then every one that is to have a hand under him in the work, is to do the like; and therefore in this perſwaſion of his, I do not conceive that Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> is a Work-man approved unto God, that needeth not to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or that this perſwaſion doth come from him who hath called him to the Miniſtry. And beſides this perſwaſion, whereof I think he ought to be aſhamed, he doth alledge Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> Opinion to confirm it in ſuch a way, as is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming to him to do; who being of a different opinion from Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> not onely in that wherein he doth alledge him, to make it probable that Chriſt was ſlow, but alſo in the main and fundamentall Tenet of <hi>Eraſtus</hi> (whom Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> followes) concerning the Power of the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in Church-Matters, which I ſuppoſe Mr <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> holds to be None at all and Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> to be All in all. Who (I ſay) being thus different in opinion from him, yet ſeems to ſnatch greedily at the Shadow of a paſſage in his Sermon, which is to ſtrengthen an imaginary probability, not ſo much of a Dilatory ſlowneſs in Chriſts ſettling of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as of the Unſettling of all Spirituall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> aims at, to make the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41545:24"/>
an abſolute Church-Officer. And by this alſo it is clear; that his Aime is rather to raiſe then reſolve doubts.</p>
               <p>The fourth <hi>Section</hi> hath this Argument: If the Apoſtles in the New Teſtament, ſettled no Goſpell-Government upon any, but upon ſuch as firſt were brought under Goſpell Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by the power of the Word and and Spirit, then no Government ſhould haſtily be ſettled in this Kingdome. But the Antecedent is true: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Conſequent alſo.</p>
               <p>Now to make good the Conſequence of the Antecedent: he ſayes, if thouſands of Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gregations in this Kingdome, are not yet brought under Goſpell Obedience by the power of the Word and Spirit; then the Goſpell-Government ought not to be ſettled haſtily in this Kingdome, but thouſands of Congregations are not brought under Goſpell-Obedience: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here obſerve again, that his Argument runnes directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Goſpell-Government it ſelfe, and not againſt the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Government deſired, to be in the hands of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
               <p>But the Anſwer to the Argument is this: Although never ſo many Thouſands of Congregations are not yet brought under Goſpell-Obedience; yet it doth not follow, that ſuch as are brought under that Obedience, ſhould not be allowed by the Magiſtrate to have that Government ſettled amongſt them, ſo farre as his Authority can advance it: and if he doth but give way to the Miniſters to ſet up Chriſts Government in his Houſe, and for the outward manner of proceeding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, doth behave himſelf as a Patron of the Work; then he doth all that is required of him: But it ſeems Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> would diſſwade him from doing this: and why? Becauſe ſaith he, the Apoſtles ſettled not Goſpell-Government, till Goſpell-Obedience was wrought: Indeed this Argument may be applyed to Miniſters in their Charges, when they have to deale with a People which doth not yet profeſſe the Chriſtian Religion. But it is not appliable to a Magiſtrate, who is ſet over a People profeſſing Chriſtianity. For the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate being required, is bound in Conſcience to give way to the Kingdome of Chriſt, and without delay to further the Government thereof ſo farre as he can, as ſoon as he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41545:24"/>
of the Righteouſneſſe thereof. Do not you think that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> did well in publiſhing their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the true God, and in commanding all their Subjects to fear and reverence him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.29. &amp; 6.25. although their Subjects were not inſtructed to know him? And did not <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> well, in Authorizing <hi>Ezra</hi> to ſettle Government in the Church, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. He ſhould then have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the duty of the Civill Maigiſtrate in ſettling Church-Government, is quite another thing, then that of the Miniſter, and he contrary to his Miniſteriall Duty, intending to diſſwade the Magiſtrate from his Duty; doth alledge that which is proper onely to the Miniſter, and involves it with that which is proper to the Magiſtrate: thus a Spirit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion doth as with a Whirle-wind, drive all his thoughts to mixe di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orderly and deceitfully things of a different nature together, to lead himſelfe and others by ſome appearance of light, into the wayes of error.</p>
               <p>And as for the Second Propoſition, that there are Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Congregations, which are not yet brought under Goſpell-Obedience by the Word and Spirit, how farre this is true I know not; but I ſuſpect that he may be miſtaken in ſome ſort herein alſo; not that I intend to leſſen the opinion of great want of knowledge in many Congregations; but I ſuppoſe he means by Goſpell-Obedience, ſomething which truly I do not condemn him for ſeekimg after; but yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think it ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that before all manner of Government be ſettled any way, it muſt be had in ſuch a way as he doth imagine; and till that be ſo had, all that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe know Chriſt, ſhould be counted as Heathens and Unbelivers. That which I would ſay, is this: It is true that the Doctrine and the Conviction of the Spirit, muſt go before the ſettling of Government in a Miniſteriall way, that every one who is to be governed by the Goſpell, may out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience free willingly ſubmit himſelfe, as it is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it ſhall be in the day of Chriſts power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. But yet it is as true, that the many thouſands of Congregations in this Kingdome cannot be counted ſo ignorant, and ſo wholly deſtitute of the Spirit, that they ſhould be utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of all Goſpell-Government. It is well known, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41545:25"/>
they all know Chriſt by name, and that there is no Saviour beſides him, and that upon this ground they offer themſelves to be his Subjects, and deſire at leaſt in the outward profeſſion, to be under his Ordinances and Government. Now if this much Goſpell-Obedience be not ſome common fruit of the word &amp; of the Spirit, I would fain know of him, whence it doth proceed? Can any man ſay with any meaſure of conviction and knowledge, that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. And how is the Spirit effectuall in us? is it not by the hearing of Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. and if the word of Faith, and the work of the Spirit, be but in the meaneſt degree effectuall to work this knowledge and Conviction: if it be but as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, to bring a poor ſoul to offer it ſelfe unto Chriſt, to call him Lord; dare he reject it from the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſts Government belonging to his Miniſtry? And if he ſhould be called to a whole Flock of ſuch ſouls, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be under Chriſts Government, although they know not diſtinctly what the nature and grounds of it are; ſhould he dare to caſt them off? Truly I ſhould not dare to do ſo, leſt I ſhould offend not onely one of the little ones, but whole flocks thereof. What do I ſay then? is the Government of the Goſpell to be ſet up without preparation? ſhould all in the Congregation be promiſcuouſly admitted to all Ordinances? I ſay not ſo, but ſuch as have a Fundamentall knowledge of the Truth which is according to Godlineſſe; and being Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable in their lives, oblige themſelves profeſſedly to walk in all Gods wayes that ſhall be made known unto them: ſuch, I ſay, offering themſelves to be inſtructed and governed, may not be deſpiſed or caſt off, though very mean in judgement and other gifts, chiefly when they profeſſe a deſire to belong to the viſible Society of Saints: and you have nothing after tryall to except againſt them: For I ſuppoſe that God doth allot to every degree of Goſpell-Obedience, a proportionable degree of Goſpell-Government.</p>
               <p>As for the compariſon of a Materiall building, I admit of it, and ſay, that if they be ſo qualified, as I have ſaid they ſhould be; good Government and pains to Teach and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe them, will without noiſe of the Axe or Hammer, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſpeaks, fit them in due time to their own places in the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41545:25"/>
building. Now I am ſure all is in a confuſed heap, and it is not well poſſible, that matters can be worſe then they are, except all hopes and endeavours of advancing a Reformation be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away: nor is it the ignorant multitude that cauſeth the noiſe of the Axe or Hammer, but it is the wilfull Diſputant that declines all Government, and would have nothing ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, that he may not be under any Relation, but ſuch as he himſelf ſhall ſet up, or caſt down as he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>The Fifth <hi>Section</hi> takes an Argument from Experience, as is ſuppoſed, thus;</p>
               <p>That which in former times made the Reformation take little root, ſave in the outward and formall Obedience, is not now to be practiſed: but the ſpeedy Settlement of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Nation by the Power of the State, without the power of the Word, did this: <hi>Ergo,</hi> this is not to be Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, that ſuch ſpeed is not made in the Settlement of Government, that it ſhould proceed from the power of the State, rather then from the Word; becauſe a courſe is taken that all matters ſhall be fully debated, and determined accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rule of the Word, before the power of the State doth meddle therewith; and then when the State doth order any thing to he Practiſed, it is ſettled not as a Law of Man, but according to the Doctrine, and by the Direction of the Word.</p>
               <p>In former time, when this Nation came firſt out of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Word was not plentifully known, the Viſion was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in thoſe dayes; and there was none that had power but the State to ſettle any Government; and if the State had not done it, it is not likely that we ſhould have had at this time any Church at all.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee that our preſent Caſe, and that of former times, are different; and that the Matter which he layes to the Charge of our firſt Reformers, is miſtaken.</p>
               <p>Hitherto he hath played the Divine, drawing Arguments from matters of Religion, and how rationally he hath done this to my apprehenſion, I have declared: in his following <hi>Sections,</hi> he playes the Polititian, drawing Arguments from matters of State, and how wiſely he doth this to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41545:26"/>
in like manner I will let you know. Nor will I here inſiſt to examine all after a Syllogiſticall way, to ſee how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly he proves his Concluſion: For in matters of State it is the medium of Prudency (which here he pretends unto) which muſt give the Concuſion; therefore we will not expect Demonſtrations, but juſt and well grounded Allegations and Probabilities.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, His 8th. and 9th. <hi>Sections</hi> (which I have made the third Generall Head of his Diſcourſe) ſpeaks of our New Clergie (as he is pleaſed to call them) and endeavours to make the State jealous of them.</p>
               <p>In the 8th. <hi>Section,</hi> he ſayes, he has not yet any experiment of the New Clergy; he fears that they may incline too much to the Epiſcopall way: becauſe many are branches of the old Stock; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not ſafe to truſt Power into their hands too farre.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, that nothing is ſo difficult to Conquer, as State-Jealouſies, when Men make it a Principle of State Prudencie to be fearfull: what then is imagined whether true or falſe, that is to corrupt worldly Wiſdome, a ſufficient ground of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to take a courſe to prevent it by any thing that will do the turn, whether juſt or no. Now in true Chriſtian Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie this is not lawfull; for Charity doth not ſuſpect evill, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. and evill furniſhings are fruits of the fleſh, and follow upon ſuch Controverſies as theſe times produce, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.4. whereunto I would be ſorry that any body ſhould too deeply engage himſelf; therefore when he ſhall have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the way wherein he ſets himſelf, better then hitherto he hath done; I hope he will ſee that it doth not become a Miniſter of the Goſpell, to fortifie this corrupt Principle of State in the hearts of States-men; chiefly againſt the Miniſtry, to hinder them in the exerciſe of their Miniſteriall Charge. If the Aime of hindering a Settlement of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be not (as I conceive it is not) lawfull, then I muſt take leave to tell him; that it is not ſafe for him who is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Goſpell, to ſtrengthen the hands of worldly Men, to croſs the wayes of true Government in Chriſtianity, by giving to them ſiniſter impreſſions of his Brethren. I find that the Chriſtian Wiſdome of the State, hath Prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41545:26"/>
without any ſuch uncharitable grounds of evill ſurmiſing Policie, ſecured it ſelfe from the danger which he doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto them. For the Covenant doth oblige all Miniſters to whom any power of Government is committed, to abjure that inclination to Epiſcopacy, which he ſuſpects in his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: except then he will be ſo Uncharitable, as to ſuſpect them of Perjurie as well as of Ambition; he has no juſt cauſe to be ſo worldly wiſe, as to to perſwade States-men to violate the Tenor of their Covenant in one thing, to prevent the breach of it in another.</p>
               <p>The ninth <hi>Section</hi> drawes deeper, and ſpeaks plainer: He tells us, that Experience ſhews the <hi>remainders of Prelacy in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; that ſome ſtrive for Pre-eminencie, as the two Brethren did; that the hotteſt Controverſie is for Power, that this diſcerns diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</hi> Hence he draws two Politic Concluſions. 1 <hi>That it is not good to part with the Stakes, till the quarrell be ended.</hi> 2. <hi>Nor to give one of the Parties cauſe to think it ſelfe injuried, if all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ſhould be given to the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, if he will ſtay to ſettle all Government till there be no ambitious and aſpiring thoughts in ſome of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, he ſhall never ſettle any in our Age, nor perhaps in the following; and what although there are ſome who ſtrive as the two Brethren did for Pre eminency; is it therefore expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that the State ſhould not ſuffer any Miniſter to have the juſt power of Government belonging to his Charge? This Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie is too profound.</p>
               <p>Indeed if he had alledged ſome Experiments of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he diſſwades, to ſhew that where it hath been ſet up, ſince the beginning of the Reformation in <hi>Europe,</hi> it hath incroached upon the juſt Power of any State: or if he had ſhewed that the Fundam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntall Conſtitutions and Properties thereof, are deſtructive to Civill Jurisdiction, as may be made good of other wayes of Church-Government; (I ſay) if he had been able to alledge and ſhew any of theſe things, then indeed he had ſaid ſomething for Caution worth the hearing: but if the contrary of this may be made apparant; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the deſired Government (if rightly ſettled) is ſo farre from aſpiring to that Power which belongeth to the State; that to keep all aſpiring Spirits in awe, by the Curb of an
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41545:27"/>
Authoritative equality, and to keep all Anarchicall Spirits in Order without prejudice to Chriſtian Liberty; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this World ſo fit, as that very way of Government, which is ſued for: then ſurely he is very injuriouſly Politic in his perſwaſions, and cautions; but I ſuppoſe this may be made apparant very eaſily, therefore I excuſe him not from injurie.</p>
               <p>But I beſeech you, what is the Power ſued for by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters here? Whether is it a State Power, or a Spiritual and Congregationall Power? if it be none other then that which all the Congregationall Church-Governours challenge to themſelves by Divine Right; why is it made a matter of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter jealouſie in theſe Miniſters th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n in Others? is not the ſame Power as dangerous in the one Partie as in the other? what aſſurance can He or the Congregationall Church-Governours give, that they ſhall not abuſe their Power ſo much as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will do, ſeeing they will ſtand in all Church-Matters by themſelves alone, and not acknowledge any Eccleſiaſticall Judicature over them in doubtfull Caſes; and I doubt they will not make the Civill Magiſtrate an abſolute Judge in Church-Matters? what aſſurance then can they give, that they ſhall not abuſe their Authority? how ſhall the Subject be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from his grievances, if he be wronged by his Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall Brethren in his right to the Ordinances of Chriſt, or under a Religious pretence in ſome matter relating to his comfort, or his good name? He hath no competent Judge, but thoſe that have wronged him: Now the Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment doth yet admit of Appeals to another Judicature: <hi>viz.</hi> a Claſſis, or a Synod. And whatſoever Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> may apprehend in the depth of his Politicall Jealouſie, I weigh it not; but I am very confident, that the New Reformers never thought of that which he layes to their Charge here; <hi>namely, that they deſire a ſhare of State-Power to be committed to their hands,</hi> and that they have a quarrell about this matter with the State, is a hainous Accuſation. But whiles he endeavours to caſt this aſpertion upon others, he doth manifeſtly accuſe himſelfe, and involves thoſe for whom he pleads to be really guilty, even of that whereof he injuſtly accuſes the Reforming Miniſters: elſe how can he pretend on their behalfe, that they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41545:27"/>
have a right to this Power as wel as others? and that they wil think themſelves injured if not given? if others have no right to this Power, why ſhould they for whom he pleads pretend to it? and if they may think it an injurie to be deprived of it, then they clearly ſuppoſe, and he grants it that it is their due; and if ſo, why may not others as well as they pretend unto it? Here then in this Caſe, you may perceive that he mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and thoſe that he pleads for, pretenders to that which he allows not in others; and by his own confeſſion herein, they and he have more of the Prelatical Ambition then can be ſhewed in any Miniſter that he knows. He ſayes wel, that it is to be feared there is too much of Man in theſe Conteſtations; for this Spirit which is now in him, doth covet to envie; For he would have Power denyed to the Party he affects not, not ſo much becauſe it is not due to them; but becauſe he would not have them to have it, when it is not likely that he himſelf can obtain it; therefore he pleads, that no Power at all may be permitted to any, to ſettle any Church-Government at all. For which I ſuppoſe, none of the Churches of God, whether of the one or other way, have cauſe to give him thanks: The Papiſts who watch for our Diſſolution, and Libertines whoſe part he Acts, will thank him.</p>
               <p>I have done with his firſt point of Policy, which is to ſtirre up jealouſies againſt the New Clergie. The Second Point is Intereſt, which is two-fold to Power and in Perſons: the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to Power, hath two Conſiderations in his Diſcourſe; the one is in 7th. the other in the 10th <hi>Section.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſeventh <hi>Section</hi> tells the State, that there is danger in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, if it ſuddenly involve it ſelf into the deſignes of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Power; he ſayes, there is no danger in the not ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den incorporating the two Powers; becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> is not alive to bring the Pattern from the Mount, and a new Star may ariſe which yet appears not.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer; his Policy leads him here to be a Sceptick in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: For he Reaſons thus; ſomething may hereafter be diſcovered, which ſhall be better then what is now offered: therefore what we now allow, is not to be made uſe of. May not I ſay as well ſome New Truth may be diſcovered; <hi>Ergo,</hi> I will not profeſſe what I now know? ſome Star may ariſe, is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41545:28"/>
leſſe then what the Jews Tradition ſayes <hi>Elias</hi> will come. His ground is not ſo ſure as theirs, he tells us onely doubtfully that he may come; and then would make this a warrantable ground to ſuſpend the Settlement of an allowed Government. And is there any Reaſon in this? But what if no new Star a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe? what if theſe Confuſions grow greater, and become ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall? will not then this Policy prove folly? the ſilly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb might inſtruct him, that it is better to have half a Cake, then no Bread. But then he ſayes, there is no great danger in the not ſudden incorporating of two Powers: he takes it as granted, that the two Powers ſhould be incorporated, but that is but his fancie, and neither true Divinity nor good State Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency: the thing he aims at, is a Delay; but I may tell him, that wiſer States-Men then either He or I, wil ſay, <hi>Nocuit dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre paratis,</hi> thoſe that are ready looſe by delayes: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all this, he ſpeaks a language which I never heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in any Reformed Miniſters mouth, ſpeaking of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Miniſtry; therefore I muſt again obſerve that his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is to grant, that both Powers may be in one hand; and that the Eccleſiaſticall may have Deſignes, and be abuſed to break the Civill Power. I confeſſe, that if the Powers be as he calls them incorporated, they may be abuſed, whether they be in the hand of the Civill or Eccleſiaſticall Miniſter: but if they be kept diſtinct in Adminiſtration, as they are in nature, and co-ordinate in Authority as they are in vertue, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſubordinate to each other in Fundamentall Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as they are in their Ends; then all this fear will vaniſh: For this being granted, and Matters thus ſettled, the Eccle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall can have no deſign upon the Civill; but as long as he grants the incorporating of both into one and the ſame hand, he will never avoid this. True it is, the Papall and Prelaticall State doth incorporate both; but if he can ſhew wherein the Reforme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> do it, he ſhould have done well to have laid it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and ſuggeſted a better Remedy then the Diſſolution of all Government, which is ſo farre from a Remedy, that it is worſt of all Diſeaſes; and truly it is clear in this his Diſcourſe, and perhaps in his whole way that he practiſes for his own part, the mixture of Politicall and Eccleſiaſtiall deſigns, to make his Pen ſerve Mens turns, which how he will anſwer to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41545:28"/>
God one day, I would wiſh him to conſider ſadly if I knew him.</p>
               <p>The tenth <hi>Section,</hi> ſhews that there ought to be ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in the two Powers, and ſome Compliance; ſo that the eſtabliſhing of the one, doth draw with it ſome motions in the other. He tells us, that it is hazardous to diſ-intereſt any in the Civill part, he doth alledge <hi>France</hi> for an example, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>All this is rather againſt his main Concluſion, then for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if there ſhould be a Proportion and Compliance in both Powers; then he muſt allow the Church-Government at leaſt ſo much Settlement, as he doth the Civill, except he will poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Kingdome of Heaven to the State of the World; and if he thinks it fit, that the Eccleſiaſticall State ſhould be Unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, it may upon his grounds be rationally inferred, that in ſome proportion he thinks it fit, that the Civill alſo ſhould be wholly Unſettled; and how juſtly this may be intended by any that have ſworn to God to endeavour the Union and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdoms in Peace, I will not now debate. But all this tends in his Aime, to make way for the following and laſt <hi>Section</hi>; wherein he recommends the Intereſt of the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Brethren to the State, and gives advice to ſuſpend the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of Government ſo, as not to determine too ſuddenly into Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, in hope that their affections and judgements may be drawne to Unity; whereof in the Cloſe he would give us ſome Conjecture of poſſibility.</p>
               <p>This I do not at all diſlike, but rather approve, that if any thing ſhould move and perſwade to any delay of Settlement in Government, it ſhould be the Hope of Union betwixt the Reformers and their diſſenting Brethren; and becauſe this is now under tryall, how farre the Unity of diſſenting Parties in the Aſſembly may be gained; therefore I think it very Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall and Anſwerable to the Counſells of Peace, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be ſettled in that matter wherein the difference is, till a full triall be made of the Means of Compoſing the ſame: yet to delay the Settlement of other Matters wherein there is no difference at all, is no point of Wiſdome, except it be thought wiſdome to gratifie the deſignes of Papiſts, and hopes of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines: Nor is it Juſtice to refuſe the Settlement of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

allowed, and Voted by the State to thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be under it, becauſe there are ſome of a different way that decline it: Shall all be kept in ſuſpence and in diſorder, becauſe either there is no agreement in ſome few things, or becauſe ſome few decline all manner of Government? the Apoſtles counſell is, That ſo farre as we are come, we ſhould be like minded,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16.</note> and walk by the ſame Rule. The Intereſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Common Enemie, is not a tye ſtrong enough to Unite ſome Spirits in matters concerning God: chiefly when ſuch ſtinging Pamphlets blow the Coals of Diſſention, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controle, aſperſe injuriouſly their Brethren with falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, to entangle the ſimple conſciences with ſcruples to foment jealouſies, to flatter Worldlings into deceitfull Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and to ſtrengthen the Unruly affections of the unruly Multitude, againſt the reſpect which is to be had unto Order and Government, even with a colourable pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And although I will judge Charitably of the Mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in this Matter; yet truly his writing cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from guilt in this kind: I hear he is not a very ſtayed man, and I conceive he is led in his heat, faſter then he is able to diſcern his way, or to judge the Spirit by which he is led, which in this buſineſſe is very neceſſary to be done with great adviſedneſſe; and thoſe that in humility mind not themſelves in meddling with theſe Matters, are farre from that temper which will advance Truth and Peace; whereunto I beſeech the Lord to direct us in all meekneſſe. For from theſe we are all ſtrangers by nature, therefore we grope like blind Men for the wall, we ſtumble at noon-day as in the night, and while we look for Judgement there is none, and for ſalvation it is farre from us. The Lord be mercifull to Us, and teach us to ſtrengthen the things which Remain, which are ready to die, for our Works are not found perfect with our God. The Lord deliver us from the Line of Confuſion, which ſeemeth to be ſtretched out upon us, and heal our Breaches for Chriſt his ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <body>
                  <p>I Have done with the Two former Heads of this Diſcourſe, which in the Introduction I did propoſe unto my ſelfe to handle: the Third remaines, wherein I ſhall endeavour to be exceeding briefe: for you have ſeen the Poſitive Deciſion of the Queſtion in the Firſt Part; wherein the Neceſſity of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſome Church-Government amongſt Chriſtians in a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell-way, is made no leſſe to me then Demonſtrative: and you have ſeen the Anſwer to the Negative Deciſion of the Queſtion, in the Second Part, wherein the Sophiſtry of the contrary Arguments, and the deceitfulneſſe of that perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hath been laid open with all meekneſſe and without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality. Now if in the Third place I ſhould follow my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to ſuggeſt upon the whole matter, a word of Advice to prevent the increaſe of evills, which are like to come upon us, if Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> his ſuggeſtions take place: I muſt firſt give you a Prognoſtick of the Evils which I apprehend may enſue thereupon; and then tell you what may be adviſeable to prevent the increaſe, or the iſſue of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The Prognoſtick is this; That if the Magiſtrate of this place, who doth profeſſe the name of Chriſt, and by that profeſſion is obliged in his place to own Chriſt in his Ordinances, will not appear for the Settlement and Countenancing of the ſame effectually; that he ſhall be unſettled and caſt out of his Power and Place with utter diſgrace: and if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who pretend to adminiſter and uphold the Ordinances of Chriſts Houſe amongſt the Profeſſors of his name, will not keep the Charge of his Houſe according to his Word, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality for ſelf-ends, and without the affectation of worldly power to conſtrain Men that are not in their way, to ſubmit unto their wils; they alſo ſhall be unſettled, and all
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41545:30"/>
manner of contempt and diſgrace ſhall be powred out upon them. And by the means of theſe two Unſettlements of the Magiſtracy, and of the Miniſtry, all the foundations of all other Order and Government will be removed from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Changes and the Diſtreſſes thereof will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſſe and endleſſe, till the Candleſtick thereof be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, except God in mercy for the Elects ſake, prevent the ſame by ſome way which as yet cannot be fore-ſeen.</p>
                  <p>By this Prognoſtick, I pretend not to have any Spirit of Propheſie, which is more then ordinary; for this thing is Demonſtrable from the way of Gods Judgement, in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſinnes of Magiſtrates and Miniſters of this kind, and from the ſtate of a people in ſuch a Condition.</p>
                  <p>The way of Gods Judgement is evident, in that which was done to the Houſe of <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. till the end where the Reaſon of cutting off with utter diſgrace the Houſe of <hi>Eli,</hi> from the place which it had in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods People, is alledged to be this; that they mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their own Intereſt to make themſelves fat with the good things of Gods People, rather then to diſcharge the duty which was committed by God unto their truſt; for which cauſe it is threatned that they ſhould be deprived of their Charge, and become contemptible, becauſe the Juſtice of God did determine, that ſuch as Honoured him, God would Honour, and ſuch as deſpiſed him, ſhould be lightly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>ibid. verſ.</hi> 30. from whence we may infallibly conclude, that if the Magiſtrates and Miniſters of this Nation mind themſelves, and their own worldly Intereſts, more then the truſt committed unto them by God in their places, that they ſhall certainly be puniſhed as <hi>Eli,</hi> and his Houſe was: and J beſeech the Lord, that as in the execution of this Judgement upon the Houſe of <hi>Eli,</hi> he ſuffered his Ark (the glory of Iſrael) to be in the hands of the Philiſtims; ſo the ſpirituall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims of this Church and State, may not have the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt us to triumph over our Glory, which is the Viſible upholding of his Goſpell-Ordinances in the puritie thereof. This Prognoſtick then is very certain, and eaſie to be made by any that layes Gods wayes to heart.</p>

                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:41545:30"/>As for the other ground of the latter Part of the Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtick, relating to the Miſery of a People under ſuch Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours; it is clear in the view of all rationall Men, that can look upon a People without a Magiſtracy and a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, what their State can be: for it is certain that all the foundations of Civill and Church-Government being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, they will either remain without all Government in an Anarchicall ſtate, wherein every one will be given up into the hand of his Neighbour, to be oppreſſed and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as the Fiſhes of the Sea devour one another; or elſe (which will be a kind of Mercy) they will be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Arbitrary power of ſome Party that will be moſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and able to over-rule all the reſt, by whoſe means God (if he hath any favour in ſtore towards the Nation) happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may produce ſome Settlement which will free us from the confuſion of an Anarchy, till his Judgements in ſome other way be executed upon us.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have my Prognoſtick, and the grounds thereof, in caſe Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh's</hi> Suggeſtions take place, which is not unlikely they may, in reſpect of the wild frame whereinto God ſuffers Mens Spirits to runne now adayes, and in reſpect that the Reins of Government begin to be looſened every where, and becauſe I believe that Mr. <hi>Satlmarſh</hi> hath not ſhot theſe Arrows againſt all Settlement of Government, ſo much out of his own private Quiver, as out of the Senſe and Counſells of a Party, which doth ſtrongly Act by thoſe Principles (wherewith they have prompted him, and to vent which they make uſe onely of his Pen) towards our utter Unſettlement, by a Method of deceitfulneſſe, which upon the whimſicall humours of this Age, may become pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to diſturbe all other reſolutions and attempts of all Orderly Courſes and Eſtabliſhments.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſuggeſt a matter of Advice, either to prevent the increaſe, or to divert the ſmall iſſue of theſe evills; I ſhall do it as briefly as I can, becauſe I dare not take upon me to go beyond my line.</p>
                  <p>To prevent the increaſe of preſent Unſettlements in Church-Government, the way is not for the Miniſtry to get
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41545:31"/>
power from the Civill Magiſtrate, to preſſe all the Sanctions of the Aſſembly of Divines, without any abatement upon all the Congregations of the Nation, ſo that none ſhall be ſuffered to have any Religious liberty of profeſſing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell in Publique, that come not under this Rule by way of Conformity, which ſeems to be the clear Deſign of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of that Party which in the Houſe, and in the Aſſembly of Divines, doth go along with them: I ſay, that this is not, and will not be the way of Settlement; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not the Goſpell-way which Chriſt hath inſtituted, to which onely he hath promiſed a bleſſing: and becauſe the forwardneſſe of this Party to ſettle things in this way, comes not from a pure zeal to Religion, but involves a State-Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, which thoſe of the Houſe intend to carry along with it, which an oppoſite Party hath diſcovered, and will oppoſe to the uttermoſt, though all ſhould be Unſettled and go to rack by this means; and who knows whether Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi>'s Query, is not the effect of that Reſolution, which is taken amongſt them to croſſe the Deſigns of that other Party; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the proſecution of a Settlement in that way, wil produce rather ſtrife and oppoſition, then any other effect.</p>
                  <p>Nor will the way of Settlement in Church-Government be, that which ſome others ſeem to preſſe with no leſſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs; namely to give all the Power of Church affairs up into the hands of the Civill Magiſtrate, <hi>qua</hi> Magiſtrate; that he may Order the ſpirituall Concernments of Gods Houſe Authoritatively, as he ſhall think good; and that no wayes of Church-Diſcipline ſhould be adminiſtred by any, nor means of Edification ſet a work but in his name: I ſay, this will no more then the other produce a Settlement in Church-Government; becauſe all Parties that are moſt intelligent in the way of Godlineſſe, and zealous for the liberty of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, will joyntly oppoſe ſuch an abſolute power in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Magiſtate over the Churches which are to be ruled by none in matters of Conſcience, but by the Laws and Orders of Chriſt, and upon a free willing account, that the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Churches ſhould without conſtraint give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up thereunto, according to that of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>In the

day of thy power they ſhall be willing in the beauties of Holineſs:</hi> What way then ſoever is taken, which doth not work the Profeſſors to a willingneſs to come under the power of Chriſt in the beauties of Holineſſe, is not that which will be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to bring about a Settlement. So that it is neither by the power in the hands of the Miniſters, nor in the hands of the Magiſtrates that will do the Work; but it muſt be by a clear and gentle leading of Mens Spirits, to come willingly under the Yoke of Chriſt; and except the Godly Miniſters can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree amongſt themſelves, to hold forth the Duties of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and the Rules of Diſcipline, as they are in the Word evidently ſet forth, and leave of Conteſting about the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Circumſtantials and Prudentiall way of acting, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a latitude to each other, and conſent to a mutuall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance therein; and ſo upon the account of Charity make up the differences, and mind the ſame thing one towards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and joyntly deſire the Countenance of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, by way of his approbation onely, and not by way of Delegate Power to conſtrain others unto their way; except I ſay, the Godly Miniſters amongſt themſelves can thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate their Matters, the Unſettlement of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will never be prevented; and if there can be no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this nature procured amongſt the Miniſters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without the Politic actings of States-men, who have alwaies ſome worldly Deſigns to Byas their Reſolutions; the iſſue of the Unſettlement, will either be a totall Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the bonds and tyes of Church-fellowſhip amongſt the Profeſſors, or the opening of a door to all Adverſaries to break in upon their Societies, and to all licentiouſneſs, to break forth amongſt themſelves without controle, the iſſue whereof will be the utter contempt of all Miniſtry and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; and therewith the breaking in of all damnable Hereſies, which will make way for the increaſe of Prophaneſs of Idolatry, of Popery, of Atheiſme, and of all Blaſphemous abominations.</p>
                  <p>Now if no agreement can be found amongſt the Miniſters themſelves, to prevent the Unſettlement from whence theſe evils will certainly ſpring up, (which is the onely Advice
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41545:32"/>
that I can give in this preſent Caſe) then to divert the iſſue which theſe evils will produce unto the Nation, I know none other Remedie, but that the Civill Magiſtrate ſhould by way of fore-ſight, eſtabliſh Morall Laws to repreſs groſſe diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs of life by corporall puniſhments, to reſtrain open prophaneſs in violating the Lords Day, to inhib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I Rejoyce greatly to ſee the fram of your Spirit ſo Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Rules of our Holy Profeſſion: Mr. <hi>Hartlib</hi> hath acquainted me with the real effects of your Godly zeal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Publique Good, and every good Work, for which you are much to be commended, and on your behalf, ſuch as know You (conſidering how few there are of ſuch a temper now adayes) ought to give thanks unto God for your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, to further the Means which may be uſeful to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his Glory. Amongſt other good Effects of your pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, the thoughts which you entertain, to further the wayes of Peace, amongſt the diſtracted Churches of this Land, are not the leaſt commendable; would to God we could find many of your temper, who have ſome intereſt and influence upon the Churches: but the Truth is, that none are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, but ſuch as follow particular Intereſt, and make it their work to bring Fuell to the Fire which doth conſume us, by matters of complaint or reproach caſt upon their Neighbours; all ſides in every thing ſtriving for victory, none for gaining others in the manifeſtation of Truth, through love and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance.</p>
                  <p>The Aime which you have in the Diſcourſe, which Mr. <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lib</hi> hath ſent me, is exceeding good; although I had ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to read your Hand, yet I made a ſhift to underſtand your meaning; and I ſhall willingly give my approbation to your Propoſals, if we can find out the way to obtain the effect thereof, which I conceive to be an Unblamable Freedom in ſome matters of Difference, which are Extrafundamentall, grounded upon a reall acknowledgement of an Agreement in all matters which are Fundamentall. You have ſet down the Heads of things, which you judge Fundamental and neceſſary for ſalvation to be believed, and Overtures concerning Duties of Forbearance in ſome doubtfull Practiſes which occaſion much debate amongſt thoſe that love to abound in their own ſenſe; and concerning the obſervance of ſome inqueſtionable

berty for any ſide, to practiſe what is good in their own eyes; but that hath not made any ſide truly peaceable, but rather increaſed the Diviſions, by the abuſe of their Liberty, in croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, oppoſing, and offending others in their different wayes; whence Scandals are multiplied, bitter Diſputes, Complaints, Irritations, and Heart-burnings increaſed. Now how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in time to come this Abuſe of Liberty, which according to your Propoſals ſhould be granted, wil be the main and moſt difficult work of all; and I find nothing ſuggeſted in your Paper concerning this, and without ſome Remedie to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of our Spirits, I cannot perceive that our Maladies can be cured.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto I have made doubts, and ſhewed you what I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend as an Impediment to the effect of your deſires. Now I ſhall alſo ſuggeſt ſomething, which may tend to the removall of theſe Doubts, and Impediments of this Work, which we deſire to advance.</p>
                  <p>I muſt lay this as a Ground, that in matters of Outward and Publique Concernment to the Society of Man-kind; the Magiſtrate is Principally to be reſpected, and to be ſued unto for his aſſiſtance: but in matters which concern the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence immediately, the Word of God is alone to be made uſe of. If therefore Men in their Outward Actions miſ-behave themſelves, and do things prejudicially unto the Peace of their Neighbours; they fall under the Cognizance of the Civil Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, who may make Lawes to reſtrain them from giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence unto their Neighbours: but if they walk orderly, and offend no body; and yet foment pernicious Errors, and ſpread them ſecretly or openly, to the diſturbance of Mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the ſeduction of the weak, they cannot be otherwiſe dealt withall, but by the Word of God; and the Magiſtrate ought to ſee this done effectually, till they be Converted or Convicted to be incorrigible; and then he is to do further, as his Conſcience ſhall direct him. The Magiſtrate hath a Right to Over-ſee all Mens outward Actions, and may call them to an account of their proceedings in what they do, as Men; and may reſtrain them from doing that which he doth think prejudiciall to the Peace of other Subjects: but the Magiſtrate hath no Power to impoſe upon any Mans Conſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                     </gap>e any

thing by Law; onely he may and ought to uſe Means to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict Men by the Word of God; and he ſhould Countenance and Over-ſee the Regular wayes of ſettling thoſe Meanes a work. For God hath made him a Nurſing Father to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; therefore as ſuch he ought to have an inſight of all their wayes, to protect them from harm, and to advance unto them the comforts of their life. Now the life of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as ſuch is the freedom of their Spirit, to ſerve him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably according to his will. Whatſoever then doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of this Freedom, he may not impoſe upon them, for this were to bring their Spirits in bongage under his will: now he is not the Father of their Spirits; (that is Gods alone Prerogative) therefore he may not do any thing to hinder, but ought to do all things to further their free accceſs towards him. All his care muſt be then, as he is a Nurſing Father of Gods Children, to provide for theſe things. 1. Firſt, To know who are the Children of God, whom he ſhould Nurſe, that he may diſtinguiſh them from ſtrangers. 2. What the proper work of his Nurſing Dutie is towards them; that is to ſay, What his Aime as a Chriſtian Magiſtrate ſhould be, above which he ſhould not preſume to take upon him. 3. How he ſhold endeavour to perform the Duties ſubordinate unto his Aime. To ſpeak in a word my ſenſe (that if you pleaſe you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with me about them.) I ſhall ſay of the firſt, that he muſt know and diſcern the Children of God from ſtrangers, by this infallible Token; Whoſoever doth acknowledge Jeſus Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, and doth hear the Words of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and doth ſubmit himſelf to be guided in his profeſſion of Chriſtianity by their Directions, and doth wear in all his wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Chriſts Livery, which is Love, Holineſſe, and Meekneſſe, he is to be counted a true Child of God, as to the Outward Profeſſion of Religion; and whoſoever doth not this, he is to be counted a ſtranger to it. And this badge of Religious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, may make a Nationall Church as to the Magiſtrate: for I do not ſee, that a Church can be counted otherwiſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall, but in reference to him; nor ought he to diſcern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors by any other token, but by this: this then is the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Nationall Church to me; namely if a whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth make this Profeſſion; and if he that is the Magiſtrate

of that Nation, doth make the ſame profeſſion; he cannot but look upon himſelf in his Charge, as a Nurſing Father to them all alike: for whatſoever their particular differences other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe may be amongſt themſelves, which deſtroy not this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, they are to him no more but as the ſeverall Statures or Features, or Lineaments of thoſe Childrens bodyes and faces, which in his Nurſing Care muſt make no materiall difference.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the Second, which is his Aime above which he may not preſume to take upon him in the diſcharge of his Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Duty; I conceive it ſhould be to Over-ſee their wayes in the Viſible Profeſſion, that the freedom due to all may be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in every one; and that the Unity of the Spirit of Chriſt, and the love which ought to be amongſt Brethren, Children of the ſame Father, may be upheld without diſturbance in all. Above this, I ſuppoſe he may not preſume, nor take upon him to preſcribe any thing of Faith, or of Worſhip Authoritative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; or to reſtrain Authoritatively the Exerciſes which may be ſervicable thereunto. For he is not the Judge of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Faith, and of their reſpect unto their Father, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and them; for the Powers of the Spirituall life, by which Mens ſouls act towards God, are not committed to his Nurſing Care; Chriſt is their Tutor in this thing, but the over-ſight of the Outward Profeſſion in the Body, is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and recommended to him.</p>
                  <p>As for the Queſtion, What he ſhould do with thoſe that are ſtrangers, and what his relation is unto them? how far he is to look unto ther Profeſſion, and to what end? I wil not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it now, for it doth not concern our preſent purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The Third thing belonging to his Nurſing Care; is, to know how the Duties ſhould be performed, which are ſubordinate unto this Aime. The Duties are mainly Two: Firſt, To take away the Lets and Diſturbances of the Publique Freedom, in the profeſſion of the Name of Chriſt, and of the Obedience due to his Ordinances. Secondly, To ſupply all Comforts, all Helps and Encouragements which may further the growth of the Profeſſors in Knowledge, Unity, and Love one towards another; and the way to endeavour theſe Duties, is to be Nurſe-like, with much tenderneſſe of affection, without harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or imperiouſneſſe to over-awe their Spirits; and without
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41545:35"/>
Worldly and Politick Aims, to put a ſnare upon them, or make uſe of them, and of their Profeſſion, for Humane Advantages and worldly Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>I have enlarged my ſelf upon this Diſcourſe, to lay it as a Ground of what I am to adviſe for the Cure of our Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the proſecution of your Aime in the Diſcourſe which is ſent me.</p>
                  <p>I conceive then, that the Magiſtrate ſhould be Petitioned by all that profeſſe the Name of Chriſt; for that Liberty which is neceſſary for their Edification in the uſe of Chriſts Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and not offenſive unto any. Unto this Petition, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhould give his Approbation, and promiſe his protection to all ſuch as ſhal ſhew him, that they endeavour to walk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame in the wayes of Chriſt by the Word. And upon this Declaration, he ſhould invite all thoſe that make the Word their Rule, to offer unto him from the Word, the ſubſtance of their Faith, and of their practiſe Poſitively:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15</note> by this invitation every one wil be bound to lay himſelf open; for all Chriſtians are obliged to walk in the light, and to be ready to give an Anſwer to every one that asketh of them, a reaſon of the Hope that is in them.</p>
                  <p>Here obſerve, that I would not have the Magiſtrate to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon any, that which he doth think Fundamentall in Faith or Practiſe (for that belongs unto him no more, then to a Nurſe to ſhape the face of a Child committed to her Care, otherwiſe their God hath made it;) but he is onely to take notice of that which others think to themſelves in their way, according to the Scriptures to be Fundamentall. Here then your Diſcourſe might be preſented to him, for your ſelf and others, that ſhould reſolve to make it the Plat-form of their Profeſſion; but for him to propoſe it unto all, or to diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance all that ſhould not reſolve to follow it, that would be ſomewhat beyond his Commiſſion as I conceive.</p>
                  <p>Now when all the Parties ſhall have given up the poſitive Declarations of their Faith and Practiſe, which they conceive agreeable to the Word; and when he hath ſatisfied his own Judgement therein, that there is nothing in them deſtructive unto Godlineſs and the publique Peace; he ought to give them a ſtrict charge, not to be injurious and offenſive one unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41545:36"/>
but to ſeek Peace and follow after it, threatning ſuch as ſhall be diſturbers of the Peace of others with juſt Correction, after the firſt and ſecond Admonition. By this means he will diſcharge the Firſt part of his Duty, which is to ſecure the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Gods Children in the ſervice due unto him, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting them from injuries in their ſeverall Wayes: but if he doth think himſelf bound in conſcience to endeavour alſo the Second part of his Duty, which is to ſupply unto the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God, the Helps and Comforts which may fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ther their growth in Knowledge, Unity, and Love, (which I conceive, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> more ſolemnly obliged to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, then ever any Chriſtian Magiſtrate in this world hath been;) if I ſay, our Magiſtrate doth think himſelf bound to this, not onely by the property of his Calling, but by ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Covenant towards God, and with their Neighbours; then I would adviſe him to take this Courſe. 1. Firſt to allow of Regular Meetings, between Parties for Publique or Private Conferences, wherein all offenſiveneſſe of ſpeech or behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, ſhould be ſtrictly prohibited under ſevere Penalties. (as for the waies how to Order theſe Meetings for Edification, that may be ſpoken of at another time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2ly. To employ ſome fit perſons from among themſelves, to perſwade the reſt, or to ſtir them up to conſider of Waies how their differences may be Compoſed, and the Unity of the Spirit more clearly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, and the bonds of Peace and Love more firmly eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt them, then by the meer Authority of a Civil San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For it is a ſhame to Chriſtians, who are called to be Members of one another, that nothing ſhould be able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie them, but the reſtraint of Power keeping them from mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall injuries.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, I would adviſe him to require of every Party, that they ſhould declare that wherein they agree with others in Doctrine, and in Practiſe: and to make kown the Rules by which they deſire to walk towards thoſe with whom they agree in Fundamentalls, for their mutuall Edification, that the Communion and Uniformity which ought to be amongſt Gods Children, in the ſervice of one Maſter, may not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ſo farre as it can be entertained.</p>

he ſhould ſet ſome of the choiſeſt Men of each Party, one or two a work, to gather out of all theſe Declarations, the Tenor of the common conſent and Agreement of all Parties, ſo near as can be in their own words, or fully in their own words by way of Harmony: and to conſult about the things wherein there is a Difference remaining how it may be taken away; or to give Reaſons from the Word of God, why that it ought not to make a breach of Unity in the affections of Profeſſors, and when this Harmony; theſe Conſultations and Reaſons ſhould be perfited, they might be diſcreetly imparted unto the ſeveral Churches, to be conſidered for the End whereunto they were made.</p>
                  <p>Here again you ſee, that I would have the Magiſtrate to be very active and zealous, but yet ſtill within his own Sphere and line, as a Nurſe, and not as a Commander and Maſter of any Mans Faith and Religion: as one that leads them, and encourageth them all alike unto the obſervation of clear Duties, which they themſelves ſhall acknowledge to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable; and not as one that impoſeth his own Will and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes upon them as a Yoke. And by this meanes, the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is upon him in the Nationall Covenant, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure one Confeſſion of Faith, Leiturgie, Catechiſme, Form of Worſhip, Government and Diſcipline may be without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty diſcharged, and the things already done by the Aſſembly of Divines, may ſtand in their own place, and be of force for the uſe of ſuch as will own them; and others ſhall be free from Conſtraint, and at a due Liberty to walk in their own light, onely with this Proviſo, that they ſhall not moleſt any, no more then they deſire to be moleſted; and that they ſhall declare their Fundamentall Agreement with their Brethren, and their Reſolution to walk in the Unity of the Spirit with them therein, which will be a meanes to diſcharge the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Parliament, alſo in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  <p>By this Method and way of proceeding, I ſuppoſe all the Difficulties which in the beginning of this Diſcourſe I did mention, may be avoided: Onely this will for the preſent remain to be thought upon. How to waken the Conſcience

of the Magiſtrate to Reſent theſe Duties; and how to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate theſe Suggeſtions ſo unto him, as that they may come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to be Conſidered and examined; and by faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Agents brought to ſome effectuall Reſult. Now the God of all Peace and Comfort, lead the Children of Peace in his Truth, to be unblamable untill the Day of his appearing, and make us ſervicable unto the Kingdom of his Sonne, with all our Talents in our Generation.
