            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat there are Witches (in the common signification of the word) hath been confidently asserted, and as briskly opposed by the ingenious Penns of several modern Authors: Henceforwards none need doubt of it, that have but Faith enough to credit our relation of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adventure; whereby we seek not to commit a Rape on any mans belief: But if any will persist in a state of infidelity, we leave them to be converted from their Errors by the horrors of some such like gastly Apparition.</p>
            <p>'Tis something above a Moneth ago, that having trifled away the

best part of a Morning, in amusing my self with Doctor <hi>Dee's</hi> Legend of Spirits; I resolved on a walk to dissipate those vain ridiculous ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, which had thence invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Brain: To this purpose, I carelesly steer'd my course to a small Grove, whose stately Trees view their Branches in the Christal streams of a Neighbouring Brook. In which pleasing solitude I had not wandred half an hour, but a sudden drowsiness seized my Spirits, and I perceived an intruding Broomstaffe that violently thrust it self between my Legs, making me (spight of my Teeth) bestride it; mounted (like a delinqent Souldier) on the wooden <hi>Pegasus</hi>: I presently felt my self fly swister than a <hi>Parthian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row through the yielding Air, and without remembring the place where I was taken up, was set down again on my feet in the midst

of a vast desart; where I could find no path, seeing there no footsteps of humanity: I presently fancied it to be some new World, and like an adventrous <hi>Columbus</hi> would needs discover further, but all my strugling endeavours only satisfied me in the impossibility of getting forwards, and to add to my asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, in a moment (as if I had journyed to the Antipodes) Noon was turn'd to midnight, I saw the Stars shine in the Firmament, with a faint blewish Fire like wasted Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles sunk into their Sockets, the Moon was in her full, but paler much than ordinary, she was thrice Ecclipsed, and thrice sunk down below her Circle: The murmuring fountains were now grown mute, and the Birds had forgot their Chattering; not a Cock durst crow, and yet the Lions throughout the Wood trembled like the leaves of

He kist thrice the floor of his Grot with a kind of supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Reverence, and having pulled off his right foot shoe, and flung it over his left Shoulder, and grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling brought out certain words from the bottom of his Stomack; he went backwards Nine paces, till he came under the Boughs of an old Oak over-run with Misseltoe, Four foot from which he drew three Circles one within the other, and the Earth obedient to his Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick charms, which ready trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, put her self into those figures, which he designed to have made in her. In these Circles he wrote with his Middle finger, the names of the intelligences, as well of the age and Country as of the Year, Season, Moneth, Weak, Day, Hour and Minute, each in its different Character and proper place, every one under its constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,

and with their respective due Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>This tedious operation being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spacht, he put his Glass in the midst of the Circles, and opening it made a report louder than that of Cannon or Thunder, the small sharp end of his Rod, he plac'd between his fore-teeth, lay down with his face towards the East, and betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his Repose; I (who you may think at that time had little mind to sleep) watch't him very narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, admiring what might be the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot of so many strange formalities: about the midst of his Nap (which exceeded not half an hour) I saw Seven Fearn-seeds drop into the Vial, which when he waked he took out, and put two in each Ear, another into his Mouth, the Sixth again into the Glass, and the last he threw out of the Circles; but no

sooner was it out of his Hand, but I saw it incompassed by more than a Million (if my Arithmetick fail me not) of Mal-ominous Creatures, as well insects as others: He touch'd with his inchanting Caduceus, an Owl, a Fox and a Mole, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a frightful Noise, instantly flung themselves into the Innermost Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; And he with no less speed began to rip open their bodies with a brass Knife, and taking out their Hearts, he wrapt them up in three Bayleaves, and a litte Moss, &amp; swallowed them, he took away their livers, which he squeezd over an Hexagonal Vessel, and then reiterating the suffumiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, mixt the Dew and the Blood together in a Bason, dipt in it a Glove of Virgin Parchment, which he put on his right Hand, and after Four or Five horrible howlings, closed his Eyes, and thus began his invocations.</p>
