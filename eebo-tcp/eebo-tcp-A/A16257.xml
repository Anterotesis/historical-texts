         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

pleaſaunt ayre, and paſſe the time vpon

prouiding for our future voyage. Thus
he, with the duke <hi>Parmenion,</hi> and the

reſt the reuerende aſhes of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noumed

a good ſpace, were not gone farre
from the Citie, but that they came to
the ſide of a Gardeyn, wherein they
heard gracious and ioyous feaſting of
young Gentlemen, dames, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels:
There the ayre did all reſounde
with the noyſe of ſundrie inſtruments,
and as it were of Angelicall voyces,
entring with ſwéete delighte into the
hearts of them, to whoſe eares it came:
the whiche noyſe it pleaſed <hi>Philocopo</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:9837:6"/>
to ſtaye a while to heare, to the ende
his former Melancolie thoroughe the

reſtrayned theyr talke. And whyleſt
Fortune helde thus <hi>Philocopo</hi> and his

liſtening, a yong gentleman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
foorth thereof, eſpied them, &amp; forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
by ſighte, porte and viſage, knew
them to be noble gentlemen, &amp; worthy
to be reuerenced. Wherfore he without
tariaunce, returned to his company, and
ſayde: Come, let vs goe welcome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
yong men, ſéeming to be gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of great calling, the whiche per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
baſhfull to enter herein, not being
bidden, ſtay without, giuing eare to our
dyſporte. The companions then of this
Gentleman lefte their Ladies at their
paſtime, and went foorth of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and came to <hi>Philocopo,</hi> whome
by ſighte they knew too bée chiefe of
all the reſte, to whome they ſpake with
that reuerence their reaſon coulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe,
and that was moſt conuenient for
the welcoming of ſuch a gueſt, praying
<pb facs="tcp:9837:7"/>
him that in honour and increaſe of this
their Feaſt, it would pleaſe him and his
companions to enter with them the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
conſtrayning him through many
requeſts, that he ſhould in no wiſe denie
them this curteſy. Theſe ſwéete prayers
ſo pierced the gentle heart of <hi>Philocopo,</hi>
and no leſſe the hearts of his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that he anſwered the intreators in
this ſort: Friends, of truth ſuch a Feaſt
was of vs neither ſoughte for, nor fled
from, but like weather beaten mates
caſt into your port, we to the ende to flée
drouſte thoughts, which ſpring of ydle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
didde in reciting our aduerſities,
paſſe by theſe ſea banks: But how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
hath allured vs to giue eare vnto
you I know not, vnleſſe as we thinke,
deſirous to remoue from vs all penſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſhe hath of you, in whom I know
to be infinite curteſie, made vs this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer:
and therfore we will ſatiſfie your
deſire, though peraduenture in part we
become ſomewhat laueſſe of the curteſie
which otherwiſe towards others ought
to procéede from vs. And thus talking,
they entred togither into the Garden,
<pb facs="tcp:9837:7"/>
wheras they founde many fayre Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen,
of whom they were very
graciouſly receiued, and by them welco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to their feaſt. After <hi>Philocopo</hi> had
a good while behelde this their feaſting,
and likewiſe had feaſted with them, he
thought it good to depart, and willing to
take his leaue of the yong Gentlemen,
and to giue them thanks for the honor
he had receiued, one Lady more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
than the reſt, indued with maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
beautie and vertue, came foorth
where he ſtode, and thus ſayd vnto him:
Moſt noble Syr, ye haue this morning
through this your great curteſie, ſhewed
no ſmal pleaſure to theſe yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
for the which they ſhalbe alwayes
beholding vnto you, that is to wit, in
that you haue voucheſafed to come to
honor this our feaſt. May it pleaſe you
then, not to refuſe to ſhew vnto me, and
to theſe other Dames, that fauor that
I am ſecondarily to intreate you for:
To whome <hi>Philocopo</hi> with a ſwéete
voyce anſwered: Moſt gentle Lady, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
maye iuſtly be denied you, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
therefore, for both I and theſe
<pb facs="tcp:9837:8"/>
my companions are all preſt at your
will: To whom the Lady ſayde in this
wyſe: Foraſmuche as this your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
hath increaſed this our feaſting,
with a moſt noble and goodly companie,
I ſhal deſire you that you will not with
departure leſſen the ſame, but rather
helpe vs here to ſpende this day euen
to the laſte houre, to that ende we haue
already begonne the ſame. <hi>Philocopo</hi>
behelde hir in the face as ſhe thus ſpake,
and ſéeing hir eyes replete with bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
rayes to twinkle lyke vnto the
morning ſtarre, and hir face exceading
pleaſaunt and faire, thoughte neuer to
had ſéene (his <hi>Biancofiore</hi> excepted) ſo
faire a creature: to whoſe demaund he
thus made aunſwere: Madame I ſhall
diſpoſe my ſelf to ſatiſfie rather your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
than mine owne, wherefore ſo long
as it ſhall pleaſe you, ſo long will I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
with you, and theſe my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
alſo: The Ladye gaue him greate
thanks, and retourning to the others,
began togethers with them all to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
merry. <hi>Philocopo</hi> abiding with them
in this ſorte, entred greate familiaritie
<pb facs="tcp:9837:8"/>
with a young Gentleman named <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leone,</hi>
adorned with good qualities, and
of a ſinguler eloquence, to whome in
talking he ſayde thus: Oh, how muche
are you more than any others beholding
to the immortall Gods, the whiche pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
you quiet in one will in this your
mirth making. We acknowledge vs
to be greatly bounden vnto them, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Galeone.</hi> But what occaſion
moueth you to ſay this? <hi>Philocopo</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered:
Truely none other occaſion,
but that I ſée you all here aſſembled
in one will. Oh, ſayde <hi>Galeone,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle
not at all thereat, for this Lady
in whome all excellencie dothe reſte,
both moueth vs herevnto, and holdeth
vs herein. Then demaunded <hi>Philocopo:</hi>
And this Lady, who is ſhe? <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leone</hi>
aunſwered: It is ſhe that made
requeſt vnto you that ye woulde tarry
here, when as a while ſince ye woulde
haue departed. By ſight ſhe ſemeth vnto
vnto me (ſayd <hi>Philocopo</hi>) exceding faire,
and of a ſurmounting worthineſſe: but
yet if my demaund be not vnléefull, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
hir name vnto me, of whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhe is,
<pb facs="tcp:9837:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and of what Parentes diſcended. To
whom <hi>Galeone</hi> anſwered: No wayes
maye your requeſt bée vniuſt, beſides
there is none publiquely talking of hir,
which doth not vouchſafe to publiſh the
renoume of ſo worthy a Lady, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall fully ſatiſfie your demaund.
Hir name is of vs here called <hi>Fiametta,</hi>
howbeit the greateſt part of the people
call hir by the name of hir, throughe
whom that wounde is ſhut vp, that the
preuarication of the firſt mother ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
She is the daughter of a moſt high
Prince, vnder whoſe ſcepter theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
are quietly gouerned, ſhe is alſo
Lady to vs all: and briefly, there is no
vertue that ought to be in a noble heart,
that is not in hirs. And as I thinke, in
tarying this day with vs, you ſhall haue
good experience therof. That which you
ſay (ſayde <hi>Philocopo</hi>) can not be hidden
in hir ſemblance. The gods guide hir
to that ende that hir ſingular giftes do
merite, for aſſuredly I beléeue both that
and much more than you haue affirmed.
But theſe other dames, who are they?
Theſe Gentlewomen (ſayde <hi>Galeone</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:9837:9"/>
ſome of them are of <hi>Parthenope,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſome of places elſe where, commen
as are you your ſelues, hither into hir
company. And after they had thus helde
talke a good ſpace, <hi>Galeone</hi> ſayde: Ah
my ſwéete friende, if it mighte not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
you, it ſhould be very acceptable
vnto me to know further of your ſtate
and condition, than your outwarde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
repreſenteth, to the ende that
by knowing you, we maye do you that
honor you worthily merit, bicauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
want of knowledge bringeth lack
of duetie, to them that honour others in
not doing their due reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. To whom
<hi>Philocopo</hi> aunſwered: no lacke in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me reuerence coulde any ways hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
on your behalfe, but rather ye haue
therin ſo far excéeded, as with exceſſe ye
haue paſſed the bounds &amp; limits therof.
But ſince you deſire to know further of
my condition, it ſhould be vniuſt not to
ſatiſfie your deſire therein. And therfore
(in how muche it is lawfull for me to
diſcouer) I ſhall tell you: I am a poore
Pilgrim of Loue, and goe ſéeking as ye
ſée, a Lady of mine, taken away from
<pb facs="tcp:9837:10"/>
me by ſubtile cautele by my Parents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and theſe Gentlemen whom ye ſée with
me, of their curteſie kéepe me compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
in this my Pilgrimage: and my
name is <hi>Philocopo,</hi> of Nation a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,
driuen through tempeſtuous we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(ſéeking for the Ilande of <hi>Cicilia</hi>)
into your Ports. But he knew not ſo
couertly to talke, as that the yong Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
vnderſtoode not more of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
than he willingly deſired he
ſhould: and hauing compaſſion of thoſe
his harde happes, ſomewhat comforted
him with woordes, whiche promiſed
him hereafter a more luckie life, and
from that time forwards to increaſe his
honour, willed that he ſhoulde be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of them all, not as a Pilgrim, or as
a bidden gueſt, but rather as the chiefe
and principall patrone of the feaſt. The
Lady, who vnderſtood his ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
through the report of <hi>Galeone,</hi>
estéeming derely of ſuch an happe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
ſpecially that ſo it ſhoulde be.
<hi>Apollo</hi> was now with his Chariot of
light mounted to the Meridian circle,
and did ſcarcely behold with leueled eye
<pb facs="tcp:9837:10"/>
the new apparelled earth, when as theſe
Dames, Damſels, and yong gentlemen
béeing thus aſſembled togither in that
place, (ſetting their feaſting aparte) ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
forth by ſundry quarters of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the delightfull ſhade, and fleing the
noyſome heat that might offend their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
bodies, toke by diuers companies,
diuers delightes. And the Ladie accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with foure others, toke <hi>Philoco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po</hi>
by the hand, ſaying: Sir, the heat doth
conſtraine vs to ſéeke out the freſh aire,
let vs therfore go to yonder medow you
ſée here before vs, and there with ſundry
diſcourſes, paſſe ouer the heat of the day.
<hi>Philocopo</hi> then greatly praiſed the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
deuiſe, and folowed hir motion, and
with him his companions. <hi>Galeone</hi> alſo
with two others, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with them to the
appointed medow, which was excéeding
fair of graſſe and floures, and filled with
a ſwéete ſuauitie of ſmels, about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which
grewe ſtore of yong trées very faire and
thicke of gréene leaues, wherewith the
place was defended from the parching
beames of the great planet. There was
in the middeſt of that medowe a propre
<pb facs="tcp:9837:11"/>
Fountain, very faire &amp; cleare like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall,
about the which they all ſate them
downe, where ſome gaſing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water,
and other ſome gathering floures, they
began to talke of ſundry matters. But
bicauſe ſometimes at vnwares, the one
did interrupt the others Tale, the fayre
Ladie ſayd vnto them thus: To the ende
that this our diſcourſe may procéede in a
more better order, and ſo continue vntill
the freſhe coole houres, the which we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for our further feaſting. Let vs or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
one of vs in place of our king, to
whome eche one ſhal propound a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Loue, and ſhall receiue from hint
an apt reſolution thereof: and truely (as
I think) we ſhal no ſooner haue made an
end of our Queſtions, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the heat (we
not knowing how) ſhall be paſt, and the
time ſpent to our profit and delite. This
deuiſe pleaſed them al, and among them
it was ſayd: Let ther be a king: and with
one voice they all choſe <hi>Aſchalion</hi> to
their king, for that he was ſomewhat
more growne in yeres, than was any of
the reſt: To whom he made anſwer, to
be altogither inſufficient for ſo great an
<pb facs="tcp:9837:11"/>
office, bicauſe he had ſpent more yeres in
the ſeruice of <hi>Mars,</hi> than of <hi>Venus.</hi> But
yet he prayed them all to leaue vnto him
the Election of ſuche a King. They that
thought him to be ſuche a one (knowing
ſo wel before hand the qualities of them
all) as would conſtitute one ſuche, as
ſhould yeld true anſwer to all theyr de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes,
did then wholly conſent that
the Election ſhuld fréely be remitted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

dignitie vpon himſelf.<note place="margin">Fiametta cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Queene to define the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> 
               <hi>Aſcalion</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> roſe
him vp, and gathered certaine twigges
of a greene Laurel, the ſhade wherof did
ouerſpread the freſh fountaine, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
made a riche Coronet, the which he
brought in preſence of them all, and ſaid
in this wiſe: from the time that I in my
moſt youthful yeares began to haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
I ſwere by thoſe gods who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
I worſhip, that I do not reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber to haue

ſort, as we ought neuer to forget y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame.
And bicauſe ſhe (as w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out dout I know)
<pb facs="tcp:9837:12"/>
is plentifully endued wyth euery good
grace, adorned bothe with beautie &amp; good
qualities, and endued with a flowing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence,
I therefore make choice of hir
to be our Quéene. For aſſuredly it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
that the imperial crowne be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed

diſcended from a ſtirpe royal, to whome
the ſecrete wayes of loue, being (as they
are all) open, it ſhall be an eaſie matter
for hir to content vs in theſe our Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.
And this ſayd, he humbly knéeled
before this noble Ladie, ſaying: Moſt
curteous Ladie vouchſafe to decke your
head with this Crowne, the which is no
leſſe dearly to be eſtéemed of them, that
are worthy thorow their vertues to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
their heades with the like, than if it
were of Golde. The Ladie with a newe

Truely ye haue not in due ſorte proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a Quéene for this amorous people,
(y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue more néede of a moſt able king)
for that of all you that are preſent, I am

I can not withſtand this your election: &amp;
to the end I be not found co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to our

Moſt noble Ladie, without any forſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I ſhal obey your commaundement,
and thus ſaid: I remember that in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
wherein I was borne, there was one
day made a bountiful great feaſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
<pb facs="tcp:9837:13"/>
to honoure the ſame, were many gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
and Gentlewomen:<note place="margin">Tvvo Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men enamored of one Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlevvoman.</note> And I that
was likewiſe there roming about, and
beholding them that were in the place,
eſpied among the reſt, two yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gratious to behold, that erneſtly eyed
an excéeding faire woman. Neither was
I any wayes able to diſcerne whither of
them hir beauty had moſt inflamed. And
as ſhe in like ſort had a good ſpace beheld
them, not making greater ſemblance to
the one, than to the other, they betwéene
themſelues, began to reaſon of hir: and
among the other wordes that I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode
of their talke, was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eche one ſaid,
that he was hir beſt beloued: and for
proofe thereof, either of them alleaged in
the furtherance of himſelfe, diuers ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
then before done by the yong wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
And they thus remaining in this
contention a long time, being now tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
many woordes at daggers draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they acknowledged that héerin they
did very euil, bicauſe in thus doing, they
wrought hurt and ſhame to themſelues,
and diſpleaſure to the woman. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(moued of an equall agréement)
<pb facs="tcp:9837:14"/>
bothe two wente to the mother of the
mayd, who was alſo at the ſame feaſt,
and thus ſayd vnto hir: That forſomuch
as aboue all other women of the world,
either of them beſt liked hir daughter,
and that they were at contention whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them was beſt liked of hir, it
woulde therefore pleaſe hir to graunte
them this fauor, to the ende no greater
inconuenience might ſpring thereof, as
to will hir daughter, that ſhe either by
word or déede, would ſhew whether of
them ſhe beſt loued. The intreated gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman
ſmiling, thus anſwered: wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.
And ſo calling hir daughter to
hir, ſayd: My fayre daughter, eche one of
theſe preferreth the loue of thée, aboue
the loue of him ſelfe, and in this conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they are: whether of them is beſt
beloued of thée: and they ſéeke of me this
ſauour, that thou either by ſignes or
words, reſolue them herein. <note place="margin">Wheras loue is, there peace ought to be.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the end that loue, from whom all
peace and goodneſſe oughte alwayes to
ſpring, brede not now the contrary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
them in this, and with ſemblable
curteſie, ſhew towards which of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy
<pb facs="tcp:9837:14"/>
minde is moſt bent.<note place="margin">The loued giueth cauſe of argument to hir louers.</note> The yong damſell
ſayd: It liketh me right well. And ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
them bothe a while, ſhe ſaw the
one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue vpon his head a faire
garlande of freſh floures, and the other
to ſtande without any garlande at all.
Then ſhe that had likewiſe vppon hir
head a garlande of gréene leaues, firſte
tooke the ſame from hir head, and ſet it
vpon his, that ſtoode before hir without a
garlande. And after ſhe toke that whiche
the other yong man had vpon his head,
and ſet the ſame vpon hirs: and ſo lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
them, ſhe returned to the feaſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that ſhe had both performed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of hir mother, and eke their
deſire. The yong men béeing thus lefte,
returned alſo to their former co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention,
eche one affirming that ſhe loued him
beſt. And he whoſe garland ſhe toke and
ſet vpon hir head, ſayde: Aſſuredly ſhe
loueth me beſte, bicauſe ſhe hath taken
my garlande to none other ende, but for
that what mine is, pleaſeth hir, and to
giue occaſion to be beholding vnto me.
But to thée, ſhe hath giuen hirs, as it
were in place of hir laſt farewell: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
<pb facs="tcp:9837:15"/>
that (like a countrey girle) the
loue which thou beareſt hir, be without
requitall, and therfore laſtly ſhe giueth
thee that garlande thou haddeſt merited.
The other replying with the contrary,
thus anſwered: Truely ſhe loueth that
thine is, better than thée, and that may
be ſéene in taking therof. And me ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
better than what mine is, in as
much as ſhe hath giuen me of hirs: And
therefore it is no token of hir laſt deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
gift, as thou affirmeſt, but rather a
beginning of amitie and loue. A gift ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the receiuer a ſubiect to the giuer:
and bicauſe ſhe peraduenture vncertane
of me, to the ende ſhe might be more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
to haue me hir ſubiect, will binde
me (if perhaps I were not bounde vnto
hir before) to be hirs by gift. But howe
mayſt thou thinke, if ſhe at the firſt take
away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thée, that euer ſhe may vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
to giue thée. And thus they abode a
long time contending, and in the ende
departed without any definition at all.
Now ſay I, moſt puiſſant Quéene, yf
you ſhoulde be demaunded of the laſte
ſentence of ſuche a contention, what
<pb facs="tcp:9837:15"/>
would ye iudge? The faire Lady ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſmiling, turned towards <hi>Philoco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po,</hi>
(hir eies ſparkling with an amorous
light) and after a ſoft ſigh, thus made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere:
Moſte noble youthe,<note place="margin">The queenes iudgement vpon the que<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtion.</note> proper is
your Queſtion: And truely, as very
wiſely the young woman behaued hir
ſelfe, ſo eche one of the yong men right
well defended his cauſe. But bicauſe ye
require what we laſtly will iudge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
thus we make you aunſwere: It ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
vnto vs, and ſo it ought to ſéeme to
eche one that taketh good héede, that the
woman had in hate neither the one nor
the other: but to kéepe hir intent couert
did two contrary acts, as appeareth, and
not without occaſion. And to the end ſhe
might get more aſſured the loue of him
whom ſhe loued, as not to loſe the loue
of the other, whome ſhe hated not, it
was but wiſely doone. But to come to
our Queſtion, whiche is, to whether
of the two, greateſt loue was ſhewed.
We ſaye: that ſhe loued him beſt, and
he chiefeſt in hir fauour, to whome ſhe
gaue hir garland: and this ſemeth to be
the reaſon: Whatſoeuer man or woman
<pb facs="tcp:9837:16"/>
that loueth any perſon, ech one through
force of the loue they beare, is ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bound to the perſon loued, that abou<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
all other things they deſire to pleaſe the
ſame, neither to binde him or hir more
ſtrongly that thus loueth, néedeth either
gifts or ſeruices, and this is manyfeſt.
And yet we ſée, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> who ſo loueth, though
he endeuour him ſelfe ſundry wayes,
is not able to make the perſon loued, in
any ſorte benigne and ſubiect vnto him,
wherby he may bring it to his pleaſure,
and ſo with a more bolde face demaund
his deſire. And that this is in ſuche ſorte
as we ſay,<note place="margin">Dido.</note> the inflamed <hi>Dido</hi> with hir
doings, dothe very well manyfeſt the
ſame vnto vs, who burning in the loue
of <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſo long,<note place="margin">Aeneas.</note> as it ſéemed hir nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with honours nor with gifts able
to winne him, had not the courage to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the doubtfull way of aſking the
queſtion: So that then the yong woman
ſought to make him moſt beholding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hir, whom ſhe beſt loued. And thus
we ſay, that he that receiued the gifte of
the garlande, was hir beſt beloued. As
the quéene became ſilent, <hi>Philocopo</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered:
<pb facs="tcp:9837:16"/>
Diſcrete Lady,<note place="margin">Philocopo re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plieth to the Queene.</note> greatly is your
anſwere to be commended: but for all
that, you do bring me into a great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of that ye haue defined, touching
the propounded queſtion, bicauſe I wold
haue iudged rather the contrary. For ſo
muche as generally among louers, this
was the wonted cuſtome, that is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to beare vpon them ſome iewell, or
ſome other thing of the perſons loued, to
the end that moſt times they might glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
them ſelues more therin, than in all
the remnant they had, &amp; perceiuing the
ſame about them, therwith to glad their
minds,<note place="margin">Paris.</note> as ye haue heard. <hi>Paris</hi> ſeldome
times or neuer entred into the bloudie
battailes againſt the Greekes, without
bearing ſome token vpon him, that had

               <note place="margin">Helene.</note> beléeuing
better to preuayle therewith, than if he
had gone without the ſame. And truely
in mine opinion, his thought was not
vayne: therefore I ſhoulde thus ſaye,
(that as you ſayde) the yong woman did
very wiſely, not defining it for all that
as you haue don, but in this maner: She
knowing that ſhe was very well loued
<pb facs="tcp:9837:17"/>
of two yong men, and that ſhe could not
loue mo than one; for that loue is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuiſible
thing, ſhe would rewarde the
one for the loue he bare hir, to the ende
that ſuche good will ſhould not be vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
and ſo gaue him hir garlande in
requitall thereof. To the other whom
ſhe loued, ſhe thought ſhe woulde giue
courage and aſſured hope of hir loue, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his garlande, and decking hir ſelfe
therewith, in token wherof, ſhe playnly
ſhewed to be beholding vnto him for the
ſame. And therfore in my iudgement ſhe
loued better him from whom ſhe toke,
than him to whom ſhe gaue. To whom
the Quéene thus made anſwere:<note place="margin">The queenes ſolution of this firſt que<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtion.</note> Your
argument ſhould haue pleaſed vs right
well, if your ſelfe in your tale had not
condemned the ſame Sée how pillage
and perfect loue can agrée togither? How
can ye ſhew me, that we loue him whom
we ſpoyle, better than him to whom we
giue? According to the Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
to the one ſhe gaue a garlande,
and from the other ſhe toke a garlande:
neither had ſhe too whome ſhe gaue,
ought giuen hir: and that which we ſee
<pb facs="tcp:9837:17"/>
euery day for example may here ſuffiſe,
as is commonly ſayde: They are of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
farre better loued, on whom they
beſtow fauour and gifts, than thoſe that
are by them depriued of them. And for
that cauſe we laſtly holde opinion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding,
that he is better loued, to whom
is giuen, than he from whom is taken.
We know very wel, that in theſe our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſonings
much might be obiected agaynſt
this our definition, &amp; much alſo anſwered

being ſiſters, adorned with an ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

other company, whom as I ſaw making
this ſorowfull plaint, I withdrew my

a long while, neither was I able for all
that, to vnderſtande all the words that
they through griefe vttred in teares, but
that the effect of ſuche plaint (according

me to be for loue: wherefore I through

my trickling teres. And after that I had

all baſhfull they withhelde them from

helpe and comfort in what I may. The
women greatly excuſed themſelues, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they ſorrowed for nothing: but
yet after I had coniured them, and they
ſeing me deſirous to vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame,
the elder thus began to ſay: It is the

vnderſtand, that we, aboue al other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

now laſtly being further inflamed, and
hauing determined to ouercome that his

his yong arme, of his beſt and deareſt
ſhaftes, and with ſo great force wounded
<pb facs="tcp:9837:19"/>
the heartes ſo ſore infeebled through the

made a farre greater wound, than if reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

for the pleaſure of two moſt noble yong
Gentlemen, we are become ſubiectes to

more perfect faith, and ſeruent wil, than

beléeuing wiſely to ende my deſire, ſo
wrought as I got the loued yong Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
at my pleaſure, whome I found
as greatly enamored of me, as I of him.
But truely nowe hath not the amorous
flame through ſuch effect ceaſſed, neither
hathe the deſire leſſened, but eache one
more vehemently increaſeth: and more
than euer, I doe nowe burne in hys
fire. And what tyme, ſeeing howe I
might beſt mitigate &amp; aſſuage the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
flame thereof, holding it inwardly
<pb facs="tcp:9837:20"/>
ſecrete, it after hapned, that the horned

I ſorowfull woman aboue all others,

By occaſion whereof I ſorrow me, and
that thing that moſt increaſeth my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is, that on euery ſide I ſee the way
barde from béeing able to follow him.
Thinke therfore now, whether I haue

and this other, why ſorroweth ſhe? And
ſhe anſwered:<note place="margin">The ſeconde hindered by ielouſie, ſoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveth hir hap.</note> This my ſiſter likewiſe

we wer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here al alone, we began
to reaſon of our miſfortunes, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame farre greater than theſe of

               </gap>e lottes, as ye might well
perceiue. To heare this of them it grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
me greatly, ſo that I encountred
them with ſuche wordes as ſéemed me
moſt profitable for their comfort, and ſo
departed from them. Many times after
reuoluing in minde their griefes, and
ſometimes bethinking me whether of
the ſame ſhoulde be the greater, at one

another time, I yelded to that of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and the ſundry reaſons wherwith
as it ſéemeth me, ech one hath to lament

May it therfore pleaſe you, that by you
may be opened this errour, in telling me
whether of theſe two infortunate louers
<pb facs="tcp:9837:21"/>
ſéemed to ſuſtayne the greateſt gréefe.
Great was the ſorow of either of them,<note place="margin">The Queene decideth the queſtion.</note>
anſwered the Quéene: But conſidering
aduerſitie to be moſt greuous to hir that

bewayled hir aduerſitie. Who will euer
lament for that he hath not had: not one
but wil rather deſire it. It is demed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that of the two women, the one
wept for gréefe, the other for deſire. It is
very hard for me (gracious Ladie) to <note place="margin">Longano of contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the Queene.</note>
thinke that which you affirme (ſayd the
yong Gentleman) forſomuche as who
that hath his deſire of any deſired thing,
ought much more to content his minde,
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who that deſireth, and can not fulfil
his deſire. Further, nothing is more
<pb facs="tcp:9837:21"/>
light to loſe, than what hope promyſeth
not heereafter to yéelde. There ought to
be vnmeaſurable greefe, whereas the
not being able to bring egall willes to
effect doth hinder. From thence lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
take place, from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce thoughtes
and troubles doe ſpring, bicauſe if the
willes were not egall, of force the deſire
ſhould want. But when as louers ſee
them ſelues in preſence of that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
and can not attaine thereunto, then
doe they kindle and ſorowe them muche
more, than if that they wold haue, were

apples, &amp; the water, for that howe much
more neere they bend and ſwell to hys
mouth, ſo much the more (afterwards in
fléeing the ſame) they increaſe his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Truely I beléeue, that who hopeth
for a thing poſſible to be had and can not
attaine thereunto, thorow contrary reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
impediments, féeleth more gréefe,
than who that bewaileth a thing loſte

<pb facs="tcp:9837:22"/>
haue bene of an olde griefe, although to
that alſo might be ſayd: thus to be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
throughe forgetting the griefe, to
ſhorten the deſire in the deſired things,
where as continual impediment is ſens
not to be able to attayn them, as in thoſe
loſt, wherein Hope dothe not ſhew vs,
that we ſhould euer haue them agayne.
But we do reaſon whether of them ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed

wherfore folowing the propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

ſhe felt greater griefe that had loſte hir

(putting the caſe that it be an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to loſe a thing impoſſible to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne:
neuertheleſſe it was to be ſayd:
who loueth well, forgetteth neuer) than
the other, who if we looke well, might
hope to fulfill that hereafter, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore

bicauſe it ſéemeth to me vnléefull that I
onely ſhoulde pretermit the lawes kept
and obſerued of all others, that is, not to
loue being loued of many, I haue deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined

the good <hi>Hector,</hi> he is at euery proofe ſo
vigorous and ſtrong. The curteſie and
liberalitie of the ſecond is ſuch, that (as I
thinke) his fame doth ſound through eche

that he ſurmounteth all other wiſe men
aboue meaſure. But for that (as ye haue
heard) their qualities are diuers, I doubt
<pb facs="tcp:9837:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whether of them to take, finding in the
antique age eche one of theſe to haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſlye

made anſwere. There is neuer a one of
the thrée, that dothe not worthily merite

bicauſe in this caſe I am not to fighte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
caſtles, or to giue away the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of great <hi>Alexander,</hi> or the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of <hi>Ptholome,</hi> but that onely that
Loue and honour are with diſcretion a
long time to be kepte, the whiche are
mainteyned neither by force nor curteſy,
but only by wiſdome: we ſay, that both

ſoner to be taken than the wiſe, and this
ſeemeth to be the reaſon: Loue as we
ſee) is of that nature, as multiplying his

baniſheth out thence, retayning that for
his ſeate, and mouing it after according
to his pleaſure, wherevnto no foreſight
is able to reſiſt, but that it is conuenient
for them to follow him, by whom it is
(as I haue ſayde) gouerned. And who
doubteth that <hi>Biblis</hi> knew it not to be
euill to loue hir brother?<note place="margin">Biblys.</note> Who will
gayneſay, that it was not manyfeſt to

faire than a Bul?<note place="margin">Paſiphe.</note> and yet they and eche
one ouercome with an amorous pleſure,
reiecting all knowledge, followed the
ſame. Then if it haue power to take
knowledge from the learned, taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the witte from the wiſe, they ſhall
haue nothing left: but if from the ſtrong
and curteous, it ſhall take away the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
witte they haue, it ſhall yet increaſe
them in their vertues, and ſo they ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:9837:24"/>
become more than the wiſe enamoured.
Further, loue hath this propertie, it is a
thing that can not long be hidde: and in
reueling him ſelf, he is wont oftentimes
to bring greuous perils, whervnto what
remedie ſhall the wiſe giue that hath
now loſt his witte? He ſhall giue none
at all, but the ſtrong that vſeth his force
can helpe in a perill bothe him ſelfe, and
others. The curteous through his curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
ſhall wyth gratefull beneuolence
winne the minds of many, whereby he
may be bothe holpen and conſidered, and
others alſo for his ſake. Sée now what
it is to be of your iudgement. She was
by the Quéene anſwered vnto, thus:<note place="margin">The queenes laſt ſentence to the thirde queſtion.</note> If

But if he, whom you propound wiſe, and

he is not to be taken. The Gods forbid,
that that whereof you ſpeake, ſhoulde
come to paſſe. And yet we will not deny,
but that the wiſe know the euill, and do
it: but for all that we will ſay, that they

to ſay vnto him: The Gods ſeuer me far

<pb facs="tcp:9837:33"/>

that to me due is: For the which cauſe
I accompte that receiued of your hands,
that I haue of you deſired, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when it ſhall pleaſe you, you may
returne to your Huſbande, and thanke

and excuſe me of the follie I haue héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore

&amp; returned to hir huſband, to whome ſhe

But <hi>Theban,</hi> now comming to <hi>Tarolfo</hi>
demaunded how the caſe ſtoode. <hi>Tarolfo</hi>

him ſelfe to bryng that to an ende,
which he hadde promyſed, whereby he
<pb facs="tcp:9837:34"/>
iuſtly deſerued the ſame, did now remit
the whole to <hi>Tarolfo,</hi> and remayned
poore as he was ar the firſt.<note place="margin">The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Queene vpon the fourthe queſtion.</note> Very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

was very liberall, conſidering the firſt
of his honoure, the ſecond of his laſciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
deſire, and the third that of hys re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
riches, was very courteous.
Nowe if we will knowe which of them
vſed the greateſt liberalitie or curteſie:
It is méete we conſider whether of the
thrée déedes is moſte acceptable, the
which being well wayed, we ſhall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
knowe the moſt liberal, bicauſe
who moſt giueth, is to be held moſt libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall:
of the which thrée, the one is deare,
that is Honoure, the which <hi>Paulus Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius</hi>
vanquiſhyng <hi>Perſes,</hi> king of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ycedonia,</hi>
rather deſired than the gayned

is, the wanton delightes of <hi>Venus,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſentence of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> and
of <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> ſaying: That luſt is to be
fledde as a furious gouernement. The
third is not to be deſired, that is ryches:
forſomuche as the moſte tymes they are
<pb facs="tcp:9837:35"/>
noyſome to a vertuous lyfe, and to ſuche
a one as can vertuouſly lyue with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate

as by their woorkes is manyfeſt.
If then of theſe thrée, only Honoure is
to be helde deare, and the others not, he
vſed the greateſt liberalitie that gaue
his wyfe to another, althoughe he dyd
leſſe than wiſely therein. He was alſo
the cheefeſt in liberalitie, wherein the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
followed him: therefore according
to our iudgement he that gaue hys wife

the reſt, the moſt liberall. I (ſayde
<hi>Menedon</hi>) agrée,<note place="margin">The reply of Menedon.</note> that in as muche as ye
haue thus ſayde, it be as you ſay: but yet
eche one of the other ſéemeth to me, to be
more liberall, and ye ſhall heare howe.
It is very true, that the firſt graunted
his wyfe, but he vſed therin not ſo great
a liberalitie as ye ſpeake of, bicauſe if he
wold haue denyed hir, he might not iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<pb facs="tcp:9837:35"/>
himſelfe liberall therof, and it was
but a trifle he gaue: and therefore (as I
haue ſayde) eche one of the other was
more curteous. And for that (as it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſayde) <hi>Tarolfo</hi> had nowe a long
time deſired this Ladie, and loued hir
farre aboue all others, he for to attayne
hir, had of long time abode great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
offering himſelfe for to ſatiſfie hir
requeſt, to ſéeke forth things almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to be had, the which nowe obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he deſerued (through hir promyſed
faythe) to obtaine hir alſo, whome (as
wee ſay) béeing obteyned, there is no
doubt but that the honoure of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and the releſe of that ſhée had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
(the which he releaſed) was in his
hand. Then was he, to conclude, liberall
both of the honor of the huſbande, of the
othe of his Ladie, and of his owne long
deſire. It is a great matter to haue endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
long thirſt, and to come to a pleaſant
fountain, and not to drink, but to ſuffer
others to drynke. The thirde was alſo
very liberall, conſidering that pouertie
is one of the moſte lothſome things of
the world to bear, for ſo much as it is the
<pb facs="tcp:9837:36"/>
chaſer away bothe of mirthe and reſt, a
flyer of honours, a frequenter of vertue,
and the inducer of crabbed care, ſo that
euery one naturally endeuoure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with a fiery deſire to flie the ſame
the whych deſire is ſo kindled in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,<note place="margin">Euery one fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth pouertie.</note>
to the ende to liue very ſplendantly

or not otherwayes béeing able to feede
that theyr deſire: whych is cauſe many
times eyther of deathe or exile. Howe
muche then ought the riches to pleaſe
and to be acceptable to them that in due
ſorte doe bothe gaine and poſſeſſe them?
And who will doubt that <hi>Thebane</hi> was
not moſt poore if he behold how he aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
hys nyghtes reſt, went gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of herbes, and digging vp of rootes

in hearing how <hi>Tarolfo</hi> did deme to

apparelled in vile veſture, &amp; ſeeing him
deſirous to ſhake of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> miſerie to become
<pb facs="tcp:9837:36"/>

               <hi>Theſſalia</hi> into <hi>Spayne,</hi> haſarding himſelf
to perillous chaunces through doubtfull
iourneys, and vncertayne ayre, to the
ende to perfourme the promiſſe he had
made, and to receiue the like from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Alſo it may be euidently ſéene, that
without doubt who giues him ſelfe-to
ſuche and ſo many miſeries, to the ende
to flée pouertie, knoweth the ſame to be
full of all griefe and troubles. And how
muche the more he hath ſhaken off the
greateſt pouertie, and is entred a riche
life, ſo much the more is the ſame life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
vnto him. Then who that is
become of poore, rich, if therwith his lyfe
doth delight him, how great, and what
maner of liberalitie dothe he vſe, if he
giue the ſame away, and conſenteth to
returne to that ſtate, the whiche he hath
with ſo many troubles fled? Aſſuredly he
doth a thing excéeding great and liberal.
And this ſéemeth farre greater than the
reſt,<note place="margin">Olde folkes commonlye couerous.</note> conſidering alſo of the age of the
giuer, that was now olde: foraſmuche
as auarice was wont to be continually
of greter force in old men than in yong,
<pb facs="tcp:9837:37"/>
whervpon I gather, that eche one of the
two following, hath vſed a greater libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie
than hath the firſt, ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by you, and the thirde far more
than either of the others. In how much
your reaſon mighte be well by any one
defended, ſo well is the ſame defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by you (ſayde the Quéene) but we
minde to ſhew vnto you briefly how our
iudgement rather than yours ought to
take place.<note place="margin">The queenes ſolution to the fourthe queſtion.</note> Ye wil ſay, that he ſhewed no
Liberalitie at all, graunting the vſe of
his wife to an other, bicauſe of reaſon it
was conuenient through the othe made
by the lady, that he ſhould ſo do, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which
ought to be in déede if the othe mighte
holde. But the wife forſomuch as ſhe is
a member of hir huſband, or rather one
body with him, coulde not iuſtly make
ſuch an oth without the will of hir huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande:
and yet if ſhe did make ſuche an
othe, it was nothing, bicauſe the firſt oth
lawfully made, could not with reaſon be
derogate by any following, chiefly not
by thoſe that are not duly made for a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
cauſe. And the maner is in matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monicall
vnitings the man to ſweare to
<pb facs="tcp:9837:37"/>
be content with the woman, and the
woman with the man, and neuer to
chaunge the one the other for an other.
Now then, the woman can not ſweare,
and if ſhe do ſweare (as we haue ſayde)
ſhe ſweareth for a thing vnlawfull, and
ſo contrary to the former othe, it ought
not to preuayle, and not preuayling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
than for his pleaſure, he ought
not to commit his wife to <hi>Tarolfo,</hi> and if
he do commit hir to him, then is he libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
of his honour, and not <hi>Tarolfo,</hi> as
you holde opinion. Neither could he be
liberall of his othe in releaſing it, for
as muche as the othe was nothing.
Then onely remayned <hi>Tarolfo</hi> liberall
of his wanton deſire: the which thing of
proper duetie is conuenient for euery
man to do, bicauſe we all through rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
are bounde to baniſhe vyce, and
to folow vertue. And who that doth that,
whervnto he is of reſon bound, is (as ye
haue ſayd) nothing at al liberal,<note place="margin">Flee vice, and follow ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</note> but that
whiche is done more than duetie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
may well &amp; iuſtly be termed libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.
But bicauſe you peraduenture with
ſilence argue in your mind, what honour
<pb facs="tcp:9837:38"/>
may that be of a chaſt woman to hir huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande,
which ought to be ſo deare: we
wil prolong ſomewhat our talke in ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
you, to the ende that ye may the
more clearely ſée, that <hi>Tarolfo</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane,</hi>
of whom we intend next to ſpeak,
vſed no liberalitie at all in reſpect of the
knight. Ye ſhall know that chaſtitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
with the other vertues,<note place="margin">Chaſtitie a vertue moſt excellent.</note> yeld none
other rewarde to the poſſeſſours therof,
than honour, the whiche honour among
vertuous men, makes the leaſt vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the moſt excellent. This honour if
men with humilitie ſéeke to ſupport it,
it maketh them friends to god, and ſo by
conſequent to liue, and after death, to
poſſeſſe the goods eternall:<note place="margin">The ioy of a man is to haue a good wife.</note> the whiche if
the woman conſerueth for hir huſbande,

is no ſmall pleaſure, ſéeing ſhe is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
him for an euerlaſting companion
<pb facs="tcp:9837:38"/>
indiuiſible, ſauing by death: He through
this obtayned fauour is ſéene continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to increaſe, bothe in ſpirituall and
worldly wealth.<note place="margin">The grief of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing an euil wife.</note> And ſo on the contrary,
he whoſe wife hath default of ſuche ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
can neuer paſſe one hour with true
conſolation, nothing is acceptable vnto
him, and continually the one deſireth the
death of the other, he perceiueth him
ſelfe through this diſordred vyce to be
caried in the mouthes of the verieſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,
neither ſéemeth it vnto him, that
ſuch a fault ſhoulde not be beléeued, of
whom ſoeuer it is hearde: And yf ſhe
were largely endowed with all other
vertues, yet this vyce ſéemeth to haue
ſuch a force as to bring hir in contempt,
and to vtter ruine. Then is this honour
that maketh the woman bothe chaſte
and good to hir huſbande, a moſt great
gifte, and ſo is to be helde moſt dearely.
Bleſſed may he be called to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> throgh
grace is graunted ſuch a gifte, although
we beléeue they are but few, towards
whom is borne enuy for ſo great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite.
But to returne to our purpoſe, it
is to be ſéene how muche the knight did
<pb facs="tcp:9837:39"/>
giue. It is not fled our memory when as
ye ſaid, that <hi>Theban</hi> was of the reſt moſt
liberall, who being with trouble enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
hath not doubted to returne into
the miſerie of poore eſtate, in giuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
that whiche he had gotten. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly
appeareth, that ye are euill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaynted
with pouertie, who if ſhe come
vnto vs mery, ſurmounteth all richeſſe.
<hi>Theban</hi> now peraduenture through the
attayned wealth,<note place="margin">The care which riches bring.</note> felte him ſelfe replete
of ſundry ſoure cares. He did now ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that it ſéemed <hi>Tarolfo</hi> to haue done
very euill, and therfore would practiſe
by murdring him, to recouer agayn his
Caſtles. He abode in feare to be perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
betrayed of his tenaunts. He
was entred into care touching the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
of his lands. He now knew
all the prepared guiles to be done vnto
his coparteners. He ſaw him ſelfe gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enuied for his riches, and doubted leſt
théeues ſhould ſecretly ſpoyle him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
He was ſtuffed with ſo many ſuche
and ſundry thoughts and cares, as all
quietneſſe was fled from him. Through
the whiche occaſions, calling to minde
<pb facs="tcp:9837:39"/>
his former life, and that withoute ſo
many cares he paſſed the ſame merily,
ſayde to him ſelfe: I deſired to grow
riche, to the ende to attayne quiet reſt,
but I ſee it is the increaſer of troubles
and cogitations: ſo is it the flier of qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe:
And therefore deſirous to be in
his former eſtate, he rendred them all to
him by whom they were giuen.<note place="margin">Pouertie highly eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in times paſt.</note> Pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is the refuſed richeſſe, a goodneſſe
vnknowen, a fire of prouocations, the
which was of <hi>Diogenes</hi> fully vnderſtod.
As muche ſuffiſeth pouertie, as Nature
requireth. He liueth ſafe from euery di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceite
that paciently approcheth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
neither is he diſabled to attayne to
great honours, that (as we haue ſayde)
vertuouſly liueth therwith: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as <hi>Theban</hi> reiected this allurement
he was not liberal, but wiſe. So graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
he was to <hi>Tarolfo,</hi> in that it pleaſed
him to giue the ſame rather to him than
to an other, whereas he mighte haue
beſtowed the ſame vpon many others.
Then to conclude, the Knighte was
more liberall that graunted his honour,
than any of the others: And thinke this
<pb facs="tcp:9837:40"/>
one thing, that the honour he gaue was
not to be agayne recouered, the whiche
happeneth not in many other things,
as of battayls, proweſſe, and others like:
For if they are at one time loſt, they are
recouered at an other, and the ſame is
poſſible. Therefore this may ſuffiſe for

I in gazing among them, eſpied

piteous of ſemblaunce, as I imagined
to make choyſe of hir, as of a ſinguler

on your right hand, makes me me deſire
to be both to you and hir, a moſt faithfull
ſeruant. I am therfore redy to obey your

together, it happened that two yonge
Damſelles of noble bloud,<note place="margin">Tvvo da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels amorous of a gentleman he not knovv<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing thereof: and that vvhich hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</note> abounding in

perceiuyng him to be in the ſayde Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
came thyther, and began a farre off
to beholde hym that was altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt
of theyr purpoſe. And after a
while, ſéeing him al alone, ſauing for me
of whome they reckened not, bicauſe I
was but a little one, thus the one began
to ſay to the other. We loue this yong
Gentleman aboue all others, neither do
knowe whether he loueth vs or no, yet
is it méete that he loue vs bothe: ſo that
nowe it is léefull for vs to ſatiſfie our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire:
and to knowe whether he loue ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to the ende that ſhée, whom he ſhal

ſince he is all alone, and that we haue a

being thus determined vpon
this reſolution, began to run their race

maruelled greatly, eſpying them, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

(as is alredy ſaid) I ſay, that feare hathe

<pb facs="tcp:9837:49"/>

euen to that place wher the Laurel

the golden treſſes on the other, dyd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine:
It ſo entermingled there amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
with twinings not artificiall, as at the

had iſſued forth among the gréene leaues
a cleare flame of a burning fire, whych
did ſpread in ſuch ſort, as the aburn hairs
were eaſily ſéene to the flanders about.

               <hi>Galeone</hi> that was peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture ſooner or

than any of the reſt (being ſet in circle o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

At this ſodaine voice <hi>Galeone</hi> lift vp his
mind replete with ſwéet thoughts, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
comming to him ſelf, at what time
he is wont to doe, that thorow a ſodaine
fear doth breake his golden ſléepe, &amp; thus
ſayd: Moſt noble &amp; renoumed Quéene,
whoſe worthyneſſe it ſhoulde be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb facs="tcp:9837:52"/>
for me to declare, my mind was
ſo wrapped in gracious thoughts (when
as I did ſo firmly loke at your hed) as in
beholding the bright ray, ſtreming into
the freſh fountaine, and rebounding vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
your face, me thought there iſſued forthe

gracious to ſée vnto, as he plucked my
minde backe, to beholde that whych he
did, &amp; perceiuing peraduenture, my eyes
altogither inſufficient to behold ſo great
a ioy, he mounted by the cleare ray into
your eyes, &amp; there for a good ſpace made
maruellous myrth, adorning the ſame
with a new cleareneſſe: And after mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
more high, I ſawe how he aſcended
by this light (leauing his footeſteppes in
your eyes) vpon your crown, wheras he
together with the ray, kindled (as it ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
vnto me) a new flame, ſuch a one as
was of yore ſéene by <hi>Tanaquil,</hi> to apéere
to <hi>Seruius Tullus</hi> a little boy whileſt he
ſlept, and ſo we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about your crowne, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
from ſprigge to ſprigge, like a little

many leaues, mouing your hearte with
ſundry ieſtures, ſometimes wrapping &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:9837:52"/>
hiding himſelfe therin, being more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
euery time he came forth thereof,
and therewith (as it ſeemed vnto me) ſo
iocunde in him ſelfe, as nothing more,
and that ſinging, or with a ſwéete voyce
he vttered theſe words:</p>

               <l>Of the third rolling Skie, the benigne babe deuine</l>
               <l>I am, enamoured ſo, to neast in theſe two eyne,</l>
               <l>That doubtleſſe dye I ſhould, were I of mortal routs</l>
               <l>From twig to twig I twine to feede this my delight.</l>
               <l>Theſe golden Treſſes whirling in and out:</l>

               <l>If ſuche hir pleaſure be, I there diſcend adowne,</l>
               <l>For of my kingdomes ſhe, quene is of great renowne.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And herewith he ſayde muche more, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about as at what time ye called me,
and ye had no ſooner ſpoken, but that he
ſodenly retired into your eyes, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
ſparkling like to the morning ſtarre
gaue a new light that made al the place
to ſhine: ye haue now heard with what
<pb facs="tcp:9837:53"/>
ioy new thoughts haue ſtayed me for a
time. <hi>Philocopo</hi> and the reſt maruelled
not a litle hereat, and turning their eyes
towards their Quéene, ſaw that, whiche
to heare ſéemed to them impoſſible. And
ſhe that was attyred with humility, liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to the words that were truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
of hir, and abode with a ſtable
countenaunce, making no anſwere at
all. And therefore <hi>Galeone</hi> ſpeaking in
this wiſe, followed with his queſtion:
Moſt gracious Quéene, I deſire to know
whether a man ought to be enamoured
for his delyght or no? And to demaunde
this, many things moue me, both ſéene,
heard, and helde, through the ſundry opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of many. The Quéene beheld <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leone</hi>
a good while in the face, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
after a certayne ſigh, thus made
anſwere. It is conuenient we ſpeake
agaynſt that which with deſire we ſéeke
to follow. And truely that which you in
aſking, do propounde in doubt, ought to
be manifeſt vnto you. In anſwering you
therfore there ſhalbe kept the begon or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
And he whoſe ſubiects we are, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
vs the words, that we, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt rained
<pb facs="tcp:9837:53"/>
through force of Iudgement, ſhall (more
ſooner than willing) ſay againſt his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
maieſtie, leaſt thereby his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
do fall vpon vs. And you that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
as well as we are his ſubiect, with
a bolde minde giue eare vnto them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do you for all that chaunge your
purpoſe at all. And to the ende that ſo
much the better, and with a more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
intendment our words may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
we wil ſomwhat digreſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our
matter, returning againe therevnto as
briefly as poſſible we may, and thus we
ſay: Loue is of thrée ſorts, thorow which
three al other things are loued, ſome tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the vertue of one, &amp; ſome throw the
power of an other, according as is the
thing loued, and likewiſe the louer: The
firſt of the which .iij. is called honeſt loue:
This is the good, vpright, &amp; loyall loue,
the which of all perſons ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued:
This, the high &amp; firſt creator hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
linked to his creatures, &amp; them h<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tieth
therwith vnto him. Through this,
the heauens, the world, realmes, prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and cities do remaine in their ſtate:
thorow this we do merite to be eternall
<pb facs="tcp:9837:54"/>
poſſeſſors of the celeſtiall kingdome:
and without this is loſt al that we haue
in power of well doing. The ſeconde is
called loue for delight: And this is he,
whoſe ſubiectes we are: This is our
god, him we do worſhip, him we do pray
vnto, in him do we truſt, that he may be
our contentation, and that he may fully
bring our deſire to paſſe: Of this is put
the queſtion, whervnto we ſhall duely
anſwere. The thirde is loue for vtilitie,
of this loue the worlde is repleniſhed
more than of any of the other thinges.
This is coupled with Fortune, whileſt
ſhe tarieth, he likewiſe abideth: but if
they parte, he is then the waſter of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
goods. And to ſpeake reaſonably, he
oughte to be déemed rather hate than
loue. Now as touching the propounded
queſtion, we néede to ſpeake neither of
the firſt, nor of the laſt: we will ſpeake
of the ſecond, that is, of loue for delight,
to whom truely, no perſon that deſireth
to leade a vertuous life, oughte to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him ſelfe, bicauſe he is the depriuer
of honours, the bringer of troubles, the
reueler of vices, the copious giuer of
<pb facs="tcp:9837:54"/>
vaine cares, and the vnworthy occupier
of the libertie of others, a thing aboue al
things to be helde moſt deare. What is
he then regarding his own wealth (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wiſe) that will not flée ſuche a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment?
Let him that may, liue frée,
following thoſe things that doe euery
way increaſe his liberty, and let vicious
gouernours gouerne vicious vaſſals. I
did not thinke, ſayde <hi>Galeone</hi> then, to
giue occaſion through theſe my words
to the leſſening of this our diſport, nor
to diſquiet the regiment of our lorde
loue, neither yet to trouble the minds of
any others, but did rather imagine (you
defining it according to the intente of
me &amp; many others) that ye might therby
confirme thoſe that are his ſubiects with
a valiaunt minde, and inuite thoſe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
are not, with a gréedy appetite: but
I ſée that your intent is all contrary to
mine, bicauſe you with your words do
ſhew to be thrée ſortes of loue, of the
which thrée, the firſt and the laſt I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
they be as you ſay. But the ſecond,
whiche anſwereth to my demaunde, ye
ſay it is as muche to be fled, as I holde
<pb facs="tcp:9837:55"/>
opinion, it is (as the increaſer of vertue)
to be folowed of him that deſireth a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
end, as I beleue to make apparant
vnto you by this that followeth. This
Loue, of whom we reaſon (as it may be
manyfeſt to all the worlde, bicauſe we
proue it) doth worke this propertie in
humayne hearts, that after that it hath
diſpoſed the mind to a thing which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
it ſpoyleth the ſame of all pride and
of al fierceneſſe, making them humble in
eche doing, as it is manyfeſt vnto vs by
<hi>Mars,</hi> whome we finde, that in louing
<hi>Venus,</hi> became of a fierce and ſharpe
Duke in battayle, a moſte humble and
pleaſaunt Louer. It makes the gréedie
and couetous, liberall and curteous. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>
the moſt carefull hider of hir arte, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhe felte his flames, liberally yelded
hir ſelf, hir honour, and hir arts to <hi>Iaſon.</hi>
Who makes men more diligent to high
attempts than he? And what he can do,
behold by <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Menelaus.</hi> Who fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth
forwarde the angry fiers more
than doth he? He ſheweth vs how often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the anger of <hi>Achilles</hi> was quieted
thorowe the ſwéete prayer of <hi>Polixena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9837:55"/>
He aboue all others maketh men coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and ſtrong. Neither know I what
greater example may be giuen vs, than
that of <hi>Perſeus,</hi> who for <hi>Andromaca</hi>
made a maruellous proofe of his vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
force. He decketh all them that are
by him aparelled, with excellent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
with ornate talke, with magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and with pleaſantneſſe. He I ſay
beſtoweth vpon al his ſubiects fineneſſe
and gentleneſſe. Oh how many are the
good things whiche procéede from him?
Who moued <hi>Virgill?</hi> who <hi>Ouid?</hi> who
the other Poets to leaue of them ſelues
eternall fame in thoſe their holy verſes,
the which (if he had not ben) ſhold neuer
haue comen to our eares, but he? What
ſhall we ſay further of his vertues? but
that he was able to giue ſuche a ſwéete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to <hi>Orpheus</hi> harpe, as after that he
had called to that ſounde all the woods,
ſtanders about, and made the running
ſtreames to ſtay, &amp; to come into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
in milde peace the fierce Lions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>githers,
with the faint hearted Hartes,
and all other beaſts: he made likewiſe
the infernal furies quiet, &amp; gaue reſt, and
<pb facs="tcp:9837:56"/>
ſwéeteneſſe to the troubled ſoules, and
after all this the ſound was of ſuch ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
as he attayned to haue agayne his
loſt wiſe. Then is he not the chaſer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of honour as you ſay, neither the
giuer of vnſitting troubles, nor the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoker
of vices, nor the diſpoſer of vayn
cares, nor the vnworthy vſer of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of others. So that euery one of
whom he maketh none accompt, and is
not as yet his ſeruaunt, ought with all
their wit and diligence, to endeuour and
to occupie them ſelues in the attayning
the fauour of ſuche a Lorde, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his ſubiect, ſince throw him he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
vertuous. That which pleaſeth
the Gods, and men of greateſt ſtrength,
ought likewiſe to pleaſe vs. Let ſuche a
Lorde therfore be loued, ſerued, and liue
alwayes in our minds. Greatly decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
thée thine opinion, ſayd the quéene,
and it is no maruell, bicauſe as farre as
we vnderſtande, thou art ſo farre ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured,
as none the like, and without
doubt the iudgement of the enamoured
is méerely falſe, bicauſe as they haue
loſt the ſight of the eyes of their minde,
<pb facs="tcp:9837:56"/>
ſo haue they baniſhed reaſon as their vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enemie. And for this cauſe it ſhall be
conuenient, that we agaynſt our will
ſpeake of loue, the whiche gréeueth vs,
ſince we be his ſubiects. But yet to pluck
thée from thine error, we ſhall turne our
ſilence to a true report, and wil therfore
that thou know, that this loue is nothing
elſe, than an vnreaſonable will ſprong
of a paſſion entered the heart through a
wanton pleaſure, that is opened to the
eyes, nouriſhed with idleneſſe, by the
memorie and thoughts of fooliſh minds:
and many times in how much it multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth,
ſo much it taketh away the intent
of him in whom it abideth, from things
neceſſarie, and diſpoſeth the ſame to
things vnprofitable. But bicauſe that
thou through example giuing doſt ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
thy ſelfe to ſhew, that all goodneſſe
and all vertue doth procéede from him,
we will procéede to the diſprofes of thy
prooufes. It is no part of humilitie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly
to bring to a mans ſelfe, that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
belongeth to an other, but rather an
arrogancie and an vnſitting preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
The whiche thing <hi>Mars</hi> (whome
<pb facs="tcp:9837:57"/>
thou makeſt throughe loue to become
humble) aſſuredly vſed in taking away
from <hi>Vulcan, Venus</hi> his moſte lawfull
wife. And without doubt this humilitie
that appeareth in the face of louers doth
not procéede of a benigne heart, but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
roote from guile and deceipt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
makes this loue the couetous libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
but when as ſuch abundance as thou
laieſt to haue ben in <hi>Medea,</hi> doth abound
in the heart, and doth depriue the ſame of
the ſight of the minde, and moſt fooliſhly
is become prodigall of things heretofore
duly eſtemed deare, and not giuing the
ſame with meaſure, but vnprofitably
caſting them away, beléeueth to pleaſe,
and diſpleaſeth. <hi>Medea</hi> nothing wiſe of
hir prodigalitie, in ſhort time repented
very muche without vtilitie, and knew
that if ſhe had modeſtly vſed thoſe hir
dere gifts, ſhe ſhould not haue comen to
ſo vile an ende. And that ſoliciting that
purchaſeth or worketh hurt to the ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as it ſeemeth to vs, ought not any
ways to be ſought for: for muſt better
it is to ſtand idle, than worke harme, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that neither the one nor the other
<pb facs="tcp:9837:57"/>
is to be prayſed. <hi>Paris</hi> was a ſolicitour to
his own deſtruction, if he beheld the end
of his ſoliciting. <hi>Menelaus</hi> as reſon was,
became diligent, not for loue, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
his honor loſt, as eche diſcrete per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ought to doe. Neither yet is this loue
a meane to mitigate anger, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignitie
of minde, the brunt being paſte
that induceth it, makes it to become no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and remitteth the offence agaynſt
whom it is angry. And yet louers and
diſcrete perſons were wont at the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the perſon loued, or of ſome friend
to forgiue offences, to ſhew them ſelues
curteous of that which coſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing,
and to make the crauers thereof behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vnto them. And in this ſort <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
many times ſhewed himſelfe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
from him this congeled anger. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it ſéemes that this makes men cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
and worthy: But therof I can
ſhew you the contrary. Who was a man
of greater valour than <hi>Hercules,</hi> and yet
béeing enamoured, became vile &amp; forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of his force, ſo that he did ſpin thréede
with the women of <hi>Iole?</hi> Aſſuredly in
things, wherein occurreth no daunger,
<pb facs="tcp:9837:58"/>
a moſt hardy people are the enamoured,
and wherin daunger hapneth, they ſhew
themſelues in apparaunce hardie, and
put themſelues forwarde, neither dothe
loue, but little wit allure them ſo to do,
to the ende they may after haue glory in
the ſight of their loues, although it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
very ſeldome, bicauſe they doubt ſo
much the loſing of the perſon loued, that
they are rather content to be helde vyle
and of little courage, than to giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to perill. And yet we doubt not,
but this loue repoſeth all ſwéeteneſſe in
<hi>Orpheus</hi> harpe. We agrée that it is true
that thou haſt ſhewed, that truly in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
loue ladeth the tongs of his ſubiects
with ſuch a ſwéeteneſſe, and with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
enticements, as they many tymes
would therby make the ſtones turne vp
ſide downe, ſo that to entice is not onely
the propertie of wauering and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
men, but of vile men. How ſhal we
ſay, that ſuche a lorde ought to be follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed,
throughe the good propertie of the
follower? Aſſuredly he (in whom he abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth)
maketh wiſe and profitable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
to be deſpiſed. For it was euill with
<pb facs="tcp:9837:58"/>
the <hi>Troians</hi> that thoſe of <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> were
not heard of <hi>Paris.</hi> He maketh likewiſe
his ſubiects to forget and deſpiſe their
good fame, the which ought to remayne
to vs all on earth after our deathes, as
an eternall heire of our memorie. And
how much theſe aforeſayd did contemne,
the ſame <hi>Egiſtus</hi> may ſuffiſe for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
Although <hi>Scylla</hi> wrought no leſſe
hurt than <hi>Paſiphe.</hi> Is not he the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that breaketh ſacred bonds of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
pure faith? Yet truely what had
<hi>Ariadna</hi> done to duke <hi>Theſeus,</hi> whereby
contaminating the matrimonical bands,
and giuing himſelfe, and his promiſed
fayth to the winds, he ſhoulde abandon
hir poore miſer among the deſert rockes?
A little pleaſure in gaſing in the eyes of
<hi>Phedra,</hi> was occaſion to celerate ſo much
euill, and of ſuche requitall for the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
honor. In him alſo is found no law:
and that it is true, may be ſéene by the
doings of <hi>Tereus,</hi> who hauing receyued
<hi>Philomena,</hi> from hir pitifull father, and
carnally knowen hir, made no ſtaye to
contaminate the moſte holy lawes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonially
contracted betwéene hym
<pb facs="tcp:9837:59"/>
and <hi>Progne,</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Philomena</hi> This
alſo calling and cauſing himſelfe to be
called a God, occupieth the reaſons of
the gods. Who coulde euer fully with
words ſhew the iniquitie of him? He to
ſpeake briefly, leadeth them that follow
him to all euilles: and if by happe his
followers do any vertuous acte (whiche
happeneth very ſeldome) with a vicious
beginning they beginne it, deſiring ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to come very quickly to the deſired
ende of their lothſome willes, the which
may be rather ſayd vices, than vertues,
forſomuche as that is not to be héeded
onely whiche man dothe, but with what
minde it is doone, and ſo according to the
will of the worker, to repute the ſame
vicious or vertuous, bicauſe that neuer
of an euill roote ſprang a good trée, nor
from an euill trée good fruite. This loue
then is leude and naught: and if he be
naught, he is to be fledde. And who that
fleeth things euill, of conſequent follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
the good, and ſo is bothe good and
vertuous. The beginning of this loue is
none other thing, than feare, the ſequels
is ſinne, and the ende is griefe and noy,
<pb facs="tcp:9837:59"/>
it ought then to be fled, and to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and to feare you to haue him in you,
bicauſe he is violent, neither knoweth
he in any of his doings to kepe meaſure,
and is altogither voyde of reaſon. He
is without all doubt the deſtroyer of the
minds, the ſhame, anguiſhe, paſſion,
griefe, and plaint of the ſame, neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth
that the hearte of whome that
lodgeth hym be withoute bitterneſſe,
who will than prayſe that he is to be
followed, but fooles. Truely if it were
lawfull we would willingly liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him, but of ſuche an harme we are
to late awares, and therefore it is
conuenient for vs, ſince we are
caught in his nettes to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

propoſed by a fayre Gentlevvoman
named POLA.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N the right hande of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leone,</hi>
was ſet a fayre gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,
whoſe name
was <hi>Pola,</hi> pleaſaunt, and
yet vnder an honeſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerture,
who after the Quéene blent,
thus began to ſay: O noble Quéene, ye
haue domed at this preſent, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ought to follow this our lord Loue,
and I for my part conſent thervnto: but
yet ſince it ſéemes to me impoſſible, that
the youthfull race both of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſhould be runne ouer without this
benigne Loue: I gather, at this preſent,
ſetting apart (by your leaue) your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that to be enamoured is lefull, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the euill doing for due working:
And in following the ſame,<note place="margin">Of vvhat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees one ſhould choſe his louer.</note> I deſire to
know of you, whether of theſe two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ought rather to be loued of a yong
man, bothe two pleaſing him alike, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhe that is of noble blood, and of able
kinſfolke, and copious of hauing muche
more than the yong man, or the other
<pb facs="tcp:9837:60"/>
that is nether noble nor rich, nor of kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes
ſo abounding as is the yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
To whome the Queene thus made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere:
Faire Gentlewoman,<note place="margin">The Quenes anſvvere.</note> admitting
the caſe that both man and woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought
to follow Loue as you haue before affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
we giue iudgement, that in howe
much the woman is richer, greater, and
more noble than the yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
degrée or dignitie he be of, euen
ſo ſhe ought to be rather preferred to the
loue of a yong man, than ought ſhée that
hath any thing leſſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he: bicauſe mans
mind was created to folow high things.
And therfore he muſt ſeeke rather to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance,
than any ways to imbace himſelf.
Further there is a common Prouerbe,
which ſayth:
<q>
                  <l>The good to couet better t'is,</l>
                  <l>Than to poſſeſſe that bad is.</l>
               </q>
Wherefore in our iudgement, thou art
better to loue the moſt noble, and wyth
good reſon to refuſe the leſſe noble. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſaid pleaſant <hi>Pola:</hi> noble Queen,<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary opinion of Pola vvith hir reaſons.</note> I wold
haue giuen an other iudgement (if it had
bene to me) of this Queſtion, as ye ſhall
heare. We all naturally doe rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb facs="tcp:9837:61"/>
ſhort and bréefe, than long and tedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
troubles, and that it is a leſſe &amp; more
bréefe trouble to get the loue of the leſſe
noble, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the more noble, is manifeſt.
Then the leſſe ought to be followed: for
as muchè as the loue of the leſſe may be
ſayd to be alredy won, the which of the
more is yet to get. Further, many perils
may folow to a man louing a woman of
a greater condition, than him ſelfe is of,
nether hath he laſtly therby any greater
delight, than of the leſſer. For we ſee a
great woman to haue many kinſfolks, &amp;
a great family, and them all as diligent
héeders of hir honour, to haue an eye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hir, ſo that if any one of them happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
eſpie this loue, therof may folow (as we
haue already ſayd) great perill to the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
the which of the leſſe noble ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not ſo
lightly com to paſſe: and theſe perils ech
one (as he is able) ought to flée, for as
much as who y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> receiueth harme is ſure
therof, and who that hath done it, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him after to ſcorn, ſaying he ſpéedeth
wel, where he liketh, there let him loue:
yet dyeth he more than once. But howe
that once happeneth, where, and for
<pb facs="tcp:9837:61"/>
what occaſion, beſides eche one ought to
take good heede: it is very credible that
a Gentlewoman will lightly eſteeme of
hym, for that ſhee will deſire to loue one
more Noble or greater than hir ſelfe,
and not one inferioure to hir ſelf: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſoldome or neuer, he ſhall attaine his
deſire. But of the leſſer ſhall happen the
contrary, bicauſe that ſhee will glory to
bée loued of ſuche a Louer, and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
hir ſelfe to pleaſe hym, to the
ende to nouriſhe Loue, and yet if this
were not, the power of the Louer onely
myght be able wythout feare to bryng
to paſſe to fulfill his deſire. Wherefore
I gather, that the leſſe Noble oughte to
bée preferred in loue before the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Your iudgement deceiueth you (ſaid
the Quéene) to the fair Gentlewoman,<note place="margin">The Que<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> ſolution vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the eight queſtion.</note>
bicauſe Loue is of thys nature, that
howe muche the more one Loueth, ſo
muche the more he deſireth to loue: And
this may be ſéene by them, that thorowe
loue féele y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater gréefe, the which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it trouble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not a litle, yet loue
they continually the more: Neyther
doeth any one from his heart, althoughe
<pb facs="tcp:9837:62"/>
he make great apparance in wordes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
thereof a ſpéedie end. Then as ſmall
troubles are ſought for of the ſlouthfull,
of the wiſe, things that are attained w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
moſt trouble, are helde moſt deare and
delightfull. And therefore in louing the
leſſe woman, to get hir, ſhould be (as you
ſay) little trouble, and the loue both litle
and ſhort, &amp; ſhould be folowed as though
one in louing, would deſire to loue leſſe
and leſſe, which is contrary to the nature
of Loue, as we haue ſayd. But in louing
the greater, that is gotten wyth trouble,
happeneth the contrary: bicauſe, that as
in a thing dearely gotten, with trauaile,
is repoſed all dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the wel héeding
of the gained Loue, euen ſo is ſhée euery
houre the more loued, and the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger doth
continue the delight and pleaſure therof.
And yet if ye will ſay that all the doubt
is of theyr kinſmen, we wil not denie it,
for this is one of the occaſions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it is a trouble to haue the loue of
one of theſe great women: but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the diſcrete in ſuche caſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede
by a ſecrete way. And we dout not
but that the honor bothe of the greateſt
<pb facs="tcp:9837:62"/>
and meaneſt woman is by ſome of their
kinſfolkes according to their power lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
vnto, in ſuch ſort, as a fole may come
to an euill aduenture, louing aſwell in a

he be that wil paſſe <hi>Piſiſtrato</hi> in crueltie,
hauing offended them which loued hys<note place="margin">The crueltie of Piſiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note>
without forethinking y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he ſhould
afterwardes haue done to thoſe that had
had the ſame in heart? In ſaying alſo,
that louing a greater woman than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he ſhall neuer be able to come to the
ende of his deſire, bicauſe the woman co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueteth
to loue one greater than hir ſelfe,
and therefore will make of him no eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
at all: ye ſhew your ſelf to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that the meaneſt man (in what
belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to naturall vertues) is of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and better condition,<note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſt man of better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than the nobleſt vvoman.</note> tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nobleſt
woman of the world. Whatſoeuer man
ſhee then deſireth, ſhée deſireth him that
is of greater and better condition than
hir ſelfe, bicauſe the vertuous or vicious
life maketh many times y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane great,
and the great meane. In as much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as any woman ſhall bée ſolicited by
any man in due ſorte, euen ſo wythout

doubt ſhée ſhall yeld to his deſire, though
the great w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more trouble tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mean.
For we ſee the ſofte water with a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
fall to breake and pierce the harde

loue.<note place="margin">The Queene concludeth that vve ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loue the more noble vvoman than the leſſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> For ſo muche goodneſſe ſhall folow

who after the Quene
had ſaid, thus began:
I conſent that it bée
conuenyent to loue,
that ye haue alredy fully anſwered this
Gentlewoman to hir Queſtion. And
that a man ought to loue rather a more
noble woman than a leſſe noble than
himſelfe, may very well be yelded vnto,
thorow the ſundry reſons by you ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
touching the ſame.<note place="margin">Whether is to be choſen in louing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the vvife, the vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovve, or the maide.</note> But foraſmuch as
there are ſundry Gentlewomen of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
ſortes attired with diuerſities of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,
that (as it is thought) doe diuerſly
loue, ſome more, ſome leſſe, ſome more
hotly, &amp; ſome others more luke warme.
I deſire to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of you, whether of
theſe three, a yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bring his deſire
to a moſt happy ende, ought ſooneſt to be
enamoured of, either of hir y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is maryed,
<pb facs="tcp:9837:64"/>
or of the maide, or of the widowe? To
whome the Queene made this anſwers:
Of the thrée,<note place="margin">The Quenes anſvver.</note> the one, that is the maryed
woman, ought in no wiſe to be deſired,
bicauſe ſhe is not hir owne, neither hath
libertie to giue hir ſelfe to any: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
either to deſire hir, or to take hir, is
both to commit an offence againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
lawes, as alſo againſt the lawes
naturall &amp; poſitiue, the offending wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is to heap vpon our ſelues, the diuine
anger, and by conſequent, heauie iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Howbeit, who that gropeth not
his conſcience ſo farre inwardly, dothe
oftentimes ſpéede better in louing hir,
than of any of the other two, either maid
or widowe, in as much as he (althoughe
ſuch loue ſomtimes be with great peril)
is to haue the effecte of his deſire. And
why this loue may diuers times bring
the louer to his deſire, ſooner tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the loue
of the others, this is the reſon: It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
that in how much more the fire is
blowne, ſo much the more it flameth, &amp;
without blowing, it becommeth deade.
And as all other things thorowe muche
vſe do decay, ſo contrariwiſe luſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more
<pb facs="tcp:9837:64"/>
it is vſed, the more it increſeth. The wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe
in that ſhée hath bene a long tyme
without the like effect, doth fele the ſame
almoſt as though it had neuer bene, and
ſo is rather kindled with the memorie
thereof, than with any concupiſcence at
all. The maid that yet hath no ſkil ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
neither knoweth the ſame but by ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gination,
deſireth as it were one luke
warme: and therfore the maried woman
kindled in ſuch paſſions, doth more than
any of the others deſire ſuche effectes.
What time the maried are wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
from their huſbandes outragyous
woords or déedes, wherof willingly they
would take reuenge if they might, there
is no way left more readier vnto them,
than in deſpite of their huſbands to giue
their loue to him, by whome they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured
to receiue the like. And althoughe
it be expedient that ſuche manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
be very ſecrete, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no ſhame grow
thereby, netheleſſe are they yet content
in their mindes. Further the alwayes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of one kinde of meat is tedious: and
wée haue oftentimes ſéene the delycate
meates left for the groſſe, turning after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<pb facs="tcp:9837:65"/>
vnto the ſame again, what time
the appetite hath bene ſatiſfied of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
But bicauſe (as wée haue ſayd) it
is not lawfull thorowe any vniuſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to deſire y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is an other mans,
we will leaue the marryed to theyr huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes,
and take of the others, whereof
a copious numbre our Citie dothe ſette
before our eyes.<note place="margin">The vvidovve is to be loued before the maide.</note> And we would in beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
our loue, rather ſeke the widowes
than the rude maides, groſſe for ſuche a
miſterie, and that are not without great
trouble (the which in widowes néedeth
not) made able to a mannes deſire. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
if mayds loue, they know not what
they deſire, and therefore they doe not
followe with an intentiue mynde, the
ſteppes of the louer as do the widowes,
in whome nowe the antique fire taketh
force, and maketh them to deſire that
which thorowe long abuſe they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten:
ſo that to come to ſuche effecte,
they (to late) bewéepe the loſt tymes,
and the ſolitarie long nightes, the which
they haue paſſed in their widowiſh beds.
Theſe are therefore (as it ſéemeth vnto
vs) rather to be loued of them in whom
<pb facs="tcp:9837:65"/>
is the libertie to ſubmitte them ſelues
to others, than any of the reſt. Then
aunſwered <hi>Faramonte:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinion of Feramonte.</note> Moſte excellent
Quéene, what ye haue ſayde of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed,
I hadde determined in my minde
that ſo it ought to bée: and now hearing
the ſame from you, I am the rather aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
thereof. But touching the Maides
and Widowes, I am of the contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
bicauſe (ſetting the maryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte,
for the reaſons by you alleaged)
it ſéemeth vnto me very good, that the
Maide rather than the Widowe, ought
to be deſired: For as muche as the loue
of the Maide ſéemeth more firme and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
than that of the Widowe. For the
Widowe without doubt hathe alreadie
loued one other time before, and hathe
ſéene and felt many things of loue, and
knoweth what ſhame may folow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
and therefore knowing theſe things
better than the Mayde, loueth faire and
ſoftely: and doubting and not louyng
firmly, deſireth now this and now that,
and knoweth not to whether for hir
moſt delight and greateſt honour to link
hir ſelfe, for ſometimes ſhée will neither
<pb facs="tcp:9837:66"/>
the one, nor the other: ſo that deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
dothe wauer in hir minde, neither is
the amorous paſſion able to take there
ſtabilitie: but to the mayde theſe things
are alltogether vnknowne.<note place="margin">The conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of maides in loue.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as ſhée perſuadeth hir ſelf with good
aduiſement, that of many yong men ſhée
greatly pleaſeth one, ſo wythout further
examination ſhée maketh choice of him
as of hir louer, and to him onely diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
hir loue, not knowing howe for hir
pleaſure to ſhew any contrary acte, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there for the more ſure tying of
the Louer, any newe deliberation by hir
ſought for the, touching hir loue, ſo that
ſhée is then pure at the wil and pleaſure
of him that ſimply pleaſeth hir, &amp; quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſpoſeth hir wounded heart, him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſerue as Lorde. The which thyng
(as I haue already ſayd) happeneth not
of the widowe, and therfore is the other,
the rather to be followed. Further, with
more efficacie the mayde taryeth thoſe
things that neuer any one of hir ſorte
hath ſéene, heard or proued. And yet ſhée
deſireth more to ſée, hear and proue them
than who that ha the many times bothe
<pb facs="tcp:9837:66"/>
ſéene, heard and proued them, and this
is manyfeſt. Emong the other occaſions
for the which our life doeth greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
vs, and is deſired to be long, is for
to ſée newe thyngs, ſuche as wée haue
yet neuer ſéene before. And alſo for to
ſée thyngs moſte newe we haue a great
delight to runne wyth a dilygent pace
to that, which we aboue all other things
doe endeuoure our ſelues to flée, that is
Deathe, the laſte ende of oure bodyes.
The maide knoweth not that delyght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
coniunction, thorowe the which wee
come into the world, and yet is it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
to euery creature thorowe a deſire
to be drawne thereunto. Further, ſhée
many times hath heard from them, that
know what manner a thing it is, howe
muche ſwéeteneſſe doth conſiſt therein,
the which wyth woordes haue giuen fire
to the deſire, and therefore drawne of
nature, and of a deſire to proue the thing,
of hir not as yet proued, dothe thorow
the woordes whych ſhée hathe hearde,
deſire boldly with a kindled heart thys
concourſe. And with whome is it preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be had but only with him, whom
<pb facs="tcp:9837:67"/>
ſhée hathe alreadie made Lorde of hir
minde? This heat ſhal not be in the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe,
bycauſe hauing once proued and
felte what manner a thing it was, ſhée
is thereby prouoked thereunto: So that
the Mayde then ſhall loue more, and be
more diligent (thorowe the reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayde)
to the pleaſure of hir Louer,
than the widowe. To what ende ſhall
wée then wade any further in ſéeking
that the Maide ought not rather to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
than the Widowe? You, ſayde the
Quéene reaſon well,<note place="margin">The Queenes ſolution vpon the nynthe queſtion.</note> and very well you
defend your iudgement: But yet we wil
ſhewe you with apparant reaſon, howe
you likewiſe ought to holde the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that we holde of thys contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if wyth a ſtraight eye ye looke to the
nature of Loue. Thus in the Mayde as
in the Widowe, and ſo in the Widowe
as in the Maide we ſée him to be firme,
ſtrong, and conſtant, and that thys is
true, <hi>Dido</hi> and <hi>Adriana</hi> with theyr do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
haue left vs an example. And wher
as thys Loue is neyther in the one nor
the other, none of the aforeſayde opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
will thereof followe. Then is it
<pb facs="tcp:9837:67"/>
conuenient that eche one of them doe
loue, if we wil haue that to folow, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
bothe you and I haue already talked.
And therfore in louing eyther maide or
widowe, without going about to ſéeke
whether of them is moſt diſcretely ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored
(as we are certain of the widow)
we ſhall ſhewe you how the widowe is
more diligent to the pleaſure of the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
than is the maide.<note place="margin">Maides ought not to loue, but in reſpect of mariage.</note> For doubtleſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe things, that a woman eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
deare aboue the reſt, is her virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:
and this is the reaſon, bycauſe
therein conſiſteth all the honoure of hir
following life. And without doubt ſhee
ſhall neuer be ſo much vrged forwardes
to loue, as ſhe ſhal not willingly be cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
thereof, but yet to him onely, to
whome ſhee beléeueth to be coupled as
wife thorowe the matrimoniall Lawe.
And therfore we go not about ſeking for
this: for there is no doubt but that who
will loue to marry, ought rather to loue
the maide than the widowe, bicauſe ſhée
ſhalbe ſlow and negligent in giuing hir
ſelfe to hym that loueth hir not (if ſhée
know it) to that effect. Further, maydes
<pb facs="tcp:9837:68"/>
are generally fearefull, neither are they
ſubtile enoughe to finde the wayes and
meanes, whereby they may take the
ſtolne delights: But the widow of theſe
things maketh no doubt at all, bicauſe
that ſhée already hathe honorably giuen
that which the other taryeth to giue, and
being without the ſame, doubteth not
in giuing hir ſelfe to an other, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
which may accuſe: Whereby after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes,
ſhée becommeth the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturous,
bicauſe (as is ſayd) the chée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
occaſion that bringeth doubt, is not
in hir: beſides ſhée knoweth better the
ſecrete wayes, and ſo putteth them in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
In that which you ſay, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maide
as deſirous of a thing which ſhée neuer
proued, may be made more diligent to
this tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the widow, that knoweth what
maner a thing it is, therof the contrary.
Maides do not at the firſt time for their
delight, run to ſuche effect (although the
thing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> delighteth, the oftener it is ſene,
heard, or felt, the more it pleaſeth, and

quéene, I remember that there was
heretofore in this our citie a faire &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
gentlewoman lefte the widow of a
worthye huſbande, the whiche for that
hir maruellous beautie, was of many a
noble yong Gentleman beloued. And of
thoſe many, there were two gentlemen
coragious knights, eche one in what he
could did endeuor him ſelfe to attaine hir
loue. And whilſt this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued, by chance
it hapned, that an vniuſt accuſation was
brought againſt hir, by certayne of hir
kinſfolks, before the Magiſtrate, &amp; after
by falſe euidence proued, thorow whiche
vntrue proceſſe ſhe was condemned to
the fire. But bicauſe the conſcience of the
Iudge was perplexed, for that it ſéemed
him, as it wer to know the vniuſt profe,
he was willing to committe hir life to
<pb facs="tcp:9837:69"/>
the Gods, and to Fortunes happe, and ſo
tyed ſuche a condition to his giuen ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
as after the Gentlewoman ſhould
be ledde to the fire, if any knight coulde
be founde the which would combate in
the defence of hir honour, agaynſt him
that would maintayne the contrary, and
ſhoulde happe to ouercome, ſhe ſhoulde
then be frée, and if the contrary, to be
burned according to the domed ſentence.
As the condition was vnderſtoode of
hir two louers,<note place="margin">Tvvo knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes amorous of one gentle vvoman, did in ſundry vviſe ſhevve their loue.</note> and by chaunce ſooner
knowen to the one than to the other: He
which knew the ſame ſooneſt, foorthwith
tooke him to his armour, mounted on
horſebacke, and came into the fielde,
gainſaying him that wold come &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
the death of the Gentlewoman.
The other that ſomewhat later than the
firſt vnderſtod of this ſentence, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
how that the knight was alredy in
field in hir defence, neither that ther was
then place for any other to go thither in
that enterpriſe, &amp; therefore not knowing
herein what to do, became very ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
imagining that through his ſtacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
he had loſt the loue of the loued
<pb facs="tcp:9837:70"/>
Gentlewoman, and that the other iuſtly
had deſerued the ſame: and whileſt he
thus ſorowed his miſſehap, he bethought
him, that if he before any other ſhoulde
go armed into the fielde, ſaying that the
Gentlewoman ought to dye, and ſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him ſelfe to be ouercome, he mighte
thereby cauſe hir to eſcape, and ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his deuice, he put the ſame in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
The gentlewoman hereby eſcaped,
and was deliuered from perill. So that
then after certayne days, the firſt knight
went vnto hir, and recommended him
ſelfe vnto hir, putting hir in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance
how that he, to preſerue hir from death,
had a few days paſte offred him ſelfe to
the perill of death, and thanks be to the
Gods, and to his forces, he had deliuered
bothe hir and him ſelfe from ſo harde an
happe: Whervpon it would pleaſe hir,
according to his deſert to giue hir loue,
the whiche aboue all things he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
deſired. Afterwards with the like
prayers came the ſeconde knight, ſaying
that for your ſake I haue hazarded my
lyfe, and bicauſe you ſhould not dye, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
my ſelfe to be ouercome, whervpon
<pb facs="tcp:9837:70"/>
I haue purchaſed to my ſelfe eternall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie:
wheras I contrarywiſe with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring
your ſuretie, and willing to
vſe my force, might haue bene able to
haue gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the honor of the victorie. The
Gentlewoman thanked ech one of them
very benignely, promiſing them bothe
due recompence for the receiued ſeruice.
And now they being departed, ſhe abode
in great doubt to whether of them ſhe
ſhould the rather giue hir loue, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt,
or to the ſeconde, and thereof prayeth
counſell of you, on whether of them ye
would ſay, that ſhe ought ſooneſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe

as if ſuche a battayle to be done

<pb facs="tcp:9837:71"/>

with being of euery one honored
for the receiued victorie: and what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

content their inflamed deſires, with the
delight onely of the thought. But this
happeneth not in the beholding, bicauſe
that onely the viſible ſpirite féeleth ioy,
and the others ar kindled with ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
that they are not able to endure, and

the preſent ſight than the abſent thought

doth delight, bicauſe we are to think that

will we haue than this, that
the gladneſſe is not greater of the ſighte
than of the thought? Bicauſe that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

comprehended, whiche in the hearte is
hidden?<note place="margin">The queenes ſolution of the xj. queſtion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining that the thought is to be preferred before the looke.</note> The Quéene then, thus made
anſwere: Thoſe things, bothe delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and noyſome, that approche moſt
néere to the minde, bring more annoye,
and more ioye, than doe thoſe farre off
from the ſame. And who doubteth, but
that the thought abideth in the mind, and
that the minde is not from the eye? al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
thorow the particuler vertue of
the minde they haue their fighte, and
that it is conuenient for them by ſundry
means to render their proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the
<pb facs="tcp:9837:74"/>
animate vnderſtanding. Hauing then in
the minde a ſwéete thought of the loued,
in that acte which the thought bringeth,
in that togither with the thing loued,
it ſéemes the louer to be. Then he ſéeth
the ſame with thoſe eyes, to whome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
no not of a long diſtance may be
hidden. Then he ſpeaketh with hir who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he loueth, and peraduenture with pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſtile telleth the annoys ſuſtained for

feare to embrace hir. Then dothe he
according to his deſire maruelouſly glad
himſelfe with hir. Then doth he hold hir
wholly at his pleaſure, the whiche in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
happeneth not, bicauſe that ſight
onely at firſt taketh pleaſure without
paſſing further. And as we ſay, Loue is
timorous and fearefull, and in beholding
dothe make the heart tremble in ſuche
ſorte, as it leaueth neither thought nor
ſpirite in his place. For many with the
long beholding of their ladies,<note place="margin">The effects of fond amorous lookes.</note> loſe thoſe
their naturall forcas, and remayne van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed:
and many not béeing able to
moue, ſtande like poſtes, other ſome, in
tangling and trauerſing their legs, fal to
<pb facs="tcp:9837:74"/>
the grounde. Others thereby loſe their
ſpeache: &amp; by ſight we know many other
like things to haue happened, the which
all ſhoulde haue bene very acceptable to
them, to whom (as we haue ſayde) they
haue happened, if they had not happened
at all: how then bringeth that thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
that ſhall willingly be fled? We
confeſſe, that if it were poſſible to behold
without feare, it ſhoulde be a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
But yet little or nothing without
the thought, the which without the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſight, pleſeth very much. And that that
whereof we haue may ſpoken come to
paſſe through the thought, it is manifeſt,
that, yea, and muche more. For we finde
that men with thought haue paſſed the
heauens, and taſted of the eternal peace.
Then more delighteth the thought than
the ſighte. And if ye ſay that <hi>Laodomia</hi>
was melancolie with thinking, we doe
not denye it, but yet it was rather a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorouſe

that dyd trouble hir: She as it were a

Who then will giue counſell to
any, that he lye firſt with a fayre Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman
one yere, the whiche is the
onely reſt and ioye of him that muſt lye
with hir, in ſhewing him after that
there muſt follow ſo great annoy and
vnpleaſaunt lyfe, as he muſte in euery
acte wherein he abode with the young
woman, haue to do as long with a loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
olde woman? Nothing is ſo noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to a delightfull lyfe, as to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that after death we ſhall be founde
ſpotted. This death returning to our

doth diſturbe vs of al goodnes &amp; pleſure:
and whilſt this is remembred, there can
neuer be ioy taſted in worldly things.
Likewiſe no delight can be had with the
yong woman, that is not troubled or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
in thinking &amp; remembring that
it behoueth him to do as muche with a

that the contrary were better counſell,
that is, that all trouble, wherof gracious

faire yong Gentlewoman,<note place="margin">A Gentlevvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvas loued of a Knight.</note> whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

was intierly beloued of a

him not at all, neither cared for hym, by
occaſion wherof, the Knight was neuer
able to get from hir, either good wordes
or curteous countenance: and while he
thus liued comfortleſſe of ſuche loue, It
happened that he was called to the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Citie not farre diſtante from
this of oures: And accordingly he went
thither, hauing honorably gouerned the
ſame all the time of his abode there: du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the which it happened, that there
came a meſſanger vnto hym,<note place="margin">The Knyght aduertiſed of the death of hir vvhom he loued.</note> who after
other newes thus ſayd: Sir ye ſhal vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that the Gentlewoman of our

all others, this morning labouring with
<pb facs="tcp:9837:81"/>
great griefe to be deliuered of child died,
not being deliuered, and was in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
of hir parents honourably buried.
The knight not without great ſorrow,
gaue <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>are to this tale, and with a ſtrong
heart endured the telling thereof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſhewing any alteration of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
at all, and to himſelf thus ſaid: Hawretched
death, curſed be thy power,
thou haſt depryued me of hir, whom I
loued aboue all others, and whom I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
more to ſerue, although I knew hir
cruell vnto me, than any other worldly
wight. But ſince it is thus come to paſſe
that which loue in hir life time woulde
not vouchſafe to graunt me, now that
ſhe is deade, he can not deny me: That
aſſuredly if I ſhould dye therfore, I wil
now kiſſe the face of hir béeing deade,
that liuing I loued ſo well. And ſo ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vpon this determination, he taryed
vntill it was night, and then tooke one
of his ſeruants,<note place="margin">The knighte ſeeketh his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued gentlevvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in hir graue.</note> whom he beſt truſted
with him, and trauayled the dreadfull
darke wayes, till at the laſt he came to
the Citie: And being entred the ſame, he
went ſtreight to the ſepulture, wherein
<pb facs="tcp:9837:81"/>
the gentlewoman was buried: and after
he had comforted his ſeruaunt, that he
without any feare ſhoulde attende him
there, he opened the ſame, &amp; went there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into,
wheras lamenting with a piteous
plaint, he kiſſed the gentlewoman, and
tooke hir in his armes, and not ſatiſfied
therwith, he began to féele hir here and
there, and to put his hand into hir frozen
breſt among the colde dugs. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
(being become more bolde than
was méete) to ſeke out vnder the rich at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
which ſhe had on, the ſecrete parts of
the body, going &amp; féeling with a feareful
hand hither and thither, til at the laſt he
ſpred the ſame vpon hir ſtomack, where

pulſes ſomewhat to moue. He then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
very fearefull, but yet loue made
him bolde, and therefore trying further
with a more aſſured héede, he knew that
ſhe was not dead: and firſt of all with a
ſwéete mutation he drew hir out of that
place, and after wrapping hir in a great
mantell (leauing the ſepulture open)
he and his ſeruant caried hir ſecretly to
his mothers houſe, whereas he coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

his ſayd Mother,<note place="margin">The Knight caryeth his Lady to his mothers houſe.</note> thorow the power
of the Gods, that ſhée, neyther this, nor

not therby returne in due ſort: by occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wherof, as one peraduenture diſcrete

firſt to be ſtrowed many vertuous her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,

now after all theſe heauie trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
returned to hir perfecte vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and the new ſonne was alſo borne

Knight that thus loued hir, or his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

neither did ſhe ſee any one of hir parents

ſayd: Where am I? what a wonder is

the Knight anſwered:<note place="margin">The Knyght declareth to the gentlevvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hovv ſhe vvas brought into his houſe.</note> Gentlewoman,

ſo declaring from the beginning to the

<pb facs="tcp:9837:83"/>
concluded, that throughe him, ſhée and
hir ſonne were aliue: By occaſion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they were alwayes bounden to be
at his pleaſure. The Gentlewoman
perceiuing this to be true, knowing aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
that ſhe could not by any other
meanes, but onely by this which he ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
hir, be come to the hands of the
knight: firſt of all with a deuoute voyce,
rendred thanks to the immortall gods,
and after to him, offring hir ſelf to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
at his pleaſure and ſeruice. Then
ſayd the knight: gentlewoman ſince you
know your ſelfe to be beholding vnto
me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I wil that in guerdon of my wel do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ye comforte your ſelfe here in this
place, vntill I returne from mine office,
wherevnto it is now ſo long ſince that I
was choſen, as the date hereof is almoſt
at an end. Beſides ye ſhall promiſſe me
faithfully, neuer to bewray your ſelfe
without my licence, either to your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
or any other perſon. To whom
the Gentlewoman anſwered, that ſhée
was vnable to denye him eyther this,
or any other requeſt, and that aſſuredly
ſhe would comfort hir ſelfe: and ſo by
<pb facs="tcp:9837:83"/>
othe made vnto him, ſhe affirmed neuer
to cauſe hir ſelfe be knowen without his
pleaſure. The knight ſéeing the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
out of all perill to receiue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
after he had abode two dayes in hir
ſeruice, recommended hir and hir childe
to his mothers charge, and ſo departed,
returning to the gouernment of his ſaid
office, the whiche after a little while he
honorably ended, and returned home to
his owne houſe and poſſeſſions: where
as of the Gentlewoman he was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
receyued.<note place="margin">The knighte biddeth the husbande of the gentlevvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet.</note> Certayne days after his

banquet, wherevnto he inuited the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande
of this Gentlewoman, whom he
loued, hir brethren, and many others of
hir friendes and his: and the bydden
gueſtes beeing ſette downe at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the Gentlewoman according to the
pleaſure of the knight, came apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in thoſe garments, and decked with
that crowne, ring, and other precious
ornaments (as the vſe was then) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ſhe was buried. And by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of the knighte placed hir
ſelfe on the one ſide by hir huſband, &amp; on
<pb facs="tcp:9837:84"/>
the other ſide by himſelfe, where as ſhée
ſedde that morning, without ſpeaking
any worde at all. This Gentlewoman
was oftentimes behelde of hir huſband,
and hir attire and ornaments alſo: and
as it ſéemed vnto him, he knewe hir to
bée his wife, and thoſe to be the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
wherein ſhée was buryed: But
yet for that he thought he had buried hir
dead into hir ſepulture, and not beleuing
that ſhée was ryſen againe, durſte not
once giue hir a word, doubting leaſt ſhée
had bene ſome other that did reſemble
his wife, imagining that it were more
eaſie to finde one woman, in attire and
ornamentes like to an other, than to
raiſe vp a dead body. But yet for all this,
he tourned many times towardes the
Knighte, and aſked him who ſhée was.
To whome the knight anſwered: Aſke
of hir, whome ſhée is, for I can not tell,
out of ſo vnpleſant a place I haue brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght
hir. Then the huſband aſked y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wife
who ſhée was, to whome ſhée anſwered:
I was brought by this Knight by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
wayes inte this place, to that
gracious life that is of euery one deſired.
<pb facs="tcp:9837:84"/>
At theſe words there wanted no admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the huſbande, but rather the
ſame increaſed, and ſo they remayned
vntill the banket was ended. Then the
knight ledde the huſbande of this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
into a chamber, and with him
the Gentlewoman, and the other like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
that banketted with them, where
as they found the Gentlewomans fayre
&amp; gracious ſonne in the neurſes armes,
whome the knighte deliuered into the
fathers handes,<note place="margin">The knight reſtoreth the gentlevvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to hir huſbande.</note> ſaying: This is thy

and to the reſt, how it happened that ſhe
was brought thither. They al after gret
wonder, made great ioy, and chiefly the
huſbande of his wife, and the wife with
hir huſbande, of their ſonne. And ſo both
two thanking the knight, retourned me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
home to their houſe, many dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
making maruelous ioy. This knight
entreated this gentlewoman with that
tenderneſſe and that pure fayth, as if ſhe
had bene his ſiſter, and therefore it is
doubted whiche of theſe two was the
<pb facs="tcp:9837:85"/>
greter:<note place="margin">The queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is vvhether the loyaltye of the kni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghte, or the ioye of the husbande vvas the grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter.</note> either the loyaltie of the knight,<note place="margin">The queenes iudgement.</note>
or the ioy of the huſbande, that had now
gotten agayne his loſt wyfe, whome he
reputed as dead. I pray you to ſay your
opinion, and what you woulde iudge
hereof? Moſt great (as we beléeue) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the Quéene) was the ioy of the
agayne gotten wife, and of hir childe:
and likewiſe noble and very great was
the loyaltie of the knight. But for that
it is a naturall thing to be glad of the
getting agayne of things loſt (neither
could it otherwiſe be bicauſe it woulde
an other) and ſpecially in the getting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
of a thing before ſo gretly loued,
with a childe, wherof there could not be
made ſo gret ioy as was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient. We
do not repute it to be ſo great a matter
as to do that wherevnto a man is of his
proper vertue conſtrayned to doe, the
which in béeing loyall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe,
bicauſe the béeing and not béeing loyal,
is a thing poſſible. We ſay then, that
from whom procedeth the being loyall
in a thing ſo greatly loued, that he doth
a moſt great and noble thing in keping
loyaltie, &amp; that in a far greater quantity
<pb facs="tcp:9837:85"/>

ioy in the other,<note place="margin">The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Maſſani<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

ſayde <hi>Maſſaline:</hi> Moſt renoumed quéene,
I beléeue it be as you ſay: but yet it
ſemes vnto me a great matter to think,
that with ſo great ioy as was in him
that had gotten agayne his wyfe, there
could be made compariſon of greatneſſe
in an other thing: foraſmuch as greater
griefe is not ſupported, than when as
thorow death a thing loued is loſt. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if the knight were faythfull, as is
already ſayd, he did therin but his dutie,
bicauſe we are all bounden to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of vertue: and he that dothe that,
whervnto he is of duetie bounden, doth
but well, but yet it is not to be reputed
for ſo great a matter. Therfore I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that there may be iudged greater
ioy than loyaltie.<note place="margin">The queenes ſolution vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the laſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</note> You with your words
do contrary your ſelfe (ſayd the quéene)
bicauſe man ought as well to reioyce in
the goodneſſe of god in taking him away
as thorow the working of vertue: but
if the one could be in the one caſe, as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
as the other could be in the other
<pb facs="tcp:9837:86"/>
caſe diſloyall, it might be conſented to
your iudgement. To follow the laws of
nature, which can not be fled, is no great
matter, but to obey the poſitiue lawes, is
a vertue of the minde, and the vertues
of the minde bothe for greatneſſe as for
euery other reſpecte, are to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before bodily works. And if vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
workes (making due recompence)
do ſurmount in greatneſſe euery other
working, it may be ſayd, that the hauing
ben loyall, dureth always in béeing. Ioy
may be turned into ſodayn ſorow, either
elſe in a ſhorte ſpace of time become lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or nothing, loſing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing thorow the
whiche it is become mery. And therfore
let it be ſayde of him, that vprightly will
iudge, the knight to haue bene more loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
than the other mery. Not one there
was that followed <hi>Maſſaline,</hi> that had
any thing more to ſay, for that they all
had now propounded their Queſtions.
The ſunne now in ſetting, left the place
replete with a temperate aire. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
whereof, <hi>Fiametta,</hi> moſte reuerente
quene of this amorous people, raiſed hir
<pb facs="tcp:9837:86"/>
on foote, and thus fayd: Gentlemen and
gentlewomen, your queſtions are fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed:
whervnto (the Gods be thanked)
we haue according to our ſmall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
made anſwere, following rather
pleaſant reaſoning, than matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.
And we know, that much more
might haue bene anſwered vnto the
ſame, yea and in farre better ſorte than
we haue done: But yet that whiche we
haue ſaid may ſuffize to our paſtime: and
for the reſt, let it remayne to the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
of <hi>Athens.</hi> We ſée <hi>Phoebus</hi> now
not to beholde vs with a ſtraight aſpect,
we féele the ayre refreſhed, and knowe
this Feaſt, which we at our comming
hither left through the exceſſiue heate, to
be agayne begonne by our companions.
And therfore it ſéemeth vs good, that we
returne to the ſame: and this being ſayd,
ſhe toke with hir delicate hande, the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
crowne from hir heade, and in the
place where ſhe ſate, ſhe laide it downe,
ſaying: I leaue here the crowne of my
honour and yours, vntill that we ſhall
retourne hither to the like reaſoning.

And hauing thus ſayde, ſhe toke <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copo</hi>
by the hand, that now with the reſt
was riſen, and ſo returned with them al
to their Feaſt. Thence was heard of all
ſides the pleaſant inſtruments, and the
aire reſounding of amorous ſongs, no
part of the Garden was without ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketting:
wherin they all abode merily
all that day, euen to the laſt houre: but
night béeing come vppon them, and the
ſtarres ſhewing foorth their light, it ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
good to the lady, and to them all, to
depart, and to returne to the citie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
bring entred, <hi>Philocopo</hi> taking his
leaue, thus ſayde vnto hir: Moſt noble
<hi>Fiametta,</hi> if the Gods ſhould euer graunt
me, that I were mine owne, as I am an
others, without doubt I ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
yours, but bicauſe mine owne I
am not, I can not giue my ſelfe to an
other: Howe be it for ſo muche as the
miſerable heart coulde receiue ſtraunge
fire, ſo muche the more it féeleth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
your ineſtimable worthyneſſe to
be kindeled, and ſhall feele alwayes
and inceſſantly, with more effecte ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:9837:88"/>
deſire neuer to be forgetfull of your
worthineſſe. She thanked <hi>Philocopo</hi>
greatly of this curteſie at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
adding that it would pleaſe
the Gods quickely to bring
a gracious peace to
his deſire.
