            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Power by whom all things were made, who is called Chriſt Jeſus,
hath lightned every one of you with the true light which

with which you are all lightned: And firſt, The light meaſureth
every mans ſtate in true Judgement, and with it you may all ſee
your ſelves in the ſtate wherein you now ſtand which is a ſtate

which was bleſſed.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſearch and conſider your ſtate and condition in

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118851:3"/>
in the Image of the Creator created he them, without ſin or evil;
&amp; man was a noble Plant, vvholly a right Seed, planted vvith the
choiceſt Vine, &amp; placed in paradiſe, the Garden of the Creator,
and there vvas ſet to bring forth Fruit, &amp; to glorifie and honor
him by whom man and all creatures vvere made; for man vvas
made perfect and upright, ſet in the councel of his Maker with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſin, or ſpot, or evil in his ſight, and was the glory of the
Creator, and was made for his glory; and Power and Wiſdom
vvas given unto man to rule and govern in Dominion, in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
and in Wiſdom over all living creatures, and was
Lord over all things, and had rule and authority over all the
Creation, and was Steward over all things whom the Creator
had made, who made all things for man, and made them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
unto him, to be ordered and governed by him, and uſed to
his glory by vvhom they were made; and in that day when
man was in the councel of him that made him, and was ſubject

was all creatures bleſſed, and not any thing was evil that was
made, but good in his ſight that made it, and good unto man
that vvas to uſe it, he being brought forth in the Image of the
Creator, and had a meaſure of his Wiſdom and his Power to
teach him, and to lead him in the exerciſe of all creatures, and
was in perfect freedom over all things, to rule in the Wiſdom
of God. And this was the ſtate of man before tranſgreſsion,
which ſtate vvas bleſſed, and not ſubject to the curſe of miſery,
or ſorrow, nor trouble, nor torment; but man diſobeyed the
Power that made him, and went from its Councel, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to its will, and grieved it, and vexed it till it became his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

&amp; ſo his mind &amp; heart adulterated from the Creator
into the viſible glories, pleaſures, and things which were leſs

Creation, and forgot the Power that made him; and thus
being vvith his mind turned into the earth, there the evil entred
and the devil overcame him vvith his temptations, &amp; the power
of the earthly darkneſs gained dominion over him to ſvvay his
affections, deſires and luſts, into vanities of the earth, and he

with them who became captive vvith his mind, to be ruled by
them in vanity and in evil: And thus man became unprofitable
to his Maker, and unfruitful in the Garden, and kept it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled;
and being turned from the Covenant wherein he was
ſet, into his own willing and deſiring in the outward Creation,
the evil defiled him, and he became evil, and a fruitleſs tree that
cumbred the ground, and an enmity was placed in him by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
and all things became evil to him, and the door of
all miſery and ſorrovv was opend, &amp; let in the curſe upon him

the Creator, and of the myſtery of his glory and wiſdom; and
every one in particular, and none excepted of all the children
of <hi>Adam</hi> upon the face of the whole earth, but all have ſinned

heart hath poſſeſſed all, and all have fallen ſhort of the glory
of the Creator, &amp; all men are concluded (by his ſpirit) to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſin, and children of Wrath, and Heirs of Corruption, and
in diſobedience &amp; rebellion to the life that gives all men a being;
the whole world, &amp; all people in it, without exceptions of tribes,
Generations, or Nations, this is the ſtate &amp; condition of all the
ſons of men; all fleſh hath corrupted his way upon the earth
in his ſight that made it; and the wickedneſs of man is great in
the earth, and the imaginations and thoughts of every mans
heart is evil continually, and grieveth the Creator; for the
whole earth is filled with violence through mans trnſgreſſion:
And now if any ſtock or age hath priviledge one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

whom the world was made, into blindneſs of heart, and to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118851:4"/>
the loathing of your ſelves, and are more ignorant of your
Maker then the Ox is of his owner, or the Aſſe of his Maſters
Crib; for you know not him that gives you life and all good
things, and that upholds you by the Word of his Power; and
this is his word unto you all, You are all under the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and ſubject to his wil, acting in iniquity and in evil, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth the fruits of death from that ground in which you
now ſtand, which is curſed, and your Maker hath no pleaſure in
it, for your fruits grieves his ſpirit that made you, and vexes his
ſoul which brought you forth; for man is degenerated into the
plant of a ſtrange Vine, and brings forth wild grapes and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
fruits which is of a bitter taſte unto the Lords ſoul, who
planted all things for himſelf, who is the good Husband man;
but the whole earth is currupted, and all mankind in it, and
man is not now acted, nor led, nor ruled in his heart by the
Power that made him, which gives him all good things; but the
power of Satan, the Serpent, the old Dragon, which decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the beginning who is in the enmity againſt the life of
the Creator; he acts man, and rules man, to the abuſe of all
creatures, and to his own deſtruction, and every particular

from miſery; nor none priviledged one above another unto
happineſs, but as I have ſaid, Male and Female, who was made

man in the whole world is in the enmity againſt the life
of the power that made him and is a child of wrath and ſhut
up in blindneſs and unbelief under the Devils power, which
power abode not in the truth, but is out of the truth, and all
mankind is left in this condition without help, or helper, or
deliverance, or means, or way of ſalvation from himſelf or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other creature upon the face of the whole earth but is a
Sheep without a Shepherd, ſtraying and wandering in the
thoughts of his own heart, after vanity, and that wherein there
is no profit to the Lord, nor to his own ſoul, but death and
ſorrow in all his wayes, having forſaken the Fountain of living

waters, and gone a whoring after other Lovers, and defiled
himſelf, and ſo brought deſtruction upon himſelf by his own
doings, who abounds in all evil, lying, theft murder, envy, ſtrife,
ſtealing, and Whoredom, and ſuch like which are the fruits of
the ground that is curſed for mans ſake: But now unto all
people, the ſons and daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt man that
ever vvas made; though you be thus fallen into miſery by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
and helpleſs from your ſelves, or from any other
creature, yet hath the living God, the povver which made you,
and which you have tranſgreſſed againſt, ordained and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a way to be reſtored and healed, and to be brought to the
injoyment and feeling of the Creator from the diſobedience,
and from the curſe and miſery, unto the bleſſing and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and unto all Mankind in particular, is prepared a way out
of death unto life, out of the loſs which every man hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in tranſgreſſion, to ſalvation, and redemption, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
out of the captivity and bondage, which all is fallen into,
into liberty and freedom, to ſerve his Maker, &amp; to glorifie him,
for he hath not been ſerved nor glorified, but grieved and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all men on the earth; and ſo he hath brought miſery
and the curſe upon all, by forſaking them, and leaving them
under the power which made them not, to be led and guided
by it in rebellion unto deſtruction. And now this ſame power
by which man was made is mans Reſtorer, and Deliverer, and
Redeemer and Saviour, though he have tranſgreſſed againſt it;
for vvhen there vvas none to help nor to ſave of any creature
upon the face of the earth, the arm of that Power vvhich
made all things ſtretched forth its ſelf to ſave the creatures
vvhich vvas made; and that ſame Povver vvhich is trangreſſed is
the Redeemer of all mankind, though it is offended, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened,
and preſſed as a Cart vvith ſheaves by tranſgreſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Creator; and that is the povver vvhich vvorks out
ſalvation and deliverance by ſlaying the enmity, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
iniquity, and removing the curſed ground out of mans
heart, that the evil Fruits may ceaſe vvhich it brings forth; and
by this Povver all muſt be ſaved that ever are ſaved, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from Wrath. And this all men have been ignorant of,
and not felt, nor knovvn, nor taſted of the life and povver of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118851:5"/>
the Creator, though it hath been near unto every one, and all
men and creatures lives, moves, and hath their being by it, and
ſuſtenance from it, and yet man tranſgreſſes it, and grieves
it, and is not led by it.</p>
            <p>Therefore all people upon earth conſider your condition
and ſtate, and hearken to the Power that made you, a meaſure
of which moveth in the hearts of all mankind upon the face
of the earth; and it moveth againſt the evil, and againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
and tranſgreſſing part in every mans heart that is come
into the World; and this Power by which all men was made,
and which they have tranſgreſſed againſt (a meaſure of it from
the Father is made manifeſt to all mankind upon the face of the
Earth, and convinceth of the evil, of Murder, and Adultery,
and ſuch like, and condemneth the works which are evil in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular man, whether Heathens or Chriſtians (ſo called)
and unto all people; here is the way to be reſtored into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with your Maker, a meaſure of his power in you, ſecretly
moves upon you, and calls to you to return to it, to be led and
guided by it in fear, and obedience, and ſubjection to it, from
which you have been driven, and againſt which you have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greded;
and this power the Creator hath ſent his Son into the
World, and given him a gift unto all mankind, &amp; he hath given
light and underſtanding to every particular man to know good
from evil; truth from a lye, right from wrong; Juſtice from
injuſtice, and equity from falſhood; and this Power of the Son
of God in you, doth witneſs to you, and accept you, when with
it you be guided, and vvhen according to it you ſpeak and act;
and it juſtifies the good, and the right, and the equal, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
all men in that from condemnation; but againſt lying and
wrong dealing, and deceit, and injuſtice it teſtifies; and when
you do theſe things, you tranſgreſs againſt that Power that
made you, which ſhould ſave you, and juſtifie you, and excuſe
you, and with it you are accuſed and condemned, and it brings
trouble upon you, and the curſe of miſery and ſorrow; and
this Power in you will ſearch your hearts, and try your reins,
and let you ſee your thoughts, and make manifeſt unto you the
ſtate and condition of mankind, who is become enemy to his
Maker, in following that which brings death, upon which the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118851:6"/>
wrath remaineth till there be a returning unto the Power by
which man was made, a meaſure of which (as I have ſaid) mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
in the hearts of the ſons and daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> in all
the world: And now if every one of you do turn your minds
from the World, and from the glories and vanities thereof, and
from the evil which hath poſſeſſed you in thoughts &amp; actions;
and if you ſtand ſtill for a moment from willing and deſiring
to your ſelves and after the World, this ſhall you find ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moving in you, which ſhall draw you towards the Creator
to enjoy him, and to ſee his glory, which none that are ſtill in
tranſgreſſion againſt him can ever partake of, or behold; and
if to that you hearken within you, and heed it, and follow it,
which witneſſeth to that Power that made you to be great, and
mighty, and wonderful, this will ſhew that you are ſhort of his
glory, and it will condemn evil in you in all thoughts, and
words, &amp; actions, which proceedeth out of the curſed ground
in which the Creator hath no pleaſure; and this will take away
the vail vvhich is ſpread over you all, and open the blinde eye,
and unſtop the deaf ear, and bring you to hear, and ſee, and
underſtand the things vvhich are eternal, which belongs unto
your peace; and if you all come to be guided by that which
moves in you againſt evil, it vvill lead you up to its ſelf to be
renewed and changed (out of the evil, and from under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
povver, under which every man bath been ſubject, which
Povver hath been out of truth) into the Image and likeneſs of
the Creator, and to be reſtored to his Inheritance to enjoy
peace and reſt for ever.</p>
            <p>And this is the Word of the Creator of Heaven and Earth
to you all, and to all mankind, this is the Way unto redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſalvation, &amp; unto the bleſsing, out of all ſorrow, and
troubles, and afflictions, and torments, and vvoes and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
vvhich is the Portion for ever of all that diſobeys this
Power which moves againſt evil in you, which is the Power of
him that made all men and things which moveth in your hearts
againſt all that which the Creator never placed in you, but

muſt you own and believe in &amp; follow, and be guided by it, and
bear its condemnation and judgement upon all that which is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118851:6"/>
contrary to it; if ever you be reſtored to the bleſſed ſtate, and
all anger, and wrath, and murder, and lying, and diſſembling,
and whoredom, and drunkenneſs, and brutiſhneſs, and beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
and wantonneſs, and backbiting, and theft, and all theſe
things whatſoever muſt be condemned in you, for who acts
theſe things, are Enemies to the Creator, and is led by the
Povver of Darkneſs which is the deſtroyer of you ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and the cauſe of the curſe upon you, and the ground of all
ſorrow, and ſufferings, and afflictions, and troubles which
comes upon that part in you which is in tranſgreſsion againſt
the power of God, for there is a birth born of the fleſh which
brings forth, and goes after fleſhly Wayes, fleſhly Joyes and
Delights, and Pleaſures, and fleſhly Words and Vanities, which
murders the Juſt, and blinds the eye, and grieves your Maker;
and this birth muſt not inherit eternal life, but all that ever
doth inherit muſt be born again of another Seed, and into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Nature, where all the former things is paſſed away, for
all glories of this World will wither, and all your joyes and
pleaſures will come to an end, and you will be left miſerable
and wretched.</p>
            <p>Therefore oh earth, earth, and all the children of <hi>Adam</hi> in
the whole World, be awakened, be awakened and ſtirred up to
conſider of your ſtate and condition, for the Creator of all
things is riſen to gather his people up to himſelf, and his voice
ſoundeth abroad through the whole World; if any hath an ear
to hear, let him hear; terror and vengeance is againſt all the
rebellious, and to the judgement muſt all come before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of all things, to be judged by him according to the Power
which moves in every man, which is juſt and equal, and witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
in equity, which is a meaſure of the Power that made the
World, and all mankind unto it ſhall confeſs, to its greatneſs,
to its juſtneſs, and to its authority; and to it muſt all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Adam</hi> bow, and before it tremble, and he that hath
done good, and lived in meekneſs and ſoberneſs, in the truth,
and in juſtneſs, in all that which is good, &amp; not in any evil, ſhal
receive life, peace, reſt and glory from the righteous Judge, the
Power by whom the World was made, and he ſhall be excuſed
from all condemnation; but he that hath done evil, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118851:7"/>
againſt the Power of God by which he is upholden,
who is degenerate, and brings forth rudeneſs, wildneſs, and
wickedneſs, he ſhall receive tribulation and anguiſh, and be
deprived of happineſs in this life and for ever; and all who
doth not own the meaſure of the Power of the Creator in you
to be guided by it, ſuch doth neglect and reject the day of your
Viſitation, and ſhuts your ſelves out from the glory of God,
and are unworthy of life and peace; but all that owns this, and
are ſubject to it, the Power of his Son, who is the Maker of all
things, and doth follow it, this will reconcile you, and ſtay the
enmity, and bring you into unity with the Creator, and this
will lead you out of darkneſs out of death and evil, and all the
wayes thereof, and will ſave you from all the effects thereof,
and you will be excuſed and juſtified in the ſight of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
Therefore all people upon earth conſider, this is the day
of your Viſitation, the Way of life and of death is ſet before
you, the Way unto peace, and the way of trouble; Priſe the day
