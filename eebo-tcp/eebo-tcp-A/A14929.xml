         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning the
Argument of
Sea-faring go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement,
so
farre as by any
monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts can be observed,
our beginning must be at the
inhabitants of the Iland cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Rhode,</hi> situate within the
<hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20269:9"/>
part thereof called the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>path</hi>
sea, upon the coast of
<hi>Asia minor,</hi> over against <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi>
The indwellers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
amongst all other people
we can reade of, were most
famous for shipping and
Sayling; and that not onely
to the great increase of their
power and wealth every
way, as by which they did
command and daunt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
people about their
coasts and seas; in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that neither Pirat, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sort of enemy, or distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their peace and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique,
durst then appeare<note n="a" place="margin">Gellius, lib. 7. Cap. 3.</note>:
but also by the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20269:9"/>
of their trade, and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
on sea, they did make
neighbour Princes, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
willingly Tributars un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them<note n="b" place="margin">Strab. geogr. lib. 12. cap. 14.</note>. And further, as
<hi>Strabo</hi> writeth<note n="c" place="margin">Ibid.</note> to the crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of their renowne, they
surpassed all other Nations
in knowledge of equity in
marine businesse; which
they manifested by making
of Sea-lawes.</p>
               <p>For, the very Emperors
of Rome, <hi>Tiberius Caesar,
Hadrian, Vespasian, Traian,</hi>
successively, did referre all
seafaring debates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
to the judgement
of the <hi>Rhodian</hi> law.<note n="d" place="margin">Vide Il. Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dior. in prin.</note> And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20269:10"/>
so likewise exemplarilie, did
their successor <hi>Antoninus,</hi> by
his rescript yet extant<note n="e" place="margin">L. deprecatio ad L. Rhod. e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wherein, answering to one
<hi>Eudemon</hi> his plaint, I am
(saith he) the Lord of the
world, but the law is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the sea; let that thy
plaint and controversie <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon</hi>
be decided by the law
of the <hi>Rhodians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So farre did the Romans
(who alwaies excelled all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations, in devising of
humane lawes) yeeld and
give place to the <hi>Rhodians</hi> in
the sea lawes.</p>
               <p>And by their example,
finding sea-faring and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20269:10"/>
on sea, redound to a
great common wealth, as
plainly pronounced<note n="f" place="margin">L. 1. sect. licet. de exerc. act.</note> 
                  <hi>Vlpian,</hi>
one of the fathers of their
lawes; the Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and namely <hi>Claudius,</hi>

actions, and devised a kinde
of new and sure commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and gaine for trafiquers;
by taking upon them the
hazard of shippe and goods:
to which end also is erected
by English lawes, the office
of Assurance.</p>
               <p>It is true, that the first ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Sea lawes, is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by some attributed to
others, as by <hi>Dionysius</hi> to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20269:11"/>
the <hi>Phenicians,</hi> because of
Merchant trade<note n="h" place="margin">De situ orbis.</note>. And <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
for that same cause as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes
the Art of sayling to
the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiam. c. 27.</note>. and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
would seeme to
attribute to these two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
also for their necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
the skill of sayling. To
be briefe, by the space of a
thousand yeeres, the sea, at
least the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> was
onely ruled by the <hi>Rhodian</hi>
law, but helped with some
few additions by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
and that by way of
interpretation: the rather, to
occurre to the deceits and
Sophistrie of calumniators
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20269:11"/>
and wilfull vexers of their
neighbours, as also for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
needfull doubts<note n="k" place="margin">Dotimus in lib. suo legoli.</note>.</p>
               <p>At last, when all sorts of
lawes by the eversion and
renting of the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
was as it were for a
long time buried, necessity
forced the Rulers of Rome,
<hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1075. to make
new sea lawes and statutes:
and so successively, every
chiefe sea-faring towne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> coast,
to adde other ordinances;
as they of <hi>Marseilles</hi> did,
<hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1162. and they
of <hi>Genua, Anno Dom.</hi> 1186.
And they of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:20269:12"/>
called <hi>Morea, Anno Dom.</hi>
1200. and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of <hi>Venice, Anno Dom.</hi>
1215. And the Emperours
of Constantinople, <hi>Paleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log.
Anno Dom.</hi> 1262. and
<hi>Constantine,</hi> 1270. and <hi>Iames</hi>
King of Aragon that same
yeere; and <hi>Peter</hi> King of
Aragon, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1340.
and they of <hi>Barcelona, Anno
Dom.</hi> 1434. which lawes
being all collected and amas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
serve the <hi>Mediterraneans</hi>
unto this day.</p>
               <p>But on the great Ocean,
which is our sea, the first
lawes we knew to be made,
were devised by them of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20269:12"/>
the Iland of <hi>Oleron,</hi> situate
on the sea coast of <hi>France,</hi>
beside S. <hi>Martin</hi> against the
mouth of <hi>Charante</hi> and the
<hi>Marraes,</hi> neere to the entry
of <hi>Garumna:</hi> which are
therefore called <hi>La roold' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leron;</hi>
as by which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
on the sea coast
of <hi>France</hi> toward the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
were ordinarily decided,
in the towne of the said
Ile, called thereupon, <hi>Lavile
de droict,</hi> or <hi>Oleron.</hi> As
where the skilled Skippers
in that law did dwell, and
had cognition of all such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
debates and questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:20269:13"/>
Now these lawes of <hi>Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
were afterward transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into Dutch by them of
<hi>Wisby,</hi> for the sea use of the
Dutch coast.</p>
               <p>And of late, our Kings
of <hi>Scotland</hi> made divers Acts
in Parliament, concerning
sea-faring<note n="l" place="margin">Vide act. par. lia. Scot.</note>.</p>
               <p>As also the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
have done before<note n="m" place="margin">Vide statut. Ang.</note>:
for <hi>Edward</hi> the third, by a
solemne inquisition of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
most famous persons
for skill in sea-faring, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at <hi>Quinborow</hi> from
divers parts, <hi>Anno</hi> 1375. set
downe certaine articles
concerning the Admiralty
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20269:13"/>
and sea-faring, into old
French: as may be seene in
an old parchment authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
booke yet extant;
which articles one <hi>Thomas
Roucghton</hi> of that same, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
afterward in Latine, and
intituled <hi>de officio admiralita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
Angliae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise <hi>Fredericke</hi> the
second of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> in his
generall convention, at Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhaven,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1561: sets
downe a compend of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
for ruling of his Sea-faring
subjects; but for most
part all one with <hi>La rooled' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also the French King
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20269:14"/>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the third, added his
new constitutions to these
of <hi>Francois,</hi> and others his
predecessors, which are
chiefly for the authorising
of his Admiralty, Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
honour and profits ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
preferring the Admirall
and his officers to all other
Iudges and Iustices, except
these called Royals.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all these
many, divers, and late Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
and Ordinances made
and set forth these sixeteene
hundreth yeares, by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
people, and Princes
above written, in the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of causes, and judging of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20269:14"/>
sea-faring controversies; that
fragment of the <hi>Rhodian</hi>
law, extant and Latinized
by <hi>Simon Shardius,</hi> intituled
by him, <hi>Leges navales Rhodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum
&amp; selectae Leges Rhodio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
with the interpretations
and commentations, devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thereupon by the old
Romane <hi>Iurisconsults</hi> insert
in the <hi>Pandects;</hi> together
with the constitutions made
by the Romane Emperours,
contained in the <hi>Cod.</hi> and
<hi>Novells</hi> at large: as it were
by common consent of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
obtaines the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi>
as in <hi>Great Brittaine, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20269:15"/>
France, Italy,</hi> and
<hi>Spaine.</hi> Such is the force and
authority of the Civill Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Law amongst all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Christian.</p>
               <p>In which Countries, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
there hath bin, and yet
remaines a great number of
professors and doctors of
the Roman civill law, who
have written largely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon;
yet few or none hath
taken in hand to write per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
or expresly, upon
the lawes concerning sea-faring,
the traffique on sea,
and by sea, with the duties
requisite of every sea-faring
person, of all sorts and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20269:15"/>
degrees.</p>
               <p>It is true that <hi>Iulius Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rettus</hi>
in his observant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir
to the Emperour <hi>Charls</hi>
the fift, prepared a discourse
for the addressing of Navies
with convenient and expert
Governours, and all sort of
necessaries for hostility on
the sea, intituled <hi>de iure &amp; re
nautica,</hi> but farre off from
our present Argument, as
may bee seene by the same
of late published, <hi>Anno</hi> 1579.
and dedicated to <hi>Philip,
Charles</hi> his sonne, by <hi>Exupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantius
Ferrettus,</hi> sonne also
to the said <hi>Iulius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Petrus Pekkius</hi> also a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20269:16"/>
Fleming <hi>Zelander,</hi> hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
commented upon the
titles of the civill law, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sea-lawes; but more
busied about the exposition
of words then of the matter.
Likewise <hi>Benvenutus Strac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi>
in his large booke <hi>de
mercatura,</hi> interlaceth a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
title, <hi>de nautis, navibus
&amp; navigationibus,</hi> but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
not close to this our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;
for he holds
straightly within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of the civill law, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing
also his pretermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and remissions of many
chiefe matters to certaine
Doctors, who also writes but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20269:16"/>
                  <hi>obiter</hi> of the sea matters, and
none speakes of the sea cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
which is our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
argument: To the end
of which booke is annexed
an halfe sheet of paper, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>consilia Roderici Suarij

vehendis;</hi> a turne of small
contentment.</p>
               <p>'Tis true that <hi>Simon Shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,
Anno</hi> 1561. promised
this same compend and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of sea lawes forth of all
lawes (which presently by
Gods grace I intend) but by
death prevented, could not
performe it.</p>
               <p>To conclude then, since no
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20269:17"/>
man, as I can understand,
hath set his pen to this my
argument and purpose, for
the due information of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sort of sea-faring persons
in every order, whether
Commanders, Iudges, Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
Mariners, Merchants,
Passengers, Fishers, Ferry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Watermen, &amp;c. concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their severall duties,
priviledges and powers, and
all manner of things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
or incident to sea
and sea-farers; I thought
good, after the insight and
deepe consideration of all
the lawes and ordinances
aforesaid, to mend a weake
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20269:17"/>
piece of labour, which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
many yeares since,
intituled the <hi>Sea law of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and to frame the same
in a very harmonicall col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of all sea-lawes,
And upon the conscience
of my profession of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
law, having no em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
or part in any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty,
to publish the same
for the use of the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and benefit of all bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent
sea-farers; and that
presently, because of the
present use thereof so requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the same, as I now
cleerly perceive: that is to say;
Because that wheras the most
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20269:18"/>
civill, wise, and politicke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
have even most care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
distinguished the juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the sea from the
jurisdiction of the land in all
respects: yet neverthelesse
some men prease alwaies,
upon what intent I wot not,
to confound the same. And
the multitude of these who
doe acknowledge the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
distinction, as specially
the Mariners, through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
contemne all other
law but the rule of <hi>Oleron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these respects (I say) I
have with great paine and
travell, concluded the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of this work; which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20269:18"/>
if it please (as I pray) God to
blesse with the owne effect,
I have reward enough.</p>

an Overseer, or a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
on sea or on land;
for <hi>Mirar</hi> is to see, as the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> useth it. From this
word <hi>Amiras,</hi> commeth the
word <hi>Amirante</hi> to the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
for the Leader of their
fleets, as well as <hi>L'amirag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio:</hi>
albeit they tearme
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:20269:22"/>
their sea-faring Iudges, <hi>Li
consoli del mare,</hi> and such like
from the same word Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
which most part of the
Nations of Europe use in
the same meaning; as first
and chiefly <hi>France,</hi> where
<hi>Childebert</hi> the first, one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
yeeres sithence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
an Admirall as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and Commander of
his Armie upon sea, like as
he did then ordaine a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall
for the governement of
his <hi>Gen d'armerie</hi> on land.
Onely the <hi>Spaniard</hi> called
this Leader and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his fleets and navies,
<hi>Adelantado:</hi> as who should
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20269:23"/>
goe before the rest.</p>
               <p>Briefly, the word Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
how ever this day it be
used or abused, for to signifie
the chiefe shippe, which was
<hi>Navis praetoria</hi> to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
as the chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of the fleet; yet that
word Great Admirall, notes
properly the man whom
the Romans called <hi>Praefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
maris,</hi> and the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<hi>Thalassiarcham:</hi> to wit,
the Governour of the sea.
And thus farre concerning
names and styles for the

of ships, fleets, and seas.</p>
               <p>But concerning the jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20269:23"/>
of the sea, and the
exercises of justice amongst
sea-faring men; at first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Romans, it was
allowed to every President
on the coasts, and afterward
other Iudges were specially

called <hi>Magisteriani:</hi>

               <p>Sithence, in these latter
daies, for the readier obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the great Admirall

agreed, that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration

their speciall prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

floud; that therefore they
should also have a soveraine
jurisdiction onely proper
to themselves, over all sea-faring
men within their
bounds, and in all sea-faring
causes and debates, civill
and criminall. So that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

meddle therewith, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by way of assistance; and
that by commission and in

sith the goods which they
have wrongfully taken from
others, whether they be

are esteemed to bee a just
prey to any taker, so that

the Admirall: in case the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
finde the goods of his

the Pirat, hee should make
the same forth-comming to
the just owner claiming the
same; his cost, charges and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:20269:96"/>
hazard, being alwaies consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and allowed;<note n="a" place="margin">Per l. Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponius de acq. rei dom.</note> so
that if any man buy or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme

from the owner.<note n="b" place="margin">Per l. mulier. de cap. &amp; post.</note> But if
no man claime the goods
taken from a Pirat, then
should the same be delivered

               <p>If a ship or goods be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:20269:97"/>
the same is taken back,
and recovered by any friend,
and the just owner claime
the same, it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to the owner; for that
by the law, <hi>Huiusmodi res

in effect a plaine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
of a liberty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
for all of all Nations,
to fish indifferently on all
kinde of Seas, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
a turning of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:20269:108"/>
proprieties to a
community; as the fift chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thereof at large discovers
(wherein the unknowne
Authour protesteth, that he
may for his warrant use the
authority and words of such
old Writers as have beene
esteemed most mighty in the
understanding and judging
upon the naturall condition
of things here below) and
the Discourse, being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with the maintenance
of a liberty to saile to the
Indians; I thought alwaies
expedient by occasion of
this argument of fishing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in my former Title,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:20269:108"/>
by Gods grace, to occurre
thereunto; as manifestly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
at least (in my weake
sight) tending to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of my most worthy
Prince and his subjects; and
that not onely by arguments
derived from the first verity
of the nature of things, but
also from his owne proofs,
warrants, and their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
               <p>And yet before I goe any
further, I cannot passe the
Authour his ridiculous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
in both Epistle and
beginning of his Discourse;
as for a liberty onely to
saile on Seas: a thing farre
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:20269:109"/>
off from all controversie, at
least upon the Ocean; speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
since passage upon land
through all Regions Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
is this day so indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
permitted to all of all
Nations, even to Turkes,
Iewes, Pagans, not being
professed enemies; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
much lesse to be restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
on Sea in all respects. So
that I cannot but perswade
both my selfe, and other loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
subjects, that the said pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is but a very pretence;
and so much the more to be
suspected as a drift against
our undoubted right and
propriety of fishing on this
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:20269:109"/>
side the Seas.</p>
               <p>Now remembring the

by the opinions and
sayings of some old Poets,
Orators, Philosophers, and
(wrested) Iurisconsults, that
Land and Sea, by the first
condition of nature, hath
beene and should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all, and proper to
none: against this I minde to
use no other reason, but a
simple and orderly reciting
of the words of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
concerning that first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
naturall of Land and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:20269:110"/>
Sea from the very beginning;
at which time, God having
made and so carefully to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man disposed the foure
Elements, two to swimme
above his head, and two to
lye under his feet: that is to
say, the Earth and Water,
both wonderfully for that
effect ordered to the up-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of one and a perfect
Globe, for their more mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
service to mans use: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the creation, God saith to
man,<note n="a" place="margin">Genes. 1. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Subdue the earth, and

               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:20269:110"/>

the earth:</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">eod. c. 9. v. 1.</note> and for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

God in his justice against the

                  <hi>These are the Iles of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

that hereby is evident that

and what? even the usage of

common to every one of

<hi>Iure gentium;</hi> that is, according
to the law kept by all other

               <p>Moreover, albeit these

pronounce so, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the community of the
sea-shoare, and coast, that
private men may build hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
within the floud-marke,
and appropriate them to
themselves, according to
that which <hi>Neratius</hi> writes,

               <p>For answer, first concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the nature of the sea, as
supposed impossibly occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or acquirable; Is this so
thought because the sea is
not so solid, as is the land,
that men may trade thereon,
as upon land? or that it is
continually flowing to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:20269:117"/>
fro? Surely, that lacke of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
for man his trading
thereon by foot, shall not
hinder the solid possession of
it, farre lesse the occupation
and acquiring, if we will give
to the sea, that which the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risconsults
indulgently grant
to the land, which also can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied. <hi>Paulus</hi> the
Iurisconsult saith,<note n="x" place="margin">In l. possideri. de acquir. poss.</note> 
                  <hi>Qui

needfull for him who would

it is sufficient to enter-in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any thereof, with a mind
to possesse all the rest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
even to the due marches.
And what can stay this to
be done on sea, as well as on
land? And thus farre concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the solidity.</p>
               <p>As for the flowing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the sea, howsoever
it be liquid, fluid, and unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in the particles thereof,

not so: because it keepes the

               <p>VVhich discourse, gives

which kinde of doing being
embraced, the Geometers
may steale away the earth,
and the Astronomers the
heavens from us.</p>
               <p>It is true, that there are not
in every part of the sea Iles
sensible (as <hi>Gernsey</hi> is to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

sands (as the <hi>Washes</hi> at the

for the designation of the
bounds (or laying-out the
limits) of the divisible parts
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:20269:119"/>
thereof: but GOD, who is
both the distributer and first
Author of the diuision and
distinction of both land and
sea, hath given an understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
heart to man for the
same effect, as well as for all
other necessary actions
wherein he hath to employ
himselfe: so that to a very
wonder, God hath diversly
informed men by the helpes
of the Compasse, counting
of courses, sounding, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
waies, to finde forth, and
to designe <hi>finitum in infinito;</hi>
so farre as is expedient for
the certaine reach &amp; bounds
of seas, properly pertaining

               <p>And thus farre through oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of answering to that
alleadged impossibility, of
acquiring the Sea by occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
because (as would
appeare) of the unsolidity
therof, for any foot treading.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:20269:121"/>
It rests to touch the other
cause naturall, for that other
impossibility, which may be
the continuall fluxe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stability
of the Sea; in such
sort, that it would appeare
not aye to be one and the

changeable. For answer, I
must remember that which

so prettily:<note n="d" place="margin">In l propon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and often be changed and
altred, that none of that first
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:20269:121"/>
Colledge or Legion could
be found alive, nor yet any
part of the Shippe or body
could be so certainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
that it might be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for the very same that it
was at the first; yet if that

even so, however
the sea many waies and hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
changes, in the small parts
thereof, by the ordinary rush
on land, mixture with other
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:20269:122"/>
waters, swelling in it selfe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation
and backe receipts
thereof by raine; yet since
the great body of the Sea
most constantly keepes the
set place prescribed by the
Creator, I see not in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
neither, wherefore the
nature of the Sea should not
yeeld to occupation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.
And thus farre concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Mare liberum</hi> his last
and great conclusion, against
all appropriation thereof by
people or Princes. I call it his
last great conclusion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of other two passing
before, whereof the first is
this; <hi>Mare igitur proprium
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:20269:122"/>
alicuius fieri non potest, quia
natur a iubet esse commune:</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Pag. 21.</note>
and for what reason? Even
because <hi>Cicero, Virgil,</hi> and
<hi>Plautus</hi> have said so. To
whom I could also assent
concerning the great, huge,
and maine body of the sea.
His next conclusion is this;
<hi>Est igitur mare in numero eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
quae in commercio non
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <note n="f" place="margin">Pag. 25.</note> that is,
The Sea to be of that order
of things, which cannot bee
appropriate to any man.
His warrants for his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
also are the Romane
Lawyers, whom I said to be
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:20269:123"/>
wrested by <hi>Mare liberum;</hi> and
therefore must shew the

confirmeth. The which, as
I accept, so I would further
demand of him. By what
reason should a private man,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:20269:123"/>
who hath no other care nor
respect but to himselfe alone,
be thus priviledged and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to a Prince? who not
for himselfe; but for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
also in common, yea and
for the safety of all traders
passing his coasts, with great
charges and care protects
and conserveth the Seas nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
unto him: shall not this
Prince be acknowledged, at
least with the good which
that Sea, conserved by him,
offers so directly to him?
And I pray you say, What
lesse authority had <hi>Leo</hi> than
the rest of the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
to grant to every
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:20269:124"/>
one in particular, having
possessions at the Sea side, as
much of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

against their lands,<note n="k" place="margin">Novell. const. 102. 103. &amp; 104.</note>
with the fishings thereof?
What then, shall not Princes
be equalled, in these cases,
with subjects? Or rather,
have not all Princes a like
right &amp; power within their
own precinct and bounds, as
these Roman Princes had?</p>
               <p>But now to draw neerer to
the chiefe point of our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and so to the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:

more heartily embrace the

next, which is this; When

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:20269:127"/>
as their imployment now-a-dayes

their forth-setting and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration

the same to <hi>Iulius Ferretus,</hi>

Some touch I have here sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,

some thing concerning the

his warfare-ships, the graces

with their duties, power and

               <p>Captaines of Princes war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare-shippes
should be men,
first, fearing God, because
they must continually walke
in the midst of the wondrous
workes of God. Next, they
should be stout, hardy, and
couragious. Thirdly, vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
diligent, and carefull;

is full of hazard and danger,

even so are their occasions
and opportunities sudden
and momentanie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their commandement
and power over their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
not onely surpasseth
the power of Masters and
Commanders of private
shippes, but also that of the
Captaines on land; and
therefore their honour and
estimation every way high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
also, because of their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
charge, care, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.
Their duty toward
their company, is first, that
they chuse such as bee free
from hainous and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
offences.<note n="c" place="margin">per. l. 4. de re militar.</note> Next,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:20269:128"/>
that they suffer none of their

punish as well the sluggard
as the rebellious:<note n="d" place="margin">per l. 6. eod.</note> yea, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
those who are irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

by a frame not onely

also strong, ticht, and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:

fore-see if they can, that their

such time as experience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
wood to be most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide

cut at the contrary times, is
commonly full of moysture;
and therefore being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
dryed, becomes clung,
and open to receive water.</p>
               <p>The like care and skill is
required in the iron, and all

that the workes may prove
strong, durable, right, and
