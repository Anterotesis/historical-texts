         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Know not whether this Paper will ever ſee the light of the ſun, or not; We being fallen into times of ſuch defection, and degeneracy, even from the common principles of the light of Nature, that <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> ſeem baniſhed out of our <hi>Territories,</hi> and prohibited our Courts of <hi>Judicature:</hi> nothing more frequent than to call <hi>Light Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs Light; Good Evil,</hi> and <hi>Evil Good;</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to <hi>Juſtifie the Wicked,</hi> and <hi>Condemn the Innocent;</hi> Whereof this Paper contains one ſmall and petty Inſtance, which (compared with the great numbers of its fellows, and many of them much deeper in demerit) may be accounted a ſmaller proportion, than <hi>One,</hi> of a <hi>Thouſand:</hi> To make a particular calculation of all which, as it would be next to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibillity, (for they may well be called, <hi>Legion,</hi> or rather, <hi>many Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> and would make <hi>a ſwelling Volumn,</hi> too big for this age well to bear.)

            <head>A brief RELATION of the killing of <hi>John Towneſend</hi> by Major <hi>Edward Crosby,</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>May 1662,</hi> at St. <hi>Albones</hi> in the County of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Court thereupon.</head>
            <p>Upon the day aforeſaid, being Sabbath day, many People being met together in a peaceable manner at the Funeral of one Mrs. <hi>Terril,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Heaward</hi> preaching unto them in a place called, either the <hi>Cloyſter,</hi> or, the <hi>Schoolwhite</hi>; the ſaid <hi>Croſby</hi> come ſwearing in a furious manner, calling them <hi>Rogues,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi> (without any occaſion given him by the People, ſave onely their being met as aforeſaid) and directing his ſpeech to the ſaid <hi>Heaward,</hi> he cried out, <hi>Come down; Why prate you there? Come down, or I will pull you down.</hi> To which <hi>Heaward</hi> replied, <hi>If you have any Authority to command me to come down, I will obey it; but otherwiſe not.</hi> Then <hi>Croſby</hi> ſwore, <hi>He would fetch that which ſhould fetch him down,</hi> and ſo went away; but about half an hour after, he returned again, with a <hi>Piſtol</hi> cock'd in his hand; accompanied by one <hi>Tymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Ratcliffe,</hi> a Conſtable of the Town, with a Fowling-piece in his hand. At which the People being much affrighted to ſee two men come againſt them with <hi>Fire-armes,</hi> ſome of them cried out, <hi>Murther, Murther.</hi> But <hi>Croſby,</hi> with his aſſiſtant <hi>Ratcliffe,</hi> preſſed in amongſt them; Whereupon the ſaid <hi>John Townſend</hi> uttered theſe words, <hi>Noble Major, Pray make no diſturbance, conſider it is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day.</hi> Upon which <hi>Croſby</hi> replyed, <hi>You Rogue, do you tell me of the Sabbath day</hi>? and turned himſelf about towards <hi>Towneſend,</hi> (who ſtood almoſt behind him) and bending down the muzle of his Piſtol, (which before he carried upwards) preſented it againſt <hi>Towneſend,</hi> and gave fire upon him, and ſhot him, that he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately died upon the place. And afterwards both <hi>Croſby</hi> and <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe</hi> made up towards the ſaid <hi>Heaward.</hi> Hereupon there was a great Cry among the People, ſome crying, <hi>Keep the peace, keep the peace.</hi> Others, <hi>Here is a man kil'd, Conſtable do your office; apprehend him that kil'd him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Subſtance of this Relation was proved by ſubſtantial Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Court, and the Jury, and might have been farther te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified (with other agravating Circumſtances) by <hi>a cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> more, had not the Juſtices terrified them through fear, and with threatnings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:104844:4"/>Upon all which, ſeveral of thoſe men who were peaceably met together as aforeſaid, were <hi>bound to their good behaviour,</hi> and <hi>Indicted for a Riot</hi>; eſpecially thoſe who cryed, <hi>Conſtable keep the peace, do your office,</hi> &amp;c. But the ſaid <hi>Ratcliffe,</hi> who was aſſiſtant to <hi>Croſby</hi> and came with him armed as aforeſaid, contrary to the Law; and refuſed to do his Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore in the eye of the Law was deeply acceſſary to the Fact, and ought to have been dealt with accordingly; was notwithſtanding (not onely unmoleſted, but) made <hi>Foreman</hi> of the Jury to try <hi>Crosby,</hi> who ſtood Indicted for <hi>Willful Murther.</hi> Yet nevertheleſs (though <hi>Ratcliff</hi> was <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>) the Jury brought in the Bill, <hi>a true Bill</hi>: At which Sir <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottle Grimſton</hi> demanded of them, <hi>Will you hang a Man upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition? Can you prove that he came with a full intent to kill him?</hi> or words to that effect. And bid them go again; which they did, ſome of them ſaying, <hi>They meant not to hang him, but thought they had done right; for they intended to do as they were bid,</hi> or words to that purpoſe. But (it ſeems not well underſtanding their Leſſon) the ſecond time they brought the Bill in <hi>Ignoramus</hi>; whereupon the ſaid <hi>Croſby</hi> was quit by <hi>Proclamation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now becauſe this ſtory hath filled the ears, and exerciſed the tongues of many,<note place="margin">Your Speech to the King, <hi>Aug. 29 1660.</hi>
               </note> far and near; Let us reaſon a little with Sir <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottle Grimſton</hi> upon ſome <hi>Maxims</hi> of his own. Sir, it was your own obſervation very lately, that, <hi>To ſettle mens eſtates was the way to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et their mindes.</hi> But how (think you) can we look upon our <hi>Eſtates as ſetled,</hi> or, what <hi>quietneſs</hi> can the mindes of <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> have, when their lives ſhall be in jeopardy every hour, and their perſons obnoxious to be aſſaulted, killed and murthered at the malitious rage of ſuch wicked and ungodly wretches as <hi>Croſby,</hi> if juſtice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had againſt the Murtherers? If <hi>Jehu</hi> had reaſon to demand, <hi>What peace ſo long as the Whordoms of Jezabel, and her Witchcrafts are ſo many?</hi> How much more cauſe have <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> to ſay, <hi>What peaceable ſecurity have we, when the Juſtices upon the Bench,</hi> [and no leſs than a <hi>quondam</hi> Speaker of Parliament] <hi>ſhall countenance the Murtherer</hi>? Or, what <hi>Juſtice</hi> are we like to expect, when ſuch ſhall be made <hi>Foremen</hi> of the <hi>Jury</hi> to try Capital Offenders, who were themſelves <hi>acceſſary</hi> to the Crimes committed? eſpecially if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſuch fellow <hi>Jurats,</hi> who ſhall ſay in open Court, <hi>They intended to do as they were bid?</hi> What is the <hi>Law</hi>? or, what is our ſecurity by it when thus perverted, and imployed to puniſh the Innocent, and diſcharge the Guilty? <hi>Peaceable</hi> men bound to their

Or, what <hi>content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> can any of the <hi>Loyal and Faithful</hi> Subjects of the Land receive thereby? Will ſuch <hi>Triacle</hi> as this, <hi>expel the poyſon of</hi> John Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end's <hi>Blood, and make a Sacrifice to appeaſe God's wrath, and ſatisfie Divine Juſtice?</hi> Will God be mocked? Can you demand of him, whether <hi>Croſby</hi> intended to kill? Or, would you know his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Read <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.16. <hi>And if he ſmite him with an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of iron (ſo that he die) he is a murtherer; the murtherer ſhall ſurely be put to death.</hi> And verſ. 31. <hi>Moreover ye ſhall take no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the Life of a murtherer, which is guilty of Death, but he ſhall be ſurely put to Death.</hi> But <hi>Croſby</hi> did more then this, his Act had Contrivance, and Deliberation in it; He firſt <hi>Threatned,</hi> then <hi>fetch'd his Piſtol, cock't it,</hi> and <hi>preſented it</hi> againſt <hi>Towneſend, gave fire</hi> and <hi>kill'd him</hi>; and afterwards <hi>purſued another man.</hi> Certainly this is no more like unto <hi>Murther,</hi> than one Egg is like another; and to ſay that <hi>Croſbey had an intent to kill a man,</hi> is (without all doubt) as bad us to call a Spade, <hi>a Spade</hi>; or, a Bottle, <hi>a Bottle.</hi> What greater demonſtration can you have of the <hi>inward Intention</hi> of

any <hi>Murtherer</hi>? And yet would you <hi>reject</hi> a Verdict that found him <hi>guilty,</hi> and <hi>quit</hi> him upon an <hi>ignoramus? HEAR oh Heavens! and GIVE EAR oh Earth!</hi> and Conſider ye Juſtices of the Bench! Think not that God will be mock'd; Or, that Conſiderate Men will alwayes ſhut their Eyes: No, you do not dance in ſuch a Net, but many in City, and in Countrey do look upon you: This Story rings far and near; and is come very nigh unto the Ears of the King's Court.

               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere hath been preſented to the Houſe, a moſt faithful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act report of the conference we had with the Lords yeſterday, together with the opinion of the Committees that were imployed in that ſervice: That they conceived it ſit the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> ſhould be ſequeſtred. I muſt ſecond the motion, and with the favour of this Houſe, I ſhall be bold to offer my Reaſons, why I conceive it more neceſſary we ſhould proceed a little further than the deſire of a bare Sequeſtration onely.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, Long Introductions are not ſuitable to weighty bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; We are fallen upon the great man, the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>; Look upon him as he is in his Highneſs, and he is the Stye of all peſtilential filth, that hath infected the State, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, and Common-wealth: Look upon him in his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104844:5"/>
Dependancies, and he is the man, the onely man, that hath raiſed and advanced all thoſe, that (together with himſelf) have been the Authors and Cauſers of all the Ruines, Miſeries, and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities we now groan under. Who is it, but he onely that brought the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> to all his great places, and imployments, a fit Inſtrument, and Spirit to act, and execute all his wicked and bloody deſignes in theſe Kingdomes? Who is it, but he only that brought in Secretary <hi>Windebanke</hi> into the place of Secretary and Truſt; the very Broker and Pander to the Whore of <hi>Babylon?</hi> Who is it (Mr. Speaker) but he only, that hath advanced all Popiſh Biſhops? I ſhall name ſome of them, Biſhop <hi>Manwaring,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Wren</hi> (the leaſt of all) but the moſt unclean one. Theſe are men that ſhould feed Chriſt's Flock, but they are the Wolves that devoured them: The Sheep ſhould have fed upon the Mountains; but the Mountains have eat up the Sheep. It was the happineſs of our Church, when the zeal of God's Houſe did eat up the Biſhops; Glorious and brave Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs that went to the Stake in defence of the Proteſtant Religion: But the zeal of theſe Biſhops hath been to eat up, and perſecute the Church. Who is it (Mr. Speaker) but the great Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that hath ſat the Helme to guide and ſteer them all to the managing of their Projects, that have been ſet on foot in this Kingdom theſe ten years laſt paſt? And rather than he would ſtand out, he hath moſt unworthily truck'd and chaffer'd in the meaneſt of them; as for inſtance, that of Tobacco, wherein thouſands of poor people have been ſtript, and turned out of their Trades, for which they have ſerved as Aprentices: We all know he was the Compounder, and Contractor with them for the Licences, putting them to pay Fines, and Fee, and Farm Rents to uſe their Trades. Certainly (Mr. Speaker) he might have ſpent his time better (and more for his grace) in the Pulpit, than thus ſharking and raking in the Tobacco ſhop.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, We all know what he hath been charged withal here in this Houſe; Crimes of a dangerous conſequence, and of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent nature; No leſs than the ſubverſion of the Government of this Kingdom, and the alteration of the Proteſtant Religion; and this not upon bare information onely, but much of it comes before us already upon clear and manifeſt proofs: And there is ſcarce any buſineſs, grievances, or complaints, come before us in this place, wherein we do not find him intermingled, and as it were twiſted into it; like a buſie and angry Waſp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his ſting in the tail of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

thing. We have this day heard the report of the conference yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; and in it the accuſations which the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation have char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him withal; and we do all know he is guilty of the ſame, (if not more) in this Kingdom. —Mr. Speaker, He hath been and is, the common enemy of all goodneſs, and good men; and it is not ſafe that ſuch a Viper ſhould be near his Majeſties perſon, to diſtil his poyſon into his ſacred Ears; nor is it ſafe for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, that he ſhould ſit in ſo eminent a place of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being thus accuſed. We know what we did in the Earl of <hi>Strafford's</hi> Caſe.</p>
            <p>This man is the corrupt Fountain, that hath infected all the Streams; and till the Fountain be purged, we cannot expect to have any clear Channels. I ſhall be bold therefore to offer my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and if I erre, it is the error of my Judgement, and not my want of zeal and affection to the publick good. I conceive it moſt neceſſary and fit, that we ſhould now take up a reſolution, to do ſomewhat, to ſtrike whilſt the Iron is hot, and go up to the Lords, in the Name of the Commons of this Houſe, and in the Name of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> and to accuſe him of High Treaſon; and to deſire their Lordſhips his perſon may be ſequeſtred, and that in convenient time they may bring up the charge.</p>
