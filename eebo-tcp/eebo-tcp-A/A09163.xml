         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulnes &amp; frutefulnes of Cities inhabited, becauſe when man and wife had edified for them ſelues a dwelling houſe and repleniſhed the ſame with encreaſe of children and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, they were dryuen to make other houſes, becauſe one houſe coulde not holde one lynage or ofſpringe: and ſo they began to erect villages in the countrie and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhe ſocietie by meanes of many houſes.</p>
            <p>And when they did playnly ſee what commoditie was in the ſocietie of man and woman: and howe more eaſlye and better verye manye liued together, then a fewe: yea more ſafer from the inuaſion of wilde beaſtes: they began to ioyne Lordſhippe to Lordſhippe, and laye Familye to<note place="margin">The firſt reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Societie inſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuted.</note> Familye, and alſo to ioyne in neighbourhoode for their owne common vtilitie.

            <p>Certainlye wee haue a common voyce, aſwell as other lyuinge creatures haue, whiche doth eyther ſpeciallye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate and ſhewe forth ioye or ſadnes, eyther els ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes deſire, and ſometimes feare, whiche is in vs. But for to know and diſcerne thinges by their proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes by plaine and perfecte ſpeache, to finiſhe or conclude aſwell our cogitations as our effectes and meaninges, that for certaine could not be but inuented by ciuill ſociety<note place="margin">Studies of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines.</note> of men.

<pb facs="tcp:14585:10"/>
and of them whiche after the manner of ſauage beaſtes led their lyues in the wooddes: but by the ciuil man, whiche was conuerſant in companye of men whiche hearde many thinges, which diſcuſſed many thinges, and by whom they were inuented and firſt had in vſe. For in ſuch Citties as were well inſtructed and ordered: there were Rewardes beſtowed on them which excelled in any manner of vertue and ſuch as were alſo therby preferred to high promocion and adorned or made famous, with praiſe and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their excellence. For honour as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayth, doth foſter and mainteyne Artes and ſciences, and we all<note place="margin">Honos alit artes.</note> are inflamed to endeuour our ſelues for prefermente and prerogatiue by praiſe and commendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our trauailes. Finally what excellent exploite ſo euer mortall men haue by their ſtudie and diligence in this life put in vre, it either had firſte iſſue and originall practize from the Citties, or elles tooke the vfe and grace thereof, in the ſame cytties.</p>
            <p>Man which is brought vp or trayned in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſociety, differeth verye muche from him that lyueth in a rude cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, eyther elles in a hilly wilderneſſe, or wood: for this<note place="margin">Difference of Societie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</note> man ſeemeth to be borne as it were vnto crueltie, amonge wilde and brute beaſtes, but the other ſeemeth to be borne amongeſt men vnto Iuſtice and humanitie. For it is true that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <q>He is a beaſt and not a man whiche forſaketh ciuill ſocietie: and he that refuſeth to be any parte or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a cittie, he muſt needes be a wicked and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye perſon.</q>
            <p>For he ſhunneth the companie of men becauſe he would not be compelled to obaye the lawes and Iudgement, and to obaye him that is a rightfull Ruler: then the whyche thinge ſurelye there can bee nothinge more pernicious or hurtfull. For of all good ciuill order the chiefe thinge is Iuſtice, whiche no doubt layeth the foundacion and grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d worke of humane ſocietie and withoute the whiche there
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14585:10"/>
can bee no ciuill congregation. For as the ſaide Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſayth, as man is the beſt liuing creature of all others whiche liueth perfectlye. ſo is he worſte and naughtieſt of all liuinge creatures, which is ſequeſtred from the lawe and iudgementes.</p>
            <p>The Lawes of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> (as <hi>Xenophon</hi> writeth) doe eſpecially ordayne thobedience due to Iuſtice, and in ſuch<note place="margin">Obedience vn to Iuſtice.</note> manner euen from their Childehoode, (as we haue ſaide) the Cittizens did learne to deſire nothinge that was fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye or vnlawful for man to do, whiche perſwaſion ſurely me thincketh is the beſt of all others. And if it might by any meanes be brought to paſſe, that all men mighte lyue inſtructed in this doctrine, wee ſhould be exonerated and diſcharged of a great parte of our labour otherwiſe. For if euerye man woulde preſcribe what were nedefull to bee done, and beinge ſo lincked and ioyned together were not affected or moued wythe couetouſnes, nor other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations of the mynde: they ſhoulde doe rightewell.

It maye bee brought to paſſe by fortune that ſuch a Cittye which is ſo gouerned, may ſtand in ſafetye and quietnes for a certayn tyme, but fortune frowning on them, it is ſone perceiued, how hard a matter it will be to lyue well amongeſt ſuche manner of men.
