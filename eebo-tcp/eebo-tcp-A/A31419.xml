            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>My Lord,</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> is uſually aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by two ſorts of Adverſaries. The one declar'd Enemies to the Epiſcopal Government, or if at any time in a good humour they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the name, they deny the thing making the Biſhop of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times no more in effect than a meer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Prieſt. The other are great pretenders to Antiquity, and ſtrongly enough aſſert the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal Order, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all would obtrude upon
<pb facs="tcp:64253:4"/>
us a Supreme and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Biſhop, to whom all others are to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and accountable, and he we may be ſure is the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> As for the firſt of theſe, I have not directly enter'd the Liſts with them, though what is here ſaid concerning the Ancient Church-Government might be enough to ſatisfie Men modeſt and unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd; and more I did not think fit to add. They have been ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten baffled upon that
<pb facs="tcp:64253:4"/>
Argument, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a reſolv'd obſtinacy could make them keep a poſt, ſo utterly indefenſable. But the Men of that way ſeem generally too over-weaning and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniative, and I have no hopes of doing good upon that Man, that's <hi>wiſer in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, than ſeven Men that can render a Reaſon.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the nature of my deſign led me more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whoſe cauſe (ſo far
<pb facs="tcp:64253:5"/>
as it relates to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject under debate) I have examin'd, and brought to be tried by the Standard of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, the trueſt Rule to proceed by in this matter; and this mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged without any need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Exaſperations. For I never could think it a reaſonable method of Conviction to rail at Popery, or to load the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> with ill Names, and ſpiteful Characters. The beſt way ſure in ſuch caſes is to appeal to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:64253:5"/>
of the Ancients, and to enquire what power and authority was allow'd him in the wiſer and better Ages of Chriſtianity. Which I hope I have done with all truth and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the following Diſcourſe.</p>

But we that are the Clergy of Your Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, think our ſelves oblig'd to take all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of letting the World know, how much we rejoyce under the happy Influences of Your Care and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; how much we are beholden to that great Example of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Induſtry and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, you daily ſet

            <p>A noble and divine temper of Mind, which our Lord has effectually recommended both by his Doctrine, and the example of his Life. He has taught us, that we ſhould not,

For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly among all the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and innovations of that Church, nothing is more pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable and notorious, than an intolerable uſurpation over the Rights of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; nothing more wild and extravagant, than the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging a Supremacy over the Chriſtian Church, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> expreſly contrary not only to the Scripture, the great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of our Faith, but to the Laws of all ancient Councils,
<pb facs="tcp:64253:12"/>
and the practice of the Church; which however it allow'd a primary honour and reſpect to the <hi>Roman</hi> Prelate, yet ſtill ſet him out, as it did to all other Biſhops, the particular extent of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.</p>
            <p>This is that which I have endeavoured to evince in the following Diſcourſe, wherein I have trac'd the Papal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to thoſe proper bounds and limits, within which it was confin'd of old. And upon that occaſion have brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly ſurvey'd the frame and conſtitution of the ancient Church, and that Policy and
<pb facs="tcp:64253:13"/>
Government, whereby it was manag'd in its purer and better times.</p>
            <p>That which gave birth to the whole Diſcourſe, was this: I had elſewhere in relating the Acts of the ſecond gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral<note place="margin">Life of S. Greg. Naz. Sect. v. Num. ix.</note> Council, repreſented the third Canon of that Council, which decreed, that <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, upon the account of its being New Rome,</hi> or the Imperial City, <hi>ſhould have the priviledge of honour next to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome.</hi> A Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non which they of <hi>Rome</hi> could never pardon, as which
<pb facs="tcp:64253:13"/>
limits the power of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Prelate, and declares the foundation upon which it ſtands. For the illuſtration of this Canon, I intended im that place to have added a digreſſion concerning the ancient Power and Precedence of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome;</hi> but upon ſecond thoughts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd it to an <hi>Appendix</hi> at the end of the Book. But that Book ſwelling into too great a bulk, and this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe being grown beyond the proportion that was at firſt deſign'd, I was over-perſwaded by ſome Friends to venture it abroad alone. A thing which
<pb facs="tcp:64253:14"/>
had I intended from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it had come forth, at leaſt in ſome parts, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than it is, and with ſome advantages which now it is forc'd to go without.</p>
            <p>I have wholly wav'd all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates concerning the <hi>Jus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum</hi> of Epiſcopacy, and the Controverſies that depend upon it, (enough has been ſaid upon that Argument) and have chiefly inſiſted upon thoſe branches of the Eccleſiaſtic Government, which have been leſs canvaſſed amongſt us.</p>
            <p>For the ſame reaſon I have more lightly touch'd upon the Pope's Univerſal Supremacy,
<pb facs="tcp:64253:14"/>
'twas his <hi>Metropolitical and Patriarchal</hi> Power I principally deſign'd to enquire into. I know Volumes have been written <hi>De primatu Papae, de Eccleſiis Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbicariis, &amp;c.</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have reduc'd what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns thoſe matters into as narrow a compaſs as I could, and have ſaid no more than what is neceſſary to clear the Argument, and expreſs my own ſenſe about it.</p>
            <p>If what is here ſaid ſhall adminiſter any light to this part of Church-antiquity, I ſhall be very glad; if not, I am content it ſhould follow
<pb facs="tcp:64253:15"/>
the fate of many much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Books to be thrown aſide. 'Twas never deſign'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Learned, but only to form a ſhort Scheme of the true ſtate of things, for the benefit of thoſe, who have not been much converſant in the Antiquities of the Church; at leaſt to give ſome aid and direction to the younger ſort, who firſt apply themſelves to the ſtudy of thoſe ancient Times. And if it may but attain this end, I ſhall think my Time and Pains have been well beſtow'd.</p>

                  <p>An Equality among the Apoſtles as Church Governours appointed by Chriſt. <hi>Peter's</hi> pretended Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy over the reſt ſhewed to be vain and groundleſs.

The foundation of that Church by two great Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul. Rome</hi> the Seat of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The honour and advantages of that Church thereby. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith long time preſerv'd entire in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Its large Revenues affording libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hoſpitality. Its ſending forth Emiſſaries to plant Chriſtianity in other Countries, and thereby claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuperiority over them. The pride of that Church ſeverely cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd by S. <hi>Baſil.</hi> A general Scheme of the ſubordination in the Government of the Primitive Church, by Biſhops, Archbiſhops, and Patriarchs, and the Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty herein to the Civil State.

                     <hi>CHAP. II. The Government of the Church, and Power of the Biſhops of</hi> Rome, <hi>as 'tis repreſented in the Canons of the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſixth Canon of the Synod of <hi>Nice</hi> ſet down, with the occaſion of it.
<pb facs="tcp:64253:17"/>
Seven Obſervations drawn from that Canon. <hi>I.</hi> That the larger bounds of Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction were the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces. A. Province, what. Whether the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in <hi>Italy</hi> ſo called. <hi>II.</hi> That the chief Church-Governour in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Province was the <hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi> The prudence and convenience of that way of Government. Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs prov'd not to be intended in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon. <hi>III.</hi> That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> no leſs than the reſt had his proper and limited Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitical power. This own'd by ſome of the greateſt Champions of <hi>Rome. IV.</hi> That the Metropolitick Sees of <hi>Rome, Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> were ever of the greateſt note in the Chriſtian Church, and of theſe <hi>Rome</hi> the chief. The eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Sees according to the greatneſs of the Cities wherein they were planted. This gave precedency to
<pb facs="tcp:64253:17"/>
the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The three Sees of <hi>Rome, Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> aſcribed to S. <hi>Peter.</hi> Blaſphemous things ſpoken of the Pope upon that account. Primacy allow'd to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> No Supremacy belonging to it. The Chriſtian Church then knew of no ſuch ſupereininent Power. <hi>V.</hi> That the Rights of the <hi>Roman</hi> Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan were not due by any Divine Conſtitution, but by cuſtom and the practice of the Church. This plainly ſhew'd to be the ſence of this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther following Councils. <hi>VI.</hi> That the Ordination of Provincial Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops was one of the prime Rights and Priviledges of every Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan within his own Juriſdiction. The fourth, ſixth, and ſeventh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of this Council noted to that purpoſe. The ſame ſhew'd to be the determination of other Synods. What other Rights belong'd to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans.
<pb facs="tcp:64253:18"/>
                     <hi>VII.</hi> That this way of Eccleſiaſtick Adminiſtration was not any late novel Inſtitution, but founded upon ancient cuſtom and practice. What this Antiquity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. The original of Metropolitans briefly enquir'd into. Several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this way of Government noted in the ſecond and third Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The word Metropolitan not met with 'till the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> But the thing long before. The ſum of the Obſervations upon this Canon. <hi>Page 46</hi>

Patriarchal, Apoſtolical. The firſt not controverted; the laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd as extravagant and groundleſs, and as frequently baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, both by the <hi>Reformed,</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Church. <hi>L. Allatius's</hi> jeer of his Country-men. His Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Juriſdiction conſidered, as concurrent with that of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt of Rome.</hi> That how great, and how far extending. The <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbicary Regions,</hi> what. <hi>Sicily</hi> no part of the <hi>Urbicary</hi> Regions. The uſual conformity between the extent of the Civil and Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction in thoſe times. The power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Metropolitan confin'd within an hundred Miles of <hi>Rome. Rufinus</hi> his Expoſition of the <hi>Suburbicary Churches.</hi> Greatly quarrell'd at by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Writers. His authority in other caſes allow'd ſufficient and unqueſtionable. His Book approv'd
<pb facs="tcp:64253:19"/>
by Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> and others. No probability of his being miſtaken in the ſence of the Canon, or the extent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Metropolitanſhip, or the <hi>Suburbicary</hi> Churches. His Explication confirm'd by moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Interpreters of this Canon. The Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> diſtinct. The Biſhop of <hi>Milan</hi> rank'd with him of <hi>Rome.</hi> The objection of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome's</hi> being confin'd to ſo narrow a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, conſider'd and anſwer'd. The <hi>Majores Dioeceſes</hi> in the Epiſtle of the Synod of <hi>Arles,</hi> what.

                  </p>
                  <p>An Enquiry into the Riſe and Original of Patriarchs in general. None before the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> What that Council contributed to them. Civil <hi>Dioceſes,</hi> when, and by whom introduc'd. Theſe gave ſtart to Primary Metropolitans. Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when firſt brought into the Church.

The Patriarchate of <hi>Antioch</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to the <hi>Eaſtern Dioceſs.</hi> The conteſt about <hi>Cyprus,</hi> how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd. <hi>Paleſtine</hi> for ſome time under <hi>Antioch.</hi> The Patriarch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> By what degrees it aroſe.

The Biſhops of it hence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards exerciſing a kind of Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal power over the Churches of the neighbouring Provinces. The Power granted to that See by the Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> Its ninth, ſeventeenth, and eight and twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Canons conſidered to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

The famous caſe of <hi>Appeals</hi> in the Church of <hi>Africk.</hi> A clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that matter. Their publick rejecting the power which the Pope challeng'd over thoſe Churches. The Letters of the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> to Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> and <hi>Caeleſtine</hi> to that purpoſe. Several uſeful and proper Corollaries deduc'd from this ſtory, for the evincing the vain pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Papal Power over thoſe Churches.

being generally taken for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that S. <hi>Peter was</hi> in a proper ſence Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which yet I believe can never be made good.

                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:64253:29"/>
Once more, let it be ſuppos'd that this Supremacy was entail'd not only upon S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Succeſſors, how comes it to paſs that it was not lodg'd in the See of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where they grant S. <hi>Peter</hi> reſided as Biſhop ſeveral years before he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and which therefore in all reaſon ought to challenge a Primary title?

to the great diſturbance and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement of the Chriſtian World, for which he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely rebuked by the wiſe and good men of that time, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the mild and peaceable <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus.</hi> It was not much above half an Age after this, when the practice of Baptizing a new thoſe who had been Baptized by Hereticks begun mightily to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in ſome parts of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> but eſpecially in the <hi>African</hi> Churches. <hi>Stephen,</hi> who was then Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſtorm'd hereat, and in a great rage publickly declared, that he would hold no Communion with them; and when, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtome whereby Churches mutually acted in thoſe days, they ſent ſome Biſhops to give him an account of their opinion and practice, he proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p n="4">IV.

Which could not but reflect a more than ordinary luſtre upon thoſe Biſhops that ſat at the upper end of the world, and make them appear conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably bigger, more conſpicuous and uſeful than the reſt of their Brethren, and by reaſon of the general confluence of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to <hi>Rome,</hi> enable them in a

little time to draw the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of Eccleſiaſtick Cauſes from all parts thither. 'Twas this conveniency of Situation gave them opportunity to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelves into the favour of the Emperors, and by their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to enlarge their own Borders, yea, and to ſuccour and relieve their Clients and Dependants, which made many to court their protection and aſſiſtance, though often with the loſs of their own freedom and liberty. This was eſpecially done after the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours became Chriſtians, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church being by them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd with vaſt honours and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, accounting that the greatneſs of that Church would not a little contribute to the ſplendour and magnificence of the Empire.

to another place, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the Emperours a long time retain'd their affection for <hi>Rome,</hi> what the Pope loſt in one ſence, he gain'd in another, making uſe of the Emperours abſence to enhance his own Power and Revenue, 'till he was able not only to Lord it over his brethren, but over Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Church continued for ſeveral Ages the Seat of true Apoſtolick Doctrine, maintaining that character that S <hi>Paul</hi> had given them, that <hi>their Faith was ſpoken of throughout the whole world,</hi> it being here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd pure and uncorrupt, while a great part of the Chriſtian world beſides was over run with Error and Hereſie, and torn in pieces by Schiſms and Factions.

(while it remain'd ſound and Orthodox) in a manner the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of Catholick Communion, moſt other Churches veering in point of Communion, as they found the Wind blow from that Quarter, and ſaw how the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs far'd at <hi>Rome.</hi> Accordingly <hi>Theodoſius</hi> in the beginning of his Reign reſolving to reform the Doctrine of the Church, then miſerably degenerated in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> parts, commanded, <note n="*" place="margin">De fid.

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by the advantage of the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al City was capable of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the Chriſtian Doctrine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral parts of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> to ſend out Diſciples, receive Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatches, tranſmit Directions, and ſupply all Emergencies that might ariſe.

And Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> tells <note n="*" place="margin">Innoc. Epiſt. I. ibid. col. 1245.</note> 
                  <hi>Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Eugubium,</hi> that all the Churches in thoſe parts ought to take their meaſures from <hi>Rome,</hi> and nothing to be valid, but what's received from thence; it being evident, that no Churches had been planted in <hi>Italy, France, Spain, Africk, Sicily,</hi> and the interjacent Iſlands by any, but ſuch as had been Ordain'd by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or his Succeſſors.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64253:38"/>
as perhaps we may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſhew afterwards. In ſhort, though it became Churches thus planted, to bear a very grateful reſpect to that Mother Church, that was the inſtrument to convey to them the Chriſtian faith; yet did it lay them under no obligation to ſubjection and ſervitude: however the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has handled the matter to its own advantage, and from the lenity and tenderneſs of a Parent, had degenerated into the pride and cruelty of a Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother; and not content to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe authority over its own Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, began to advance its ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners over all the reſt; proudly proclaiming it ſelf the Mother and Miſtres of all Churches.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64253:38"/>
this put the old <hi>Romans</hi> upon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing the world; and by this the Emperors tyrannized over it for ſome ages, and when <hi>Rome</hi> ſhifted its Lords, it did not change its Task-maſters; the ambition which the Emperors laid down, the Popes took up, and proſecuted it by far worſe arts and methods, than ever the <hi>Romans</hi> did of old.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64253:39"/>
as near as might be to the Mode that obtain'd in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil State. Now the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire conſiſted of thirteen <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes,</hi> (for ſo they began to ſtyle thoſe large Diviſions about the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi>) whereof ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> parts, <hi>Egypt,</hi> the <hi>Orient,</hi> or <hi>Eaſt</hi> properly ſo call'd, <hi>Aſiana, Pontica, Thrace, Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Dacia;</hi> and ſix in the <hi>Weſt, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Afric, Illyricum, France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Britain;</hi> beſides the <hi>Roman</hi> Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecture, extending to the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces round about the City, which had anciently been a peculiar government, equal, yea ſuperior in dignity to any Dioceſs; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hereafter. In each of theſe <hi>Dioceſſes</hi> were ſeveral Provinces, (118 in all) the chief City whereof in every Province, was the Metropolis, that had a kind of juriſdiction over all the reſt;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64253:40"/>
both title and dignity being pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly ſettled by imperial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Now the civil and Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction, were concurrent after this manner; in every City there was a civil Judge, who preſided over it, and the Towns about it; and to him anſwered the Biſhop of that City: in every Province a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul</hi> or Preſident reſided at the Metropolis, govern'd that whole diviſion, received appeals, and determined all important caſes brought before him from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Cities. Correſpondent to him was the Metropolitan, or (as they after call'd him) the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, whoſe See was in the ſame City, who ſuperintended the ſeveral Churches, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the ſeveral Biſhops with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Province. And then in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Dioceſs, there was a <hi>Vicarius</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:64253:40"/>
or Lieutenant, who kept his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the principal City, thence diſpatcht the Imperial Edicts, and there heard and decided thoſe cauſes, that were not finally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by inferiour Courts. And concurrent with him in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical matters was the Primate, or (as ſome of them were more eminently ſtiled) the Patriarch, who preſided over the ſeveral Metropolitans within that Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, appointed the conventions of his Clergy, Umpir'd the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that aroſe between the ſeveral Biſhops, and gave the laſt determination to all Appeals brought before him. And thus by an orderly Subordination of Deacons and Presbyters to their Biſhops, of Biſhops to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Metropolitans, of Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans to their reſpective Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates or Patriarchs, and by a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64253:41"/>
mutual correſpondence between the ſeveral Primates of every Dioceſs, the affairs of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church were carried on with great <hi>decorum</hi> and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. THIS excellent Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form was not fram'd and ſet up all at once. In the more early Ages Chriſtianity being general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firſt Preacht and planted in the greater Cities, and the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Government ſettled there, thence ſpread it ſelf into the neighbouring Country, and perſons were thence diſpatcht to Preach and attend the Miniſteries of Religion in thoſe rural Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, who yet were in all things ſteer'd and directed by the Biſhop and his Eccleſiaſtick Senate reſiding in the City. As Churches multiplied, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity extended it ſelf into wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64253:41"/>
circles, it was found neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to fix a particular Biſhop al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every City, to whom was committed the care and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency over all the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and people there, and in all the Towns and Villages belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the juriſdiction of that place. But becauſe controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies began to ariſe between the ſeveral Biſhops (and ſometimes between them and the inferiour Clergy) which could not eaſily be determin'd, where every ones authority was independant, it was neceſſary that ſome one ſhould preſide over all the other Biſhops of that Province, as the <hi>Proconſul</hi> did in the civil ſtate, who might convene Synodical Aſſemblies, adjuſt the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and manage the Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Provincial Biſhops. And for this none could be ſo fit

the affairs of his own <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as they tell us, according to a moſt ancient Rule and Canon, that had been in force from the times of their fore-fathers. To the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan then upon every extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary occaſion the Provincial Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops addreſſed themſelves, to him alſo other Metropolitans, ſuch eſpecially as lay neareſt to him, were wont to ſend Letters of Communion, to teſtify their conſent with him in the faith (a confeſſion whereof every new

               <p n="7">VII. THIS 'tis plain from the Writings of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and others, was the way of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration during thoſe firſt and moſt early Ages of Chriſtianity: Private cauſes every Biſhop judg'd of within his particular juriſdiction, where taking to him the aſſiſtance of his Clergy, his Presbyters and Deacons, they did <hi>Communi Conſilio ponderare,</hi>

Here the Ordination
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64253:43"/>
of Biſhops was uſually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, or where a Synod could not conveniently be had, by as many Biſhops as could be got together, the reſt <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. Cone. Nic.

Here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo criminal Biſhops were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, and the ſame way of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſuffrage obſerv'd: Thus when <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Synod at <hi>Rome</hi>

               <p n="8">VIII. IN reference to the affairs of Churches abroad, they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64253:44"/>
acted by a kind of mutual conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, they communicated coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, interpos'd in differences, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the ſame common enemies, and upon all occaſions afforded ready help and aſſiſtance to one another, that <hi>dilectio communis,</hi> that <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſo often ſpeaks of, <note n="*" place="margin">

For they look'd upon themſelves, he tells us, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> xxx. <hi>p.</hi> 42.</note> as members of the ſame Body of the Church, though ſtretcht out into many ſeveral Provinces, and that therefore they were bound to have care one of another, and to watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the welfare of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Upon a Perſons Election to any of the greater Sees, they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64253:44"/>
were wont to ſend their congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory Letters, to give him joy of that place, to ſignify their concurrence with his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a ſhare of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, and their communion with him in the Faith. Thus <hi>Cyprian</hi> by Letters <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> XLii. <hi>p.</hi> 56.</note> approv'd <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Election to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he did, he tells us according to divine tradition and Eccleſiaſtick inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; nay he ſent to all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of his Province, requiring them by their Letters to do the like. And when <hi>Marcian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles</hi> was depos'd for his ſiding with <hi>Novatian, Cyprian</hi> wrote <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> LXVii. <hi>infin.</hi>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64253:45"/>
on Church, he could not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Communion in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus when <hi>Feliciſſimus,</hi> who had been Excommunicated by <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Synod, fled to <hi>Rome,</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Sixt Canon of the Synod of <hi>Nice</hi> ſet down, with the occaſion of it. Seven Obſervations drawn from that Canon. <hi>I.</hi> That the larger bounds of Eccleſiaſtick ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction were the <hi>Roman</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. A Province what. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Countries in <hi>Italy</hi> ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. <hi>II.</hi> That the chief Church-Governour in every Province was the <hi>Metropolitan.</hi> The pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and convenience of that way
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64253:47"/>
of Government. Patriarchs prov'd not to be intended in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon. <hi>III.</hi> That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> no leſs than the reſt had his proper and limited Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical power. This own'd by ſome of the greateſt Champions of <hi>Rome. IV.</hi> That the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politick Sees of <hi>Rome, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> were ever of the greateſt note in the Chriſtian Church, and of theſe <hi>Rome</hi> the chief. The eminency of Sees ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greatneſs of the Cities wherein they were planted. This gave precedency to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The three Sees of <hi>Rome, Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> aſcrib'd to S. <hi>Peter.</hi> Blaſphemous things ſpoken of the Pope upon that account. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy allow'd to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> No Supremacy belonging to it. The Chriſtian Church then knew
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64253:48"/>
of no ſuch ſupereminent power. <hi>V.</hi> That the rights of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Metropolitan were not due by any divine conſtitution, but by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and the practice of the Church. This plainly ſhew'd to be the ſence of this, and other following Councils. <hi>VI.</hi> That the Ordination of Provincial Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops was one of the prime rights and priviledges of every Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan within his own juriſdiction. The fourth, ſixth and ſeventh Canons of this Council noted to that purpoſe. The ſame ſhew'd to be the determination of other Synods. What other rights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to Metropolitans. <hi>VII.</hi> That this way of Eccleſiaſtick Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration was not any late novel inſtitution, but founded upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtome and practice. What this antiquity implies. The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Metropolitans briefly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd

               <p>IN this <hi>condition</hi> ſtood things at that time when the great Council Aſſembled at <hi>Nice, An.

This alſo is altogether evident, that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64253:49"/>
if any man be made a Biſhop without the conſent of the Metropolitan, this great Synod Decrees ſuch a one to be no Biſhop.

               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That the rights of the <hi>Roman</hi> Metropolitan were not due by any Divine conſtitution, but flow'd only from Cuſtome and the Practice of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That the Ordination of Provincial Biſhops was one of the prime Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of every Metropolitan within his own Juriſdiction.</p>

And this <hi>Salmaſius</hi>

to judg of the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that aroſe between them, to ordain perſons to vacant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks, or at leaſt to ratify their Ordination, and to direct all tranſactions that were of greater and more general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.

By the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Canon</hi> here ſpoken of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant this of <hi>Nice,</hi> which was but ſixteen years before it,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64253:53"/>
and therefore without doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs to the XXXIV. <hi>Canon of the Apoſtles,</hi> which almoſt in the ſame words commands the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in every Nation to own him who is firſt or chief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and to eſteem him as Head, and to do nothing of moment without his conſent, which truly expreſſes the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent practice of the Church; theſe <hi>Apoſtolick Canons</hi> being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a collection of Rules and Cuſtomes agreed upon in the firſt ages of Chriſtianity. For (that I may note this by the way) 'tis vain to think, that a thing then firſt began to be, when we find it firſt mention'd or enjoyn'd by a Synodal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; the Canons in ſuch caſes being very oft expreſſive of a more ancient practice, which they then take notice of, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64253:54"/>
only becauſe ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary accidents at that time may have given particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it. As here at <hi>Nice,</hi> in the caſe of the Rights of Metropolitans, which the Canon mentions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettles, only becauſe <hi>Meletius</hi>'s uſurpation had brought it into queſtion. It had been long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an ancient cuſtome, and having lately received ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhock, the Church no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had an opportunity of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, but it eſtabliſht theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitical priviledges by its Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenical Authority. There are, I know, and they too men of no mean name and note, both heretofore and of later times, who tell us, that this <hi>Nicene</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non is to be underſtood not of <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> but <hi>Patriarchs:</hi> But
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64253:54"/>
where does the Council ſay, or ſo much as hint any ſuch thing, the Synod both here and in all other places conſtantly calls them Metropolitans, and makes the bounds of their juriſdiction to be Provinces, not <hi>Dioceſſes.</hi> And indeed the word <hi>Dioceſe,</hi> as relating to this extent of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick Government, was not in uſe till above an intire age af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Nay perhaps at this time it was ſcarce in uſe for the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger diviſion of Countries in the civil ſtate: For it was but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> new modell'd the Government, and brought in <hi>Dioceſes</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending ſeveral Provinces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them.</p>
               <p>So that either here muſt be Patriarchs without Dioceſes, or if the Canon be meant (as ſome explain it) of <hi>Metropolitani Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politanorum,</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:64253:55"/>
of ſome prime and principal Metropolitans, that preſided over the Metropolitans of the ſeveral Provinces within their juriſdiction, then 'tis plain the Synod muſt intend ſuch whereever it mentions Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans, for it all along ſpeaks of them as of the ſame. In the fourth Canon it provides, that in every Province a Biſhop Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd ſhall be confirm'd by the Metropolitan; which is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be reſtrain'd to proper provincial Metropolitans. In this ſixth Canon it ſpeaks more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and becauſe the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitick rights had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Ordains that the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> no leſs than he of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and the Churches in all other Provinces ſhould ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their ancient priviledges.

Where we ſee it ſpeaks of them all without any difference in this reſpect as provincial Churches. And thus the ancient Verſion of this Canon (whereof more hereafter) underſtood it, when it rendred it thus, <hi>in caeteris pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciis privilegia propria reſerven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Metropolitanis Eccleſiis,</hi> that at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and in the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, the Metropolitan Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſhould have their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</p>
               <p>And to put the caſe out of doubt what the Council meant, the Canon adds in the cloſe, that no Biſhop ſhould be made without the conſent of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan. Nothing therefore can be more abſurd, than to ſay, that Patriarchs are meant in the former part of the Canon, and Metropolitans only in the latter, when as the Canon it ſelf makes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64253:56"/>
no difference. And indeed were that the meaning, the grave and wiſe Fathers of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil took an effectual courſe that poſterity ſhould never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their mind. If we look into the following Canon, that ſecures the rights of the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan Church of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and though it grants the next place of honour to the Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet ſtill it ſubjects him to his own Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan. And I ſuppoſe it will puzzle any man to give a wiſe reaſon, why the Church of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> (for which the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World ever had ſo great and ſo juſt a veneration) ſhould be ſubject to that of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> but only that <hi>Caeſarea</hi> was the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis of that Province, and ſo had been ever ſince the time of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and accordingly

               <p>What Power ſoever our Lord or his Apoſtles convey'd to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, this is certain, that all

In which capacity he is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more honourable than all other Biſhops and Patriarchs, but has full authority over them, to conſecrate, confirm, or depoſe them, yea when he pleaſes, to ſuppreſs old, and to erect new Epiſcopal Sees.

of theſe, as he is a private Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, we have no controverſie with him: And for the laſt, his Supreme and Apoſtolical power over the whole Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church; 'tis ſo wild and extravagant a claim, ſo ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and precarious, ſo utter a ſtranger to Scripture and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Antiquity, that it's need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to take pains in the refuting of it. Nay, the Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves how deſirous ſoever to amplify their own Power, have not yet dar'd to challenge it where they knew it would be diſputed or denied.

and that (as he urges a little before) when the whole World had paſt Sentence upon him. The proper anſwer to which (had <hi>Liberius</hi> known of any ſuch power) had been this.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64253:82"/>
founded upon long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and ſettled by ſeveral Laws and Canons of the Church, inſomuch that if a change or alteration had been, or ſhould hereafter be made by imperial authority in any City, that then the Order of Epiſcopal Sees ſhould follow the civil and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical forms, as is expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by two general Councils, the one of <hi>Chalcedon</hi>

               <p>Accordingly we find that when great diſturbances were made in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and Schiſmaticks, <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> writes <note n="*" place="margin">L. 62.

               <p>The Synod of <hi>Nice</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden by all with a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and veneration, and its Decrees receiv'd as Oracles from Heaven, and the Chriſtian World finding what particular

Hence the following Popes, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Leo</hi> the Firſt, do upon all occaſions magnifie the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons, and amplify their meaning beyond what was at firſt intended by them. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> The late diviſion of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the alteration of it from that form, whereinto it had been caſt, firſt by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and afterwards by the Emperour <hi>Hadrian,</hi> new modell'd by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> much about the time of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, gave a ſingular advantage and opportunity to promote and further this deſign.</p>

He likewiſe depos'd <hi>Gerontius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> which lay in the Dioceſs of <hi>Pontica,</hi> and ſome others, and fill'd up their Sees; whereof we have elſewhere given an account at large.

kept for ſome years, and all affairs of the Church tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there; where S. <hi>James the Brother of our Lord</hi> was made (and that ſay ſome of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients by our Lords own hands) the firſt Chriſtian Biſhop of that See; the place where the firſt Church was planted, and from whence Chriſtianity was propagated into all other parts of the World.

reſolv'd to throw off the yoke, and to get what power they could into their own hands.</p>
               <p>The firſt that graſpt at the Metrpolitick Rights was S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,</hi> who diſputed the caſe with <hi>Acacius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> for which <hi>Acacius</hi> depos'd him, and perſecuted him both in the Synod at <hi>Seleucia,</hi> and in that which followed at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> about the latter end of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his Reign. What imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately followed in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, is uncertain, the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Church being ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in that matter.

After this a high conteſt aroſe between him and <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who challeng'd <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> as within his Dioceſs.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>Zoſimus</hi> was guilty of a notorious forgery and impoſture in falſifying the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons, pretending a Canon of <hi>Sardica</hi> to be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of <hi>Nice,</hi> and as ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to impoſe it, and his own power by it upon the <hi>African</hi> Churches.

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64253:142"/>
lookt into. Was not the Pope, think we, able to diſtinguiſh between <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Sardica,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an Oecumenical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and a Synod only of <hi>Weſtern</hi> Biſhops, call'd in another Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Reign above Twenty years after. No, no, it was not a ſin of ignorance, but the Pope knew well enough which Council would beſt ſerve his turn, that the World had a juſt and a mighty veneration for that of <hi>Nice,</hi> and that his deſign would be eaſily ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, if he could gild it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with the reputation and authority of that Synod. It was obvious to except againſt <hi>Sardica,</hi> that it was but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Council, and that the Canon it made for Appeals to <hi>Rome</hi> was only a Proviſionary Decree, when the injur'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64253:143"/>
was not like to meet with Juſtice at home, but the whole Maſs of Biſhops was corrupted, and ſet againſt him, as was the caſe of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and two or three more in reſpect of the <hi>Arians,</hi> who were the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and for whoſe ſakes that Canon was made. But that of <hi>Nice</hi> was univerſal, and unexceptionable, and which he hoped would paſs without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul. But the <hi>African</hi> Biſhops according to the humour of that Nation were of too honeſt and blunt a temper to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jol'd by the arts of <hi>Rome.</hi> They requir'd to have the matter brought to the teſt, and to be Judg'd by the Original Canons, and ſo the fraud was diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and brought to light in the eye of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:64253:143"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Church of <hi>Africk,</hi> and accordingly eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry National Church, has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerent power of determining all cauſes that ariſe within it ſelf: That this Right is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both upon moſt evident reaſon, (nothing being fitter than that controverſies ſhould be ended in the places where they began, where there are all advantages of bringing matters to a more ſpeedy and equal trial) and upon the wiſdom and juſtice of the Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which would not let his aſſiſtance be wanting in one place more than another, and eſpecially there where doing right to truth did more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately make it neceſſary; and that 'twas as probable two or three hundred ſhould ſift out truth as a ſingle perſon.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64253:144"/>
That the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod had made this the Right of the <hi>African</hi> no leſs than other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how they had forfeited it, or that any Council had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for any perſon, accuſed or proceeded againſt in <hi>Africk,</hi> to appeal to <hi>Tranſmarine</hi> Churches, no not to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> This they tell <hi>Coeleſtine</hi> moſt expreſly, and call them <hi>improba refugia,</hi> wicked and unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able refuges. Againſt this they had particularly provided in the Council at <hi>Milevis</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Mil.</hi> ii. <hi>Can.</hi> xxii. <hi>T. 2. col.</hi> 1542.</note> not long before this conteſt aroſe, that if any Clergyman had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with his Biſhop, the neighbouring Biſhops ſhould hear and determine it. But if there were any occaſion of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64253:144"/>
they ſhould appeal no further than to an <hi>African</hi> Council, or to the <hi>Primates</hi> of thoſe Provinces. And that if any ſhould reſolve to appeal to any <hi>Tranſmarine</hi> Judgment, no man in <hi>Africk</hi> ſhould admit them to communion. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non 'tis true expreſſes only the Appeals of Presbyters, Deacons, and the Inferiour Clergy; but as the Fathers in their Letters to <hi>Caeleſtine</hi> argue ſtrongly, if this care be taken about the Inferiour Clergy, how much more ought it to be obſerv'd by Biſhops.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That the power which the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſought to eſtabliſh over other Churches, evidently made way to bring pride, and tyranny, and a ſecular ambition into the Church of God, and that if
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64253:145"/>
this courſe were follow'd, it would let in force, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and a ſcornful tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling over the Heads of our Brethren, and perhaps the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the ſecular arm to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the oppoſition it would meet with; Principles and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices infinitely contrary to the mild and humble Spirit of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And now let the Reader Judge what power the Pope had over the <hi>African</hi> Churches, ſo ſolemnly denied, ſo ſtiffly oppos'd, not by two or three, but by two or three hundred Biſhops, twice met in Council upon this occaſion, and their judgment herein not precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, but paſt upon moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and deliberate debate and conſultation, and after that the cauſe had been depending for
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64253:145"/>
five or ſix years together. The truth is, ſo great a ſhock is this to the Papal power, that the Advocates of that Church know not which way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it. At laſt ſtands up one, <note n="*" place="margin">M. A. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. de Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. Eccl.

But the beſt of it is, the Writers in this Cauſe that came after him, had not the hardineſs to venture in his bottom. Nor have any of the many Publiſhers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils ſince that time ſtigmatiz'd them with the leaſt ſuſpicion of being ſpurious, nor taken any notice of the trifling exceptions he makes againſt them.</p>

is ſacred, that none of them would ſuffer themſelves to be wrought upon by any Arts of Flattery and Inſinuation, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or Puniſhments to aſſent to it, but ſtoutly oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt it, and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly drive out the Wolf that was breaking into the Fold.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. HE that ſhall view theſe paſſages, and look no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the outſide of things, will be apt to think, ſurely S. <hi>Gregory</hi> was the moſt ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying man in the World, and that he and his Succeſſors would ſooner burn at a Stake, than touch this Title. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe paſſionate outcries, 'tis ſhrewdly ſuſpicious, that they were levell'd not ſo much againſt the Title it ſelf, as the perſon that bore it. We have taken notice all along what
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:64253:184"/>
an inveterate Pique the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> had againſt thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ever ſince the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Councils had made them equal to them, and this now added to all the reſt, ſeem'd to exalt <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> infinitely above S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s See.</p>
               <p>Had this Title been Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally conferr'd upon the Pope, we had heard none of this noiſe and clamour; but for him to be paſs'd by, and his Enemy the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to be crown'd with this Title of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, 'twas this dropt the Gall into his Ink. And therefore in the midſt of all this Humility he ceas'd not to challenge a kind of Supremacy over that Biſhop: Who doubts (ſays he <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 7. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. 64.</note>) but that the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is ſubject to the <hi>Apoſtolic</hi> See, a thing which both the Emperour,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:64253:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and <hi>Euſebius</hi> the Biſhop of it, daily own. But this 'tis plain is there ſpoken in the caſe of Rites and Ceremonies, wherein it ſeems all Churches muſt take their Meaſures from <hi>Rome;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs with <hi>Spalato</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">De Rep. Eccl. l. 4. c. 4, n. 28. p. 582.</note> we underſtand it of a ſubjection in point of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Dignity, that <hi>Rome</hi> was the firſt See, and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the ſecond.</p>
               <p>The truth is, to me the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſeems ſuſpected, and that <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is there thruſt in for ſome other place; and the rather, becauſe there was no <hi>Euſebius</hi> at that time Biſhop of that See, nor for a long time either before or after. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Gregory</hi> had all his Eyes about him, that no diſadvantage might ſurpriſe him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his Letter to the Biſhops of <hi>Greece</hi> (mentioned before)
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:64253:185"/>
that were going to the Synod at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he tells them, that although nothing ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted for the confirmation of the <hi>Univerſal</hi> Title, yet they ſhould be infinitely careful, that nothing ſhould be done there to the prejudice of any place or perſon: which though coucht in general terms, yet whoever underſtands the ſtate of thoſe Times, and the Pope's admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable tenderneſs in thoſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, will eaſily ſee, that he means himſelf. And indeed, that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> look'd upon the Title of <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Biſhop to be foul and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable only 'till they could get it into their own hands, is evident, in that <hi>Gregory</hi> had ſcarce been 12 Months cold in his Grave, when Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third got that Title taken from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:64253:185"/>
