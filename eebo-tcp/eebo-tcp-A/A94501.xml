            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat whereas your Petitioners upon tht ſecurities held forth in two Ordinances of Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> the 13 of <hi>May,</hi> and 3 of <hi>June,</hi> 1647. advanced and lent by way of dubling at <hi>Weavers-hall</hi> the ſumme of 484000 <hi>l.</hi> to be repayed in ſuch order, courſe and manner as by the ſaid Ordinances of Parliament is directed and appointed. And whereas ſeverall perſons have been ſatisfied their proportions of money by them Advanced and Doubled by the Purchaſe of the late Biſhops Lands, and others which have not Purchaſed have had ſome doubts ariſing in them touching the time of payment of the remainder: The Parliament did upon the 16 of <hi>December</hi> 1652. Enact and Ordain, that the Commiſſioners of the Exciſe for the time being ſhould out of ſuch moneys as ſhould come to their hands upon the receits of the Grand Exciſe immediately from and after the 31 of <hi>December</hi> 1653. make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſaid money or of ſo much as ſhould at that time remain due and payable, in ſuch order and form as is directed and appointed by Ordinance of Parliament of the 13 of <hi>May</hi> 1647. and at the expiration of which terme, application was made to the late Commiſſioners of the Exciſe demanding the ſaid money, and it was alledged by the ſaid Commiſſioners that they were reſtrained from the payment thereof by an Order dated the 31 of <hi>December</hi> 1653. of his Highneſſe the Lord Protector and his Councell till they ſhould receive further Order; which reſtraint we finde to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue upon the preſent Commiſſioners to this day. Now for as much as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did upon the 29 of <hi>June</hi> 1649. Enact, that no ſumme or ſummes of money advanced and lent remaining and ſtanding charged upon the Grand Exciſe, whereof the money now due to your Petitioners is part, ſhould be taken or transferred from the ſaid Exciſe upon any other ſecurity whatſoever, nor be paid otherwiſe then in their proper courſe, wherein they firſt were charged upon any exigent or occaſion whatſoever; and for as much as his Highneſſe the Lord Protector hath likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the 39 Article for the Government of the Common-wealth, that the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties given by Acts and Ordinances of Parliament, or any ſumme or ſummes of money payable by the Grand Exciſe in courſe, or by any other publick revenue, ſhall remain firme and good, and not be made void and invallid upon any pretence whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of all which, together in relation to the honour of his Highneſſe the Lord Protector and the Parliament, as alſo the preſſing neceſſities of your Petitioners, giveth us boldneſſe to make theſe our humble addreſſes to your Honours, praying that you would take the premiſes into your grave and ſerious conſideration, and to give ſuch further order as may be of effect for the payment of all your juſt debts as is directed and appointed by former Acts and Ordinances of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that behalf.</p>
