            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>NAture, or that <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream CAUSE</hi> of all Things, which we term <hi>GOD,</hi> has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished his Creatures with such Guides, as may best Conduct them to the several Ends of their Beings. To the Birds, Beasts and other Animals, which we ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally hold Inferior to Mankind, he gave <hi>INSTINCT,</hi> as sufficient to direct them to all that is necessary for them. We may well therefore excuse them, if by that Guide they go not beyond a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Care of their Subsistence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation, all which reaches not beyond the Body; because we can discover no other End of their Being (except what human Luxury has found out in their Destruction) but to Support that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Food, and to Preserve it by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation;
<pb facs="tcp:48367:3"/>
and to this, <hi>Instinct</hi> is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
            <p>But in Man we (at least) discover a farther and nobler End. Nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must have given him another and a more sufficient Guide: For the Mind of Man (the Chief Ingredient of his Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition) is not bounded by present Objects, in which <hi>Instinct</hi> alone would serve. Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity has always a share in its Thoughts, and its Faculties will be employ'd with a Care of those Things that are to come, from whence it may derive not only Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, Interest and Ease for the Body, but also Improvement, Happiness and Tranquility for its self.</p>
            <p>But the things from which the Mind must gather, and of which Compose all these, are so vast in Number, and so Various and Obscure in their Natures, that without the Help of a very good Guide, it may make a Collection of Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons instead of Medicines, and reap its Destruction, not Satisfaction; But the <hi>Omnipotent CAUSE,</hi> that had so well furnished Bruits, left not the Mind of Man without its Director in this Maze and Lottery of Things; he gave it
<pb facs="tcp:48367:3"/>
               <hi>Reason,</hi> as its sovereign Rule and Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone to examin them by, and to fit our Choice to our double Advantage of Body and Mind. Reason is the Light, that brings Day to those Things, that will contribute to, or oppose our Happiness; without which we should in vain grope in the Dark; and we should owe entirely to Chance what we obtain'd.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, Reason is not sufficient to bring us to a perfect Knowledge of all Things, but 'tis able to furnish us with enough to make us happy, and that is as much as we need care for. There is no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of our Skill in the inmost Nature of Things, but there is (since we are ordain'd to an eternity of Continuance) that we should know how to make Eternity Happy, since its Being so depends on our selves; and since such a Knowledge is absolutely necessary, I can discover nothing that can give it us, but our sovereign Guide, Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>REASON,</hi> therefore being the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream and Primitive Director of e'ery Man, to infringe its Liberty of dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, is to invade the common Charter of Nature, and every Man's Right and
<pb facs="tcp:48367:4"/>
Property; so that those that do so, are justly to be look'd on as the Enemies of Human-kind. But how that Character agrees with the <hi>Fiery</hi> Glory of the <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi> for Religion, I cannot comprehend, unless they can demonstrate, That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Nature are directly Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that they pretend their Severity against Heterodox Books (that is, all that deviate from their Opinions) is the Eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct of their Zeal for the Good of Mankind. But then they ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>not deny but that they make <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> the Iudges of that Good, and so make their Opinion the Standard, which is too particular for what they would have of so universal Extent; and will afford us no Refuge if they should lead us into an Error, which we may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after find (unless they deny that they can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e deceived) and if they should do so, then may their Universal imaginary Good prove a Real and Universal Evil.</p>
            <p>If they would have us believe, that they hold every Man must be saved by his own, not anothers Faith; they must
<pb facs="tcp:48367:4"/>
grant every one the Liberty of believing and professing what his own Reason shall direct him; and that 'tis a Crime to oppose this Liberty, I mean by indirect Means, for I shall never quarrel at Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son if they can produce any. I must tell these <hi>Fiery</hi> Bigots, that their Practice and Doctrin being so Contradictory, gives a more effectual Blow at Religion, than all the Attempts of professed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists; for when these clash, they give too great Grounds to suspect a trick in the whole: And when so essential a Birthright of each Man is invaded, it must improve those Suspicions very much, and cause a narrower Enquiry into Things that might otherwise pass unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
            <p>We should not have so great cause to resent this Severity, if we might say of Religion and Eternity, as <hi>Pliny</hi> said of Providence, — <hi>Ridiculum est agere curam rerum humanarum, Quicquid est Summum, sed credi usui est Vitae.</hi>— That 'twas meerly a political Trick for the Convenience of Government and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Life. Then indeed it would be something pardonable in these Gentlemen,
<pb facs="tcp:48367:5"/>
that Patronize the <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Faggot</hi> so vehemently, to strive with so much Ardor for the reducing all to their own Fancy. Then the Prophanation would not be great, of making what they really believ'd a Chymaera serve a Turn, and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a Faction or any Interest. I will easily excuse the ancient Founders of Paganism, for having recourse to Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems, to reduce Mens Reason to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Opinions, because they made use of them only to form Greatness to themselves, by imposing on the Predominant Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Vulgar Sort, in a thing they judg'd of no more Concern, than a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Convenience. 'Twas no ill Policy in them, when they perceiv'd the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Mankind would easily submit their Reason to every appearance of a Wonder, to fish for their Profit and Glory, with so eas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e a Bait. <hi>Alexander</hi> the false Prophet, mentioned by <hi>Lucian,</hi> found it turn to his Advantage, in gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him so great an Interest in the People. And from this Topic <hi>Philostrates</hi> mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>Apollonius.</hi> These in short, every new God and Prophet among them was to have, as Credentials of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
<pb facs="tcp:48367:5"/>
and a Right to the Zeal of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votees. Some of these carried, I must confess, extraordinary Circumstances to gain 'em necessary Credit, as one (among several others) in those Marble Records found in the Temple of <hi>Aesculapius</hi> in <hi>Rome, viz.</hi>

                  <hi>In those days there was an Oracle delivered to one</hi> Caius, <hi>that was blind, that he should come to the Sacred Altar, and kneel down, and should then go from the right side to the left, and place five Fingers on the Altar, and lift up his Hand and put it on his own Eyes: Which done, he plainly saw in the presence of all the People, who congratulated the Cure, that such great Miracles should be performed under our Emperor</hi> Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus.</q>

of a Disease he did not labour with, and for the Glory of their Gods the <hi>Romans</hi> always found some that would attest the highest Improbabilities by Authority, to influence the People with an Awe; as he that Swore he saw <hi>Romulus</hi> assum'd into Heaven, in that <hi>Senate,</hi> that had been the Authors of his Death, but they were willing to grant him Immortality and Deity above, to be rid of him there, and at the same time give the People a Vener<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

they believe Religion and Eternity a sacred Truth, and that every Man is so far interested in them, that his Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and loss of Eternal Happiness de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on his own Faith; let them leave every Man in his Native Right to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son on what Concerns him so much, and bring nothing against us but what <hi>Reason</hi> affords them. For 'tis but fair that if I must venture my Life in any Cause, I have the Liberty of taking my own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Security.</p>
            <p>This Liberty among us extends to the interpreting that sacred Repository of Truth, the Holy Scriptures, according to our own Reason; which is a Liberty that has been for many Years asserted to be the Right of every reasonable Man: This being granted, as indeed it can't be deny'd, it inevitably follows, that we ought to be allow'd a Liberty of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring our Opinion and Interpretation, or else it could be of no use in Nature to us. And if this be the Right of every reasonable Man, how much more must it be of Men that to their natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son have the acquired helps of Learning, as Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> must be granted to have,
<pb facs="tcp:48367:7"/>
whom my ever Honoured and Learned Friend has so well, and with so much Evidence, vindicated in the first Letter of this Book. Nor is it through a vain Opinion that I can add any force to that incomparable Defence of his learned Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, that I presume to interest my self in the Doctor's Quarrel; but only to plead for that Liberty for him (and in him for every ingenious Man) which his great Opposers stand so much upon, against those Adversaries that would deny the same to them. I should never complain of their confuting him by fair Reason, for that is the Weapon of Mankind; but when they have Recourse to the wretched Refuge of rooted Argument, <hi>Power,</hi> and the <hi>say so</hi> of such and such, we have cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of unfair Dealing, and that they press what they would not admit themselves.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Reason</hi> be our Iudge, and we can never fear being Censur'd by <hi>it,</hi> for esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing its Sovereignty: Nor can the nicest Devotee that hath any deference to Reason deny, but that Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> h<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:48367:7"/>
the Absurdities vulgar Apprehensions had cast on him, than those who stickle them, that involv'd him in 'em. In short, 'tis not <hi>Moses,</hi> but his Interpreters that the learned Doctor has exposed, and by consequence 'tis not that holy Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, but the blind Biggots of the old absurd Interpretation of him, that we have offended in publishing this in <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let our Adversaries but consider that this Liberty I have been pleading for, and which the Doctor has made use of, is only to examin the Interpretation of Others, by the severe, yet just, Rules of Reason; which they will agree to be very reasonable, when they shall reflect, that the Passions and Interests of Men have not only emboldned them to misinterpret the <hi>Sacred Writ</hi> to their own Ends, but also to add to and detract from the very Text it self.</p>
            <p>Thus they have brought into Question several parts of the new Testament, and among others particularly the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which in some Manuscripts is left out, and even in that of <hi>Beza,</hi> which is very ancient, 'tis put by its self at the End, like an Apocriphal piece.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48367:8"/>St. <hi>Jerom</hi> is a further Testimony of this, who having the Supervisal and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the <hi>Latin</hi> Bible, assures us, that having recourse to the <hi>Greek,</hi> he found those Copies as defective, and as much alter'd by the Transcribers as those of the <hi>Latins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This liberty of Reasoning I have been so long pleading for, our severest Oponents will grant us in Philosophical and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Points, of which that part of this Book which relates not to Religion, is compos'd: I shall therefore say nothing in defence of them, nor obviate those Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions I foresee will be made against them by those, that do not consider, that we judg of things of that nature but by bare Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, and Probabilities.

               </gap>. Nor shall I meddle with any other of the Letters that relate to Religion except one, the subject of which is so uncommon, the Reasons it contains so extraordinary, and the End it aims at so evidently gain'd, that I cannot but take notice of it. Not that I can be so vain to imagin, that my declaring my self of that opinion, will be any Advantage to
<pb facs="tcp:48367:8"/>
the cause, or that what I can say, will in the least strengthen my Honour'd Friends Arguments, which of themselves are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, but I consult purely my own sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in running over some Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Subject of it; which tho I am not vain enough to think, yet am I zealous enough to wish serviceable to the Honourable Person the Letter is directed to. I mean that <hi>about the Lawfulness of Marrying two Sisters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the weight and force of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Subject seem to turn upon this one Point, viz. <hi>Whether the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of two Sisters successively be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Laws of God.</hi> This is the Rock that all the Defenders of the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative depend on, and this they fix chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on <hi>Levit. 18.16,</hi> &amp; <hi>18.</hi> or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mosaic</hi> Prohibitions. So that if it be made evident that such a Marriage is not forbidden by the Law of God, the <hi>Bugbears</hi> of Custom (for those of the Laws of the Land as well as the Canon-Law evidently, from the proof of my ever Honour'd and Learned Friend, depend entirely on this) will vanish; for if the Law of God be not infring'd, I think there
<pb facs="tcp:48367:9"/>
is no other consideration can reach the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest scruple of the most severe Lady of Honour that has with it Sense and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as I am assur'd the Admirable <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straea</hi> has. Tho this Point as well as the rest be already beyond contradiction clear'd, yet I shall venture to attempt a Supererogatory Argument or two, as a tribute I owe to the truth, I so much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of.</p>
            <p>First then to make any Law the Law of God, strictly taken (for in some sense every Law that tends to the temporary convenience or good of a people is so) it must have one quality, that is insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the Nature of God, and (by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence) of his Acts, viz. <hi>Immutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that is it must be founded in nature, and always the same. So that what was the Law of God in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> could not cease to be so, or at least be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to his Law, in our time; and what God plainly and openly espous'd in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> cannot but he suppos'd to be according to his Law: Now 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from the Sacred Scriptures, that <hi>Sarah Abrahams</hi> Wife was his Sister, by the Father, tho not by the Mother, <hi>Gen.
<pb facs="tcp:48367:9"/>
20.12. And yet indeed she is my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, she is the Daughter of my Father, but not the Daughter of my Mother, and she became my Wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here was at least a half-blood, and something with a face very like Incest, and yet the Marriage justify'd by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, not only in the threats he us'd to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech,</hi> if he return'd not his Wife, and those Plagues he inflicted on <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his House, <hi>Gen. 12.17. And the Lord Plagued</hi> Pharoah <hi>and his House, with great Plagues because of</hi> Sarai Abraham's <hi>Wife</hi>: But also in the farther confirmation of it, <hi>Gen. 17.15,</hi> &amp; <hi>16. And God said unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>as for</hi> Sarai <hi>thy Wife thou shalt not call her Name</hi> Sarai, <hi>but</hi> Sarah <hi>shall her Name be.</hi> Now this alteration of her Name shew'd a particular favour she had found in being <hi>Abraham</hi>'s lawful Wife, for God always alter'd or order'd the Names of those he particularly chose, as <hi>Abraham's, Jacob's,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>ver. 16.</hi> is a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my assertion, <hi>I will bless her, and give thee a Son also of her, and</hi> She <hi>shall be a Mother of Nations, Kings of People shall be of her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48367:10"/>Certainly never was Marriage better confirm'd than this, so solemnly approv'd by the God of Heaven, the God of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Just.</hi> And afterward God chooses to establish his <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>Isaac</hi> the Son of <hi>Sarah,</hi> not with <hi>Ishmael</hi> the Son of <hi>Hagar, tho</hi> Hagar <hi>was not his Sister.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet we find this very sort of Marriage so approv'd of by God in <hi>Genesis,</hi> forbid by <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Leviticus</hi> (that is if we will believe these Gentlemen, that perswade us that he intended the prohibitions of the <hi>18</hi>th. of <hi>Levit.</hi> as to Marriage) for if, <hi>Thou shalt not uncover the Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of thy Fathers Daughter,</hi> be the same as, <hi>Thou shalt not marry thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Daughter,</hi> and this be a Divine immutable Law, and by consequence so from the beginning, the very Case of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> is expresly condemn'd. Nay if this <hi>Levitical</hi> Prohibition be in this sense, and the Law of God too, then wou'd there be a Divine Law expresly contradictory to the Will of God himself. Such absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities do some men incur, whilst they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue either some private design, or supine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interpret without a diligent and
<pb facs="tcp:48367:10"/>
through comparison of the several Texts of Scripture.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed 'twill not be amiss in a line or two to shew that this Standard I make of the Law of God, is not my own particular Fancy, but a Reality establish'd by Christ himself. For he examining some of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, tells the <hi>Jews</hi> this was permitted for the hardness of your Hearts, but from the beginning it was not so, where he makes from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the Test and Standard of that permissory Law, which must hold good too for the Prohibitions, both proceeding from the same cause, <hi>viz.</hi> the hardness of the <hi>Israelites</hi> hearts, or the depravity of their inclinations.</p>
            <p>But after all 'tis evident to me that there is no Prohibition of Marriage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by that <hi>18. Chap. of Leviticus,</hi> for I meet not with the Phrase of <hi>Unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Nakedness,</hi> importing Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, in any part of Scripture, I mean absolutely and alone; and 'tis evident from the <hi>20. Chap.</hi> where the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions are repeated, that they are meant barely as to unlawful Copulations without Marriage; for first to what purpose wou'd
<pb facs="tcp:48367:11"/>
it be to forbid what never was done, or cou'd indeed be suppos'd to be tolerated ev'n among the <hi>Jews.</hi> For we never read of any Daughters that Married their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or Sons their Mothers knowingly; there was such a horror of this printed in the heart of man, that the very Heathens gave a punishment to <hi>Oedipus</hi> for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary commission of it; and <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> kill'd his Mother for stealing his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces. Next there is not one Verse in the whole Chapter except the <hi>18th.</hi> that has any relation to Marriage, and that indeed expresses the taking to Wife; which evinces the truth of what I assert, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Uncovering the Nakedness,</hi> is not a Synonymous Expression for Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; else 'twould be perfect Nonsense in this <hi>18th.</hi> Verse, which runs thus, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shalt thou take a Wife to her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, to vex her, to uncover her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness besides the other in her life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</hi> Now if these Expressions were Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous, it wou'd be thus, <hi>Neither shalt thou take a Wife to her Sister, to vex her, to take a Wife, &amp;c.</hi> Besides it seems to imply a liberty of espousing two Sisters at once, tho not of enjoying both, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
<pb facs="tcp:48367:11"/>
the Nakedness is only an expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for bare enjoyment, without regard either to Marriage or not.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that the Chapter should be all of a piece, and that either this Verse should not relate to Marriage, or the rest shou'd, I answer, there is no necessity of that, for in all the <hi>Chapters</hi> in the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> where several Laws are repeated, he does not observe, at least generally speaking, any order or method in that, but mixes things of no relation to one another, as is evident from the very next Chapter, where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every Verse affords a new and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Prohibition. Besides according to this the Verses that follow the <hi>18th.</hi> as well as those that go before, must be of the same, which wou'd indeed be merry enough to make <hi>Moses</hi> forbid our Marriage with Beasts, or Mens Marrying one another, which perhaps might reach one of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Extravagant Actions, but none else. But the <hi>20th. Chapter</hi> explains this annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each particular punishment, to each particular transgression, whereas in this the punishment is put in general at the End, as <hi>ver. 29. For whosoever shall
<pb facs="tcp:48367:12"/>
commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among the People.</hi> 'Tis a common thing in this Prophet to repeat his Prohibitions, and sometimes with a little variety. But methinks <hi>vers. 15.</hi> of this <hi>Chap.</hi> shou'd put this beyond all-question, where 'tis thus, <hi>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy Dangh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Law, for she is thy Sons Wife, &amp;c.</hi> The Verb <hi>Is</hi> being in the present Tense denotes the Son to be living.</p>
            <p>But for a concluding Proof that Marriage was not meant here, or that, if it was, not as an invariable Law of God, but only limited under such and such considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by consequence only Temporary, and therefore wants that distinguishing mark given to the Divine Laws by Christ, let us compare <hi>vers. 16.</hi> of this <hi>10</hi>th. <hi>Ch.</hi> of <hi>Levit.</hi> with <hi>Deut. 25.5, 6, 7, 8, 9,</hi> &amp; <hi>10.</hi> First, <hi>Lev. 1.18, 16. Thou shalt not uncover the Nakedness of thy Brothers Wife, it is thy Brothers Nakedness.</hi> Next, <hi>Deut. 25.5. If Brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no Child, the Wife of the Dead shall not marry without unto a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb facs="tcp:48367:12"/>
her Husbands Brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to Wife, and perform the</hi> Duty <hi>of a Husbands Brother to her.</hi> Nay in the succeeding Verses that is to the <hi>11th.</hi> 'tis prov'd so evident a <hi>Duty,</hi> that he who wou'd not comply with it was to be affected by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Authority, with a public Infamy. The first-born was only to succeed to the Name of the deceas'd Brother, <hi>That his</hi> Name <hi>be not put out of Israel.</hi> Now if Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Brothers Wife were contrary to the Law of God, and by consequence <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in se,</hi> it cou'd not be despensed with to serve a meer Political turn, and that so trivial as this, especially since any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might perform it (if not a stranger, yet at least some other of the Family not so nearly related) and the Child so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten wou'd be as much the Child of the deceas'd, as if begot by his surviving Brother. Nay an Adoption might have kept up the Name, which seems to be the whole Aim of it, without dispensing with the Law of God on so small and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable an Account.</p>
            <p>So that upon the whole, if (as I think is evident) the Marriage of a Brothers
<pb facs="tcp:48367:13"/>
Widow be not forbid, the <hi>ubi eadem Ratio, ibi idem Jus</hi> of the Canonists is quite out of Doors against the Marriage of two Sisters. And were I deceiv'd in my Assertions in this particular (which I do not believe) yet can I see no reason why this blind Prohibition of the old Law should affect us any more than that of not wearing Garments of Linen and Woolen, since the former is no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by Christ, than the latter, that is not at all. And great part of the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Law was calculated for the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> in regard to their Rites, Customs and Inclinations, and are merely Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, which in their very nature can have no tye upon us.</p>
            <p>To conclude, if I have given the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture a contrary Interpretation to what it has receiv'd before, I can't help it; this I have chosen appears to me the natural <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I can read the History of the Pigeon that was sent out of the Ark, and returned no more, yet not question how she found out her Mate that was left behind. That <hi>Lazarus</hi> was raised from the Dead, yet not demand where in the Interim his Soul waited; or raise a Law Case, whether his Heir might lawfully detain his Inheritance bequeath'd to him by his Death, and he, though restored to Life, have no Plea or Title to his former Possessions. Whether <hi>Eve</hi> was framed out of the left side of <hi>Adam,</hi> I dispute not; because I stand not yet assured, which is the right side of a Man, or whether there be any such distinction in Nature. That <hi>Eve</hi> was Edified of the Rib of <hi>Adam,</hi> I believe, yet raise no question who shall arise with that Rib at the Resurrection. Whether <hi>Adam</hi> was an Hermophrodite, as the Rabbins contend upon the Letter of the Text (<hi>Genes.</hi> 1.27.) because it is contrary to Reason there should be an Hermophrodite before there was a Woman, or a Composition of two Natures before there was a second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.

That there was a Deluge once, whether in the time of <hi>Deucalion</hi> or <hi>Noah,</hi> seems not to me so great a Miracle, as that there is not one always. How all kinds of Creatures, not only in their own Bulks, but with a Competency of Food and Suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, might be preserved in one Ark, and within the Extent of Three hundred Cubits, will not appear very feasible. There is also another Secret not contain'd in Scripture, which is more hard to comprehend, and put the honest Father (St. <hi>Austin</hi>) to the Refuge of a Miracle; and, that is, not only how the distinct pieces of the World, and divided Islands, should be first Planted by Men, but Inhabited by Tygers, Panthers and Bears?

Also that <hi>Iudas</hi> perished by hanging himself, there is no certainty in Scripture, the two Texts (<hi>Matth.</hi> 25. and <hi>Acts</hi> 1.18.) seeming to contradict one another. That our Fathers after the Flood, erected the Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> to preserve themselves against a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Deluge, is generally believed, yet is there another Intention of theirs express'd in Scripture: Besides it is improbable from the Circumstance of the Place, which was a Plain in the Land of <hi>Shinar.</hi> I believe there was a Tree, whose Fruit our unhappy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents tasted, though in the same Chapter, where God forbids it, 'tis possitively said, the Plants of the Field were not yet grown; for God had not then caused it to rain upon the Earth. I believe that the Serpent (if we shall literally understand it) from his proper Form and Figure, made his Motion his Belly before the Curse. I find the tryal of the Pucillage and Virginity of Women, which God ordained the <hi>Iews,</hi> is very fallible. Experience and History inform me, that not only many particular Women, but likewise whole Nations have escaped the Curse of Childbirth, which God seems to pronounce upon the whole Sex.

Also in his <hi>Vulgar Errors,</hi> our same Author writes thus:
<q>— It hath puzzled the Enquiries of others to apprehend, and forced them to strange Conceptions, to make out how <hi>Eve</hi> should be deluded by a Serpent, or subject her Reason to a Beast, which God had subjected to hers? and how without Fear and Doubt she could Discourse with such a Creature, or hear a

            <p>Now as one observes very well, in relation to Divine Miracles, there is oftentimes great Errors committed in the manner of reading Scripture; as when that is taken in a general Sence, which ought to be particularly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood: As that of <hi>Adam,</hi> whom <hi>Moses</hi> made only to be the first Father of the <hi>Iews,</hi> whilst others Hyperbolically make him to be the first Father of all Men. So likewise the Darkness at the Death of our Saviour, which some say was spread over the Face of the whole Earth: Others, and some able Interpreters, have only translated it, <hi>Vpon all the Land of the Iews, viz. Palestine,</hi> which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> always meant, when they said the Earth. So likewise the Star which Conducted the Wisemen upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of Christ, some place in Heaven among the rest of the Stars; but others say, that could not be, for then other People had seen it as well as those few Wisemen, and <hi>Herod</hi> among the rest; who being troubled at this Report, and not being able to see it himself, calling the Wisemen to him privately (says the Evangelist) he enquired of them what time the Star did appear? And besides it marched before them
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48367:17"/>
like a Torch, and conducted them; so that it cannot be said to have been a fixed Star in the Heavens. Again, some will tell you, that the Fiery Army sent to the help of <hi>Elisha</hi> from Heaven was such, whom the Prophet himself saw, and yet his Servant that stood by him could not see. Likewise in the miraculous Sign which was given of <hi>Ezekiah</hi>'s Recovery from his Sickness, when 'tis said, — That God brought back the shadow of those Lines that it had gone down in the Dial of <hi>Achaz</hi> back ten Degrees — Here some affirm, That the Sun went not back in the Heaven (as 'tis general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed) but only in the Dial of <hi>Achaz</hi>; for, say they, if the Sun went back in the <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diac,</hi> or that Degree of the Ecliptic standing still, which he was running that Day, the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Mobi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Besides, that this Sign was seen only in the Land of <hi>Iudah</hi> and not elsewhere, they pretend to prove from Ambassadors which were sent from <hi>Babylon</hi> to enquire after the Sign, which (say they) might have been seen in <hi>Babylon,</hi> as well as in <hi>Iudah,</hi> had the Sun gone back in the Firmament. Much to the same purpose they argue against the Miracle of the Suns standing still one whole

Day in <hi>Gabaon</hi> at the command of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, That that long day extended not it self beyond the Country of <hi>Gabaon,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it must have been apparent elsewhere: And therefore they urge, That the Light of the setting Sun after he was himself gone down, was only the Reflection of his Beams, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet in the Atmosphere, which reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated longer than ordinary upon the Mountain and City of <hi>Gabaon,</hi> by a favourable Scituation of the Hills: In the North of <hi>Scotland</hi> they have at sometimes in Summer hardly any Night at all; and some Mathematicians write, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Obliquity of the Sphere, there were some Days of six Months continuance, with them who live under the Parallel.

Now that this Flood was only in the Land of the <hi>Iews,</hi> they argue; First, From the Causes of the Deluge, which were only the Sins of the <hi>Iews</hi>: Secondly, From the words of <hi>Berosus,</hi> who hath written of the Ark (says <hi>Iosephus</hi>) in which the chief of our Family was preserved; not the chief of Mankind, but the chief of our Lineage, that is, the <hi>Iews.</hi> Thirdly, From the Dove that was sent out and returned at Night with an Olive-branch free from Dirt or Slime and cover'd with green Leaves; whereas, say they, in all places where the Flood had been, the Trees were depress'd and cover'd with Slime and Mud. They further tell you, That the World was said to be divided by <hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These and many more Scruples are raised by some nice and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Enquirers; so that we see our Learned Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> stands not alone by himself in his more refined and speculative Doubts. All which might easily be salved, were it not for

For God seldom alters or perverts the Course of Nature, however Miracles may be necessary sometimes to acquaint the World with his Prerogative, least the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance of our Reason should question his Power; a Crime no wise Man can ever be guilty of: Who climbling up from Cause to Cause, shall ever find the highest Link of Nature's Chain to be tyed at the Foot of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Chair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The next Charge against our Author is for his disowning Original Sin, which I must inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guously confess was ever a difficult Pill with me to swallow, my Reason stopping it in my Throat, and not having Faith enough to wash it down. There are some Persons, I know, who believe that Wars, Plagues, Feavers and all the Troop of natural Corruptions invaded the Earth by that imputation of the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> without discriminating between Natural and Legal Sin. For Wars, Plagues and Feavers, with whatever else of this sort trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and afflicts Mankind, are the consequences of Natural Sin, which is the Wickedness and Imperfection of Nature. This will easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to such, who can suffer that ancient Cloud of Prepossession to be taken off, which dulls their sight; for who knows not that Wars
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48367:19"/>
had their Original from such, whom eithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> greedy Desire of Prey, or cruel Thirst after Revenge, or sacred Ambition of Rule stirr'd up to take Arms? Then who hath not had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Breeding and Inflammation of Plagues and Feavers, either by the natural Corruption of the Air, or by the Corruption of our natural Bodies? We have as many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of this Observation and Truth, as we have States-men and Physicians, therefore not from <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin proceed our Diseases, but from our own Corrupt and Rotten Natures; the innate Infirmity of Men being the chief and natural Calamity of Men. Nay it is not known that <hi>Adam</hi> who was the Criminal and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain (as they say) of so great Evils, was ever so much as troubled with the least Disease all those 930. Years which he lived; unless you will believe him, who relates, out of I know not what Author, that <hi>Adam</hi> died of the Gout, wherewith he was troubled from his Ancestors. Did <hi>Cain</hi> fall sick when he slew his Brother? No; he was very strong and lusty, he fled to the <hi>East</hi> of <hi>Eden,</hi> where he associated himself with a pack of Lewd Fellows; he set up for the Trade of Padding, then married a Wife, begot a Son, and built a City. Likewise the most excellent Poet falls out with his Gods, for that his Mistress <hi>(Eugenia)</hi> being perjured, kept the same Face which she had before, or rather became fairer and fairer: The same is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48367:20"/>
also the constant complaint of the Elect in Scripture, That the Wicked prosper so much in this World. Wherefore to me it seems cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin is no ways an occasion of our Sufferings. I know there are some affirm, That if <hi>Adam</hi> had not sinn'd, Men should never have died; as if Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and Eternal Life, which nothing but a New Creation could beget, should have been bestow'd on Men by Vertue of the First Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which by its own Nature is subject to Death and Corruption: And that those Men should not have died, who (as the Schools say) are naturally Corruptible, and were created Mortal. Some will here object and say, God told <hi>Adam, That on the Day he eat that Fruit, he should die the Death</hi>; from whence they gather, That if Death was given as a Punishment to <hi>Adam</hi> on that Day wherein he trangress'd the Law of God, then surely <hi>Adam</hi> would never have died, if he had never sinn'd: But that Consequence I deny; for although they die which kill, yet they who do not kill are not Immortal. Besides, to conclude this point, 'tis altogether inconsistent with God's Attributes of Mercy and Justice, to punish all Mankind for one single Persons sin, which we could no ways prevent or hinder, nor any but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who permitted that Evil Spirit to Reign in him. The <hi>Roman</hi> Schools affirm the first Motions of Concupiscence to be no sin; because
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48367:20"/>
they are involuntary, and come upon us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will or no; then why should they think Original Sin to be really and truly a Sin in us, which is altogether as involuntary, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chosen by us as Concupiscence? For how can anothers sin, wherein we have no hand, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us? Eternal Death was not threatned to <hi>Adam</hi> for his sin, and therefore could not from him descend upon us, for that which was none of ours. The Death that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced is such as could have a Remedy or Recompence by Christ, but eternal Death hath no Recompence, nor can ever be destroy'd, whereas temporal Death shall. If God should impute <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin so as to damn us for it, then all our Good we receive from God, is much less than the Evil, saith Dr. <hi>Taylor.</hi> If God will not give Men Heaven by Christ, he will not throw them into Hell by <hi>Adam</hi>; if his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will not do the First, his Mercy and Justice will not suffer him to do the Last. Nor did any Church ever enjoyn Pennance or Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for Original Sin; wherefore it seems pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous and unreasonable, that any Man should be damn'd for that, which no Man is bound to Repent. However I do no way find that Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> does absolutely declare against Original Sin; but rather the contrary, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the Degeneracy of Mankind from its primitive State, which must be redeem'd by the Seed of a Woman. All Extreams are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48367:21"/>
dangerous, as walking upon the Brink of a Precipice or the like, and if he be not so violent in this Point; what others may only think he wants in Piety, may perhaps be really supplied in Charity: And what they only fancy they have in Piety, may be truly defective in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: An honest Augure is ever in most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his own Fraternity.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, it hath been a point very much disputed among several Politicians in the Commonwealth of Learning, who was the real and true Author of the Pentateuch. A late and great Modern Philosopher of this Nation declares, It is not an Argument sufficient to prove those Books were written by <hi>Moses,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are call'd the Five Books of <hi>Moses</hi>; for, as much as Books often take their Titles from their Subject, as well as from their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. It's true, the History of <hi>Livy</hi> denotes the Writer, but the History of <hi>Tamberlain</hi> is denominated from the Subject. We read in the last Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy, v.</hi> 6<hi>th.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sepulcher of <hi>Moses,</hi> that no Man knoweth his Sepulcher to this Day, that is to say, to the Day wherein those Words were written; wherefore it is manifest that those Words were written after his Interment. But it may perhaps be alledged, That the last Chapter only, and not the whole <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> was written by some other hand, and the rest
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48367:21"/>
by <hi>Moses.</hi> Let us therefore consider, that which we find in the Book of <hi>Genesis</hi> (cap. 12. <hi>v.</hi> 6.) and <hi>Abraham</hi> passed through the Land to the place of <hi>Sichem,</hi> unto the Plain of <hi>Moreh,</hi> and the <hi>Canaanite</hi> was then in the Land; which must be the Words of one that wrote when the <hi>Canaanite</hi> was not in the Land, and consequently not of <hi>Moses,</hi> who died before he came into it. Likewise, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 14. the Writer citeth another more ancient Book, entituled, the Book of the Wars of the Lord, wherein were Registred the Acts of <hi>Moses</hi> at the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and at the Brook of <hi>Amon</hi>; which he would never have mention'd of himself, but could as well have given us an account himself of what he did in those places. Wherefore it is evident, That the Five Books of <hi>Moses</hi> were written by another Hand after his Decease. But yet it is rational to believe that <hi>Moses</hi> wrote the Volume of the Law, contain'd in the 11<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and the following Chapters to the 27<hi>th.</hi> which he commanded to be written on Stones in Entry into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Also <hi>Moses</hi> himself deliver'd it to the Priests and Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> to be read every seventh Year to all <hi>Israel</hi> at their Assembly in the Feast of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, as we may find in the 31<hi>st.</hi> Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy v.</hi> 9<hi>th.</hi> Nay, it may be also question'd, whether the aforesaid was that very Law which <hi>Moses</hi> delivered, since having been a long time lost, <hi>Helkiah</hi> pretended to find it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48367:22"/>
again, and so sent it to King <hi>Iosias</hi> (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.8. and the 23.1, 2, 3.) so that we have only <hi>Helkiah</hi>'s Word for it. The Book of <hi>Ioshua</hi> was also written long after <hi>Ioshua</hi>'s time, which may be gather'd out of many places of the Book it self: <hi>Ioshua</hi> had set up twelve Stones in the midst of <hi>Iordan</hi> for a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Passage; of which the Writer saith (<hi>Ioshua</hi> 4.9.) <hi>They are there unto this day</hi>; which Expression, <hi>Vnto this day,</hi> is a Phrase that signifieth a Time past. And the same is manifest by like Arguments of the Books of <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> that they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten long after the Captivity, <hi>Iudges</hi> chap. 1.21, 26. chap. 6.24. chap. 10.4. chap. 15.19. chap. 17.6. and <hi>Ruth</hi> chap. 1.1. but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <hi>Iudges</hi> 18.30.</p>
            <p>Now the Reason why I make mention of these things is only to shew, That our most Reverend and Ingenious Author is not the first that has had scruples in this kind, and that he may well make an Enquiry into the Truth of some Passages of the History, when the very Historians themselves are so much doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by others; not but that we may pay a just deference to the Church, and yet at the same time raise scruples for information sake, the better to arm our selves against our Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonists.</p>

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48367:22"/>The next little Part or Epilogue of Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>'s Book, which we here present you with in <hi>English,</hi> is his <hi>Appendix</hi> concerning the <hi>Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>'s Religion, and has reference to one of his former Chapters on the same Subject. I must confess his Notion of their Omnipotent Spider (though what I have read many Years since) was no less grateful to me, than the return of a Friend after a long Voyage.

               <head>CHAP. VII. Concerning <hi>Moses</hi>'s Description of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice as well as the Original State of Nature and Mankind in the beginning of the World.</head>
               <p>WE have hitherto made our Enquiry after the Originals of things as well as after a true knowledg of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise among the Ancients; yet still with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Sacred Writ, where it gave us any manner of light into the Subject, but think it altogether unnecessary to define the place or sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48367:23"/>
of Paradice; since in respect to the Theory of the Earth, 'tis much the same thing where you place it, provided it be not on our modern Earth. Now if you enquire among the ancient Fathers where the scituation of it was, either they will have it to be none at all, or else obscure and remote from our understanding; some of them indeed term it an Intelligible Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, but confin'd to no one particular place; whilst others at the same time make it a sensible one; and here it is they first divided about it. Moreover, such as believe it to be a Sensible and Corporeal Paradice, place it either on this Earth, or out of it, (<hi>viz.</hi>) in the Air or in the Lunary Orb; when they who believe those hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Mansions to have been upon the Earth, place them either on this side the Aequator, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Aequator, or beyond the Aequator or Torrid Zone; finally all that are of our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on believe the true Paradice, which is now passed away did in reality formerly flourish upon the Earth, but nevertheless on such an Earth as was quite different from what we now inhabit. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever these different opinions we have else-where more at large explained; especially that which carries Paradice beyond the Aequator, Torrid Zone, the Ocean and our Northern World. Not that this opinion pleases me above the rest but because it is demonstrated by the Calculations of the Ancients; and plainly evinces the Paradice we now pretend to place in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> to be only a Modern fiction. Besides, as to the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48367:24"/>
Theory of the Earth, it does not in the least ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate a Local Paradice in any part of the Earth; since it supposes that in the Infant world even the whole inhabitable Globe was like a Paradice. Yet notwithstanding consequentially and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Mosaic Hypothesis, which make<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Mankind how numerous soever to have first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd its birth only from one Man and one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, you may therefore (if you please) appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate the name of Paradice to the original na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive soil and first habitation of these two; a place most wonderfully beautified as well with Trees as Waters; provided at the same time you grant to the other parts of the same Earth a Perpetual Spring, and those advantages which necessarily flow from it, (<hi>viz.</hi>) spontaneous fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility together with long life to its inhabitants; for that the World did in its first beginning en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all these blessings we have sufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated as well from the nature of the thing it self as from the testimonies of the Ancients. Ay but, say you, <hi>Moses</hi> mentions only one Garden which he calls <hi>Gan Eden</hi> or the Garden of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciousness; and seems to suppose that all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Regions of that Earth enjoyed but one and the same common Lot with little variation from our modern Earth: Now to this I answer, That among the Ancients, but more especially the Orientals, there were two different ways of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering their Divinity and Philosophy, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Popular and a hidden one; of which dubious sort of style the Holy
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48367:24"/>
Scripture seems to make use in the explaining natural things; sometimes accommodating it self to the capacities of the people, and sometimes to the real but more clouded truth.</p>
               <p>However, being resolv'd not in the least to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate from the very literal sense without an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute necessity; that is to say, unless the Nature of the thing does unavoidably oblige or enforce me to it; we must first enquire what is in this case the literal sense, and how much it will bear; as also, on the other side, what the Subject-matter will bear and what not; to the end that having thus fairly stated the case on both sides, we may be the better enabled to give a certain determination according to the merits of the cause as well as to disclose where the real truth lies hid.</p>
               <p>Now the History of Paradice (from whence we'll begin) according to <hi>Moses</hi> is thus: When God had in six days finished the Creation of the World, the seventh day he rested from all manner of work: And here <hi>Moses</hi> relates par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly each days Operation; but for the story of Mankind, as well Male as Female, of that he makes a peculiar Treatise by it self. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore omitting the rest at present, let us, if you please, consider the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Doctrin upon these three subjects (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Adam, Eve</hi> and the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Eden</hi>; together with those things which are interwoven or adherent to them. As to the first man <hi>Adam, Moses</hi> says he was formed, not out of Stones or Dragons Teeth, as others have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48367:25"/>
feigned concerning their men; but out of the dust or clay of the Earth; and when his Body was formed, <hi>God blew into his nostrils the breath of life, and man was made a living soul,</hi> Gen. 2.7.</p>
               <p>But after another manner and of other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was the Woman built (<hi>viz.</hi>) with one of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> small bones; for as <hi>Adam</hi> lay asleep, God took away one of his ribs, and out of that made <hi>Eve.</hi> The words of <hi>Moses</hi> are these, <hi>And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof: And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman and brought her unto the man for a wife,</hi> Gen. 2.21.</p>
               <p>So much for the forming of the first Man and first Woman according to the literal Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now <hi>Moses</hi> has likewise given us a large account of their first habitation; he says that God made them a certain famous Garden in the East, or as others render it <hi>ab antiquo,</hi> of old; and gave it to them as a Farm to cultivate and inhabit; which Garden was a most delightful place, watered with four several Fountains or Rivers, planted with Trees of all kinds, as well those that bore fruit as those that were agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for their shade and aspect. Amongst which Trees in the midst of the Garden, stood two more remarkable than the rest, whereof one was called the Tree of Life, the other the Tree of Death, or of the Knowledg of Good and Evil. Why one was called the Tree of Life is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48367:25"/>
not certain; perhaps because whoever had eat of it, would have from it received Immortality, as many conjecture. The effect of the other fatal experience has sufficiently taught us: <hi>Hino illae Lachrymae &amp; infandus dolor</hi>: 'Tis for our first Parents eating the fruit of this Tree that all their Posterity now smarts; and is punished for a crime committed some thousands of years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were born. But of this I'le here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you with a full relation.</p>
               <p>God upon pain of death prohibits <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> from tasting the fruit of this Tree; But it happened upon a time that <hi>Eve</hi> sitting solitarily under this Tree without her Husband, there came to her a Serpent or Adder, which, tho I know not by what means or power, civilly accosted the Woman (if we may judg of the thing by the event) in these words, or to this purpose.</p>

                  <p>What do I hear! who is that God that envies his Creatures the innocent delights of Nature? Nothing is sweeter, nothing more wholsom than this very fruit; why then should

he forbid it, unless he were in jest?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eve.</speaker>

                  <p>Undoubtedly you mistake his meaning: This Tree has nothing that would prove fatal to you, but rather something Divine and above the common force of nature.</p>

                  <p>Very well thought on; here's another for you; go to your Husband with it. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well happy young Woman. — In the mean<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>time i'le go my ways, let her take care of the rest.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Accordingly <hi>Eve</hi> gave this Apple to the too uxorious <hi>Adam,</hi> which he likewise eat off; when immediately upon their eating of it they became both (I know not how) ashamed of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness; and sowing together Fig-leaves made
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48367:26"/>
them a sort of Aprons to cover their <hi>Pudenda.</hi> Now after these transactions God did in the Evening descend into the Garden; upon which our first Parents fled to hide themselves among the thickest of the Trees; but in vain, for God called out, <hi>Adam,</hi> where art thou? When he trembling appeared before the Almighty, and said, Lord, when I heard thee in this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, I was ashamed because of my nakedness, and hid my self amongst the most shady parts of the thicket. Who told thee, said God, that thou wert naked? Have you eaten of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit? That Woman thou gavest me brought it, 'twas she that made me eat on't. You have finely order'd your business, you and your wife! Here, you Woman, what is this that you have done? Alas for me, thy Serpent gave me the Apple and I did eat of it.</p>
               <p>This Apple shall cost you dear, and not only you but your posterity and the whole race of Mankind. Moreover, for this crime I will curse and spoil the Heavens, the Earth and whole Fabric of Nature. But thou in the first place vile beast shalt bear the punishment of thy craftiness and malice. Hereafter shalt thou go creeping on thy belly, and instead of eating Apples shalt lick the dust of the Earth. As for you Mrs. <hi>Curious,</hi> who so much love De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies, in sorrow shall you bring forth Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; you shall be subject to your Husband, and shall never depart from his side unless ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving first obtained his leave. Lastly, as for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48367:27"/>
you <hi>Adam,</hi> because you have hearkened more to your Wife than to me, with the sweat of your brow you shall obtain your food both for her and her Children. You shall not gather fruits, which, as heretofore, grew of themselves, but shall reap the fruits of the Earth with labour and trouble. May the Earth, for thy sake ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed, hereafter grow barren; may she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thistles, thorns, tares, with other hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unprofitable herbs; and when thou hast here led a troublesom laborious life, <hi>Dust thou art, to Dust thou shalt return.</hi> In the mean while let these Rebels be banished out of my Garden, and sent as Exiles into strange Lands; least they also eat the fruit of the Tree of Life, and live for ever. However, for fear they should perish through the cold or inclemency of the Weather, the Almighty made them Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of the Skins of Animals, and being thus clad, he thrusts them out of Paradice. Finally, to prevent their return, he placed Angels at the entrance of his Garden, who by brandish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Flaming-sword, and waving it on all sides guarded the passage that led to the Tree of Life.</p>
               <p>This is the Summ and Substance of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Account concerning Paradice, and the first State of Minkind; which keeping always close to the Sense, I have explained in other words that we may more freely judge of the thing it self; as is it were written by a Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:48367:27"/>Now that there are in this Relation some things Parabolical, and, which will not bear a construction altogether, Literal, there are few but do allow. Nay, some proceed farther, and will have even the whole Discourse to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially figurative, in order to explain things that were really true (<hi>viz.</hi>) the new and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Condition of Mankind; as also para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disiac State of Infant Nature, and its Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy. For although in the beginning of the Discourse, this state of Paradice seems confin'd only to one Region, which is called <hi>Gan Eden,</hi> yet afterwards, when the Curse of Barrenness comes out, the whole Earth is brought in for a share. <hi>The Earth shall not for the future bring forth her increase of her own accord, nor any of her Fruits without Tillage and Husbandry; but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>with the Sweat of thy brow shalt thou get those things that are necessary for Life and Sustenance.</hi> Whence 'tis evident, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Alteration of Curse, the whole Earth yielded her Increase without Planting or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; for otherwise by this Curse nothing had been made new, nothing had been chang'd in the Face of Nature. Besides from another thing it plainly appears, that one small Country or some few Acres of Land, such as is a Garden, could not alone enjoy this Fertility, together with those other Priviledges as well of Air as Soil; but that the whole inhabitable Globe did partake of them in the primitive State of things. For suppose <hi>Adam</hi> had continued In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48367:28"/>
how would there have been room for his Posterity within the inclosures of one Garden? Or admit you will have them all shut up there, like so many unfledg'd Birds in a Nest, what must have been done with all those other vast Tracts of Earth? Should they have stood Empty, Desert, and without Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants?</p>
               <p>Nature it self does not allow of that, neither is it becoming the Divine Wisdom. From all these things we may conclude what is very agreeable to Reason <hi>(viz.)</hi> That <hi>Moses</hi> puts the part for the whole, and laid one Example before the Eyes of the People instead of a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; because it was more suitable to the Genius and Understanding of the Vulgar to conceive a pleasant Garden or single Field, than that the whole Globe of the Earth should put on a new Face and new Nature entirely different from what we now enjoy. But let us proceed in the Road we have begun.</p>
               <p>The aforesaid Relation consists of five or six parts, whereof the first is, concerning the Birth and Formation of the first of Mankind. The second, the Description of the Garden <hi>Eden.</hi> The third is, the History of the two Trees of Life and Death. The fourth treats of the Serpent's Conference with <hi>Eve.</hi> The fifth about the Wrath of God and his Curse for eating the forbidden Fruit. Lastly, the sixth contains the Expulsion of these first of Mankind out of the Almighty's Garden, as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48367:28"/>
also how God made them Coats of Skins, and placed Angels with flaming Swords at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of his Garden; together with other things hereto belonging.</p>
               <p>Great is the force of Custom and a precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Opinion over human Minds. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these short Observations or Accounts of the first Originals of Men and Things, which we receive from the Mouth of <hi>Moses,</hi> are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced without the least Demurr or Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. But had we read the same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin in another, for Example, in a <hi>Greek</hi> Philosopher, or in a Rabbinical or Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Doctor, we should have stop'd at every period with our mind full of Objections and Scruples. Now this difference does not arise from the Nature of the thing it self, or of the Matter in hand, but from the great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion we have of the Faithfulness and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Writer, as being divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired.</p>
               <p>All which we willingly acknowledge, neither do we in this occasion doubt of our Author's Authority, but with what intent it was that he wrote these Things, and what kind of Style he has made use of, whether <hi>Plebeian</hi> or <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical</hi>; I say, <hi>Plebeian</hi> and not Fabulous, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this last word might have been used, did we speak of a Prophane Author. Now of Fables, some are pure Fictions; others are built upon some Foundation, but beautified with Additions and acquired Ornaments. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48367:29"/>
there are some Relations that have Truth at the bottom, but not in every particular point of them; only as to the substance of the thing, and drift of the Author. As in Christ's Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and in many things which are related concerning the Day of Judgment, as to the outward shell and form. Such kind of Relations I think ought not to be termed Fables, but sometimes Parables, and sometimes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Hypotheses adapted to the Vulgar. And if in this rank you place the Narration we have now in hand, preserving always the good Name and Honour of the Author, I shall not think it amiss.</p>
               <p>But let us, if you please, first examin some Articles herein.</p>
               <p>As to the Temporal Rise of Mankind, I have ever held it most certain and undoubted: and that upwards of 5000 Years, according to the account given us by Sacred Chronology. But out of what Matter the first of Mankind, whether Male or Female was composed, is not so easily discover'd, nor of so great importance to know. If God had a Mind to make a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man start from one of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Ribs, 'tis true it seems to be a Matter not very proper, but however, out of any Wood, Stone or other Being God can make a Woman: And here, by the by, the Curious ask whether this Rib was useless to <hi>Adam,</hi> and beyond the number requisite in a compleat Body?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48367:29"/>If not, when it was taken away, <hi>Adam</hi> would have been a maim'd Person, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of a part of himself that was necessary. I say <hi>necessary,</hi> for as much as I suppose that in the Fabric of a Human Body nothing is superfluous, and that no one Bone can be taken away without endamaging the whole, or rendring it in some measure imperfect. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t if on the other side you say this Rib was really useless to <hi>Adam,</hi> and might be spared; so that you make him to have had only twelve Ribs on one side, and thirteen on the other; they will reply that this is like a Monster; as much as if the first Man had been created with three Feet or three Hands, or had had more Eyes or other Members than the use or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatness of an human Body requires. But in the beginning all Things were made with Number, Weight and Measure, that is to say, with all imaginable Exactness.</p>
               <p>For my part, I do not pretend to decide this dispute, but what more perplexes me is, how out of only one Rib the whole Mass of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Body could be built? For a Rib does not equal the hundredth, perhaps not the Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandth part of an entire Body. If you answer that the rest of the matter was taken from else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, certainly <hi>Eve</hi> might much more truly be said to have been formed out of that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed matter whatever it was, than out of <hi>Adams</hi> Rib.

way; for they say, the first man had two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the one male and the other female, whose sides stuck together, or (as some will have it) their Backs; that God cut them asunder, and having thus Cloven <hi>Eve</hi> from <hi>Adam,</hi> gave her to him for a Wife. <hi>Plato</hi> has in his <hi>Symposium</hi> something very like this Story, concerning his first man <hi>Androgynus,</hi> who was afterwards divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two parts, Male and Female. Lastly, others conjecture (which is not improbable) that <hi>Moses</hi> gave out this original of Woman to the end he might breed a mutual Love between the two Sexes as parts of one and the same whole; and that by this means he might more effectually recommend to his people his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Marriage (which does unite them a second time) as if it had been imprinted in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self. But leaving this Subject I will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten to something else.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48367:30"/>
this Garden may agree, for not to speak of that continual serenity of the Air, and spontaneous fertility of the place, even the very Rivers themselves afford a most perplexing, and as yet undecided Controversie both to Divines and Geographers as well Ancient as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern.</p>
               <p>Those Rivers are by <hi>Moses</hi> call'd <hi>Pishon, Gishon, Hiddekel</hi> and <hi>Perath,</hi> which the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Authors interpret by <hi>Ganges, Nile, Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates.</hi> Nor do I truly think with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some reason; for <hi>Moses</hi> seems to have proposed nothing more to himself than the bringing four of the most celebrated and most fertile Rivers of the whole Earth to the watring of his Garden. Ay but, say you, these four Rivers do not spring from the same source, or come from the same place; 'tis true, nor any other four Rivers that are named by the Interpreters. Wherefore this Objection <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>e Ancient as Modern Writers. But altho you should reduce these Rivers, only to two as some do, to <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> yet neither have these two Rivers the same Fountain-head, but this is really and truly an Evasion rather than an Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to reduce, contrary to the History of <hi>Moses,</hi> a greater number of Rivers to a smaller; only that they may the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be derived from the same Spring; for these are the words of <hi>Moses,</hi> but there
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48367:31"/>
                  <hi>Comes a River out of Eden to water the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and from thence it divides it self into four Branches: The Name of the first is Pishon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.10. Whereby it is apparent that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the entrance or <hi>Exit</hi> of the Garden, there were four Rivers; and that those four Rivers did proceed from one and the same Fountain-head in <hi>Eden.</hi> Now pray tell me in what part of the Earth is this Country of <hi>Eden,</hi> where four Rivers arise from one and the same Spring? But do not go about to say that only two came from that Fountain of <hi>Eden,</hi> and that the other two arose from the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> where they split near the Sea, and make as it were a Bifrontic Figure. Since this does by no means answer the words of <hi>Moses.</hi> Besides, he mentions in the first place <hi>Pishon</hi> and <hi>Gishon,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> as lesser Rivers; whereas you on the contrary will have those to be derived from these last <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Rivers of an inferior order; which is a manifest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storting the Historical Account. But to end all these Difficulties or Controversies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Originals and Channels of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that water'd Paradice, you will perhaps at last say that the Springs as well as the courses of Rivers have been changed by the Universal Deluge. And that we cannnot therefore be now certain where it was they formerly broke out of the Earth, and what Countries they passed through. For my part
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48367:31"/>
I am much of your opinion, provided you confess there happened in the Deluge such a fraction and disruption of the Earth as we suppose there did; for from only an Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Superabundancy of Waters such a change could never possibly happen. Besides, according to what Geography or Hydrogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy will you have <hi>Moses</hi> to describe these Rivers <hi>Antidiluvian,</hi> or <hi>Postdiluvian?</hi> If the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there has happened no considerable alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Earth since the time of <hi>Moses</hi> or the Flood; if the former, you then ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Moses</hi>'s description of the Earth altogether superfluous, and unuseful to find out the sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of Paradice. Lastly, 'tis hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that any Rivers, whether these or others, can have subsisted ever since the very first beginning of the World, whether you have regard to their Waters or to their Channels. The Channels of Rivers used to be made by little and little as well as by a daily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, for if they had been made, as Ditches and Furrows are, by Earth dug out and heaped up on each side, or at least on one side, there would certainly have been every where seen great Banks and Heaps of Earth. But we plainly perceive that this is only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous; forasmuch as they often run through Plains, and the River-banks are no more than level with the adjacent Fields, besides whence cou<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d there be had water at the first foundation of the World to fill these Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48367:32"/>
If you say that on the third day when the great Bed of the Ocean was made the smaller Channels of the Rivers were also; and as the greatest part of the Waters of the Abyss fell into the Gulf of the Seas; so the remaining part descended into these o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Channels, and therewith formed the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Rivers, admitting this, yet the Waters would be not only as Salt as those of the Sea, but there would be no continual Springs to nourish these Rivers; insomuch that when the first stream of Water had flow'd off, there being no fresh Supplys of Water to succeed it, these Rivers would have immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately been dried up: I say because there were no perpetual Springs, for whether Springs proceed from Rain, or from the Sea they could neither way have rose in so short a time; not from Rain for it had not as yet Rained, neither was it possible that in the small space of one day the Waters of the Abyss should run down from the most Inland places to the Sea, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning through ways that were never yet opened by them, should strain themselves through the Bowels of the Earth, and ascend to the heads of their Rivers. But of Rivers we have said enough, let us now proceed to the rest.</p>
               <p>We have in the third place a very strange account of a Serpent that talked with <hi>Eve,</hi> and enticed her to mistrust God. I must
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48367:32"/>
confess we have not yet known that this Beast could ever speak, or utter any sort of voice, besides hissing. But what shall we think <hi>Eve</hi> knew of this business? If she had taken it for a dumb Animal the very Speech of it would have so frightned her that she would not have durst to stay and enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Conference with it. If on the other side, the Serpent had from the beginning been capable of talking and haranguing, and only lost his Speech for the crime of having by his seducements corrupted the Piety and Faith of <hi>Eve</hi>; certainly <hi>Moses</hi> would have been far from passing over in silence this sort of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and instead of that have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so small a Penalty as that of licking the dust. But besides all this, pray will you have the particular Species of Serpents, or all the Beasts of the Field that were then in Paradise to have been indued with the faculty of speaking like the Trees in <hi>Dodona</hi>'s Grove? If you say all, pray what offence had the rest been guilty of, that they also must loose the use of their Tongues? if only the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Serpents enjoyed this priviledg, how came it about that so vile an Animal, and by nature the most averse and remote from Mankind, should before all his other fellow Bruits deserve to be Master of so great a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and benefit as that of Speech?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:48367:33"/>Lastly, since all discoursing and arguing include the use of Reason, by this very thing you make the Serpent a Rational Creature. But I easily imagin those who are great stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; for the Literal Interpretation will solve this difficulty another way: For, say they, under the shape of this Serpent was hid the Devil, or an Evil Spirit, who using the Mouth and Organs of this Animal, spoke to the Woman as it were with an human voice. But what Testimony, with Authority, have they for this? The most literal reading of <hi>Moses,</hi> which they so closely adhere to, does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press any thing of it; for what else does he seem to say, but that he attributes the sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of <hi>Eve</hi> to the natural craftiness of the Serpent, and nothing else? For, these are <hi>Moses</hi>'s words: Now the Serpent was more cunning than any Beast of the Field that the Lord God had made: (Afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues he) <hi>The Serpent said to the Woman, yea, hath God said</hi>—. But besides had <hi>Eve</hi> heard an Animal, by nature dumb, speak through the means of some Evil Spirit, she would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly with horror have fled from the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. When on the contrary she very familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receved it; they discoursed and argued very amicably together, as tho nothing new or asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing had happened; again, if you say, that all this proceded from the ignorance and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Woman, 'twould on the other side, have been but just, that some good Angels should
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48367:33"/>
have succoured a poor Ignorant weak Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, those Just Guardians of human affair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> would not have permitted so unequal a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict; for what if an Evil Spirit, crafty and knowing in business, had by his subtlety over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached a poor silly Woman, who had not as yet seen the Sun either rise or set, who was but newly come of the Mould, and wholly unexperienced in all things? Certainly a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who had so great a price set on her head, as the Salvation of all Mankind might well have deserved a Guard of Angels: Ay, but perhaps (you'l say) the Woman ought to have taken care not to violate a Law established up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of death: <hi>The day you eat thereof, you shall surely die,</hi> both you and yours; this was the Law. Die! what does that mean, says the poor ignorant Virgin, who as yet had not seen any thing dead, no not so much as a flower; nor had yet with her eyes or mind perceived the Image of death <hi>(viz.)</hi> Sleep or Night. But what you add concerning his Posterity and their Punishment that is not at all expressed in the Law. Now no Laws are ever to be distorted, but especially not those that are poenal. The punishment of the Serpent will also afford no inconsiderable question if the Devil transacted the whole thing under the form of a Serpent; or if he compell'd the Serpent to do or suffer those things, why did he pay for a crime commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Devil. Moreover as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48367:34"/>
and form of the punishment inflicted on the Serpent <hi>(viz.)</hi> that for the future he should go creeping on his Belly, it is not easie to be explained what that means. Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any one will say that the Serpent did before walk upright, or after the manner of four-footed Beasts; and if on the other side from the beginning he crept like our Modern Snakes, it may seem ridiculous to impose on this Creature as a Punishment for one single Crime, a thing which by nature he ever had before. But let this suffice for the Woman and Serpent, let us now go on to the Trees.</p>
               <p>I here understand those two Trees which stood in the middle of the Garden, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Tree of Life, and the Tree of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Good and Evil. The Tree of Life was (they'l tell you) so called, for that it would give Men a very long life. But by what follows in the same Relation we find that all our Forefathers before the Flood did without the help of this Tree attain to a very great Age. Besides, if the Longaevity or Immortality of Men had depended only upon one Tree, or its Fruit, what if <hi>Adam</hi> had not sinned? how could his Posterity, when they were diffused over the face of the whole Earth have been able to come and gather Fruit out of this Garden, or from this Tree? Or how could the product of one Tree have been enough for all Mankind?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48367:34"/>
As to the other Tree of the Knowledg of Good and Evil, it does not so plainly appear what was its vertue, or from whence it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that name: It seems by I know not what juice or other vertue, to have instilled into them a new sence of shame and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty; or, as it is expressed of Nakedness, as though before the Fall they had been wholly void of bashfulness in Venereal Pleasures; yet now adays in things of that kind even the most innocent have some sense of shame. I know not what St. <hi>Austin</hi> means, when he says, that in the first state and innocence of Mankind, Women would have conceived and brought forth without violating their <hi>Claustrum Virginale,</hi> the feed being immitted, and the Off-spring coming forth through the Pores, as do Virgins Monthly Purgations, and that the whole Act of Generation would have been performed without any sting or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, just as one hand rubs another. If these things were taken-exactly according to the Rules of Nature and Philosophy they would be very difficult to solve. But God seems to intimate quite another Vertue in this Tree, when he says, <hi>Behold Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil (viz.)</hi> by the force and Vertue of the Fruit which he had eaten. Now certainly whatever heat or transport arises from a vicious, inordinate Motion, is so far from making us like God, that it on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48367:35"/>
renders us but the more dissimular to him.</p>
               <p>Having thus therefore spoken sufficiently concerning the Trees, let us next proceed to the rest: Now after the eating this Apple, Fig or whatever other Fruit it was, our Parents made themeselves Aprons: For, says the Text, they sewed together Fig-leaves, and therewith made themselves Aprons. From whence you may deduce the Original of the Taylors Trade, but where had they Needles? And where their Thread that very first Day of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? since the Thread-makers Art was not yet found out, nor yet the Art of Working in Iron. All which Questions may perhaps be thought a little too free, but the thing it self requires us to deal freely, when we are seeking for naked Truth. When they had thus made themselves Aprons, God gave them likewise Coats made of the Skins of Animals: But here again we run into other Difficulties, wherefore to soften the Thing, let us suppose an Angel to have been in the place of God, that 'twas an Angel who killed and flead the Animals, or pull'd off their Skins whilst they were yet alive and Innocent. Notwithstanding this too smells more of the Butcher or Executioner, than of an Angel. Besides, through this Butchery some entire Species of Animals must necessarily have perish'd; for 'tis not believed that from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning there were more than two of each kind created, and one alone, without another for its
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48367:35"/>
Consort, could never have produced any Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring. After all this what follows? Why God expell'd our Parents thus cloath'd out of Paradise, and placed at the Entrance of the Garden, Cherubims with a great two-handed flaming Sword, that continually waved about the same, for fear least either by open force or by stealth they might have repossest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves again of those happy Mansions. Now is there any one of the Interpreters that will put an exact literal Construction upon these Things? that will make Angels to have stood like Centinels, with drawn Swords before the Doors of the Garden, for I know not how many Ages, as Dragons are feign'd by the Poets? To have guarded the Apples of the <hi>Hesperides?</hi> But how long did this Angelical <hi>Corps du Guard</hi> last? To the Flood, I suppose, if not longer. So that you here suppose the Angels to have been for above Fifteen Hundred Years employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in keeping a Garden. <hi>Sic vacat exiguis Rebus adesse Deos?</hi> How much easier would it have been, in a place so well watered as Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, to have Fenced the Garden about with a River? which to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> who were as yet ignorant of the manner either of Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or conducting Boats and Vessels, would have been a more than sufficent Obstacle: But these, and other Things of this Nature, least they should be thought to savour of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, I had rather leave for others to reflect upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:48367:36"/>Thus have we in short run over the chief Heads of the History of Paradise; the only thing now remaining to be consider'd, is, in how short a time all these things are said to have been transacted, in one Days time, or perhaps, but in half a Day. Divines suppose <hi>Adam</hi> to have consummated his Marriage with <hi>Eve</hi> the first Night; afterwards, say they, if <hi>Eve,</hi> whilst she was yet Innocent, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her first Born, she would have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise brought him forth Innocent and Free from all blemish of Sin: Whence also his whole Progeny, in Relation to the Father's side, would have continued unspotted with it. But there is none of that sort of Progeny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted, or so much as half pure, we are all of us tainted with the same Blemish, have all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame Disease. Wherefore we must necessarily suppose all these Things to have been done on the sixth Day of the Creation, before their lying together, or the Embraces of their Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Bed. How many therefore, and how great Things must we heap on this one Day! We will, if you please, briefly run them over. That Day did God create all manner of Cattle, all manner of wild Beasts, and all sorts of creeping Things: Lastly, he created <hi>Adam</hi>; and when he had created all these things, he brought each kind of Animal before <hi>Adam,</hi> that to every one of them he might give a name according to their several Faculties. As for me, what Language <hi>Adam</hi> could speak the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48367:36"/>
first Hour or Day of his Nativity, I am whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of; but however it be, since there are so many different Ranks and Familles of Animals, to weigh and consider well the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of each, and afterwards to give them a name adapted to it, seems a Task that requires no small time. Again, when all this work was in some manner finished, God cast <hi>Adam</hi> into a deep sleep, and whilst he was snoring, took from him a Rib out of which he built a Woman: The same Day these new born Man and Woman commit Matrimony without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or the formal Preliminaries of Wooing. And that very same Day Mistress Bride be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to I know not what intent, pleased to ramble among the Groves of the Garden, happened to meet with the Serpent: This Serpent begins a Discourse with her; they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue on one side and t'other, about a certain Tree and eating, or not eating a certain Fruit. She at length overcome by his Reasons, or seducing Expressions, eats of this Fruit; and not only that, but carries it to her Husband, who likewise eat of it. Upon this there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a great alteration, they cast their Eyes on each other's Nakedness, are ashamed, and make themselves Aprons of Fig-leaves sew'd together.</p>
               <p>When things being in this Posture, God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty in the Evening descends into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; they conscious of their own Guilt fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and abscond themselves among the Trees
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48367:37"/>
and shady Coverts; but all in vain; for God Summons the Criminals, they appear, and upon Examination of the whole Cause, he Decrees to the Man, Woman and Serpent the several Punishments they had merited. Lastly, to fulfil all parts of the Punishment, our Parents are cast out of Paradice, and sent into Exile: When several Angels being placed at all the Avenues of the Garden, they are forced to wander alone among the Woods, and take up their Lodging among the Wild Beasts. All which things we read to have been done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the small space of one day; truly a very considerable and very numerous piece of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But I cannot bear to see, that in so short time all Things were inverted and put into a total Disorder; and that the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which had but just now been composed and polished, should, before the first time of the Suns setting, fall to Ruin and Confussion: In the Morning God said all things were good; and in the Evening of the same Day, all things are accursed. Alas! how fleeting and unconstant is the Glory of Things created! A work that was six days e'er it could be elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and brought to perfection, and that by an Omnipotent Architect to be thus in as few Hours ruined by so vile a Beast. Now this is a faithful Account of Matter of Fact contain'd in the History of Paradice and Creation of Mankind, as also of the time wherein each Part of the said History was produced: All
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48367:37"/>
which things when I revolve in my Mind, which is wholly unbyass'd and ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply on every side, where right Reason and the Love of Truth conduct me: I cannot be angry with those of the Fathers and ancient Writers who have endeavoured to convert these things into Symbols, Parables or ways of discoursing adapted to the Vulgar. But am angry with <hi>Celsus,</hi> who calls this account an old Wive's Tale; upon which <hi>Origen</hi> tells him very well by way of answer, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that these things were spoken in a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Sence. However <hi>Celsus</hi> himself does in what follows acknowledge that the fairest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters both among the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> were ashamed of the literal Sence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accommodated them to Allegories. Hence you may see, that in the first Ages of the Christian Church (at which time <hi>Celsus</hi> lived) as also among the <hi>Iews</hi> before Christ's Birth, the more candid Interpreters deviated from the literal Reading of <hi>Moses</hi>'s History. And really it seems a very cruel and very hard thing in this Respect that God should be said to have tormented, nay and ruined Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind for so small a Fault, and that too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted through the Levity of a Womans Mind. Wherefore some are of an Opinion (which I am not much averse to) That <hi>Moses</hi> laid so vast a Punishment on so small a Crime, only to the end he might procure the greater Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48367:38"/>
and Authority to his own Laws, which often Decree with the strictest Severity things Frivolous, and in their own Nature, Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. For who would not fear to violate the most petty, inconsiderable Precept that comes in the Name of God, if the eating of one Forbidden Apple could bring perdition to all Mankind? But upon these and the other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Narration, let every one enjoy his own Sentiments, provided he do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Foundation.</p>
               <p>Now by Foundation I here mean the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Temporal Rise of Mankind, as well as of this Earth, the Degeneration of both; and that Mankind will be redeemed by the Seed of a Woman. In this blind State of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality we are all prone to Error; and among the Duties of Charity, 'tis not the least for us to indulge and succour one another when we are Erroneous. For my own part, I call God to Witness (who knows our most secret Thoughts) that in this or any other Writing I never proposed more to my self, than the promotion of Piety founded upon Truth.

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Concerning the Original of Things, as they are Expounded in the First Chapter of <hi>Genesis;</hi> together with the Manner of Interpreting <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Hexaemeron,</hi> that is to say, his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Creation performed in Six Days.</head>
               <p>WHAT Reflections we have made in the foregoing Chapter about the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals of Things, chiefly respect Mankind, as also their Causes and primary State. But the Original of Things inanimate and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, as <hi>Moses</hi> describes it in the First Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> seems no less contrary to the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of the Earth. This Account therefore which <hi>Moses</hi> gives us of the World, being much ancienter than all those others before mentioned, we ought to examin it the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, and so to compose or dilute these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies by a friendly Interpretation, that Truth (which is alike necessary to each of them) may at the same time inviolably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hexaemeron</hi> and Theory ('tis true) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in their first Foundation of Things: For as they both suppose the Chaos to have been the matter out of which the World was Built.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48367:39"/>
So they likewise agree in their general Order, making the World to have been first inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and then afterwards animated. But, as to the rest, for Example, the Form an Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the created World, as also the manner, time and other Things, they do not a little differ; all which we must now at large exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</p>
               <p>'Tis <hi>First,</hi> therefore to be observed, what Form and what Limits of the World the <hi>Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emeron</hi> has proposed to its self. Now 'tis well known, that betwixt the Learned and the Vulgar there are two different Systems of the World, whereof one supposes the Sun to be the Center, and t'other the Earth. Quaere then upon which of these two Systems is <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Hexaemeron</hi> grounded? 'Tis most certain, that <hi>Moses</hi> has begun his Work from the Earth, as the Basis or Foundation of the whole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine; and that he did not produce the Sun (according to what he says) till the 4th Day, at which time the Structure of the Earth and Sea was already finish'd. The Sun was not therefore the Center of the whole Work, since it had no Being till the work was half brought to Perfection. Besides, as well the Sun as the rest of the heavenly Bodies, are by <hi>Moses</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to have been created meerly for the use of the Earth, and in a manner but as so many servile Bodies, whose only business was to measure out to us the Days, Years and the rest of the several Season. But according to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48367:40"/>
the other Hypothesis, the Sun and fixed Stars are not only very great, but also very noble Bodies; bearing the first Rank amongst the various Parts of the Universe, and being as it were the Foundations of that prodigious Mass. 'Tis evident therefore from both these Reasons, that <hi>Moses</hi> has followed the popular System; that which most pleases the People, which most flatters our Senses, is believed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, or at least seems to be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the greater number: And in so doing he rightly consulted the public Safety; when neglecting Philosophy, he adhered to more serious Counsels and Reasons of greater weight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Since it is evident that the Earth was the Center of this <hi>Mosaic</hi> Chaos, 'tis next to be enquired after, how far upwards thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> blind and confused Mass did reach. The <hi>Hexaemeron</hi> truly seems to suppose that this Chaos filled and possessed the whole Universe how great soever, together with all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Regions of the Air, which way so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were diffused; as also that the brightest and most resplendent Stars were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of this chaotic Matter, neither that there were any before the Birth and Creation of this our Earth. Which is what the very Letter of the <hi>Hexaemeron</hi> seems to import, and absolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the Nature of Things, as well as to all Philosophical Reasons. 'Tis most certain that the fixed Stars are fiery Bodies; that they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48367:40"/>
do not all rest upon the same Superficies; being some more remote from the Earth, and more profoundly immers'd in the Heavens, than others; and that upon this score there can be no common Center assigned to all of them at least, to believe our modern Earth (a blind and sordid particle of the Universe, inferiour to each of the fixed Stars, as well in bulk as in dignity) to be the Heart, the most noble and most vital Part of so vast a Body, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether irrational and repugnant to the Nature of Things. I speak it again with Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that to say, or almost to think, that this Earth, the Dregs, the meer Scum of Nature, is the Supream Head of all Things, and as it were the first born Product of the whole Creation cannot be without an Abuse and Scandal, as well to the Operator as to the Work. Besides if that earthyly Chaos had been extended throughout the vast Face of the Universe, and that this Earth were the only Center in which all the grosser parts convened, the same Earth or middle Body, being the common Recepticle of all the grosser Parts, would have grown up to a bulk infinitely big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than this little Earth of ours. For that the sublunary Chaos (or which reaches to the Moon) is of it self sufficient to make up this Earth; and if to this you add the whole vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Heaven, and those spaces above the Heavens, which are not obvious to our Senses, but surpass all our imagination: Neither the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48367:41"/>
Sun nor any visible Body is of so great a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude as would be that Body composed in the midst of the Chaos. Moreover, that as well the corporeal as the incorporeal World is more ancient than this inhabitable Earth, may in some measure be proved out of Ecclesiastical Authors, if we strictly examin the thing.</p>
               <p>Many Fathers of the Christian Church were of Opinion, that before the Earth or <hi>Mosaic</hi> World, there had been Angels for many Ages unknown to us; and some also mention the same of the highest Heaven or Firmament. But this Opinion of the Angels is a thing more positively asserted, and by a greater number. Not to speak of <hi>Origen,</hi> St. <hi>Basilius</hi> says this in his <hi>Hexaemeron; Chrysostom.</hi>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48367:41"/>
served God.</hi> In the Book <hi>de Trinitate</hi> (whether it was written by <hi>Novatian</hi> or <hi>Tertullian</hi>) as well the Angelical World as the spaces above the Firmament, are said to have been made before the <hi>Mosaical</hi> World, in these words; <hi>Although in the higher Regions</hi> (viz.) <hi>those above the Firmament it self he did before institute Angels, spiritual Vertues, Thrones and Powers, as also create many other vast Tracts of the Heavens,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Insomuch that this World appears rather to be the last Work of God, than his sole and only one.</hi> To which Passage adds <hi>Damelius.</hi> — Novatian <hi>was not only of this Opinion, but also St.</hi> Jerom <hi>together with all the</hi> Greeks, <hi>that the Angels were sooner instituted,</hi> (viz.) <hi>before any part of the Creation of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent World.</hi> Lastly, <hi>Cassian</hi> tells us, <hi>That this was the common Opinion of the Catholics in his time</hi>; which was at the beginning of the fifth Age: <hi>Whereof</hi> (says he) <hi>none of the Faithful doubt.</hi> And having more fully explained this generally received Opinion, he afterwards adds, <hi>'Tis most certain and undoubted, that God created all those Celestial Powers before that Temporal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Creation.</hi> But to remove all doubt concerning the preexistence of Angels, we have the very words which the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self spake to <hi>Iob,</hi> chap. 38.4, <hi>&amp;c. Where were thou when I said the Foundations of the Earth: when the morning Stars sang my praises, and all the Sons of God shouted for joy?</hi> Whereupon says <hi>Olympiodorus,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. 'Tis plain from this
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48367:42"/>
Passage, that in the Creation of the World the Angels were first made. Forasmuch as these words certainly imploy that before the Foundations of the Earth were laid, there were Angels, and that they sang praises to God at the first Building of our World. Likewise if you take the Morning Stars according to the very Letter, it is most certain that the Stars and Heavens also preceded the Foundation of our Earth.</p>
               <p>Besides, St. <hi>Ierom</hi> makes intellectual Beings pre-existent to the World by those Passages of Scripture, where something is said to have been done, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> We can evince the same by the Sacred Oracles and Authority of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as well as by Reason and Arguments. The Fall of the Angels was before the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, therefore they were before creat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, and that for some Ages. For really 'tis not at all probable that the most excellent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48367:42"/>
were made of so frail a nature, as that on the very day of their birth they should fall into evil and misery; neither is it consistent with the <hi>Deus, Opt. Max.</hi> the kind Father of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Beings, to place the most noble part of his work in so slippery a station, that no sooner had their Maker taken his hand from off them, but they immediately fell head-long into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; damned to the utmost of torments, and a most dismal Hell. Which being thus stated, let us pass on from the Angels to the Corporeal World; wherein we are first to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, That if the Angels had not any ways been united with matter, nor had from it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any pleasure, or any sort of perception, it could scarce have been possible that they should have been wrested from their habitations and first state: For pray where were the places that these pre-existent Angels did inhabit? <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silius</hi> says, they dwelt in the Heavens and Light<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Many of the Ancients did (as is well known) attribute to the Angels, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thin Bodies, and not gross Terrestrial ones like ours. And the second <hi>Nicene</hi> Council would have this Doctrin proposed out of the Book of <hi>Iohn</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> to be confirmed; these are the words: Concerning the Angels, Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and their Powers, to which I also joyn our own souls: This is the opinion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church; that they are 'tis true intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, yet not wholly Incorporeal and Invisible, as you <hi>Gentiles</hi> say, but endowed with a thin
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48367:43"/>
and Aerial or Fiery Body; as it is written, <hi>Who makes his Angels Spirits, and those that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster unto him a flaming fire.</hi> This we know to have been the opinion of many Holy-Fathers, amongst whom are <hi>Basilius,</hi> Sirnamed the Great, St. <hi>Athanasius, Methodius,</hi> and those that follow them; not that they suppose Angels to be Bodies, but like human Souls to be inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with Bodies; yet not such as are moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up of the same Clay, with our Modern ones, but thin and pure like Air or Fire: Of the same nature as those we shall one day have, when we come to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> equall to the Angels.</p>
               <p>Lastly, those who interpret that passage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Angels joyning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the Daughters of Men (which not a few of the Fathers and others do) must necessarily assert that the Angels have Bodies, proper and agreeable to their own nature, from all which we may conclude that together with the Angels some Coelestial Matter did exist before the Earth. But of whatever kind this thin, subtle and lucid Matter was it could not exist by it self, and before the remaining part of the Mass of Matter. For all Matter was together, and at once produced out of Nothing. Neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay we conceive the action of the Creation as divided into parts and distant ages; whilst the rest of the Regions and Tracts of the World remained empty. For my part if
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48367:43"/>
an Atom, or the smallest Particle of Matter existed before the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Epocha, I am of opinion that the whole Mass of the Universe did the same; and by the same Rule, if that Angelical Matter, or Vehicle of the Angels preceded the beginning of the Earth, all Matter in general did (as the <hi>Greek</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers argue) in some measure precede it; but its disposition and order according to its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts, scituations and forms have by the Decree of Providence been from time to time varied sometimes after one manner, and sometimes after another. Thus by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Fathers we have hitherto trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the pre-existence of Angels and of Matter it self, as it hath a connection with the Angels; let us now therefore return to the nature of things, and to the visible World; for in the Corporeal we have as many Arguments to confirm the same anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Matter; and to sufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate that the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Epocha of about six thousand years, does not comprehend the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of the whole Universe, but the Age of our present Earth, and the time since it was formed out of its Chaos. If we again consider the <hi>Phaenomenaes</hi> of the Heavens, and the Companies of both erring and fixed Stars, we shall easily believe that so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a progeny, and which was worthy of a better Parent, could not be the off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>spring of one Earthly Chaos; nor admit of their Ages
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48367:44"/>
and Histories being included within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of so small a time, wherefore let us, if you please, call to mind a thing which is now no longer doubted of (<hi>viz.</hi>) that the Earth is a Planet; and that besides the Earth there are many Planets of the same nature, as well as of a like matter and form. All which, 'tis probable, have had the same manner and principle of birth; that is, every one out of its own Chaos. Moreover, since the Creation of the Earth, we have not seen the birth of any one new Planet; for which reason cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they are all either older than the Earth, or as old now. If you grant the former, 'tis all we desire; and if you make them of the same age with the Earth, you must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose as many Chaos's as there are Primary Planets since; for example, 'tis certain, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> who wheels about his own Satellites or Tendours, is a Center to himself, and does not any ways depend on our Earth, as do none of the rest, except it be the <hi>Moon.</hi> Again, the fixed Stars seem ancienter than the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and to be each of them the Center of its own Orb or Vortex; as many Systems therefore must be constituted in the Heavens as there are fixed Stars; which being very great both as to number and bulk, would swallow up this little point of Earth, as if it were less than nothing; wherefore whoever has any favour for the Heavens, and is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biassed observer of God's Works, will not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48367:44"/>
consent to have their Originals deduced from the Earth, or dependent on it.</p>
               <p>Lastly, 'tis probable that the Planets were formerly fixed, and that the Earth it self ought to be numbred in the same rank, 'twill be no easie matter for you to solve the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of the Planets by any other Hypothesis; at least, not if they have fire in their Center, which 'tis very probable they have. Besides we sometimes see the face of the Sun overgrown with thick spots, and perceive him for some days pale, obscure, and as it were in the pangs of death; but he that is sick may die; and what happens to one may happen to others of the same kind (now all the fixed Stars are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous) therefore the fixed Stars are perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Now a fixed Star perishes, and is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished when being crusted over with a thick shell of scurf which it cannot break through, it degenerates into an obscure and opake body, such as is a Planet. Finally, the new Stars that have of late years appeared in the Heavens, have not, 'tis probable, I mean in respect to their Originals, had any connection or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the Earth; neither have the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, which, although in some things they are dubious and hard to be explained, do to me seem nothing else, but (as one may say) the dead bodies of the fixed Stars, unburied, and not as yet composed to rest, they like shadows wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up and down through the various Regions of the Heavens, till they have found out fit
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48367:45"/>
places for their residence, which having pitck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon they stop their irregular course, and being turned into Planets move Circularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout some Star. Whereas, if according to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hypothesis, Comets are held to have been just the same from the beginning, they take such vast Tours, make such immense Circles and Periods, that no man can prove we ever saw the same Comet twice in one and the same part of its circuit. These and the like <hi>Phaenomenaes</hi> of the Heavens can hardly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out using some violence to the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be reduced to an Epocha of six thousand years. We should much rather confess that our Earth had not the same Original, nor is of the same age with the whole Universe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Intellectual or Corporeal. Nor is it to be wondered at, that <hi>Moses</hi> did not distinguish them, or treat of the Original of the Universe apart, from that of our Sublunary World; since the common people never distinguish these things, nor have any separate Idaea of them. The greatest part of Mankind esteems the remaining part of nature, and of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse only as an Appendix of our World or Earth, worth nothing of it self, but created meerly for our use and benefit. 'Twas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not without much reason, that our most wise Law giver left it to the Philosophers as their business, that when human understanding was through age, use and observations come to a greater maturity, they might digest the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48367:45"/>
Works of God into another Method adapted to the Divine perfections and nature of things. But enough of this Subject, let us now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to something else.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Moses</hi> in his <hi>Hexaemeron</hi> mentions a famous <hi>Phaenomena</hi> whereof we have not any appearance, I mean his Waters above the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, in the making or disposing of which he tells us God spent one entire day; which is no less time than he imployed about the Sun, Moon and all the Host of Heaven! 'Tis true, these Noble Bodies deservedly claim to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves twentyfour Hours labour, but to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure unknown thing we cannot but grudg so much work. Let us make a search therefore after these invisible Waters, let us enquire what are the places they now possess, or where they have formerly resided. <hi>Moses</hi> says, they were placed above the Firmament; but the Sun with the rest of the Stars he mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to be in the Firmament: Thus he places those Waters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the Stars, and the Starry Heaven, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless of these and all things else he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the Earth to be the Center; but since the Waters are heavier than the Coelestial Matter, and than even the very air it self, how is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for them to stay in the highest Regions, not being sustained by any intermediate Bodies of a grosser kind? St. <hi>Austin</hi> in this matter forbids us having recourse to the Divine Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence when in treating on the same subject he thus very gravely and much to the purpose

admonisheth us, neither let any one say, that according to the Almighty Power of God to whom all things are possible, we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Waters, thus heavy as we know and feel them to be, are diffused above the Heavenly Body in which are the Stars; for now we ought to examin by his Scriptures, how God has instituted the natures of things, not how he is pleased to operate according to his Miraculous Omnipotence; and this agrees with what he has more generally taught us elsewhere, God does after such manner ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister all the things he has Created, that he suffers them to be exercised and governed by their own motions. Let your judgment then go according to these Rules. Besides, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose these I know not what kind of Waters had been above the highest Heavens, what had it signified to the people to know this Mystery? 'tis remote from <hi>Moses</hi>'s custom, and what he proposed to himself to relate in his <hi>Hexaemeron</hi> invisible, abstruse things which were of no use when known; He in that only traces the <hi>Phaenomenaes</hi> of the visible World, which strike upon the eyes of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and make them sensible that there must be a Creator; whereas those things which are no way apparent, as they need no Author, so neither do they require any explanation. And therefore some have thought it proper to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret these Waters above the Firmament, as it were watry Clouds, and to that end they esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48367:46"/>
two Firmaments, an upper and a lower; the former is that where the Stars reside, the latter that wherein the Vapours, Clouds and Meteors roul about; that is to say, they call by the name of Firmament, the space that lies between the Earth, and the middle Region of the air. But according to this solution, pray what did God Almighty create the second day, a little extension or space? The distance which is between us and the Clouds; but that distance did before exist, being not only extended to the middle Region of the Air, but even to the very highest Heaven; whether you suppose the newly Created Light, or the Chaos to have been interposed. What a business then is it to create distance; besides to create distance the second day which did <hi>exit</hi> the first? Neither is there according to this Proposition any solid fence or enclosure admitted in the fluid Heavens. But that we may further confute this Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let us hear <hi>Moses</hi>'s own words: <hi>The second day</hi> (says he) <hi>God said let there be a Firmament in the midst of the Waters, and let it divide the Waters from the Waters</hi>; that is the Superiour from the Inferiour, these Waters therefore as well the one as the other did exist before this <hi>Interaqueous</hi> Firmament was made. For there can be no bound or seperation but of things that do already exist. Tell me then what or where were these Superiour Waters before this Seperation was made, they seem to have before been one continued Mass, and after to have
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48367:47"/>
been by this partition divided into two different Stories. But before all this there were neither Rain nor Clouds; if therefore you will have these to be the Superiour Waters this does not answer <hi>Moses</hi>'s words. Finally, 'twould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous to suppose Clouds before the Earth; or to imagin these coagulations of Vapours, which perish and are renewed each day, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable enough to take up the sixth part of the Almighties vast Work. The thing in short comes to this; the vulgar do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the natural Generation of Rain by the condensation of Vapours, but fancies rain is sent down from Heaven by a Divine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse, or comes immediately from God, <hi>Moses</hi> to favour this opinion goes and makes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Receptacle for the Waters above the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; so that God by opening or shutting his Flood gates might at his pleasure keep up or let down the Rain; this I take to have been the mind and intent of the Sacred Author as to his Super coelestial Waters. And this is the best way to keep up the dignity of <hi>Moses,</hi> if whenever he deviates from the Physical Truth, we suppose him to do it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by adapting his History of the Creation to the capacity and use of the common people. Thus also when he treats of light in the first day of the Creation, that <hi>Phoenomena</hi> is equally uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being explained by any Physical reason; but least God should seem to work three days in the dark, <hi>Moses</hi> thought it was convenient to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48367:47"/>
produce light at the beginning of the work. But what sort of a light was it? A light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any source, without any original from whence it might be derived. Yet light, to argue Philosophically, always flows from some Center wherein is the Heart and Principle of its Motion. Nevertheless in this Account of the Creation, Light is produced before any distinction of the Heavens into Orbs or <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex</hi>'s. Besides, according to the literal read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God seems to have rested from his work in the Night time, as Men are used to do; but I do not see how another Haemisphere ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Celestial or Terrestrial could be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if there was any intermission of the work, and God acted only where there was light. But the Vulgar never regard these little Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties, nor do they dream of Antipodes or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hemisphere; conceiving the World to be like a Tent, whose covering is Heaven, and foundation the surface of the Earth. Next comes the third Days Task, wherein the Original of the Ocean is described, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, purely according to the Capacity of the Vulgar, in these words, <hi>Let the Waters be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry Land appear.</hi> Now the dry Land he called Earth, and the gathering together of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he called Seas; this gathering together of the Waters to uncover the Face of the Earth, which lay hid under the Abyss, could not be effected any more than two ways (<hi>viz.</hi>) either
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48367:48"/>
by an accumulation of the Waters in certain places, so as that others might remain empty; or else by hollowing the Earth, which was under the Abyss, in certain places, so as that the Waters might subside there. But that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation could not make the Channel of the Ocean, wherefore all the Interpreters say, it was made by a hollowing of the Earth, and that the Waters being drawn down, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated there, the Earth was deprived of them in other places. They also tell you, that the Mountains were made of this work (<hi>viz.</hi>) with the Earth, which was dug out of this Channel of the Sea, and heaped up in diven places. Now what can be plainer than this Original of the Ocean and Mountains, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you do not too much play the Critic, and forbear too nice a scrutiny: These things therefore must have pleased and satisfied the People who do not trouble themselves about niceties. But if any one has a Mind to make a more exact Enquiry into these Things, he may if he plases, consult what is written on this Subject in <hi>Theor. l.</hi> 1. c. 8, 9. <hi>and last</hi>; in which last Chapter by various Reasons and manifest Tokens, it is demonstrated that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Channel of the Ocean, nor the first inhabitable dry Land, could proceed from this Original. But it would not be worth my while to repeat the same here, or to add any more upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:48367:48"/>So much for the first three Days of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Creation, in which if our Author had passed by the first and second Days Task (<hi>viz.</hi>) that glimmering Light and those Waters above the Firmament; and had put his ninth verse immediately after his second, his World or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitable Orb had been never the more defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: But because he had resolved (at least as I suppose) to hold and consecrate the seventh Day for a Sabbath, it was necessary for him to spin out his Creation to six Days: That with the remembrance of the Worlds being finished, and after the Example of God's rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from all manner of Work, the seventh Day might be for ever solemnly observed. But the Tasks of each of these days are extreamly unequal, the first days work would have been finished in the twinkling of an Eye; and so in my Opinion the second: Whereas the third days Task would have been a vast and tedious piece of Business. First to cut out so large a Channel as is that of the Sea; then to draw off all the Waters that covered the Surface of the Earth, or rather to force them down into that Channel; I say force, since they would not fall down towards the Sea of their own accord, there being as yet no Channels to convey the Rivers, nor Descents of the Earth to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rry them down in those places where the new Mountains or heaps of Earth newly dug up were fixed, the Waters would be thrown off, and the same proportion of them fall
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48367:49"/>
down into the Pit of the Sea: But in all other places if no violence were used to them, they would remain unmoveable upon the Face of the Earth. However, although you suppose them to have run down with the same rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity as Rivers do. Yet from some of the most Inland Places, 'twould be several Days Journey to the Sea. The fourth days Task seems no less la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Sun, Moon and Stars: Good God, how many and vast Bodies did that one day produce and perfect! Even in the making each of the Planets there ought to be six Days imploy'd, as well as about this of ours, they being of the same Form (and as we have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe) their Ornaments and Equipage not very unlike: Besides, according to the order of Things in the Creation, they being terrestrial Bodies, ought all to have been thrown into the third days work; especially the Moon, which could scarce be torn from its Center the Earth, and transferred into another Glass. But <hi>Moses</hi> follows the Philosophy of the Vulgar, and joyns the Moon with the Sun, as though they were of like Nature and Magnitude. Lastly, the fifth and sixth Days Tasks consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of great variety: In these two days were built the Bodies of all the Birds, all the Fishes and all the Beasts, both great and small that were produced out of the Earth and Waters. Now adays the Bodies of Animals arrive more slowly at perfection; nor do I wonder at it, since they are so artificially composed. But
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48367:49"/>
seeing the Bodies of Animals even to the small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est are of so exquisite a Form and Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I shall never be induced to believe that the Earth, the common Mother of all things, was from the beginning of the World, as ruinous an ill shapen Mass as now it is. But this by the by.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Austin</hi> would have all those Things that are said to be the work of six Days, to have been created in one Moment; although <hi>Moses</hi> divided them into Classes and different Times that he might the better help the imagination of the People, to comprehend the first Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals of Things. God Almighty did in my Opinion create out of nothing in one moment, and by one individual act, all Substance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intellectual or corporeal. Nor did St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> in that come wide of the mark.</p>
               <p>But here is not (in the reality of the thing) spoken of Substance in general, but only of the terrestrial World; and not of its Creation, but its Formation. As for the Creation of all Things out of nothing, or out of no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent Matter, 'tis what cannot be doubted, as also that they were not from Eternity; (for we cannot form to our selves any Idea of a thing created from Eternity) but to prescribe the divine Creation so short an <hi>Epocha,</hi> as the limits of Six Thousand Years, 'tis what I never durst. I had rather leave that together with several other Things amongst the hidden secrets of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:48367:50"/>Now these short Annotations upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Moses</hi> gives us of the first Creation of Things, seems to imply that it was not this Sacred Author's design to represent the beginning of the World, exactly according to the Physical Truth (which would have been of no use to the common People who were uncapable of being made Philosophers) but to expound the first Originals of Things after such a method as might breed in the Minds of Men Piety, and a worshipping of the true God. And foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as all the ancient Nations <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans, Phaenicians, Aegyptians, &amp;c.</hi> had each of them their several Accounts of the Creation of the World, placed as an introduction before their Histories or Systems of Divinity; so <hi>Moses</hi> in like manner being to write Laws and Institutions for the <hi>Israelites,</hi> thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient also to prefix, as an introductory Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, an Account not only of the Original of his own Nation, but even of the whole World. However, whereas the Heathens Accounts of the Creation were frequently stuffed with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and I know not how many Gods and Goddesses, to the very great Corruption of Religion, he laying aside all those Fooleries has handled this Subject with a great deal of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Innocence. When that he might tear up the very Roots of Idolatry, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the Heavens, Sun, Moon and Stars, which were the chief Deities of other Nations, not as eternal or created on their own account,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48367:50"/>
but as subservient to this sublunary World, as well as to the use of Mankind.</p>
               <p>This to me seems the Scope of our Holy Writer; but if we seek only after pure naked Truth, and a physical Theory, we must go quite upon another Foundation; that is, we must (if I am not mistaken) suppose the World, which began near upon six Thousand Years ago; to have been no other than the sublunary Orb, or our Earth together with its Sky; and that Chaos from whence it arose, not to have been universal or diffused over the vast spaces of the Heavens, but contained within the aforesaid bounds, which are what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is below the Moon. Likewise the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Earth did not arise out of that Chaos in the same Form as <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ses</hi> had represented it: For his Description of it was just according to what the People had before their Eyes, which was the <hi>Post diluvian</hi> and modern one; nor could he without a great many far fetched ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure terms, and a long Chain of Arguments, have ascended to its first Form, and have brought the Thread of both down to his own Times. In short, neither the Sun nor Stars were composed out of this terrestrial Chaos; but <hi>Moses</hi> having made Man to be the Head and under God the supream Lord of all things, he represented the whole Universe as it were created and compiled purely for his sake. This to me seems the Reason of both the physical and ethical Account of the Creation, for so I
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48367:51"/>
call the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Relation, since it seems not to have been Instituted so much <gap reason="foreign">

In the mean time, if to other Peoples Optics this appears in a different view, I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to trouble or disturb any one in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.

But we are all bound to make use of that Portion of Reason God Almighty has distributed to each of us, till we have some more clear Light to illuminate us from Above.</p>

               <head>AN APPENDIX Concerning the Modern <hi>BRACHMINS</hi> IN THE INDIES, Together with their generally received Opinions.</head>
               <p>HAving already spoken of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Brachmins</hi> in the <hi>Indies</hi> (whom, besides the near resemblance of their Studies and Customs, we have several other Arguments to show they are descended from the ancient Race) I think it may be neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent nor unpleasant to add some few Words here by way of Appendix, about their Opinions,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48367:52"/>
concerning the Originals and Revolutions of Things; which Opinions are, 'tis true, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by most People, because they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in a mythological way; and that Truth is very much clouded with Fables.</p>
               <p>Under the name of <hi>Indies,</hi> we here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, besides the <hi>Chineze</hi> Empire, and Kingdom of <hi>Indostan,</hi> or Dominion of the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>; the Kingdoms of <hi>Siam,</hi> of the <hi>Malabars,</hi> of <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> and whatever others are known to us in the <hi>East,</hi> that have in some measure shaken off their Barbarity. Now in each of these are a certain sort of Philosophers or Divines, and in the Kingdoms of <hi>Indostan, Siam</hi> and the other adjacent Parts, there are some who seem to be the Progeny of the ancient <hi>Brachmins,</hi> being different and distinguished from the rest of the People by their Manner and Way of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as well as by a Doctrin and Language wholly peculiar to themselves. They have a certain <hi>Cabala,</hi> or Body of Learning, which they receive by Tradition from one to the other. Now this Body of Learning does not treat of each little Point or Nicety in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, as our modern Philosophers used to do; but like the natural Theology of the Ancients, it treats of God, of the World, of the Beginning and Ending of Things, of the Periods of the World, of the Primitive State of Nature, together with its repeated Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. All which Opinions are by some
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48367:52"/>
more plainly, by others more obscurely and fabulously, delivered; but that they were of old spread amongst these Nations, is plain from several Footsteps of them at this day remaining. For a Specimen whereof, we will give you some short Remarks out of our late Voyages, upon several Heads of this now barbarous Theology, or Philosophy: Nor is it of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with what Kingdom or Country we begin.</p>

                  </gap>ges, Priests or Philosophers. They have a Language peculiar to themselves, which they call Hanscrit, or the pure Tongue; in this Language they have some very ancient Books, which they call Sacred, and say were given by God to the Great Prophet <hi>Brahma</hi>; as formerly the Law of the <hi>Israelites</hi> was to <hi>Moses. Athan Kircher</hi> gives you an Alphabet of this <hi>Brachmin</hi>'s Language, written by the Hand of Father <hi>Henry Roth,</hi> who for several Years in the <hi>Indies</hi> apply'd himself to the Learning of <hi>Brachmins.</hi> And in this they not only write and conceal their Divinity, but also their Opinions in Philosophy of all Kinds:

besides the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which are Opinions of a very ancient Date. They likewise Philosophize after the manner of the Ancients, upon the Creation of the Universe, together with its End and Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for they explain these Things by the Efflux or Emanation of all things from God, and by their Reflux or Restoration into him again: But this they propound in a Cabalistical Mythological way. For they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At last, when she has sufficiently pleas'd and diverted her self in adorning and contemplating her own Web, she retracts the Threads she had unfolded, and swallows them up again into her self; whereby the whole Nature of Things created vanishes into nothing.</p>
               <p>After this manner our modern <hi>Brachmins</hi> represent the Birth, Order and Perishing of the World. Nor does this much differ from the Opinions of the Ancients we have above mentioned (<hi>lib.</hi> I. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>page</hi> 63, 64, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) provided, that taking off the fabulous Shell, we go to the Kernel.

               <p>The <hi>Siamese Brachmins</hi> not only say, that this modern Earth must perish, and that by Fire; but even that out of its ashes a new Earth must arise; and, without a Sea, that is to say, such a one, as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Prophet saw, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.1. and without the yearly Vicissitudes of the Seasons, being blest with a perpetual Spring; such another Earth as we have described in the Fourth Book of our <hi>Theory,</hi> Cap. 2.

Moreover the Kingdom of <hi>Choromandel,</hi> on the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren Coast of the <hi>Indies,</hi> has its <hi>Brachmins</hi>: whose Manners and Doctrine have been with

no small Diligence enquired into by <hi>Abraham Rogers,</hi> who wrote the Book called — <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nua aperta ad Arcana Gentilsimi.</hi> Having Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self lived many years there. Now they affirm that there are several Worlds which do at one and the same time exist in divers Regions of the Universe: and that there are several successive ones; for that the same World is destroyed and renewed again according to certain Periods of Time. They say also that our Terrestrial World began by a certain Golden Age, and will perish by Fire. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they retain the Doctrin of the <hi>Ovum Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum</hi> comparing the World to an Egg; as did the ancients both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians:</hi> Finally, to the Kingdom of <hi>Choromandel</hi> is Contiguous that of the <hi>Malabers</hi>; where Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Robert Nobilius,</hi> Founder (as tis said) of the <hi>Maudarian Mission,</hi> has spent no small part of his life; learned as well in the vulgar <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Language, as in that of the <hi>Branchmins</hi>; then he is said to have written a great deal concerning the <hi>Theory</hi> of the <hi>Brachmin,</hi> but I know not to what language: for I have not yet happened to light upon any of his writings; neither have I any Accounts of this or the rest of the Countrys of the <hi>Indies</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon, to furnish me with their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, either from eye or ear witnesses.</p>
               <p>We have likewise before mentioned the <hi>Chinese,</hi> a People of great Antiquity, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ancients unknown, as to matter
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48367:55"/>
of Learning, they have this in Common with the rest of the Orientals, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the World to an Egg, and will have it to be born of one. In like manner they say, their first Man, whom they call <hi>Puoncuus,</hi> was born of an Egg; whether you will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that by it, they mean the <hi>Chaos</hi> or the Primitive Earth; and altho they do not seem to have derived their Philosophy or History from the <hi>Brachmins</hi> yet they set so great a value on their Letters, and secret Alphabet, that as things sacred, and of a very great Antiquity, they use to inscribe them on their Idols. As for the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who are spread at large over the East under seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral different Dominions, I pass by them, as men of an upstart, ignorant kind what an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priest formerly told — <hi>Solon</hi> (<hi>You</hi> Greeks, <hi>always Boys; not one of the</hi> Greeks <hi>ever comes to be Old</hi>) May changing names, be much more properly said to them. Nor does the <hi>Egyptian</hi> give an ill reason for what he says —
<q>Your are young in your Minds; for in them is no tenent of the Ancients, that comes by ancient Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: you retain no Learning that is grey with old Age.</q>
These things exactly square with the <hi>Mehometans,</hi> wheresoever they are dispersed, they retain nothing of Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Wisdom; for the Ambition of extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The same Author relates some opinions General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received by these <hi>Persians</hi> transplanted into <hi>India,</hi> concerning the Original Age, and End of the World: But they are so stuffed with Fables, that they hardly seem worth while to repeat.

Concerning the <hi>Arrians, Trinitarians</hi> and Councils.
<salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BY your Permission, and Mr. <hi>Crook</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, I have had the Happiness to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use your incomparable Treatise of Heresie in Manuscript, wherein you have certainly given us a more accurate and faithful Account of the Nicene Council, together with their particular Grounds and Reasons for each distinct Article of their Faith in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, than is any where else to be met with. How grateful this Discourse of yours will be to the <hi>Quicunque Men,</hi> I shall not presume to determine, since I am sure Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> is as much above their Anger, as they are below his Resentments. You your self have very well observed, <hi>when Reason is against a Man, a Man will be against Reason</hi>; and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48367:62"/>
therefore 'tis no wonder to see, from several Interests, so many several Opinions and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities arise: This made the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Trinitarians</hi> so zealously endeavour to supplant one another; this made <hi>Constantine</hi> at first espouse the <hi>Arrian</hi> Interest to Mount the Throne, as the present <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV did the Interest of the <hi>Hugonots</hi>; and afterwards think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to weaken or at least to ballance that Power that raised him, strike in with <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> and the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> for a time, as our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt <hi>Lewis</hi> hath since done the like with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish and Jusuitical Party against his Protestant Subjects. For Mankind ever lived and died after one and the same Method in all Ages, being governed by the same Interests and the same Passions at this time, as they were many Thousand Years before us, and will be many Thousand Years after us.</p>
            <p>It must be confessed, the <hi>Arrians</hi> were so powerful a Sect in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Eastern</hi> Part of it) that the Followers of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council were not equal to them, either in Number, Splendor, Interest or Riches. If you will believe the learned <hi>Petavius</hi> and others, they did offer to be try'd by the Fathers that preceded the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council: For at that Council, they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condemn'd by a Party than by the general Consent of the Christian Church; because <hi>Constantine,</hi> out of above Two thousand Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops then assembled, excluded all but Three
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48367:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hundred and eighteen; nor were those perhaps (for Accounts vary) all Bishops, that made up this great Council. They were all of a Judgment at first, and so rather Parties than Judges; the <hi>Arrians</hi> had not the Freedom to dispute their Cause: And the Emperor <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> was afterwards so ill satisfied with their proscription, that he soon recalled <hi>Arrius,</hi> and a little before his Death was baptized by an <hi>Arrian</hi> Bishop. <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> were professed-<hi>Arrians</hi> (and not to mention the <hi>Gots</hi>) <hi>Valentinian, Theodosius</hi> and other Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors protected and honoured them, both with civil and military Commands.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Arrian</hi> Doctrin was not only confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Eight Councils several times assembled at <hi>Tyre, Sardis, Syrmium, Milain, Selucia, Nice, Tarsis,</hi> and particularly at <hi>Ariminum</hi> (where six hundred Bishops were of their Opinion, with only three which held the contrary) but they also punished others their Adversaries, who were of a contrary Opinion to them, with Confiscations, Banishments and other grievous Punishments. Now whether the Power of their Party, the Riches of their Churches, the Magnificence of their Worship (as the first that brought Music into the Church) or the same of their Learning, and pretensions to Reason (which is always an inviduous Plea) did raise Jealousie and Hatred in the Emperors against them, as also rendred them odious to the <hi>Trinitarians</hi>; or what most contributed to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48367:63"/>
their first Depression and Persecution, I know not: Since to persecute for Religion, was by the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> (<hi>Athanasi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, Hillary</hi> and others) then accounted an <hi>Arrian</hi> and unchristian Tenet. It is not to be doubted, but that, after the days of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> Reason of State did most prevail towards their Subversion, left they should joyn with the <hi>Goths,</hi> who at that time possessed of <hi>Italy, Spain, Afric</hi> and other Provinces, were formidable to the <hi>Bizantine</hi> Empire. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding whatsoever it was, 'tis easie to comprehend that the Depression of them did facilitate the Conquest of the <hi>Goths</hi>; and if you will credit <hi>Salvian,</hi> the <hi>Goths</hi> were very pious in their Way, mild to the Conquer'd, just in their Dealings; so that the Wickedness of the Christian Rulers of Provinces, their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions upon the People, and Insolence of the Foreign Souldiers, whereby they ruled, made even the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> themselves willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their Dominion, and prefer it before that of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Emperors.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> of those Times, I must confess, I cannot but esteem them as Enemies to all human Learning; for they had Cannons forbidding them to read any Ethic Books, and a Zeal which disposed them to destroy all they met with of that kind. Thus we may well suppose them universally igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, except some few; and as the Pastors, so were the People. Their Religion also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted rather in an out-side Service, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48367:63"/>
Piety and Knowledge; their Faith was in a manner implicit, the Mysteries of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (for such I call the Doctrin of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and its Dependencies) were scarce ever mentioned to them in Sermons, much less ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated. Hence the Vulgar became prone to Embrace Superstition and credit Miracles, how ridiculous and fabulous soever: Visions, Allegories and Allusions to Texts, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Arguments; and no Demonstration like to a feigned Story and Legend, or what might be Interpreted a Judgment upon an Heretic.</p>
            <p>Amongst the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> were a sort of People who followed the Court Religion, and believed as their Prince ordained, living then unconfined by the Dictates of the then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Church: And though the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> had resolv'd upon, and subscrib'd to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and embraced those Forms of Speech which are now in use, yet did they not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what was meant by them. The <hi>Latin</hi> Church allow'd of Three Persons, and not of three Hypostases; the <hi>Greek</hi> Church allow'd of three Hypostases, and not of three Persons. As difficult was it for them to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate <hi>Vsia</hi> or <hi>Essence</hi>; which hard words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd a subdivision amongst them, consisting of <hi>Nestorians</hi> and <hi>Eutychians.</hi> The <hi>Nestorians</hi> believing the Deity of Christ, held that he was made up of two distinct Persons, and so
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48367:64"/>
perfect God and perfect Man. The <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians</hi> averr'd, that Christ had but one Nature, and that upon the Hypostatical Union, the Deity and Humanity were so blended together, by Confusion of Properties and Substances, that one Person endued with one Will did emerge thence. Now these two Sects were of great Power in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Church, and though they were both condemn'd in the third and fourth General Councils, yet did they spread far and near, through <hi>Palestine, Aegypt,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Abyssines,</hi> and all <hi>Persia</hi> over: Each of them had their Patriarchs, Bishops and Churches contradistinct from the <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites,</hi> who adhering and subscribing to the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> (which all the Imperial Clergy did) were called <hi>Melchites,</hi> that is to say, Men of the King's Religion. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the <hi>Nestorian</hi> and <hi>Eutychian</hi> Sects were Learned and Potent Bishops: <hi>Eutychius</hi> was Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and with him joyn'd <hi>Dioscorius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria, Severus</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Iacobus Baradaeus,</hi> from whom the <hi>Iacobites</hi> are at this day denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated. <hi>Nestorius</hi> was also Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and his Sect very much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, such were the Ignorance of the People, and Debaucheries of the Ages at this time, that if a Man did but live a pious strict Life, with great Mortification, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48367:64"/>
Devotion, and were but an Eloquent Preacher, he might in any place of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Empire have made a Potent Sect instantly. And to shew how ignorant the Clergy were at the General Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> in the time of <hi>Marcianus</hi> the Emperor, we find that the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue was then so little understood at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Latin</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> that the Bishops of both Countries (in all 630.) were glad to speak by Interpreters: Nay, in this very Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the Emperor was fain to deliver the same Speech in <hi>Greek</hi> to one Party, and in <hi>Latin</hi> to the other, that so both might understand him: The Council of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for the same Reason, made certain Creeds both in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi>: At the Council of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the Pope's Legates had their Interpreter to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Words; and when <hi>Caelestine</hi>'s Letters were there read, the Acts tell us, how the Bishops desired to have them Translated into <hi>Greek,</hi> and read over again, insomuch that the <hi>Romish</hi> Legates had almost made a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie of it, fearing least the Papal Authority should have been prejudiced by such an Act; alledging therefore, how it was the ancient Custom to propose the Bulls of the Sea Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolic in <hi>Latin</hi> only, and that that might now suffice. Whereupon these poor <hi>Greek</hi> Bishops were in danger not to have understood the Pope's <hi>Latin,</hi> till at length the Legates were content with Reason, when it was evidenced
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48367:65"/>
to them, that the major part could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand one word of <hi>Latin.</hi> But the pleasantest of all, is, Pope <hi>Caelestine</hi>'s Excuse to <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> for his so long delay in answering his Letters, because he could not by any means get his <hi>Greek</hi> construed sooner. Also Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the First ingeniously confesseth to the Bishop of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> that he understood not a jot of his <hi>Greek</hi>; wherefore 'tis probable, the Proverb of honest <hi>Accursius</hi> was even then in use, — <hi>Graecum est, non Legitur</hi> — and this was the Condition of Christianity in which <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Emperor found it, <hi>A.

            <head>To my Dear Friend Mr. Harvey Wilwood. That felicity consists generally in Pleasure.</head>
            <p>YOU often profess your self an <hi>Epicurean,</hi> but sacrifice your health in pursuit of a mistaken happiness; the pleasure the wise <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> plac'd happiness in was of another kind, 'twas more temper'd with Reason; but hear what he says, and then judg how far you are his Disciple.
<q>Felicity seems plainly to consist in Pleasure, this is first to be prov'd in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral then we must shew in what Pleasure par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly it consists.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In general, Pleasure seems to be, as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning so the end also of a happy life, since we find it be the first Good, and convenient to our, and to all animal Nature, and is that from which we begin all Election and Avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and in which at last we terminate them using this affection as a rule to judg every good.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That Pleasure is the first and connatural good, or (as they term it) the first thing sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and convenient to Nature, appeareth
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48367:66"/>
from that, every animal assoon as born, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires Pleasure, and rejoyces in it, as the chief good, shunneth pain as the greatest ill, and to its utmost ability repels it. We see that ev'n <hi>Hercules</hi> himself tormented by a Poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Shirt could not with-hold from tears. Thus does every undepraved Animal, in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture judging incorruptly and intirely.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>There needs not therefore any reasoning to prove, that Pleasure is to be desired, Pain to to be shunn'd, for this is manifest to ones sense Fire is hot, Snow white, Honey sweet: we need no arguments to prove this, it is enough that we give notice of it, for since that if we take away from man all his senses there is nothing remaining; it is necessary that what is convenient or contrary to nature, be judged by nature her self, and that Pleasure is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible in it self, and Pain in its self to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for what perceives or what judges, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to pursue or avoid any thing, except Pleasure and Pain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That Pleasure as being the first thing convenient to Nature, is also the last of Expetibles, or the end of good things, may be understood even from this, because 'tis Pleasure only for whose sake, we so desire the rest, that it self is not desired, for the sake of any other but only for its self; for we may desire other things to delight or please our selves, but no man ever deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a reason, why we should be delighted,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48367:67"/>
certainly no more than for what cause we desire to be happy, since Pleasure and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity ought to be reputed, not only in the same degree, but to be the very same thing, and consequently the end, or ultimate, and greatest good, on which the rest depend, but it self depends on time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This is farther prov'd, for that <hi>Felicity</hi> is, no otherwise than because it is that state, in which we may live most sweetly, and most pleasantly, that is with the greatest pleasure that may be; for take from life this sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, jucundity, pleasure, and where I pray will be your notion of Felicity? Not of that Felicity only which I term'd Divine, but even the other esteem'd human? which is no otherwise capable to receive degrees of more, or less, or intension, and remission, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause addition or detraction of Pleasure may befal it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To understand this better by comparing Pleasure with Pain; let us suppose a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying many great incessant Pleasures, both in Mind and Body, no pain hindring them, nor likely to disturb them; what state can we say is more excellent, or more desirable than this? For in him who is thus affected, there must necessarily be a constancy of mind, fearing neither death nor pain, because death is void of sense; pain if long, uses to be light, if great short; so as shortness makes amends for its greatness, lightness for its length. When
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48367:67"/>
he arrives at such a condition, as he trembles not at the horror of the Deity, nor suffers the present pleasures to pass away, whilst his mind is busi'd with remembrance of past, or expectation of future good things, but is daily joy'd with the reflecting upon them, what can be added to better the condition of this person?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Suppose on the other side, a man afflicted with as great pains of Body, and Griefs of Mind, as mans nature is capable of, no hope that they shall ever be eas'd, no pleasure past, present or expected; What can be said or imagin'd more miserable than he?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If therefore a life full of pains be of all things most to be avoided, doubtless the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test ill is to live in pain, whence it follows that the greatest good is to live in pleasure: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed hath our Mind any thing else wherein as its center it may rest all Sicknesses, and troubles are reduced to pain, nor is there any thing else which can remove Nature out of her place, or dissolve her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That Pleasure wherein consists Felicity is Indolence of Body and tranquility of Mind. There being two kinds of Pleasure, one in station or rest, which is a placability, calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and vanity, or immunity from trouble and grief: The other in motion, which consists in a sweet movement, as in gladness, mirth, or whatever moves the sense delightfully with a kind of sweetness and titilation, as to eat
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48367:68"/>
and drink out of hunger and thirst: It may be demanded whether, in both, or in either, and in which consists Felicity? We say that Pleasure wherein Felicity consists, is of the first kind, the stable, or that which is in sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so can be no other than indolence of Body, and tranquility of Mind. Or not pain'd in Body, and not troubled in Mind.</q>
            </p>

            <p>For those that practice this Vertue procure to themselves good will, and (what most of all conduces to a quiet living) dearness and tender
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48367:69"/>
estimation from others; they who use it not ill will, and (what most occasions a troublesom life) contempt and hatred. Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you omit not to be Beneficent, at least in small matters, that so you lose not the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of being accounted ready to gratifie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ev'n in great.</p>
            <p>Not without reason did I say formerly it is not only more honourable, but also more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to give than to receive benefits; because the giver thereby makes himself superior to the receiver, and reaps moreover the interest of thanks; and there is not any thing that Joys a man more than <hi>Thanks.</hi> A Beneficent person is like a fountain, which if you should suppose it to have a reasonable soul, what joy wou'd it not have at the sight of so many Corn-fields and Pastures, which flourish and smile as it were with plenty and verdure, and all by the diffusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its streams upon them?</p>
            <p>The second is Gratitude, to which every man that receives a benefit is reciprocally oblig'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he wou'd incur the greatest hatred and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny. For Ingratitude is worthily hateful to all men, because seeing nothing is more suitable to Nature, than to be propense to receive a good, it is highly contrary to Nature not to be readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grateful toward the Author of that Good.</p>
            <p>Now since none is more gratefully affected toward his Benefactors than a wise man, we may justly affirm, that only the wise man knows how to fulfil the duty of Gratitude, because he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48367:69"/>
alone is ready upon all occasions to express his thankfulness to his Friends both present and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, ev'n to those that are dead.</p>
            <p>Others pay thanks only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Friends,<note place="margin">A foolish man behind a friends back shall side with his enemy, not remembring that of <hi>Horace, Absentem qui rodit amicum. qui non defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi> &amp;c.</note> when present, and this perhaps for their own farther ends, to encourage them to some new favour; but how few are there who gratefully commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their absent Benefactors? who requite the good they did them upon their <note n="*" place="margin">As <hi>Xenophon</hi> to <hi>Xantippe,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who receiv'd no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefit than his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> and yet expresses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to <hi>Xantip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe</hi> that he takes care only to thrive in the world for the sake of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining her, and the Sons of his old Master <hi>Socrates.</hi>

            </head>
            <p>YOU sent me word that you desire to know what the ancient Philosophers held of <hi>Fate</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi>: I shall here send the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Two of the greatest (for I shall not fear to prefer them to <hi>Aristotle</hi>) I mean <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Fate Plato</hi> held thus;
<q>All things are in Fate, yet all things are not decreed by Fate; for Fate, though it be like a Law, yet it uses not to speak after this manner, <hi>That this Man shall do thus and to that Man,</hi> that <hi>shall befal</hi> (which were to proceed to infinite Generation of Men, and infinite Actions hapning daily to them; beside, that this would take away our free Will, our praise or dispraise, or whatever is of that kind) but rather thus: Whatsoever Soul chuseth such a Life, and doth <hi>such</hi> things, <hi>these</hi> shall follow. The Soul therefore is free, and is left within its power to do or not do, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion or necessity. But that which follows the Action is perform'd by Fate. As from <hi>Paris</hi>'s ravishing <hi>Helena</hi> (which is within my power to do or not to do) shall follow, that the <hi>Grecians</hi> contend with the <hi>Trojans</hi> about <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena.</hi> Thus <hi>Apollo</hi> foretold <hi>Laius, If thou beget
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48367:70"/>
a Son, that Son shall kill thee.</hi> In the Oracle are comprehended both <hi>Laius</hi> and he begetting of a Son, that which follows the begetting of a Son depends on Fate. That which may be done is of a middle kind, betwixt true and false; and being so indefinite by Nature, that which is in our power is carried on as it were unto it. That which is done by our Election, is presently either true or false; that which is in power is different from that which is said to be in Habit and Act. That which is in power declareth an Aptitude in that thing wherein the Habit is not perfect: So a Boy may be said to be a <hi>Grammarian,</hi> a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, a Carpenter, in power: He is in the Habit of one or more of these, when he he hath acquired this Habit. He is said to be in Act when he operateth according to that acquired Habit. That which we call possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be done is none of these. Indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate is that which is in our power, and to which part soever it inclines will be true or false.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Pythagoras <hi>of Fate and Fortune says,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the parts of the World above the Moon are governed according to Providence, and from Order, the Decree of God which they follow; but those beneath the Moon by four Causes, by <hi>God,</hi> by <hi>Fate,</hi> by our <hi>Election,</hi> by <hi>Fortune.</hi> For instance, to go abroad into a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48367:71"/>
Ship, or not, is in our Power; Storms and Tempest to arise out of a Calm, is by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; for, the Ship being under water, to be preserved, is by the Providence of God. Of Fate there are many Manners and Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; it differs from Fortune, as having a Determination, Order and Consequence; but Fortune is spontaneous and casual, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a Boy to a Youth, and orderly to pass through other degrees of Age happens by one manner of Fate. — There is also Fate of all Things in general, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, the cause of this Administration:</p>

Concerning the Immortality of the Soul.
<salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Had the Honour Yesterday to receive from the Hands of an Humble Servant of your Lordship's, your most incomparable Version of that Passage of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s, where he begins with, — <hi>Post mortem nihil est, ipsaque mors nihil,</hi> &amp;c. — and must confess, with your Lordship's Pardon, that I cannot but esteem the Translation to be, in some measure, a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48367:72"/>
confutation of the Original; since what less than a divine and immortal Mind could have produced what you have there written? Indeed, the Hand that wrote it may become <hi>Lumber,</hi> but sure, the Spirit that dictated it, can never be so: No, my Lord, your mighty Genius is a most sufficient Argument of its own Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; and more prevalent with me, than all the Harangues of the Parsons, or Sophistry of the Schoolmen. No subject whatever has more entangled and ruffled the Thoughts of the wisest Men, than this concerning our Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State; it has been controverted in all Ages, by Men of the greatest Learning and Parts. We must also confess, that your Author <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> has not wanted Advocates for the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Opinion; nay, even such, who would pretend to Justifie it, out of the very Scriptures themselves: <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> as when <hi>Solomon</hi> says (<hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.12.) — <hi>Then shall the Dust return to Dust as it was, and the Spirit to God that gave it.</hi> — And (<hi>Eccles.</hi> 3.20, 21.) when he declares, — <hi>All go to the same place; all are of dust, and all turn to dust again. Who knoweth the Spirit of Man that goeth upward, and the Spirit of the Beast that goeth downward to the Earth</hi> — Again (<hi>Eccles.</hi> 3.19.) when he tells us, — <hi>That which befalleth the Sons of Men befalleth Beasts, even one thing befalleth them both: As the one dieth so doth the other; yea, they have all one Breath: so that a Man hath no preeminence
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48367:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
above a Beast</hi> — Likewise to such who are desirous to know what their Friends are in the other World, or (to speak more properly) their dead Friends, know; <hi>Solomon</hi> answers their inconsiderate <hi>Vtinam</hi> (<hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.5.) with these words — <hi>The Living know they shall die, but the Dead know not any thing.</hi> — Moreover, others, for the purpose, cite that Passage of <hi>Luke</hi> 20.38. where it is said — <hi>He is not a God of the Dead, but of the Living</hi> — All which Texts (through the Weakness of Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) have by some Men been misapplied, as concurrent with the <hi>Anima Mundi</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> which has been since in great measure revived by <hi>Averroes</hi> and <hi>Avicenna,</hi> although in one point they differ'd among themselves: For, that <hi>Averroes</hi> believed, after Death, our Souls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd and mix'd with the common Soul of the World; whereas <hi>Avicenna</hi> thought it a distinct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> portion of the <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> which after our Deaths remain'd entire and separate, till it met with some other Body capable of Receiving it, and then being cloathed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, it operated <hi>ad modum Recipientis.</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Bernier</hi> likewise gives us, agreeable to <hi>Averroes,</hi> an account of much the same Opinion held at this time by some of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> of <hi>Indostan,</hi> whose Faith he Illustrates after this Manner, —
<q>They believe (says he) the Soul in Man's Body to be like a Bottle fill'd with Sea-water, which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48367:73"/>
being close stop'd and cast into the Sea, tydes it up and down, till by some Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or other the unfaithful Cork, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit Bottle, becomes disorder'd, so as the Water Evacuates and Disgorges it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the common Ocean, from whence it was at first taken</q>
— Which agrees very well with what (as <hi>Philostratus</hi> tells us, <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>chap.</hi> 13.) <hi>Apollonius</hi> after his Death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to a Young Man concerning the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul in these words, as rendred from the <hi>Greek</hi>:—
<q>
                  <lg>

                     <l>Quae velut acer equus, corrupto corpore Vinclis</l>
                     <l>Prosilit, &amp; tenui miscetur flamine Caeli:</l>
                     <l>Cui grave servitium est, atque intolerabile visum. —</l>

                     <l>The Soul's immortal, and once being free,</l>
                     <l>Belongs to Providence, and not to thee:</l>
                     <l>She, like a Horse let loose, doth take her flight</l>
                     <l>Out of the Carcass, and her self unite</l>
                     <l>With the pure Body of the liquid Sky;</l>
                     <l>As weary of her former slavery. —</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>

            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:48367:73"/>But he, among the Heathens, who spake plainest and fullest of this matter, was <hi>Pliny</hi> in his <hi>Natural History,</hi> lib. 7 ch. 4. where he writes to this purpose:
<q>After the Interment of our Bodies, there is great diversity of Opinions concerning the future state of our wandring. Souls or Ghosts; But the most general is this: That in what condition they were before they were born men, in the same they shall remain when dead: forasmuch as neither Body nor Soul hath any more sense after our dying-day, than they had before the day of our Nativity. However such is the Folly and Vanity of men, that it extendeth even to future Ages; nay, and in the very time of Death even flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it self with fine Imaginations and Dreams of I know not what after this Life. For, some crown the Soul with Immortality: others pretend a Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration thereof: and others suppose that the Ghosts sequestred from the Body have sense; Whereupon they render them honour and worship, making a God of him, that is not so much as a man: As if the manner of mens Breathing differ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d from that of other Living Creatures: or, as if there were not to be found in the World many more things that live much longer than man; and yet no man judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in them the like immortality. But
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48367:74"/>
shew me, if you can, what is the Substance and Body of the Soul (as it were) by it self? what kind of matter is it apart from the Body? where lieth the Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that she hath? how is her Seeing? how is her Hearing perform'd? what toucheth she? Nay, what one thing doth she? how is she employ'd? or if there be none of all this in her, what Good can there be without the same? Again, I wonld fain know where she resides after her Departure from the Body? and what an infinite multitude of Souls, like sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, would there be in so many Ages as well part, as to come? Now, surely, these are but fantastical, foolish and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish Toys; devised by Men that would fain live always; the like foolery is there in preserving the Bodies: Nor was the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity if <hi>Democritus</hi> less, who promis'd a Resurrection of the Body, and yet himself could never rise again. But what a folly of follies is it, to think that Death should be the way to a second Life? what Repose, what Rest could ever the Sons of Men have, if thier Souls did remain in Heaven above with sense, whil'st their shadows tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd beneath among the infernal Spirits: certainly these sweet Inducements and pleasing Persuasions, this foolish Credulity and easiness of Belief, destroyeth the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the best gift of Nature, Death. It
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48367:74"/>
likewise doubleth the pains of a Man that is to dye, if he does but consider what is to become of him hereafter: how much more easie and greater security were it for each Man to ground his Reasons and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions upon an Assurance, that he should be in no worse a condition, than he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was born?</q>
Now these (my Lord) with what others? I have mention'd in my <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> are the chief Opinions of the <hi>Moralists</hi> among the ancient Heathens.</p>
            <p>In Answer to which, some of our Moderns argue, That if the Soul be not immortal, the whole Universe would at this time be deceiv'd, since all our Laws do now suppose it so. But to this it has been reply'd, That if the whole be nothing but the parts, (as must be allow'd) then, since there is no Man who is not deceiv'd, as <hi>Plato</hi> saith, it is so far from an Offence, that it is absolutely necessary to grant, either that the whole World is deceiv'd, or at least the greater part of it; for supposing that there be but three Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Moses,</hi> that of Christ, and that of <hi>Mahomet:</hi> either all are false, and so the whole World is deceiv'd; or only two of them, and so the greater part is deceiv'd. But we must know, as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> well observe, That a Politician is a Physician of Minds: and that his Aim is, rather to make Men good, than knowing; wherefore, according to the deversity of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48367:75"/>
Men, he must render himself agreeable to the diversity of humors, for the attainment of his end. Now there are some Men so ingenuous and good-natur'd, that they are induc'd to Virtue by the meer excellency thereof, and withdraw themselves from Vice, purely for the sake of its own deformity; and these are Men the best disposed, tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> rarely to be met with. Others, who are worse enclined, notwithstanding the beauty of Virtue, and turpitude of Vice, do still practice virtuous things, and refrain from those that are vicious, meerly out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, Praises, Honours, Punishments and Dispraises, whom we may enrol in the second Rank. Again, others, for hope of some good, as well as for fear of corporal punishment, are made virtuous: wherefore Politicians, that they may attain such virtue, allure them with the hopes of Riches, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Command; at the same time, to prevent their committing Vice, they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify them with some punishment either in Purse, Honour or Body. But others, out of a savageness and ferocity of Nature, are moved with none of these things, as daily experience sheweth: wherefore for such, they have proposed to the Virtuous, Rewards in another Life; and to the Vicious, Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which do most of all terrify: since the greater part of Man, if they do good, do it rather out of fear of eternal Loss, than
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48367:75"/>
hope of eternal Gain; forasmuch as we have a more sensible <hi>Idea</hi> of Suffering and Losses, than of <hi>Elyzium,</hi> and the good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment there. Now because this last Expedient may be profitable to all Men of what condition soever, Lawgivers consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proneness of Men to evil, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves aiming at the Public Good, establish'd the Immortality of the Soul, perhaps, at first, not so much out of a regard to Truth, as to Honesty, hoping thereby to induce Men to Virtue. Nor are Politicians to be so much blamed herein, more than Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, who many times, for the benefit of their Patients, are compell'd to feign and pretend divers things: since, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Politicians devise Fables only to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the People; notwithstanding, in these Fables, as <hi>Averroes</hi> saith, (<hi>Prolog. in</hi> 3. <hi>Phys.</hi>) there is properly neither Truth nor False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: Thus Nurses bring their Children to those things which they know are good for them, after the like manner; whereas if the Man or the Child were either sound in Body or Mind, neither would the Physician or the Nurse stand in need of such contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances. Likewise, if all Men were in that first Rank abovemention'd, tho' we should admit the mortality of the Soul, they would yet (perhaps) be virtuous and honest; but such are rare to be found, and therefore it is necessary to use other Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48367:76"/>
neither is there any Absurdity therein, since almost all humane Nature is immerst in matter, and partaketh but little of the Intellect: whence Man is more distant from Intelligences, than a sick Man from him that is sound, or a Fool from a Wiseman; so that it is no wonder if a Politician makes use of such ways or means, for the publick establishment of good manners. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>my Lord,</hi> besides the Authority of the Holy Scriptures, as also the innumerable other Arguments which may be deduc'd as well from Philosophy as Reason, to prove the Immortality of the Soul, together with its Rewards and Punishments, (tho' I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine not their duration) yet there is no Argument of greater weight with me, than the absolute necessity and convenience that it should be so; as well to compleat the Justice of God, as to perfect the happiness of Man, not only in this World, but in that which is to come. And for this very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, when I hear <hi>Seneca</hi> the Philosopher, and others, preaching up the Doctrine of the Souls Immortality, with a

                  <l>Quid mihi Curae erit transfuga?</l>
               </q>

Nature, a droning God sit hugging of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and hoarding up his Providence from his Creatures, is an Atheism no less irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, than to deny the very essence of a Divine Being; so, in my Opinion, to believe an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul, without its due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Punishments, is altogether as ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational and useless, as to believe the Soul itself to be mortal; by such a Faith we rob the Soul of its best Title to Immortality: for what need is there of an Executor, where there are no Debts to pay, nor any Estate to inherit?

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Receiv'd yours, and have formerly seen a Translation of the Annals of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> but never yet met with that of his History, altho', as I have been inform'd, it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rendred into <hi>English</hi> by the great Sir <hi>H. S.</hi> but likewise illustrated with very learned Notes of his own writing: which makes me the more admire at what you say, that a person of his knowledge and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, should so far complement the <hi>Iewish,</hi> as to rob the <hi>English</hi> World of the Fifth Book of <hi>Tacitus</hi> his History, by omitting any part of it in his Version; since, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true method of Translating, an Author ought not to be drawn off, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerously and freely pour'd out of one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage into another: least in separating him from the Dregs, you leave the Spirit behind you. Nevertheless, I hope, this one Example will not be sufficient to introduce an <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> among us; whereby Posterity might be tempted to esteem Writing, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Books, as things unprofitable. <hi>Iustin,</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:48367:77"/>
the Epitomizer of <hi>Trogus Pompeius,</hi> is more fairly dealt with; notwithstanding in the 36th Book of his History, he doth, for the most part, concur with <hi>Tacitus</hi> in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Original of the <hi>Iews</hi>; all which the Translator hath sincerely and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially given his Reader in <hi>English</hi>: wherefore, according to your desire, I shall only trouble you with what was never yet publish'd in our Language, <hi>viz.</hi> what <hi>Tacitus</hi> speaks concerning this Subject, in the 5th Book of his History, which is as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Some conceive the <hi>Iews</hi> to have been Exiles from the Island of <hi>Crete,</hi> and to have planted themselves upon the Borders of <hi>Lybia,</hi> about the time when <hi>Saturn</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd expulsion from his Dominions by <hi>Iupiter</hi>; the Reason whereof is grounded upon the Name: for there being in <hi>Crete</hi> a Mountain, not a little remarkable, call'd <hi>Ida,</hi> the Inhabitants, by a barbarous intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a letter, were call'd <hi>Iudaei,</hi> quasi <hi>Idaei.</hi> Others say, that the Mob swarming through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Egypt,</hi> when <hi>Isis</hi> bare Rule there, these were evacuated into bordering Countries, <hi>Hyerosolimus</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> having at that time the Command over them. Again, many think them to have been a People of <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> whom King <hi>Cepheus,</hi> betwixt fear and hatred, thought fit to have removed. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also make them to have been an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent People of <hi>Assyria,</hi> who having pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48367:78"/>
themselves of part of <hi>Egypt,</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees built Cities, incroaching upon the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Countries, and Borders of <hi>Syria.</hi> But, among the rest, some will entitle their Original to a more honourable deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>viz.</hi> to be the <hi>Solimi</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> a People mention'd by <hi>Homer</hi> with honour, who, from their own, gave name to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi> However, sundry Author agree, that there being an Epidemical <hi>Scabies</hi> throughout <hi>Egypt,</hi> which much polluted their Bodies, King <hi>Occhoris</hi> addressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>Hamon</hi>'s <hi>Oracle,</hi> and supplicating a Remedy, receiv'd this Mandate, viz. <hi>To purge the Kingdom of that sort of People, which were not acceptable to the Gods, and to convey them into other Countries.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Inquisition being made, they were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd together, and proscribed for a march. But being afterwards left in a Wilderness, disanimated and drooping with Lamentations, one of the Proscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, <hi>Moses</hi> by name, advised them to abandon all expectation of Aid, either from Gods or Men, being thus forsaken both, and to confide only in him as their celestial Guardian, who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by their present trust freed from some miseries. They assented, and, as an ignorant People, adventured under his Conduct; in which Pilgrimage, nothing fatigued them more, than the want of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48367:78"/>
Water: when lying in the Fields ready to perish with Thirst, there passed by an Herd of wild Asses towards a Creek, very much shadow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the sixth day of their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels being at an end, on the seventh they possess'd themselves of Lands, (expelling the Inhabitants) wherein were both City and Temple consecrated. When <hi>Moses,</hi> to the end he might confirm to himself this People for the future, constitutes new Rites different from the rest of the World; esteeming those things prophane, which, with us, were sacred; and indulging others, which we interdicted. They, likewise, consecrated the Effigies of an <hi>Ass,</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Guide to the Waters where they satisfied their Thirst; as also sacrificed a <hi>Ram</hi> in contempt of <hi>Iupiter Hamon.</hi> They offer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They commemorate their long Famine with frequent Fastings; the loss of their Fruits with unleaven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48367:79"/>
grew so pleasing to them, that they devoted every seventh year to their ease. Others are of opinion that they did this in honour of <hi>Saturn</hi>; but by what means soever they have been introduced, they have no Antiquity for their Patroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation. Other sinister and filthy Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been prevalent for their pravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and all the very dregs of the People (who contemned the Religions of their own Countries) accumulated Tributes hither: whereby the substance of the <hi>Iews</hi> was very much enlarg'd. Among themselves, they were very fruitful and merciful; but for all others, had an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable hatred. They were a People very much inclin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d from mixing with <hi>Aliens,</hi> yet nothing was esteemed unlawful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves: Now this brought in their Custom of <hi>Circumcising</hi> their <hi>Genitals,</hi> thereby to distinguish them from others; and whosoever expected to be incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into them, was to do the same: after which, the first Lesson they taught them was, to contemn the Gods, forsake their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and disesteem of Parents, Children, Brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now, besides the concurrence of <hi>Trogus,</hi> we hear also of others, who pretend to much the same both with him and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> as
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48367:79"/>
those ancient <hi>Egyptian</hi> Writers, <hi>Manethon, Chaeremon, Lysimachus, Appion,</hi> and others: nor does <hi>Iosephus</hi> seem to produce any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Confutation of their Opinions; only in general, he finds fault with their mistaking of Names, and other such small Variations in their Histories, which to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Readers are very inconsiderable. Nay, we see <hi>Iosephus</hi> does not so much reject the Truth of <hi>Manethon</hi>'s History; but when it was for his advantage, he could make use of him, in qouting his Writings, to prove the Antiquity of his Countrymen the <hi>Iews</hi>; so that, however in Circumstances and Names of particular persons they might vary, yet that the <hi>Iews</hi> were banish'd out of <hi>Egypt</hi> for <hi>Scabies,</hi> that <hi>Moses</hi> their Commander gave them new Laws of his own making, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to converse or marry with stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; as also that they afterwards, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge their Banishments, invaded <hi>Egypt,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and their King to flight, (as they did) in all this (I say) most of the ancient <hi>Egyptian</hi> Writers agree, as we may gather from <hi>Iosephus</hi> his own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
            <p>The Tradition of the <hi>Memphites,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Moses</hi>'s passing the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> was,</p>
            <p>That <hi>Moses</hi> being well acquainted with the condition of the place, observed the Flux and Reflux of the Waters, and so brought over his Army by dry Land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:48367:80"/>However, had this been wrought imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by God, we need not (says <hi>Iosephus</hi>) so much wonder at it, for that the <hi>Pamphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> Ocean did the same to Great <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and gave way to him and his Followers, the Waves themselves marking out a Path, rather than any thing should hinder the Design which God had purposed to them, <hi>viz.</hi> to overthrow the Kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi> and this <hi>Iosephus</hi> in these very words records; so that by lessning the Miracle, he destroys it: making it cease to be a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, while he strives to make it fit to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> seem'd first to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute Religious Worship, and both of them were well skill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d in <hi>Egyptian</hi> Learning: which gave occasion for some to think, that <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Iews</hi> took divers of their Customs from the <hi>Egyptians</hi>; as for Instance, their <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi> because <hi>Herodotus</hi> says, that the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> and <hi>Syrians</hi> in <hi>Palestine</hi> (which must be the <hi>Iews,</hi> since none else us'd it in <hi>Palestine</hi>) took their <hi>Circumcision</hi> from the <hi>Egyptians</hi>; also (says he) they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the same themselves: nor does <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> deny as much: only says (without giving any reason why) that he doubts, whether they learnt it of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> or whether the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> learnt it of them, but does not affirm or deny either: <hi>Ioseph.

               <hi>Bochartus</hi> in his <hi>Phaleg,</hi> as well as Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his <hi>Origines Sacrae,</hi> affirm the latter; not to mention <hi>Theophilus Gale,</hi> and other Gleaners upon the same Subject.</p>
            <p>The Article of one true God, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon both to <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> even before their Reception: the universality of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worship consisting in the practice of Virtue and Goodness, we may find also common to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Iews:</hi> or if it be said, that Precept in the <hi>Decalogue, That we should make no graven Image, nor the likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath</hi>; was particular to the <hi>Iews</hi>; it will be found, that whatsoever they said thereof, the <hi>Persians</hi> and other neighbouring Nations concurred therein; as also in the rest of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: thus <hi>Feriari Deo</hi> is a kind of <hi>Sabboth-keeping.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ancient <hi>Iews,</hi> and modern <hi>Christians,</hi> have many Rites and Ceremonies common with the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; which is more than our vulgar Divines do imagine. Most of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Laws and Rites were practised among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> indifferently, or at least did not much vary from them, as the diligent Searchers into Antiquity well know. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as the <hi>Iews,</hi> held the most substantial parts of <hi>Moses</hi> his Doctrines, without differing in much more than certain parcicular Laws, more proper for that Country than any other, as, their not eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Swines flesh; their making Adultery death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> since, as the Notions of God, and a good Conscience, are written in our Souls at this day, so we cannot justly think, any of our Forefathers among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were deprived of them.</p>

            <p>ACcording to your Letter, I find the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections urged against your marrying <hi>Eugenia,</hi> your Ladies Sister, are chiefly these three;
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That you being her Brother in Law, by having formerly married her Sister, it would be not only a Violation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law, but also of the Levitical, and consequently a sin.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That it is against the known Laws of the Land, and so might be dangerous and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom to you both.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>And Lastly, That such a match being a thing unusual, and contrary to custom, it might reflect upon your Honours.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>All which Objections I do conceive so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily to be answered, that (were it not too great a confidence in any man to say so) with that little knowledge I have, either in Civil, Canon or Common Law, I would assert it to be lawful, and accordingly enter
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48367:82"/>
the Lists of Argument against any Levitical or Canonical Gamester whatever upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. in the mean time, what I have briefly collected, for your service, upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion is, as follows.</p>
            <p>'Tis confessed, the 99<hi>th</hi> Canon of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is positive in its deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, that no man shall marry within the Degrees prohibited by the Laws of God, and expressed by a Table fet forth by Authority, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1563. in the 17<hi>th</hi> particular of which Table, it is declared, that a man may not marry his Wives Sister: the foundation of which Prohibition, both in the Canon and Table is this. <hi>(viz.) Kindred and Affinity forbidden to marry by the Laws of God:</hi> So that the Prohibition, as well in the Canon, as in any part of the Table, seems to be no farther obliging, then as it is forbidden by the Laws of God, and the same dependance likewise have our Statute Laws in this Case, to which they wholly refer.</p>
            <p>The first Text of Scripture, which is commonly urged in this Case, is that of marrying a Brothers Wife, which seems to be forbidden; where by a side wind they would bring in that of marrying a Wives Sister as a parallel, saying, <hi>ubi eadem Ratio, ibi idem Ius.</hi> But, with their pardon, the simile does not run upon four feet, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is not the same: For the words (in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48367:82"/>
               <hi>Lvit.</hi> 18. and 16.) which forbid the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a Brothers Wife, say, <hi>because a man thereby uncovers his Brothers Nakedness</hi>: which seems not at all to be a good Reason against marrying the Wives Sister; because every man is supposed to have discovered his first Wives Nakedness before any such marriage with her Sister. Besides, all Penal Laws (such as <hi>Moses</hi>'s are in this Chapter,) which concern Life, Limb, nay and the very Soul too in this case, are no where construed by Parallels, but straitly tyed up to the very express Letter of the Law, or else no man would be safe, if he were liable to hang'd by way of comparison for a similitude, or being like the Picture of a Traytor: and this makes <hi>Moses</hi> so exact in particularizing each Crime, that whereas in prohibiting you to uncover your Fathers Nakedness would have serv'd likewise for the Mothers, the Reason being the same, yet nevertheless he in express words particularizes and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids both distinctly by themselves, and in like manner does the same in all other Cases, which he need not have done if he had design'd to have any cases not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned come within the equity and constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of those that are: as because I must not marry my Brothers Wife, therefore I must not marry my Wives Sister, a pretty Syllogism indeed. Besides, if it were so intended there, then, what follows had been unnecessary. For—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:48367:83"/>The Canon of Scripture which seems more nearly to concern this Case, is <hi>Lvit.</hi> 18.18. where it is said, Neither shalt thou take a Wife to her Sister to <hi>Vex</hi> her, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her Nakedness, besides the other <hi>in her Life-time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though Polygamy was allowed under the Law, yea, and <hi>Iacob</hi> did actually marry two Sisters, <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> yet it is here forbidden that one man should at one and the same time have two Sisters in Marriage; It was adjudged inconvenient, and <hi>Diodate</hi> upon this Text saith—</p>
            <p>The Reason of the Inconveniency is, it would be a kind of confusion, to make two Sisters Rivals or Adversaries to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 'twould produce continual Jealousies and Strifes, as an example may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>een in <hi>Iacobs</hi> Marriage, which in those first Ages were tolerated.</p>
            <p>But this doth not therefore seem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain or prohibit the marrying of two Sisters one after another, for the first being dead, the other cannot be a Rival or Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as the Text calls it) to her dead Sister: a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d then how shall the Prohibition be urged, if the Reason of it be removed? It is rationally apparent, that there is great stress placed in those expressions (<hi>during her Life</hi>) and (<hi>to Vex her in uncovering her shame upon her</hi>) as doth more fully appear in our Translation of the Bible in Queen
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48367:83"/>
               <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, Printed <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1599.—</p>
            <p>Thou shalt not take a Wife with her Sister, during her Life to Vex her. in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering her shame upon her. —</p>
            <p>Which seems to be very suitable to the Greek Translation, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: where the Prohibition run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon these Terms, or containing these Conditions, that a man shall not take a Wife, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with her Sister, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, during her Life: because it would be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Vexation to her; but she being dead, all those inconveniencies expire with her, and so it may probably be imagined that <hi>Cessante Ratione, Cessat Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this is the proper tendency of the words, is the opinion of the Learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> in his Tract. <hi>de Iure Belli &amp; Pacis, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>paragr.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nam de singulis partibus ne intelligatur, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumento esse potest interdictum, de non habendis eodem tempore in Matrimonio Sororibus duabus:</hi> For that it ought not to be understood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Occasions is sufficiently proved by the Prohibition it self, which forbids only the having two Sisters in Marriage at one time.</p>

of the Ancient Canons, the Composers whereof did not seem to esteem such a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage absolutely sinful, but inconvenient, and so obnoxious to penalties: As in the same Paragraph of <hi>Grotius,</hi> (<hi>Lin.</hi> 17.) <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Canonibus Antiquissimis, qui Apostolici di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur, Qui duas Sorores alteram post alteram duxisset, aut <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>For a man to marry two Sisters succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively is unusual, (because most have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of one out of a Family) and by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists esteemed inconvenient; but it doth not appear by them to be forbidden any

               </hi>; by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Law; which may restrain under a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, but doth not therefore make the marriage either sinful, or void, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated: Whereas, if it had been prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited <hi>Lege Divinâ,</hi> by a Divine Law, then both the contracting of it, and living in full Matrimony had been sinful, whether the Canons of men had been for it, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. But if it be not against the Laws of God, it is so far from being forbidden by the Laws of our Land, that it is rather confirm'd by the 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8.38. where it is enacted and declared,</p>
            <p>That the Marriages of all Persons shall be adjudged Lawful, who are not prohited by Gods Law to Marry. Which I urge in opposition to the second Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> that 'tis against the Laws of the Land to marry two Sisters, and so may be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
            <p>But against this some may object, that this Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 8. was enacted, 1540. and the Table set forth by Authority, which the 99<hi>th</hi> Canon doth confirm, was set forth after it, in 1563. to which may be answered, that the Canon neither did, nor could repeal the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 8. And that as a Canon it was a Human Law, as well as the other, and cannot therefore be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make void any Marriage, which the Law of God hath not prohibited and made
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48367:85"/>
void: with which <hi>Grotius</hi> doth concur, and particularly applies it to the Case in hand, at the conclusion of his aforemention'd Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph —</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sed sciendum simul est, non quod vetitum est fieri lege human, si fiat, irritum quoque esse, nisi &amp; hoc Lex addiderit &amp; significaverit:</hi> But (saith he) 'tis also necessary to be known, that what is forbidden by humane Law to be done, if it be done, is not therefore void, unless the Law has also added and signified as much.— And then he proceeds to give you a Quotation of some ancient Canons, which did, under a Penalty, forbid such a Marriage, but not make it void: <hi>Canon Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berinus,</hi> 60. —</p>
            <p>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48367:85"/>
indeed as near as possible to the words of the Canon set forth by <hi>Ioverius</hi> in his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Ecclesiastical Constitutions, <hi>A.

            <p>Now that these ancient Canons retain their Validity, is apparent, not only from the practice of the learned and judicious <hi>Grotius,</hi> as well as other eminent Civilians, who appeal to their Authority; but they likewise receive confirmation and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from the Laws of our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it being Enacted, 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8, 19.</p>
            <p>That all Canons, Constitutions, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Synodals Provincial, not repugnant to the King's Prerogative, nor to the Customs, Laws and Statutes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, shall be used and executed, till such time as they shall be otherwise order'd and determined.</p>
            <p>Now upon these preceding Authorities some Queries may be offer'd: As,
<list>
                  <item>1. Whether the 99th Canon <hi>Eccles. Angl.</hi> and the Table set forth 1563, concerning the prohibited Degrees of Marriage, do not derive their Force from the Sacred Writ, so that they are not to be understood, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended farther than the Scriptures do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly direct?</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:48367:86"/>2. Whether the Energy and Force of <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.18. be not grounded upon the Reasons contain'd in the Text? so that <hi>ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sante Ratione, cessat Prohibitio.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. Whether if the Marriage of two Sisters, one after the other; be not positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the Law of God, it be not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd lawful, and confirm'd by the 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8.38?</item>

                  </item>
                  <item>5. Whether if any of the Canons <hi>Eccles. Angl.</hi> be dubious, it be not proper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to consult the ancient Canons for Explanation and Illustration?</item>
                  <item>6. And lastly, Whether upon these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Considerations, to marry two Sisters, <hi>Alteram post Alteram,</hi> be <hi>malum vetitum Lege divin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> and so sinful <hi>forô Conscientiae,</hi> and such Marriage void? or only inconvenient and obnoxious to Ecclesiastical Censures and Penalties, which the Ecclesiastical Court may either inflict or commute?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now to conclude with this first and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Objection, Whether it be a Sin against
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48367:86"/>
the Levitical Law? I shall only make three short Remarques.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That there are many other Laws in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> that are no more abolish'd by Christ, than this of Marriages, which yet are wholly neglected, and no ways look'd upon as obligatory.</item>
               <item>2. Many doubt, Whether any of the Laws given to the <hi>Iews</hi> in particular, are binding to other Nations, excepting only those revived by Christ, which this of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages never was?</item>
               <item>3dly, and lastly, 'Tis worth our obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that when the Question was put to Christ by the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> about the Wife that had been married to seven Brethren, tho' 'twas a common practice among them, and he had so fair an opportunity offer'd him, yet he never reproves the Custom of one Womans marrying several Brethren, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers only to the plain Question as 'twas put, <hi>That at the Resurrection they neither mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor are given in Marriage:</hi> Now since he did reprove and abolish all their other evil Customs, it may well be suppos'd he thought not this so, or otherwise he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd it with the rest.</item>
            </list>
            <p>As for the second Objection, That such a Marriage would be against the known Laws of the Land, and therefore dangerous to you both:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:48367:87"/>I have sufficiently answered this already, as likewise the third and last Objection; since, as well the Statute Laws, as Honour and Conscience in this case do wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Legality of such a Match ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of God, which point I think has been pretty well clear'd by what has been said before. But for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter illustration of the matter, I will present you with a short view of the Original and Foundation of these Laws.</p>
            <p>The Statute Laws of this Land never meddled with the Degrees of Kindred in relation to Marriages, till <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth's time; which happen'd thus.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> eldest Son to <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<hi>th</hi> married <hi>Katharine,</hi> the Infanta of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>November,</hi> 1502, but on the second of <hi>April</hi> following the Prince dyed; <hi>whose Death</hi> (says Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>) <hi>was imputed to his using too great an excess in his Love towards her.</hi> (So that it is not likely he left her a Maid, as some would have it.) After which the Princess having watch'd ten Months, to see that she was not with Child by Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> she was married to her Husband's youngest Brother, afterwards <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th,</hi> by whom she had two Sons, and one Daughter <hi>Mary</hi> (since Queen of <hi>England,</hi>) the two Sons dying young, and only his Daughter <hi>Mary</hi> surviving. Now <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th</hi> growing weary of his Queen, as
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48367:87"/>
thinking he should have no more Children by her, desired a Divorce, and then (tho' he had be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n married many years, by and with the Advice of <hi>Fox</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and several of his chief Clergy,) he first pretends a scruple of Conscience, for being married to his Brothers Wife, the <hi>Pope</hi> nor <hi>Church</hi> would not allow of his scruple in that kind, nor grant him any Divorce, but chose rather to forfeit their Interest in these Kingdoms; however King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Lust prompting him, to make use of any shift to obtain his desires, he bribed some few Members among the foreign Universities to give him their opinions<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that the Marriage was unlawful, and a Divorce but reasonable, which accordingly his Commissioners ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in a Clandestine manner at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable.</hi> After this, the Parliament (who, during his Reign, were aw'd into a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with him in all things, being for the <hi>Pope's</hi> Supremacy, when ever he was for it; and as much against it, when he was against it) made a Law (32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. ch. 38.) in compliment and confirmation of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce and second Marriage, limiting all Marriages to the Degrees of the Levitical Law: so that we see this Law was made, not of any Religious or pious Consideration whatsoever, but only to serve a turn, and gratifie the Lust of an imperious Prince. And one consideration further is worthy
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48367:88"/>
our Notice; <hi>viz.</hi> that this very Princess <hi>Mary</hi> was afterwards allow'd and approv'd of by the Judgment of the whole Nation, and of all <hi>Christendom</hi> besides, to be undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putably the right and Lawful soveraign Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and so lived and dyed, notwithstanding the said Act of Parliament and Divorce; to which Title and Dignity, she could no ways have pretended, had the Marriage between <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. her Father, and his Brothers Wife Queen <hi>Katharine,</hi> (who was her Mother) been adjudged by the world unlawful.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>last Objection,</hi> that such a Match being unusual and contrary to Custom, may reflect upon your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: this is the weakest objection of all others. For as Conscience is but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of Vertue in our own minds; so Honour is but the vibration or darting those Beams abroad among our Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, thereby to illuminate our own Reputations. So that all this Objection is at once answer'd, if there be no violation of Vertue in the Action; which, I hope, I have already in a great measure demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by the former part of this Discourse: for I do not see where Vertue can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in an Action, that is neither impious to God, nor unjust or injurious towards man; as I am sure such a Marriage is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Your Relation of Affinity, was but
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48367:88"/>
in the nature of a Bargain, and upon your Lady's death, the least expired, and the whole contract ended. Cousin <hi>Germans</hi> (who marry daily) have a near Consanguinity and mixture of the same Blood, whereas you two have not one Dram of the same. But the most confusedly and foolishest Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of all is, <hi>What will the World say?</hi> Gather two Flowers off one Root, eat two Grapes off one Branch, Marry two Sisters? a thing never known before: But I hope both <hi>Torismond</hi> amd <hi>Eugenia</hi> have too much sence to be startled at such Mobb Bugbears; since no Body of Reason will argue that the Rarity or Novelty of a thing is any Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either upon Honour or Conscience; for as much as every thing is intrinsically either good or bad of it self; nor can the opinion of others any ways alter the Nature of it. At this rate, every new Law, and every new Mode or Fashion, may be esteemed dishonourable and vicious, as violating the oldest. He that alters his Watch by every Dial he come at, shall never have it go well: so he that alters or steers his course of Life according to the various Censures of the world, can never live wisely or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably; for as much as every mans Interest furnishes him with a By-Conscience of his own, however some may pretend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and others may perhaps not really discern it themselves. Lastly, to urge the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48367:89"/>
common Usage, Practice and Custom of our times, is the eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct of Narrowness of Soul, and meanness of Thought. For Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom is an Argument will lie as well for Vice, as Virtue: Drinking, Whoring, and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ing have as ancient a Prescription for their Plea, and as universal, as any Vertues what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. It is a common and ancient usage to rob upon St. <hi>Albans</hi> Road, is it therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>'e the more lawful?

But, to conclude, at this rate, we ought to have continued in the <hi>Popish</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Fore-Fathers, as esteeming all Reformations and Changes unlawful.</p>

            <q>I humbly ask your Lordships pardon for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption; but when I had last the honour of waiting upon you, your Lordships candour gave me the freedom of Venting my own Thoughts; and then, as the subject of our discourse was, about the great Changes and Revolutions that from time to time had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in the Vniverse, so I made bold to assert, that in all Mutations, as well Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical, as Civil, I would engage to make appear to your Lordship, that a Temporal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest was the great Machine upon which all human Actions moved; and that the common and general pretence of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> was but like Grace before a Meal: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, I have presumed to trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with these ensuing Remarques, to justifie the same Assertion.</q>
            <p>THere was never any Republick which dwindled into a Monarchy, or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom altered into an <hi>Aristoracy</hi> or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48367:92"/>
without a <hi>Series</hi> of preceding Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that principally contributed thereunto; had not other Circumstances concurr'd, never had <hi>Caesar</hi> establish'd himself, nor <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> erected a Senate: And if you enquire, why the first <hi>Brutus</hi> expell'd <hi>Tarquin,</hi> and the second could not overthrow <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi>? Or why <hi>Lycurgus, Solon,</hi> and <hi>Numa,</hi> could establish those Governments, which others have since in vain attempted to settle in <hi>Genoa, Florence,</hi> and other places, you will find it to arise from hence: that some considering those antecedent Causes, which secretly and securely encline to a Change, took advantage thereof; whilst others did only regard the Speciousness or Justice of their Pretensions, without any mature examination of what was principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be observed; for nothing is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, than that in these Cases, when the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious dispositions all intervene, but a very slight occasion, nay, oftentimes, a meer Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualty, opportunely taken hold on, and wisely pursued, will produce those Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which (otherwise) no humane Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity or Courage could have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.</p>
            <p>I cannot find any authentic Ground to believe, that the Sects among the <hi>Iews</hi> were more ancient than the days of the <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi> but arose after that <hi>Antiochus</hi> had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and reduced the generality
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48367:93"/>
of the <hi>Iews</hi> to Paganism; when (the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to confirm his Conquests) he erected therein an Academy for the <hi>Pythagorean, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonic</hi> and <hi>Epicurean Philosophers.</hi> This, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, (and so do others) was the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the <hi>Pharisees, Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Essenes</hi>; tho' afterwards, when the <hi>Macchabees</hi> had anathematized all that taught their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the <hi>Greek</hi> Philosophy, one Party did justify their Tenets, by entituling them to <hi>Sadoc</hi> and <hi>Baithos,</hi> and the other to a <hi>Cabala</hi> derived successively from <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Moses.</hi> The Introduction of those Sects, and of that <hi>Cabala,</hi> occasion'd that Exposition of the Prophecy of <hi>Iacob,</hi> viz. <hi>The Scepter shall not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor a Lawgiver from between his Feet, until</hi> Shilo <hi>come, and unto him shall the gathering of the People be.</hi> From whence they did (according to that fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastic <hi>Cabala</hi>) imagine, That whensoever the Scepter should depart from <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the Dominion thereof cease, that then there should arrive a Messiah. But as for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Line of <hi>David,</hi> this was no gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Opinion; for how then could any have imagined-<hi>Herod</hi> the Great to have been the Messias? Or how could <hi>Iosephus</hi> fix that Character upon <hi>Vespasian,</hi> as him who should restore the Empire, and Glory of <hi>Israel,</hi> to whom all Nations should how, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48367:93"/>
their Captivity under <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi>; albeit that the Scepter was at that time so departed from the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and house of <hi>David,</hi> that it never was resetled in it more. After their return to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> no such thing is spoken of; when <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> subdued them, prophaned their Temple, destroyed their Laws, and left them nothing of a Scepter or Lawgiver; during all which time, notwithstanding they had the same Prophecies and Scriptures among them, there is no News of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Messiah. But after the Curiosity of the Rabbins had involved them in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of mystical Numbers, and pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically or cabalistically to explain them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Gematria,</hi> then was it first discover'd, that <hi>Shiloh</hi> and Messiah consisted of Letters which make up the same Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and therefore that a mysterious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of a Redeemer was insinuated thereby<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as also, that the Prophecy of <hi>Balaam</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Star out of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and a Scepter rising out of <hi>Israel,</hi> with a multitude of other Predictions, (which the condition of their Nation made them otherwise to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair of) should be accomplished under this Messiah. I name no other Prophecies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are either general and indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exprest as to the time of their Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment, or inexplicable from their obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or uncertain as to their Authority:

such as are the Weeks of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which Book the <hi>Iews</hi> reckon among their <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giographa</hi> or Sacred, but not Canonical Books.</p>
            <p>This Prophecy likewise had a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory one, where 'tis said of <hi>Coniah, That no man of his seed shall prosper sitting upon the Throne of</hi> David, <hi>and ruling any more in</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.30.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d such a variety of Interruptions, seemeth to have fallen under this Interpretation in the days of <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, whom the <hi>Iews</hi> so hated for his Usurpation over the <hi>Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees</hi> Levitical Family, and for his general Cruelties, that he was particularly detested by the cabalistical <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who, to keep up the Rancor against him and his Lineage, as well as to alienate the People from him, I could easily imagine the Exposition of this Prophecy to have been for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Neither perhaps was <hi>Herod</hi> much displeas'd with the said Interpretation of the Prophecy, after the <hi>Herodians</hi> had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated it to him, and made him the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah, who (after their Conquest and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny under <hi>Pompey</hi>) having restor'd the <hi>Iews</hi> to a great reputation and strength, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48367:94"/>
rebuilt their Temple, found some who could deduce his Pedigree from the thigh of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> as directly as <hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s were.</p>
            <p>Now this Construction of the Prophecy being inculcated into the People, and into all those <hi>Iews,</hi> Strangers or Proselytes which resorted to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at their great Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, (from <hi>Alexandria, Antioch, Babylon,</hi> and all other parts where the <hi>Iews</hi> had any Colonies) there arose an universal expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Messiah to come, (excepting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Herodians,</hi> who thought <hi>Herod</hi> the Messias) and afterwards possest the <hi>Iews</hi> (for our <hi>Iews</hi> are but the Remains of the <hi>Pharisees</hi>) to this very day. But their impatience for his appearance, seems to have been less under <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, than ever since the first Interpretation of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, (there being no mention of false Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siahs at that time) perhaps, because the Prophecy was not so clear and convincing whilst that <hi>Herod</hi> was King: since under him the Scepter and Legislative Power seem'd to be still in <hi>Iudah,</hi> tho' sway'd by an <hi>Idumaean</hi> Proselyte, the Priesthood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd, the Temple flourish'd, and there was a Prince of the <hi>Sanhedrin, Rabbi Hillel,</hi> of the Lineage of <hi>David.</hi> But ten years after the Birth of Christ, when <hi>Archelaus</hi> was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and <hi>Iudea</hi> reduc'd into the form of a Province, the Scepter then seem'd
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48367:95"/>
to be entirely departed from <hi>Iudah</hi>; the Kingdom was now become part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Syria,</hi> and ruled by a Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who taxed them severely, then the sense of their miseries made the People more credulous; and whether they more easily believ'd what they so earnestly desir'd might happen, or whether the Malecontents (taking the advantage of their afflictions) did then more diligently insinuate into the multitude that opinion, it so hapned, that there arose at that time sundry false Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siahs, and the World was big with expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (rais'd in every Country by the <hi>Iews,</hi> who had receiv'd the intelligence from their common Metropolis <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) that the great Prince was coming, who should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish the <hi>Iewish</hi> Monarchy, and bring peace and happiness to all the Earth.</p>
            <p>Now these Circumstances made way for the reception of Christ, and the Miracles he did, (for Miracles were the only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations to the <hi>Iews</hi>) convincing the People that he was the Messiah, they never staid till he should declare himself to be so: (for I think he never directly told any he was so, but the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi>) or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced his Genealogy from <hi>David</hi>; (for tho' some mean persons call'd him the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and the Mobb by that Title did cry <hi>Hosanna</hi> to him, yet did he acquiesce in terming himself the Son of Man) but
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48367:95"/>
esteem'd him a Prophet, <hi>Elias, Ieremiah,</hi> and even the very Messiah. Also when he made his Cavalcade upon an <hi>Asinego,</hi> they extoll'd him as the Descendant of King <hi>David:</hi> but his untimely apprehension and death (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his neglect to improve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the People to make him King) did allay the affections of the <hi>Iews</hi> towards him, disappoint all their hopes, and so far exasperated them against him, that they who had been part of his Retinue at his entrance, did now call for his execution, and adjudge him by common Suffrage to be crucify'd: insomuch that his Disciples fly, the Apostles distrust, and sufficiently testify their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, by not crediting his Resurrection. But after that he was risen again, and they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd thereof, they reassume their hopes of a temporal Messias, and the last Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory they propose unto him, is, <hi>Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the Kingdom to</hi> Israel?</p>
            <p>After his Assumption into Heaven, they attended in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the coming of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, which seized on them, and gave them <hi>the Gift of Tongues</hi> (as 'tis written) <hi>for a season</hi>; whereby they preach'd to the <hi>Iews, Elamites, Parthians, Alexandrians,</hi> &amp;c. (whom <hi>Salmasius</hi> shews, not to be absolute Strangers to the Natives of those Countries, but <hi>Iews</hi> planted there) as also to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes. These being surprize'd with the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48367:96"/>
Miracle of the <hi>Cloven Tongues,</hi> and <hi>Gift of Languages,</hi> as likewise being possest with the desire and hopes of a Messiah, and being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ascertain'd by the Apostle <hi>Peter, That Iesus</hi> (whom <hi>Pilate</hi> had crucify'd) <hi>was the Lord and Christ,</hi> were, to the number, of 3000, immediately baptized into his Name, and such as were to depart, when they came to their Colonies, did divulge the tydings, and engage other <hi>Iews</hi> and Proselytes to the same Belief: the Apostles themselves going about, and ordaining likewise others to preach the glad tydings of a Messiah come; who (tho' dead) was risen again (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the obscure Prediction of <hi>David</hi>) for the salvation of <hi>Israel:</hi> and whose second appearance would compleat the happiness of all Nations, as well <hi>Iews</hi> as <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus therefore given your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship an Account of the subversion of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism,</hi> as well as of the foundation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, the origination of the <hi>Millenaries</hi> is only the consequence of the Fall of the one, and Rise of the other; for it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that not only the <hi>Iews,</hi> but also the <hi>Christians</hi> were <hi>Millenaries,</hi> and did believe and expect the temporal Reign of a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah, together with the Union of the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> under one most happy Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. Not one of the two first Ages dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented from this Opinion; and they who
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48367:96"/>
oppose it, never quote any for themselves before <hi>Dionysius Alexandrinus,</hi> who liv'd (at least) 250 years after Christ. Of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion was <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> and (as he says) all other Christians that were exactly Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> sets it down exactly for a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and relates the very words which Christ us'd when he taught this Doctrine; so that if this Tenet was not an universal Tradition in the primitive Times, I know not what Article of our Faith will be found to be such. This Doctrine was taught by the consent of the most eminent Fathers of the first Centuries, without any opposition from their Contemporaries; and was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by them, not as Doctors, but Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: and not as their own Opinion, but as Apostolic Tradition. Moreover, it was with this pretence of Christ's being a coming to reign with them here in Glory, that stopt the mouths of the unbelieving <hi>Iews,</hi> who before, upon his death and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering like other Men, began to doubt very much of the power of his Messiaship, which made them distrust his reigning in Glory amongst them here on Earth, as it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the Messiah should do; wherefore this <hi>Millenary</hi> Invention of his coming again to reign in Glory salv'd all.</p>
            <p>And thus your Lordship sees, the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Mens Natures is such, that all Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions

whatever both in Church and State, as well as all Mutations both in Doctrine and Matters of Faith, be they never so pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and sacred, or never so beneficial and useful to Mankind, both in their Souls and Bodies, yet they must still be seconded by some private temporal Interest, and have some humane Prop to support them, or else all will not do.

            <p>ACcording to your desire, I have sent you my few inconsiderable Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning that sort of the ancient Heathenish Superstitions, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the management of their <hi>Augurs.</hi> There were two kinds of <hi>Augury,</hi> Natural, and Artificial: the Natural was taken from a constant Experiment of Events following upon such and such Causes of Signs; the Artificial was that which was interpreted by <hi>Augur</hi> to portend something more than can be known by the ordinary course of Nature. <hi>Cicero</hi> herein mentions two sorts of Priests, whereof the first took care of the Ceremonies and Rites; the second of Divinations, and foretelling things to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48367:98"/>
come; of which sorts, it was lawful only for the latter to be <hi>Augurs</hi> or Prophets. Again, these were divided in three Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>Augures, Haruspices,</hi> and <hi>Extispices</hi>; who had all distinct Colledges, but yet they were all Priests.</p>
            <p>There were five principal kinds of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury</hi>; the first taken from the Heavens, or superior parts of the world: the second from Birds: the third from two footed Creatures: the fourth, from four footed ones: and the fifth or last <hi>ex divis,</hi> or from unusual Prodigies. They likewise took Divinations from Sneezing once, twice, thrice, or oftner, as signifying something to come, either good or bad. Itching, Palpitation, and shaking or trembling of some Limbs, or some parts of the Body; had their Interpretation also: of all which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> are said to have been the first Authors.</p>
            <p>The Birds commonly used for <hi>Augury</hi> were of two sorts: Praepetes, such as Eagles, Vultures, Butiones, Sanquales and Immussuli, of whom <hi>Pliny</hi> speaks, and which may be a certain kind of Hawk; the other sort are call'd <hi>Oscines,</hi> as forebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding something to come, by their Voice, Tune or singing. All manner of Owls were thought fatal; but Swans the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Other Birds, together with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Insects, as Bees, Ants, Locusts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:48367:98"/>
did signifie sometimes good, and sometimes bad, in the observation whereof, the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs</hi> regarded the sight of the Heavens, as supposing certain Planets did preside and govern at some hours, more than others. Young Birds were not admitted into <hi>Auguries,</hi> as not being of ripe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. Some Praedictions were also taken from Fishes, as <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, whereby we may see that Superstition, like Fire, endeavours to resolve all things into it self, or like a cunning Expositor, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets every Text to the Interest of his own party: for it here appears, that all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals whatsoever, were in some degree, time or place thought to be ominous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguries</hi> were taken at the same time Meat was given to Chickens, which was called <hi>Bolistima Tripudia:</hi> these <hi>Auguries</hi> were never undertaken till the Gods were first invoked with much solemnity. At which time a procession was made by the Senators, <hi>Patricii,</hi> and better sort of the People, who were for the most part crown'd with Bayes, and attended with their Wives and Children, they again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing followed by the inferiour sort: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all whom the <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> march'd in great state, having about him only certain young Boys and Virgins, either crown'd with or carrying Lawrels in their hands, and singing certain Verses,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48367:99"/>
which tended to the Demanding of the Gods prosperity and peace, (as occasion was;) and in this pompous manner they made a Procession to the Temple of their Gods; whose Images were carv'd with Garlands, called by the Ancients <hi>Strophia,</hi> made of Vervin. There were also <hi>Lectis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternia,</hi> or-Canopy-Beds appointed for the Gods with much Magnificence and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that, when they pleas'd, they might repose themselves thereon by Couples; as <hi>Iupiter</hi> with <hi>Iuno, Neptune</hi> with <hi>Minerva, Apollo</hi> with <hi>Diana, Mars</hi> with <hi>Venus,</hi> or <hi>Vulcan</hi> with <hi>Vesta,</hi> &amp;c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> sometimes also the same Gods were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in company with other God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses, as it pleas'd the Priests, whereof you may read <hi>Gell. lib.</hi> 5.1. Now from hence the manner of the <hi>Christians</hi> going in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession was thought to be first taken; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing esteem'd but a politick and wise part in them to conform their Religious Rite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> as much as was possible, to the practic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novating more than needs must.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato</hi> attributes much to this Art in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Way; and for my own part, I think, as the Ancient esteem'd this Art of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning too much, so we esteem it too little; since, as many of their Observations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Auguries,</hi> were either superstitious, or vain, or devised only to abuse the People<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:48367:99"/>
so, on the other side, useful Observations might have been taken from those Signs, the Event whereof followed in a constant me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and way.</p>
            <p>These Arts have been very ancient, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Italy, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> minor; where one <hi>Car</hi> or <hi>Cara</hi> is said to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented them, and <hi>Orpheus</hi> to have multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd them: for as they there wanted the knowledge of Divination by the Stars, in that perfection as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had it, so they devised these Arts to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves esteem'd Prophets. The <hi>Romans</hi> learnt this Art from the <hi>Hetruscians,</hi> to whom they sent six Children of their best Families to learn their discipline at a place not far from <hi>Florence,</hi> formerly called <hi>Fesulae,</hi> and now <hi>Fiesoli,</hi> where a Colledge of <hi>Augurs</hi> flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Another also was built at <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Sylla</hi> augmented to the number of 24.

            <p>IF to have a Picture drawn by a <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> a <hi>Raphael,</hi> or by the hand of some eminent Master, be an advantage to the Person for whom it is drawn; then certainly it is no less an Honour for a Country to be so well represented in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as ours is by you.

               </gap> can any thing be a greater Testimony of the Loyalties, Prudence and Integrity, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Country, City, or Corporation, than the Election of such Magistrates, as are both Loyal, Prudent and honest; who (like your self) have no other Intrest, but the true service of their King, and those whom they represent; as well maintaining the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48367:100"/>
Prerogative of the one, as supporting the Liberty of the other; wherein, as by the King's Prerogative, I mean not his single Will, or (as Divines pretend) a power to do what he list, only the King's Law, or a Law relating, <hi>particularly to himself</hi>: so likewise, by the Peoples Liberty, I mean not the Licentiousness of a Mobb, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Liberty according to Law, whereby we might assert our Rights, and maintain our Freeholds; which Liberty has been too lately in danger of being devour'd, not so much by Foreigners and <hi>Papists,</hi> as by our own Natives, and those too, who have the Impudence to call themselves <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> even without blushing: I mean our late Regulators of Corporations, and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renderers of Charters, in the two former Reigns, upon whose account it is, that I presume to give you this present trouble, as hearing it will be the next Business upon which your House designs to fall; and hope the Offences are not so long past, but that, <hi>Parthian</hi> like, you may yet shoot back some punishments upon the Offenders: since 'tis but reasonable, that they who mortgaged the Kingdom in the last Reign, should pay the Intrest of their Crimes in this.</p>
            <p>Therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> with submission, I do humbly conceive, that to make the <hi>Church of England</hi> concern'd in the preservation of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48367:101"/>
the late Regulators of Corporations, or surrenderers of Charters, is one of the greatest Indignities can be put upon her: and something like reviving the old Popish Law of <hi>Sanctuaries,</hi> making her once more become (as it were,) an <hi>Asylum</hi> or place of Refuge for the most notorious Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.

And if the <hi>Church of England</hi> can be supported only by such ill men, the Lord have mercy upon her! if a Father of a Family has one Son that proves an Extravagant, and sells his Birth-right, may not that Son be disinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited without a total Ruin to the whole Family?

               </gap> And that it does not follow by consequence, <hi>If we se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all ill men from the Government, none but

Fanaticks would be left in</hi>—No, I will not, I cannot do so much honour to that Party, as to admit of such an Objection.</p>
            <p>Of how great importance an honest, impartial and duly elected House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons is to this Nation, every Body well knows: and the ill effects of the contrary, I think, is unknown to no body. My old Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> us'd to say, <hi>We can never be throughly ruin'd, but by a Parliament.</hi> They may cut the Throats of us and our Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by a Law; whereas all other Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Acts of Violence or Tyranny in a Prince, will either vanish by his Death, or blow over with every adverse Gale of Fortune that attacks him. And this (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly) was well known to those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments in the last Reigns, who were so zealously affected for the regulating Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, that they would not have left one man amongst them, who should not <hi>Iurare in Verba Magistri,</hi> have done as a <hi>Popish</hi> King and his <hi>Popish</hi> Councils had dictated to them. So that, I confess, I cannot but couple these Regulators or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renderers together with those Judges and other Gentlemen of the Long Robe, who were for the <hi>Annihilating</hi> and Dispencing Power. Since, these were the only sort of men, who (in those times,) laid the Ax to the Root of the Tree: These were the men that were to have hewn down our

Care and Providence over humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. Tho' I confess it a superficial way of Dispute; the <hi>Epicureans</hi> may seem to have some Reason to conclude, that the Deity has no care of mankind, because the confusion in humane affairs, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral triumphs of Wrong over Right, the preposterous endeavours of men in the persuit of Happiness, (which consisting in mutual offices, yet they doing one another what mischief they can, by the means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the end, and bring all things into such a confusion) would perswade it, and almost make one think, if what the <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goreans</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> held of Souls were true, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were created in Heaven, and thence transmitted to the Bodies for punishment, that we are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, our Malice to each other, our abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Villanies gave some occasion for such thoughts. This consideration gave that Beauty to the beginning of <hi>Claudians in Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finum,</hi> which a certain Critick admired so much, that he said, he that had amind to be a <hi>Poet,</hi> should settle that perfectly in his memory, <hi>viz.</hi>

Tho' if they had throughly considred the mater, they must have thought first that since all the rest of the Inanimate, and meerly Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Substances, not dignified with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shanding, by the exact and regular Order they observe, discover some divine Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser and Providence; that certainly man evidently more excellent, and not be wholly destitute of all regard of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or indeed be thought to have less than the more ignoble Beings. Next, that if they confessed a God, they must not deprive him of his necessary perfections, and certainly a Providence over his Works is one.</p>
            <p>Having said all this, I may venture to tell you, that the very foundation of your Arguments will not hold, since you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to demonstrats it in your Analytick Method from the existence of Man: you begin thus. 1. Humane Kind that now inhabits the Earth, did not always exist, as all Histories make appear, asserting Man had a beginning. This they not only plainly testifie, but imply the same thing by the series of those things, which they deliver; for there is no History that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48367:104"/>
to give an account of the transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of above six Thousand years or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.</p>
            <p>This being the first step of your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and which being removed, all the rest falls to the Ground: give me leave to tell you, that all things that are not self-evident, should be prov'd, or not pass upon us in Philosophy; but this, you have laid for your foundation is so far from being self-evident, that it is extreamly controvertible. For tho' our Chronology in less than six thousand years come up to the Creation, that of <hi>Eusebius</hi> being the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and the only that exceeds that sum. Yet this takes not in all Nations, and if it did, the Argument is weak, since 'tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible there may have been Histories of them that reached farther, tho' now lost. Or perhaps they kept no Records, for the uncertainty of the <hi>Greek</hi> Chronology be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Olympiads,</hi> shews us they came but late to a regular observation of time. And the <hi>Roman</hi> Histories can give us no assurance or certainty, when or by whom <hi>Rome</hi> was built. <hi>Livy</hi> tells us of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus, Salust,</hi> says, the <hi>Trojans</hi> built it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it uncertain: I know as to the time they are more positive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> reckoning <hi>ab urbe condita,</hi> tho' I can't think there can be an absolute certainty of their computation,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48367:105"/>
since that was begun some years at least after its Foundation.</p>
            <p>Besides, to draw an Argument from this, that because we have no History that exceeds six thousand years, therefore the World was not before, is all one as if I should say, that because the <hi>Goths, Vandals,</hi> and other barbarous Nations were not known till the time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, therefore they were not in being before.</p>
            <p>But since our Correspondence with <hi>China,</hi> we have found they have Records &amp; Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of four or six thousand years date before our Creation of the World; and who knows but some other Nations may be found out hereafter, that may go farther, and so on. Nay, the <hi>Chinese</hi> themselves in a tradition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al account, tell us, That the Posterity of <hi>Panzon,</hi> and <hi>Panzona,</hi> inhabited the Earth 90000 years. The <hi>Bramins</hi> of <hi>Guzarat</hi> said the year 1639, that there had past 326669 Ages, each Age consisting of a number of years, and if I mistake not Centurys. Nay the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the time of their King <hi>Amasis</hi> Contemporary with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> had the Records, and Story of 13000 years, and a succession of 330 Kings, which shews they were not Lunary years.</p>

            <p>AFter so many Favors, you must think me a very impudent Beggar indeed, to importune you for more; but as I'm sensible the Benefits you bestow are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a generous Nature, so I persuade my self, that the pleasure you have in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, lessen the assurance of my ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; especially in a disquisition of this Nature, which may afford a more substantial profit to my Mind, than Favors of another kind, which I must always acknowledge I owe to you; and none wou'd be a greater, than your employing me in something that may be serviceable to you, for then I shall be able to convince you, that my Will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends beyond a bare Acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>I have often doubted whether there were any such thing as a pure Spirit independant of all Body and Matter: And, I must own, I think that there can be no such thing as 'tis <hi>vulgarly</hi> apprehended. For what <hi>Idea</hi> can we form of it? <hi>Thought,</hi> generally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the <hi>Essence</hi> of the Soul, seems only
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48367:107"/>
the <hi>Action,</hi> or an <hi>Accident</hi> of it, since the <hi>Mind</hi> is often without it, as <hi>Body</hi> without <hi>Motion,</hi> or any particular <hi>Modification</hi> of it. So that we may consider the <hi>Soul</hi> without <hi>Thought,</hi> but not <hi>Thought</hi> without some Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to in here in (unless by Abstraction) no more than roundness without some round Body. And why the <hi>Intima Natura,</hi> that composes the <hi>Matter,</hi> which goes to the making up that definition of <hi>Body,</hi> as Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Divisibility, Impenetrability, shou'd be incapable of receiving the accident of <hi>Thought,</hi> I can find no Reason; for being ignorant of the nature of those <hi>contiguous Particles</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> that are extended di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, and impenetrable, how can we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to decide it magisterially against this Opinion, especially since Memory, Wit and Judgment, the noblest <hi>Qualities</hi> of the <hi>MIND,</hi> are agreed by the Naturalists, (as is evident from Physic) to have so great a dependance on the Mechanism of the Brain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to shew plainly that we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this inmost nature of things, one Example may suffice, since we take the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition from certain <hi>general Qualities</hi> we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in Matter. As for Example, a Seed of Pepper— we see 'tis <hi>extended, divisible,</hi> and <hi>impenetrable</hi>; but we discover not what that quality of heating the mouth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of, or proceeds from; or what secret power those Particles have, to affect the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48367:107"/>
Sense in that manner. So in all other things 'tis not <hi>Extension,</hi> &amp;c. that compose the <hi>Body,</hi> but some other occult thing we know not what, of which <hi>Extension,</hi> &amp;c. are the consequence, whether it be the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Atoms, or other invisible Particles of <hi>Matter</hi> solid or subtle, tho' it must be confess'd that even the least of these Atoms has the same Qualities; but yet it must be also granted, they have other Qualitys pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably not less in number, which we know nothing of; so that when I term <hi>Extension,</hi> &amp;c. the consequence of those occult <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> we know not, I mean a co-existent conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as the consequence of a self-evident Principle. But if the <hi>Soul</hi> be not <hi>Matter,</hi> tho' more fine and subtle than the <hi>Body,</hi> 'tis very strange the chief Part of us shou'd be of such a nature that we can form no <hi>Idea</hi> of it. But 'tis stranger yet, that Men shou'd think it so necessary to believe so, when a more obvious and intelligible Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion wou'd answer all the ends of Religion as well. They must acknowledge the <hi>Soul</hi> a Substance, and we have no <hi>Idea</hi> of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance distinct from that of Body. If they have any, they would do well to impart it to the grosser understandings of the rest of the World.</p>
            <p>But these Gentlemen that advance this Opinion of pure immaterial Substances, trust to Fancy, and meer Conjectures, which they
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48367:108"/>
can give no account at all of, but by <hi>one only Accident,</hi> viz. <hi>THOVGHT</hi>; which they can never demonstrate incapable of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in Body modefy'd to that purpose, tho' not in all Bodies; for I think Mr. <hi>Bently</hi>'s far from Demonstrations, since they rise on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a <hi>Probability.</hi> But by making <hi>Thought</hi> the Essence of the <hi>Soul,</hi> they distinguish it not from that of Beasts; for they think, and have perhaps something equivalent to Reason, or must at least be granted equal to Idects. Nay, this proves, that either <hi>Thought</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> are not incompatible; or that the Essence of the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men and Beasts is the same, and by consequence both mortal, or both immortal, for they both think. Besides, since 'tis evident from this uncontrovertible Maxim, <hi>Nemo dat quod non habet,</hi> that the Qualities of all things; and therefore of <hi>Body,</hi> are in God himself (that is in an infinite degree of perfection) the most pure of Spirits, 'tis not likely that Body shou'd be derogatory to the purity of infinitely inferior Spirits.</p>
            <p>On this Corporiety of Spirits depends a more obvious Explanation of two Texts of Scripture, than I have met with in any of the vulgar and general Comments (suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Book of <hi>Genesis</hi> a true History of matter of Fact, and no Parable, as Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> contends in his <hi>Archiologiae</hi>) <hi>If the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels have Bodies, we may, without Absurdity,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48367:108"/>
suppose them to generate with Women, and so the Sons of God might enter with the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men, and beget a Race of Gyants on them. For 'tis unaccountable to me, that none but the Daughters of Iniquity</hi> (as the vulgar Interpreters will have it) <hi>shou'd be capable of bearing so robust a Generation.</hi> The other place is in the Epistles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where he enjoins <hi>the Women to be cover'd in the Church because of the Angels.</hi> For the Church being the more peculiar place of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of Angels, they might, perhaps, by the beauty of that Sex, be diverted from their Duty. This Opinion wou'd restore the Free-will to the Angels, which I' can't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive shou'd be so absolutely necessary for the justification of Man, as the Clergy woud persuade us, and yet not at all requisite to that of Angels. If Free-will was taken from them on the Fall, of one part of 'em, they met with a more indulgent Fate than Man, who still possesses it to his Ruine.</p>
            <p>These Considerations suggest an odd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Thought, which I must set down, if it be but to make you laugh, and, I hope, you'l pardon my impertinent freedom—</p>

                  </gap>ut be building his Opinion with the rest of the old <hi>Platonists</hi> on a false Supposition, seems to me in the wrong: For they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that it would be incompatible with the Immutability of God, not to have his whole Existence to be all once, his dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion measur'd, as Mr. <hi>Cowly</hi> does by the Phrase of <hi>An Eternal now,</hi> because they thought by succession he must loose those parts that are past, and gain those that are to come, and only enjoy the present. But the Imperfection of Succession in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is no good Argument that it must be so in God; for 'tis true that they both receive and loose by it, because as they
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48367:110"/>
grow old, they acquire or are depriv'd of some property, which cannot happen in God. But that which makes most for this Opinion, is that since the contrary is not built on Revelation, there is no Reason we should implicitly yield our assent to it on the bare Authority of the <hi>Platonists,</hi> unless they could make us understand it; for I defy any one to think of Eternity without the Idea of Succession.</item>
               <item>2. As to the Origin of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> methinks 'tis less contradictory, and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to believe as the Antient <hi>Peastans</hi> did, that there were two beginnings of things, the one <hi>Good,</hi> and the other <hi>Evil.</hi> For how can Evil proceed from a Being infinitely Good, and without whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is, if <hi>Evil</hi> be not? And if Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> has prov'd <hi>Genesis</hi> but a Parable, why may not the <hi>Persians</hi> be as much in the right as the <hi>Iews.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. Supposing the Soul Immaterial, why may not Material Fire have an operation on it, since the Body so much influences it in this Life.</item>
               <item>4. I would fain know what Reason some men have (and those Philosophers) to term any one quality in God more excellent than an other; for certainly let the number
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48367:110"/>
be infinite, so must the perfection of each be, else the Infinite Being would in some be less Infinite, or rather Finite; for I think there's no medium betwixt Infinite, and Finite; nor any difference can I disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver betwixt two equally infinite Qualities. If therefore the Qualities of all things are, and by consequence originally were (for God's Qualitys can neither encrease nor suffer diminution) in God, as it may be evidently prov'd, then it follows that those of Body are of equal excellency with those of Spirits, since equally in him, and all the Qualities of God are infinitly perfect.</item>
               <item>5. The opinion of the Plurality of Worlds seems more agreeable to God's infinite (for so must all God's Qualities be) communicative Qve Quality to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually making new Worlds, since other ways this Quality or Act of Creating would be only once exerted, and for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite duration lie useless and dormant. But it seems strange, that only once this Infinite desire of Communicating his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Glory should be put in practice, and that only to so little, and inconsiderable a Number as all the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> can make up, in comparison of Infinity. The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Plurality of Worlds does at least give us a more August Idea of the Wisdom and Power of God, and of his infinit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <item>6. <hi>That we are to expect Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments hereafter, according to our Actions in this Life; which includes the Soul's Immortality, and is proved by our admitting Providence.</hi>

                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That when we err from the Rules of our Duty, we ought to Repent, and trust in God's mercy for Pardon.</item>
            </list>
            <p>That Rule which is necessary to our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Happiness, ought to be generally made known to all men.</p>
            <p>But no Rule of Revealed Religion was, or ever could be made known to all men.</p>
            <p>Therefore no Revealed Religion is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to future Happiness.</p>
            <p>The Major is thus prov'd:</p>
            <p>Onr Future Happiness depends upon err obeying, or endeavouring to fulfil the known Will of god.</p>
            <p>But that Rule which is not generally known, cannot be generally obey'd.</p>
            <p>Therefore that Rule which is not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known, cannot be the Rule of our Happiness.</p>
            <p>Now the Minor of the first Syllogism is matter of Fact, and uncontrovertible, that no Religion supernatural has been convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all the World; witness the large Continent of <hi>America,</hi> not discover'd till within this two Hundred Years; where if there were any Revealed Religion, at least it was not the <hi>Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if it be objected to the whole, That the ways of God's dealing with the <hi>Heathen</hi> as to Eternal Mercy, are unknown to any; and that he will Judge them by the Law
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48367:112"/>
of Nature, or (in other terms) the Rules of Natural Religion or Morality. We urge again, that either those Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion are sufficient, if kept, to Happiness; or they who could know no more, are out of a possibility of a future state of Blessedness: because they could not comply with Laws they know not: And in saying this, they deny God's Infinite Goodness, which provides for all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the means of attaining that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, whereof their Natures are capable. Again, if they urge, that Natural Religion is sufficient, but not possible to be lived up to. The same answer falls more heavy upon them; That then there is no visible means left for the greater part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to be happy: And to do our duty according to what we are able, is but a cold comfort, if we have no Assurance or Hope at least in the means we have laid before us.</p>
            <p>Now if they infer, that therefore a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion is necessary, because the Natural will not suffice, is to beg the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and to begin again the Dispute: for we hold that a Natural Religion will suffice for our Happiness; because it is the only general means proposed. And tho' we affirm not that we can wholly live up to it; yet that a general expiation is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the Natural Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence,

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holds good, namely, that it is not possible for the greatest part of Mankind to be happy hereafter, where the means of compassing it was known to them.— But, 2<hi>dly,</hi> these several Expiations were indeed all but Symbolical, and refer'd to our Sorrow and Repentance: That it is the true and only Expiation of Sin, and is so agreed upon by all men in all Ages, and of all Religions, wherefore take it for an undoubted Truth: and this not reveal'd, but innate, and a part of Natural Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:48367:113"/>The same may be said of the Doctrinal part of it: Thus are the things generally known and believ'd; but all end in the practice of Vertue, and Reverence of the Deity.</p>
            <p>Now all Reveal'd Religions are different from each other; and you cannot prove any one of them to be truer than the rest, before you can prove that one of them must be true; and if once known true, mankind would all agree in it; otherwise those marks of Truth in it were not visible, which are necessary to draw an unviversal assent.</p>

               </gap>inite Perfection; and if so, he either rewards here, or hereafter; but not always here, therefore hereafter. Yet if they who hold Revelation, will grant that they are parts of Natural and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion, because the wisest men have inclin'd to hold them amongst the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and now do in all Opinions; then it follows that by living up to the Dictates
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48367:114"/>
of Reason and Penitence, when we fail i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> so doing, men may be happy in a future state, without any help of Revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is all I contend for.</p>
            <p>The great Objections against the validity of Natural Religion to Eternal Happiness, seem to be these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this Doctrine was never gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally held in any Age; and therefore seems not to carry that light of Moral certainty in it, which we hold necessary to establish the tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th of a Religion: for we say that Religion is only true, which is or may be reasonable, and convincing to all men; now if it be not generally held, it appears not convincing.</p>
            <p>This Objection has not really the weight in it, which it seems to carry at first sight; for 'tis evident that many men of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions at this day, have center'd in the Opinion of Natural Religion, and its suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Happiness. The <hi>Heathen</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers and Poets (who were the first Priests) did at the bottom acknowledge Vertue to be the guide of all our Actions; and all their Mysteries referr'd to a good Life, and to Repentance. At this day the learned in all Religions hold the same: this they agree in; in the outward Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of every Religion, they are every
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48367:114"/>
man content to Conform to those of their own Country. Which is an Argument for us, that whatever new Religions have sprung up, yet they have all retain'd this part thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> that they disagreed amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>'Tis confest that whole Nations have never follow'd our Opinion: but how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a Nation ever consider to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of any Religion! that which is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd draws the vulgar, who enquires not beyond it. And, besides, our Opinion is so Charitable, that we do not exclude any Dissenters from eternal Happiness: God may be pleas'd with different Worships, because we say that all Worships are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in Prayer, Praise, exercise of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Penitence, when we have done amiss: So that the foundation being the same, we labour not in the Superstructures, which are only the Modes and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next Objection against the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Natural Religion to Happiness eternal, is only a bare Affirmation of our Adversaries, That Natural Religion is but an imperfect Light, which God gives us so far, as that by improving it, we may arrive at a Supernaturl Knowledge. As suppose I were going to <hi>Whitehall</hi> from <hi>Goventgarden</hi> Church, and can then see only
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48367:115"/>
to the end of the <hi>Strand</hi> before me, but coming thither, am directed further.</p>
            <p>But I wholly deny any Natural Light can lead me to a Supernatural; there is no proportion betwixt those two extreams: There is a Gulph betwixt, a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: And 'tis not so easy a passage as from <hi>Covent-garden</hi> to <hi>Whitehall</hi>; 'tis rather from <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> to some place beyond the <hi>Caelum Empyraeum,</hi> and wholly out of the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of Nature. Also to prove that God can reveal to me what is farther Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, when I have us'd my best Natural Endeavours, is only to prove that God is Omnipotent and Infinite; but proves not that 'tis necessary he should or will do it: for <hi>a posse ad esse non valet Consequentia.</hi> I have already endeavoured to prove that it is not necessary he should reveal more; and therefore till that point be determin'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> I humbly doubt and suspend my Belief.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Objection may be this: That there is no foundation in Natural Religion for a vertuous Life; or at least not so great as in a Revealed Religion, where Rewards and Punishments are proposed. So that a meer Moral Man upon bare Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, will be discouraged when he sees Vertue not rewarded here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:48367:115"/>A second Objection is, That there is a difference betwixt our condition, and that of the <hi>Heathens</hi>: for if they liv'd up to the heighth of Vertue and known Reason, they might (say some charitable <hi>Christians</hi>) be happy in a future condition: We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, because a revealed Religion has been discover'd to us, more then to them, tho' we believe it not: Therefore we ought in our own defence to embrace it, because that by the Principles of a Natural Religion we grant, that those of a reveal'd may be saved: but they of the reveal'd deny that safety to us. (A foolish Catholick <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</hi>)</p>
            <p>To the first Objection we Answer: That Rewards and Punishments are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd in Natural Religion, and are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them in a future Life answerable to our Actions here; and according to the Justice and Mercy of the great Creator. And till you prove they are inconsistent with the doctrine of Natural Religion, we need answer no further to your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>To the second Objection; It supposes like the other; first, a Supernatural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is to prove. And if the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> living up to the height of Natural Religion, might be eternally happy, I see no reason but why we may be so too; for
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48367:116"/>
if our Happiness depends upon our Belief, we cannot firmly believe till our Reason be convinced of a Supernatural Religion: And if the Reasons of it were evident, there could be no longer any Contention about Religion: All men would embrace the same, and acquiesce in it; no prejudice would prevail against the certainty of a future good. 'Tis every mans greatest business here to labour for his Happiness, and consequently none would be backward to know the means.</p>
            <p>For the Inference, namely, that tho' a Supernatural Religion be dubious, yet 'tis the safest way to embrace it. I <hi>first</hi> Answer That I cannot embrace what comes not within the compass of my knowledge: And if I cannot believe, 'tis a sign the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is not strong enough to make me. And <hi>secondly,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two Arguments there are, which Sir <hi>Ch. Wolsy</hi> calls <hi>Demonstrations</hi> to prove a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion: —
<list>
                  <item>The first is, <hi>The Notion of Sin, or devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from good in all men; a repugnant Principle to Vertue; a lapse from our first estate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God, who is all good, must needs create us, and which the World has generrlly acknowledg'd by Lustrations and Sacrifices to appease the Deity:</hi> This he says, <hi>we can know by no other Light but Revelation,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:48367:116"/>Secondly, <hi>The approaches to God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation must be immediately and supernatually discover'd, how he will be appeas'd.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>To the first, I Answer; This generally acknowledg'd Lapse of Nature that it came may be discover'd by Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason; how it came, 'tis reasonable to conclude without Revelation, namely, by a deviation from the right Rule of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son implanted in us: how he came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate from this Rule or Lapse, proceeds from the Nature of Goodness, originally given us by our Creator; which Reason tells to be an arbitrary state of goodness only, therefore not a Necessary Goodness to which our Natures were constrain'd. In short, our fall proceeds from our not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to reason rightly on every thing we act; and with such Beings we were created: For all our Actions are design'd by us to some good which may arise to us; but we do not always distinguish rightly of that good: we often mistake the <hi>Bonum apparens</hi> for the <hi>Bonum reale,; Decipimur specie Recti</hi>: The <hi>Bonum jucundum</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd for want of Right Reasoning to the <hi>Bonum honestum</hi>; aud the <hi>Bonum vicinum</hi> (tho' it be the less in it self) often carries it before the <hi>Bonum remotum:</hi> which is greater in its own Nature. No Man ever held, that we could <hi>appetere malum quà ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum:</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:48367:117"/>
And therefore I will not grant him a total Lapse in our Natures from God; for we see many born with virtuous Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And tho' all Men at some times err, even the best in their Actions; it only shews, that we were not created to a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated goodness. 'Tis enough to prove no fatal Lapse, that many are proved thro' the course of their Lives, more prone to do Good than Ill; and that all Men do Ill on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for want of right Reasoning, because the Will necessarily follows the last Dictate of the Understanding.</p>
            <p>To the Second; Namely, <hi>That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our Offences must be supernaturally discover'd, or else we can come upon no certain Terms of Acceptation with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer that which I have often hinted, <hi>viz.</hi> That all the World who have agreed upon the Fault, agree upon the Compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; namely, Sorrow and a true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: And Reason dictates this without Revelation. The World indeed has differ'd in their Lustrations and Sacrifices; but more have in all Ages agreed, that these without Repentance were nothing, and Repentance without them was valid: But that bare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is sufficient Compensation for an infinite Offence against an infinite Being, is what our Adversaries deny, and therefore
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48367:117"/>
point us to an infinite Sacrifice or Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for Sin, namely, Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>I may first answer, That till all who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess Christianity, agree whether Christ be a Propitiation or no, I need not go about a farther Refutation of their Argument; for the <hi>Socinians</hi> will allow him only to be set up for an Example, not as a Mediator or Sacrifice. But grant that the Offence is committed against an infinite Being, we are but finite Creatures who commit it, and Repentance is what we can answer to an Atonement; and therefore we may reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably assert, 'tis all God will expect from us: Faith even in Christ, according to their Rules, being not good without it. If I owe a Million, and can pay but a Thousand Pounds, my Creditor can have but All; 'tis true, my Body is then subject to Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is to the farther Extent of the Law; but then that Law is void of Mercy. Now Mercy is one of the greatest Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, and I think that infinite Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice cannot be extended on a finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture infinitely, without a Contradiction to infinite Mercy, which is, as 'twere, God's High-Court of Equity in the Case to relieve from the extremity of the Law: for tho' God's Attributes are all infinite, and tho' his Justice be infinite as well as his Mercy; yet the infinity of his Justice is only as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, not as extensive as his Mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48367:118"/>
us, we receiving of his Justice but according to the measure of our deserts, in punishment from his Mercy more than we can deserve: As the strictest of Christians hold, If that his Mercy be farther extended to us than his Justice, his Justice is not infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely extended in punishing us; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is infinite which another thing can go beyond. And in this I follow that Father of the Church <hi>Origen,</hi> who thought that by a long Purgation, the greatest Sins might be wash'd away, and that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> taught him</p>
            <p>It has been demanded of me, Whether I should be convinc'd of my Opinion, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of supernatural Religion, in case the Gospel (<hi>i. e.</hi>) a supernatural Religion had been promulgated to all the World? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, I should; and was contented that the whole stress of the Dispute should be terminated in that one Point. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, That then if it could be proved that this nniversal Revelation was unnecessary, I ought to acquiesce; I granted that also.</p>
            <p>'Twas then urg'd, That this Revelation was not thought necessary by Almighty God, because he foreknew that none of those Heathens, or whosoever else would live up to the heighth of their natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Religion, and that therefore it was not reasonable that they should receive this supernatural Help; wherefore it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48367:118"/>
that they were all damned eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
            <p>I answer; This is to dive too far in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>God's Secrets, to conclude them all damned in all Ages, to whom that revealed LIght came not. The Apostle says, <hi>They shall be judged by the Law of Nature</hi>; but he says not, They shall be damn'd. Neither will they or can they be call'd of themselves, unless the means had been offered to them as well as to us. Also by the same Reason, all to whom this Revelation is come, shall be saved; because it was revealed to none who were not worthy of it: For if he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew that no one of the Heathens should live up to the worth of this new Light, and therefore deny'd it to them all, then he who makes no distinction of persons, would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have reveal'd it to those who should be saved: But our Adversaries confess that this Light is reveal'd to many as shall not be saved among the Christians, as if it were only to double their Condemnation; an Opinion which totally robs God of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of Mercy, and Man is left at least in a very doubting condition, if not totally desperate.</p>

                        <p>MY Opinion is, That the Universe admitteth neither Generation nor Corruption, for it ever was and ever shall be; inasmuch as if 'twere subject to time, it would not yet continue. For if any Man should conceive it to have been made, he would not be able to find into what it should be corrupted and dissolv'd; since that out of which it was made, is before the Universe; as that into which it shall be corrupted, will be after the Universe. Besides, the Universe being made, is made together with all things; and being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, is corrupted together with all things; which is impossible: So that the Universe is without Beginning and End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now whatsoever had a Beginning of its Production, and ought to partake of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48367:119"/>
Dissolution, admitteth two Alterations; the one from that which is less, to that which is greater; and from what which is worse, to that which is better; and that term from whence it beginneth to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd, is call'd Production; as that to which it arriveth is called the State: The other Alteration is from that which is greater, to that which is less; and from that which is better, to that which is worse: But the Period of this Alteration is call'd Corruption and Dissolution. If therefore the whole be producible and corruptible, when it was produced, it was alter'd from that which was less, to that which was greater; and from that which was worse, to that which was better: and consequently will afterwards be alter'd from the greater to the less, and from better to worse. So that the World being produced, admitted Growth &amp; State; and shall again receive Diminution and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. For every Nature that admitteth Progress, hath three Terms, and two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals. The three Terms are Production, State, and Dissolution; but the two Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals are, from the Production to the State, and from the State to the Dissolution. Now the Universe doth of it self afford us no such evidence, since no one ever saw it produc'd nor alter'd either in <hi>Ascensu</hi> or <hi>Descensu,</hi> but it always remain'd in the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48367:120"/>
same condition 'tis now in, equal and like it self. The evident Signs whereof, are the Orders, fit Proportions, Figures, Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations, Intervals, Faculties, mutual swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and slowness of Motions, Numbers, and Periods of Times; for all such things admit Alteration and Dimination, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Progress of a producible Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For that which is greater and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, accompanieth the State by reason of its Vigor; and which is less or worse, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth the Dissolution, by reason of its Weakness. Now I call the World by the Name of the Universe, which Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it obtaineth, in that it is framed out of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>hings, being an absolute and perfect Collection of all Natures: for besides the Universe, there is nothing; and if there be any thing, it is contain'd in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, either as a part, or excrescence thereof. As for those things that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the World, they have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the World, but the World hath communion with nothing else besides it self; for all other things have not such a Nature as is sufficient of it self, but stand in need of the communion with other things: As living Creatures need Respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; the Eye, Light, and the other Senses their several Objects; and Plants need the Juice of the Earth for their growth: Nay, the Sun, Moon, Planets, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48367:120"/>
fixed Stars, stand in need of a certain por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Universe; only the Universe stands in need of no other thing besides it self. Now as Fire, which is able to give heat to other things, is of it self hot; so that which is the cause of perfection to other things, is of it self perfect; and that which is the cause of Safety to others, must of it self be safe and permanent. Also that which is the cause ef Compacted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to others, must needs of it self be compacted: But the World is to all other things the cause of Being, Safety, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; wherefore of it self it must needs be eternal, perfect, and permanent for ever. Again, If the Universe be dissolv'd, it must of necessity be dissolv'd into Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or into Nothing; Not into Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, inasmuch as there will not be a total Corruption of the Universe, if it be dissolv'd into Something: for Something must be either the Universe, or at least a Part of it; nor will it be annihilated: For it is impossible that Something should either be made of Nothing, or dissolv'd into No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; wherefore the Universe can admit neither Production nor Corruption. Now if any one should conceive it is corruputed, either it must be corrupted from Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is without the Universe, or from Something that is within; it cannot be from Something without it, for there is
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48367:121"/>
Nothing without the Universe which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all things, and is the World. Nor can it be from things that are within the Universe, for then they must of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be greater and more prevalent than the Universe, which cannot be; for all things are hurry'd by the Universe, and by means of it are saved, compacted, and endew'd with Life and Soul. So that if it comes neither by any thing without the World, nor within it, then it cannot be subject to Corruption and Dissolution. Moreover, All Nature, if it be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd, seemeth to take away Continuity from the first and most honourable parts in a certain Proportion, lessning it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and applying it to all mortal things, as also admitting a Progress of its own Constitution, (for the first Bodies being mov'd, do in a uniform manner perform their Periods) I say, a Progress not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and local, but consisting in Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>viz.</hi> Condensation and Rarefaction. Thus Fire being press'd together produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Air, Air Water, and Water Earth. Also from Earth there is the same Period of Alteration, till you come to Fire again, whence the Alteration at first began, (according to what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> saith— <hi>Lumen Iovi, Tenebrae Plutoni; Lumen Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni, Tenebrae Iovi:</hi>) Likewise Fruits and Plants receiv'd their Beginning from Seeds,

which being come to maturity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, are again resolv'd into Seeds, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture making her progress from the same unto the same. But Men, and other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, do in a more inferior Manner finish the progress of their Nature, (since they do not return to their first Age:) Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they a reciprocal change into one another, as 'tis in Fire, Air, Water, and Earth; but after they have run thro' all the four aforesaid parts of their Race, and passed their several Ages, they are dissolv'd and dye, becoming in the same state as they were. (<hi>Quo non Nati Iacent,</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> both speak.) These therefore are Arguments sufficient to prove, That the Universe remaineth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and uncorrupted; as also that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crescences and Results thereof, suffer only a Mutation, and not an Annihilation; there being no such thing as <hi>Quies in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura,</hi> all things being in a perpetual circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Motion. Nay, that the Figure, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Time, and Substance thereof, are without Beginning and End; thereby it plainly appears, that the World admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth neither Production nor Dissolution: for the Figure is spherical, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently on every side equal, and therefore without Beginning or Ending. Also the Motion is circular, and consequently stable, never shifting its former place. The

Time likewise is infinite wherein the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is perform'd, as that which is mov'd had neither Beginning, nor shall have End; from all which it is evident, that the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse admitteth neither Production nor Corruption. <bibl>

            <p>Now it is very much, that this Author <hi>Ocellus Lucanus</hi> (who for his Antiquity is held to be almost a Contemporary with <hi>Moses,</hi> if not before him) should have so different a Sentiment of the World's Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from that which <hi>Moses</hi> had, methinks if <hi>Moses</hi>

               </gap>s History of the Creation, and of <hi>Adam</hi>'s being the first Man, had been a general receiv'd Opinion at that time, <hi>Ocel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Lucanus,</hi> who was so ancient and so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a Philosopher, should not have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Again, (saith he) as the Frame of the World hath been always, so it is necessary that its Parts should likewise always have existed; by Parts, I mean the Heaven, Earth, and that which lieth betwixt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sky; for not without these, but with these, and of these, the World consists. Also if the Parts exist, it is necessary that the Things which are within them should also coexist; as with the Heaven, the Sun, Moon, fixed Stars and Planets, with the Earth, Animals, Plants, Minerals, Gold and Silver; with the Air, Exhalations, Winds, and Alterations of Weather, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48367:122"/>
Heat, and sometimes Cold; forwith the World, all those things do, and ever have existed as Parts thereof. Nor hath Man had any original Production from the Earth or elsewhere, as some believe; but hath always been, as now he is, coexistent with the World whereof he is a part. Now Corruptions and violent Alterations are made according to the Parts of the Earth: sometimes by the overflowing of the Sea; sometimes with the dilating and parting of the Earth by Winds and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters imprison'd in the Bowels thereof; but an universal Corruption of the Earth never hath been, nor ever shall be. Yet these Alterations have given occasion for the invention of many Lyes and Fables. And thus are we to understand them that derive the Original of the <hi>Greek</hi> History from <hi>Inachus</hi> the Argive: Not that he was really the Original thereof, as some make him; but because a most memorable Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration did then happen, some were so unskilful as to make that Construction thereof; and if any way we may believe <hi>Adam</hi> to be the first Man, we must expound it after this manner; <hi>viz.</hi> That he was the first of the whole Race. But for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, and all the parts whereof it subsists, as it is at present, so it ever was, and ever shall be; one Nature perpetually moving, and another perpetually suffering; one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48367:123"/>
governing, and the other always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing govern'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The course which Nature takes in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the World, is by one Contrary prevailing over another, as thus—</p>
            <p>The Moisture in the Air prevaileth over the Driness of the Fire; and the Coldness of the Water, over the Heat of the Air; the Driness of the Earth, over the Moisture of the Water; and so the Moisture of the Water, over the Driness of the Earth; and the Heat in the Air, over the Coldness of the Water; and the Driness in the Fire, over the Moisture of the Air. And thus the Alterations are made and produced out of one into another.</p>
            <p>It plainly appears out of the Bible, that there were two Creations both of Man and Woman, and that <hi>Adam</hi> was not the first Man, nor <hi>Eve</hi> the first Woman, only the first of the Holy Race, and this divers of the <hi>Iews</hi> believe: for in the first Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> ver. 27. It is said — <hi>So God created man in his own Image, in the Image of God created he him: male and female created he them.</hi> Bidding them <hi>increase and multiply, and have dominion over all things</hi>: Which plainly shews that Man was then created, and that the other Creation of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> spoken of in the second Chapter, <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. and 22. were of the first Man and Woman of the Holy Race, and not the first Man and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48367:123"/>
Woman that ever was in the World; for it was a great space of time, and divers great Actions were accomplish'd betwixt those two Creations: Therefore when it is said—Gen. 6.2. <hi>That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>air, and took them for their Wives.</hi> The meaning is, that the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> of the second Creation, saw the Daughters of the Men of the first Creation that they were fair, and married them. What <hi>Iosephus</hi> speaks of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and other Nations, may with the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be apply'd to <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Iews,</hi> viz. That all Founders and Establishers of new Estates, have each of them suppos'd in their own behalf, that whosoever was of theirs, he was the first of the World, <hi>Contra Apio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> lib. 1.</p>
            <p>Now however <hi>Iosephus</hi> boasts so much of the Antiquity of his Countrymen the <hi>Iews,</hi> yet he himself confesses, That he neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less durst not presume to compare the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Iews,</hi> with the Antiquity of the most ancient and infallible Writings of the <hi>Egyptians, Chaldees</hi> and <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> who dwell in such Countries as are not subject to the Corruption of Air; and have carefully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that whatsoever has been done by them, should not sleep in obscurity, but be kept in memory, in the publick Writings of the most learned Men. <hi>Contra Appionem,</hi> lib. 1.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48367:124"/>
Which is as if he had said, Forasmuch as no other Nations but the <hi>Aegyptians, Phaenicians</hi> and <hi>Chaldees,</hi> have certain Records of their Original, therefore will I pretend my own Nation of the <hi>Iews</hi> to be ancienter than them, who cannot disprove me; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>The <hi>Grecians</hi> made three Divisions of Time; the unknown times: the Heroick or fabulous Times: and the Historical times, or such as they knew to have been true. The unknown Times were those with them, which past from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of things to the Flood; which Time, whether it had a Beginning, by Computation can never certainly be comprehended, as <hi>Censorinus</hi> from <hi>Varro</hi> affirms. The fabulous and Heroick times were those that intervened betwixt the Flood and the first Olympiad: buried like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in obscurity; nor is it certainly known how long <hi>Inachus</hi> was from <hi>Ogyges,</hi> or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus</hi> from <hi>Inachus.</hi> Lastly, the Historical and known part of Time is computed from the first Olympiad, and treasur'd up by the <hi>Greek</hi> Historians. That the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Phenecians</hi> had a constant Record of things past, is confess'd by the very <hi>Greeks</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; who but lately learn'd the use of Letters from <hi>Cadmus</hi> the <hi>Phaenician</hi>: for which reason it has been doubted, whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> had any use of Letters in time of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Expedition; as we may find in <hi>Iosephus</hi> against <hi>Appion</hi>: That the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians</hi> had the use of Letters long before

Stars were eternal: and by long observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those eternal Stars, as also an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute knowledge of each of their particular motions, they foretold many future Events. <hi>You will hardly</hi> (says he) <hi>believe the Number of years that the Colledge of</hi> Chaldeans <hi>affirm'd they had spent in Contemplation of the Vniverse; for before the Expedition of</hi> Alexander <hi>into</hi> Asia, <hi>they reckon'd four hundred and seventy thousand years, from the time they began to observe the Stars.</hi> Likewise <hi>Cicero</hi> (who was cotemporary with <hi>Diodorus,</hi>) menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the very same account of Time and Number of years. <hi>Critias,</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue call'd <hi>Timaeus,</hi> tells us, how an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priest laugh'd at old <hi>Solon</hi> for boasting of the Primitive acts of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> as of <hi>Phoroneus</hi> and <hi>Niobe</hi> before the Flood, as also of <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Pyrrha</hi> after the Flood; whereas the Priest told <hi>Solon,</hi> there had formerly been many more Floods: that he was ignorant even of the most famous of his Ancestors: that he had no knowledge of another <hi>Athens,</hi> the first and most ancient which stood before the Flood, and was destroyed by it: that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of the glorious Enterprizes which those first <hi>Athenians</hi> had perform'd ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years before the Flood; at which time an innumerable Company of fierce War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors had invaded <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> and all that was against <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars: against

whom, the only Valor of the Citizens of old <hi>Athens</hi> was then shewn, above all other Nations.
