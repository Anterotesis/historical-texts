         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Law of repentance put into his inward
parts,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 3</note> and written in his heart by the
finger of the Spirit of the Lord, though
many times by reaſon of ſtrong moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <p>2. Repentance in the hypocrite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from a ſervile fear,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 15</note> he being begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

Lavv,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 32</note> thinking that mercy and pardon

               <p>But the child of God is begotten un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Covenant of grace, and hath not

<note place="margin">Luke 1 74</note> ſerves God without fear, in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

the ſhadow of death, yet wil he not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
God, nor deal falſely in his Covenant.
His repentance (in that ſin cannot damn
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:120004:25"/>
him) is not arbitrary; he is bound to
it by the Covenant of grace;<note place="margin">5 Gal. 6.</note> his
faith works by love,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 14.</note> the love of

                  <hi>many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
cannot quench this love, neither
can the floods drown it; if a man
would give all the ſubſtance of his
houſe for love, it would utterly be
contemned;</hi> the more ſin the Lord
hath forgiven him, the more he loves
God, and repents, mourns and
weeps bitterly becauſe of ſin, as it
is an injurious offence againſt ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful

from a principle of ſlaviſh feare; but
the poore believer, from a principle

the Lord with his whole heart, as the
Lord requires,<note place="margin">1 Jam. 8</note> 
                  <hi>for he is double min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi>

yea, the worſt, moſt vile, deſpicable,

God ſo much as one hour on earth;
and theſe when they were at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of their provocations, and when
no eye pityed them, yea, when their
own eyes pittyed them not, then was
the time wherein the Lord out of the
riches of his grace and ſoule aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
love ſware unto them, and entred
into covenant with them; and this
was likewiſe the time vvherein they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
his, as in that pregnant place of

of Canaan,<note place="margin">16. Ezek. from ver. 3 to verſe 11</note> thy father was an Amorite,
and thy mother an Hittite; and in thy

was not cut; thou waſt not waſhed inwater
to ſoften thee, thou waſt not ſalted with
ſalt, nor ſwadled in clouts, none eye pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
thee to do any of theſe unto thee, for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:120004:28"/>
to have compaſſion upon thee, but thou
waſt caſt out in the open field to the
loathing of thy perſon, in the day that
thou waſt borne. And when I paſſed by
thee, I ſaw thee polluted in thine owne
blood, and I ſaid unto thee, when thou
waſt in thy blood, live: even when thou
waſt in thy blood, live. Now when I paſſed
by thee, and looked upon thee, behold
thy time was as the time of love; and I
ſpread my skirts over thee, and covered
thy filthineſſe; yea I ſware unto thee,
and entred into a covenant with thee,
ſaith the Lord God, and thou becameſt
mine; then waſhed I thee with water, yea,
I waſhed away thy blood from thee, and I
annointed thee with oyle, I cloathed thee

with fine linnen, and I covered thee
with ſilke, I decked thee alſo with orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and I put bracelets upon thine

               <p>It is an apparent truth unto all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced

then makes us his people, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
waſhes us, and ſanctifies us from

               <p>
                  <hi>And although poor believers have
injuriouſly and unkindly offended this

yea though they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
the oath in breaking this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and played the harlot in the face
of the Lord, yet the Lord wil have ſuch
to know, that his wayes are not as their
wayes, but as farre above them, as the

ſaith the Lord God,<note place="margin">16. Ezek. 59, 60.</note> I might even deale
with thee as thou haſt done which haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
the oath in breaking the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
Nevertheleſſe I will remember my

               <p>And as this covenant is free, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it is unconditional on mans part,
God is pleaſed indeed to take us into
covenant, not upon any condition in
us, before he brings with him Chriſt,
and in him all the conditions, and make
us as he would have us, not for the
covenant, but in it, or under it; we
are not his people before he be our
God,<note place="margin">8 Heb. 10.</note> firſt you have <hi>not choſen me,

                  <note place="margin">15. John 16</note> And it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently

(though divers affirm that it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
that God gives faith unto men

but of ſuch I would be ſatisfied, (if the

agreement and conditions on both

the old Covenant; there was life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
on condition of obedience, and
ſo in Covenants and Contracts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
man and man, but now there
is a Covenant, or rather promiſe in
Jeſus Chriſt, who is called the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
or Manager of the Covenant,
in which God gives himſelfe freely
in Chriſt to be the God of a poore
ſinner, Chriſt undertaking all both
with the Father and the ſoule; It is
not the way of a Covenant that the
Goſpel uſes, but rather the promiſe
or grace, or Salvation, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of it in <hi>Hebr. 8. 10. Jer. 31. 31.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:120004:31"/>
Ezek.</hi> 36. 26, 27. It is cleared to
be onely promiſe, grace and free
love to a ſinner; for if any thing were
to be done for life or ſalvation wee
ſhould darken the glory of free grace,

if it be of grace, it is no more of
workes, otherwiſe grace is no more
grace: nor is this promiſe of ſalvation
given to ſinners as ſinners barely, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

ſo as we are onely ſinners in our own

loved in Chriſt when the promiſe
comes: And thus the Scripture calls
us ungodly, and ſinners, and children
of wrath; not that we are ſo, but ſeem
ſo; or not ſo in Gods account but
the worlds. <hi>The Spirit ſaith, though

its property to empty the ſoule, and
keep it empty of ſelfe confidence; and
thereby it makes way for receiving of

new-obedience, or ſanctification as a
ground, upon which he juſtifies, or
forgives you;<note place="margin">Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the word, for if it be of works
it is no more of grace,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 6</note> otherwiſe work

               <p>2. It muſt then be only the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of your being juſtified, that
you ſeeke for in your ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:120004:67"/>
Theſe two things thus premiſed, I
proceed.</p>
               <p>1. We muſt allow any believer
to take in any thing of his ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to help his aſſurance, which the
word allowes of, as the Spirit and the
fruits thereof, that is to ſay, repentance,
mortification of ſin, new obedience,
&amp;c. but then it muſt be done in the
Scriptures owne caution and way, the
ſureſt knowledg that any one hath, that
he hath received the promiſe, is the
cloſing of his heart with Chriſt, the
real receiving and believing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 17</note> and going out of the heart upon
Chriſt;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 7</note>

                  <hi>who ſtaggered not at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,

is yet ſomething in man, beſides faith
to be ſatisfied; reaſon wil have more
light to ſee by, and therefore the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
of the Spirit in new obedience;
love, repentance, and ſelf-denyal;
theſe may be compared to the tokens
and change of raiment, whereby <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>

is not doubting, and doubting not
faith, yet both of them uſually lodg
in one ſoule. Thy fears and doubts
are indeed the effects of unbeliefe, but
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:120004:91"/>
do argue only weakneſſe of faith; and
ſure it is, that faith may be true and
lively, when weake and ſmal; yea
further, there may be not only true,
but great faith,<note place="margin">Luk. 8. 47, 48.</note> where there is feare
and trembling; ſo that you neither
put faith for unbeliefe,<note place="margin">Iſa. 5. 20</note> nor light for
darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>2. Conſider, that to doubt, becauſe
of doubting, is to relie rather upon
our faith then upon Chriſt; it is not
the greatneſſe of our faith, but Chriſt
whom faith receives and apprehends
that makes us accepted; and this a
weake faith may doe, as truly as the
ſtrongeſt. Thoſe that were ſtung of
the fiery Scorpion,<note place="margin">Num. 21. 9</note> and looked up to
the Brazen Serpent, though with the
weakeſt eye of faith,<note place="margin">Iſa. 45. 22.</note> were healed;
Chriſt is the ſame to the weak,<note place="margin">Gal. 3, 28</note> that he
is to the ſtrong in point of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yet the more of Chriſt, and of
faith, that a man hath, the more
ſtrength and comfort he enjoyes. It
is our dutie in the ſtrength of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mark. 9. 24</note> to
withſtand doubting (it being a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and a flie in our box of oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
and to endeavor to be ſtrong in
faith,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 18 19</note> and lay hold on that everlaſting
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:120004:91"/>
Covenant, which God hath made and
confirmed with an oath.</p>
               <p>3. Conſider that none is able to
perſwade a ſoul that it doth believe,
but he on whom it believes. <hi>God ſhall
perſwade Japheth;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 7.</note> who can more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,

if thou are elected thou doſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and this faith brings forth the
pleaſant fruits of righteouſnes. This
is one of the grand polices of Satan,
wherewith he <hi>nonpluſes</hi> poore ſoules;
for by this hee ſets on the ſoule for

as perſwaſion moſt upon markes and
ſignes of our owne ſanctification or

good without love to Chriſt, and
without faith it ſelfe to bring downe
Chriſt upon them; wee know that
every piece of coyne is valued accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the image and ſuperſcription
that it beares; and if <hi>Caeſar</hi> be not
there <hi>(though it bee ſilver ſtil)</hi> yet
it is not coyne, it is not ſo currant,
and he that hath it, cannot make
ſuch uſe of it, and ſo aſſure himſelfe

               <p>3. Conſider that it is a uſual deluſion
of Satan to tell a poore ſoule that God
hath no mercy for it, when the ſoule
hath obtained mercy, and this mercy
not farr from it, yea at the gate as it
were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that it is the nature of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe
