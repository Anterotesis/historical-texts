            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N Anſwer to your Requeſt in two ſeveral Letters of yours to your Brother, that Gentleman you mentioned <hi>viz White,</hi> alias <hi>Whitebread</hi> (more than twenty years ago)came to <hi>Oxford</hi> under pretence of a <hi>Jew</hi> converted by ſome Eminent Divine of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> way in <hi>London.</hi> But in <hi>Oxford</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a farther light by joyning with, and hearing at the ſeveral Churches and Sermons of Dr.<hi>Thomas Goodwin,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and ſome others of the <hi>Independent</hi> or Congregational way; but not ſredfaſt there long, (pretending the Apoſtles; Rule to try all things), he fell to the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and then to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> amongſt whom he challenges Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and ſeveral others for their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in a Letter written in ſeveral Languages, ſo Learnedly, that it was thought worthy of conſideration of the Learned Convocation there, by whom he was cenſured as a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> or ſome other Popiſh Seminariſt; and thereupon Impriſoned in the Caſtle-Priſon there, where he pretended a Diſtraction, and perſonated the Mad-man ſo exactly, that in few days ſome Friends of his procured his Liberty. I ſaw him ſeveral times running up and down the Streets, with his Hat under his Arm full of Stones, throwing at every ſmall Bird he ſaw; but ere long I met him at a <hi>Papiſt</hi>-houſe, where I heard him diſcourſe very gravely, learndly, and diſcreetly, where I got not only an acquaintance with him, but familiarity, inſomuch that ſeveral times in change of Habit he came to viſit me, and ſeveral other young Scholars in <hi>Magdalon</hi>-Colledg: but at length being again ſuſpected and like to be apprehended, he got privately away for <hi>London;</hi> I brought him five Miles of his way, and ſo left him to his deſigns. In ſix Months after, buſineſs called me to <hi>London,</hi> where after a day or two I heard a Report of a famous Preacher amongſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> near <hi>Charing-Croſs</hi> and the ſame day met the ſame Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (then ſo much famed) going to ſpeak, in an old-faſhioned Pincked Fuſtian-Jerkin, and clouted ſhooes, and Breeches faced with leather, and a Carters Whip in his hand, altogether diſguiſed from my knowledg of him, but he knew me, and ſpake with me, and renewed our acquaintance. At preſent he went about his intended work, and the next day came to my Quarters in a neat habit of a <hi>London</hi>-Miniſter, and carried me to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings within the Precincts of the Middle-Temple, where I had a good Entertainment, and a view of ſeveral ſtrange Habits, in which he diſguiſed himſelf to the ſeveral ſorts of people he inſinuated himſelf into; I ſaw alſo his Orders from the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, and an Inſtrument wherein he was aſſured of, and ordered to receive of certain Merchants a Hundred Pound <hi>Per Annum,</hi> beſides an yearly Penſion of Eighty Pound <hi>Per Annum</hi> from his Father. I am ſure he pretended he was born at <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> his Father name <hi>John White,</hi> and in his Writing he himſelf was ſtiled <hi>Johannes de Albo</hi> by the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> He was both Jeſuit and Prieſt in Orders; I went with him by Water and viſited ſome Ships; and in one houſe in <hi>Southwark</hi> he Celebrated the Maſs in the Popiſh mode to more than forty ; the ſame day we viſited ſeveral <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and others, and I continued in his Company by the ſpace of a Month, when he was apprehended, and by a ſpeci;al Order from the then Protector Impriſoned in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where I endeavoured, but was not admitted to viſit him. Two years after I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by a friend of mine and his, that he was freed from his durance, within the ſpace of ſix Months, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe four or five years (as far as my friend and I could judg) tampering much with <hi>Independents</hi> in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>London;</hi> and was ſeen ſeveral times by a friend of mine at Dr. <hi>Manton</hi>'s private Lectures in or near the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi>'s Houſe, ſtill known by the name of <hi>John White.</hi> He ſpake as good Engliſh as any Native, and knew all Cities, Towns, Villages, Hamlets, (in a manner) in all or moſt part of <hi>England.</hi>
