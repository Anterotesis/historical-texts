         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

aſſembled;</head>
            <p>THat whereas the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and
Commons in Parliament aſſembled, in the third
year of his Majeſties reign, that now is, did, in their
moſt famous Petition of Right, among other things,
claim theſe enſuing, as their and our undubitable Rights and
Liberties, according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That no Free-man in <hi>England</hi> ſhould be compelled to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to make or yeeld any Gift, Loan or Benevolence, Tax,
Tallage, or other ſuch like charge, without common conſent
by Act of Parliament. That no Free-man may be taken or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,

or be out-lawed or exiled, or in any manner deſtroyed,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:161384:3"/>
or be adjudged to death, but by the Lawful Judgment of his
Peers by the Law of the Land, and due proceſs of Law.</p>
            <p>That the quartering of Soldiers and Mariners in any Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
houſes againſt their wils, and compelling them to receive
them, is againſt the Laws and Cuſtoms of this Realm, and a
great grievance and vexation of the people; [Notwithſtanding
the <hi>Commons</hi> in this preſent <hi>Parliament,</hi> in their <hi>Remonſtrance
of the State of the Kingdom,</hi> 15 Decemb. 1641. publiſhed to
all the Kingdom: <hi>That the charging of the Kingdom with bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leted
Soldiers</hi> (complained of in the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid)
<hi>and the Concommitant Deſign of German Horſe, that the
Land might either ſubmit with fear, or be inforced with rigor to
ſuch ARBITRARY CONTRIB<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TIONS,
as ſhould be required of them;</hi> was a product and effect of <hi>the
Jeſuited Councels, of Ieſuites, Papiſts, Prelates, Courtiers and
Counſellors, for private ends.</hi> And therefore not to be approved
or endured in themſelves, or in any Officers or Soldiers under
their command, raiſed purpoſely to defend, and not invade
our juſt Rights and Properties, eſpecially ſince the Wars deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
in this <hi>Realm,</hi> ſince they deſire in that Remonſtrance,
<hi>That all Sheriffs, Iuſtices, and other Officers be ſworn to the due
execution of the Petition of Right, and thoſe Laws which concern
the Subject in his Liberty.]</hi> And that all Commiſſioners for the
executing and putting of men to death by Martial Law, (except
only in Armies in time of War) are wholy and directly contrary
to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm. And did in their ſaid
Petition grievouſly complain, That by means of divers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions,
directed to ſundry Commiſſioners in ſeveral Counties,
his Majeſties people have been, in divers places, aſſembled and
required to lend certain ſums of Money to his Majeſty (preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the publick ſafety) and many of them, upon their refuſal
ſo to do, have had an Oath tendred to them, not warrantable by
the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, and been conſtrained to
become bound to make appearance and give attendance before
the Privy Councel and in other places, and other of them have
been therefore impriſoned, cenſured and ſundry other ways
moleſted and diſquieted, and divers other Charges have been
layd and levyed on the people in ſeveral Counties by Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:161384:3"/>
Deputy Lieutenants, Commiſsioners for Miniſters,
Juſtices of Peace, and others againſt the Laws and free Cuſtoms
of this Realm. And that divers Subjects have of late been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
without any cauſe, or any juſt or lawful cauſe ſhewn;
and when for their deliverance they were brought before his
Majeſties Juſtices by Writs of <hi>Habeat Corpora,</hi> there to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
and receive as the Court ſhould order, and their Keepers
commanded to certifie the cauſes of their detainer, no cauſe was
certified, but that they were detained by his Majeſties ſpecial
command, ſignified by the Lords of his Privy Councel, and yet
were returned back to ſeveral priſons without being charged
with any thing, to which they might make anſwer according
to the Law. And that of late great companies of Soldiers and
Mariners have been diſperſed into divers Counties of the Realm,
and the inhabitants, againſt their wils, have been compelled to
receive them into their houſes, and there to ſuffer them to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ
againſt the Laws and Cuſtoms of this Realm to the great
grievance and vexation of the people. And that divers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
under the great Seal had been granted to proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Martial Law againſt Soldiers, Mariners and others,
by colour and pretext whereof ſome of his Maieſties Subiects
had been illegally put to death and executed. And alſo ſundry
grievous offendors, by colour thereof, claiming an exemption
have eſcaped the puniſhments due to them by the Laws and
Statutes of this Realm, by reaſon that divers Officers and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of Juſtice have uniuſtly refuſed or forborn to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſuch Offendors according to the ſaid Laws and Statutes,
upon pretence that the ſaid Offenders were puniſhable by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Law, and by Authority of ſuch Commiſſions, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>And therefore they did then in their ſaid Petition moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
pray his moſt Excellent Maieſty, that no man hereafter be
compelled to make or yeeld any Gift, Loan, Benevolence, Tax
or ſuch like charge, without common conſent by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And that none be called to make anſwer, or take ſuch
Oath, or to give attendance, or be cenſured, or otherwiſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted
or diſquieted concerning the ſame, or the refuſal thereof.
And that no Free-man, in any ſuch manner, as is before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
be impriſoned or detained. And that his Maieſty would
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:161384:4"/>
be pleaſed to remove the ſaid Soldiers and Mariners, and that
his people may not be ſo burthened in time to come. And that
the foreſaid Commiſſions for proceeding by Martial Law may
be revoked, recalled and annulled. And that hereafter, no
Commiſſions of the like nature may iſſue forth to any perſon or
perſons whatſoever, to be executed as aforeſaid; leſt by colour
of them any of his Maieſties Subiects be deſtroyed or put to
death, contrary to the Laws and Franchiſes of the Land. All
which they then moſt humbly prayed of his Maieſty, as their
Rights and Liberties, according to the Laws and Statutes of this
Realm. And that his <hi>Majesty</hi> alſo would vouchſafe to declare,
that all the awards, doings and proceedings to the preiudice of
his people, in any of the premiſes, ſhal not be drawn hereafter
into conſequence or example. To all which the King then fully
condeſcended, and gave this royal Anſwer in Parliament; <hi>Let
Right be done as is deſired.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe undoubted Rights, Franchiſes and Liberties, and that
our Knights and Burgeſſes ought to enioy their ancient Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
and Freedom, and to be preſent at all binding Votes and
Ordinances, we do here claim and challenge as our Birth-right
and Inheritance, not only from his Maieſty, but from both the
Houſes of Parliament now ſitting, who have in ſundry printed
Remonſtrances, Declarations and Proteſtations, and in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League and Covenant, oft times promiſed and ſeriouſly
vowed and covenanted, in the preſence of Almighty God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably
to maintain and preſerve the ſame, and to bring the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringers
of them to condign and exemplary puniſhment, and
have engaged all the wel-affected Free-born people of <hi>England,</hi>
by like ſolemn Proteſtations, Leagues and Covenants, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and defend the ſame with their lives and eſtates: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we at this preſent not only humbly deſire but alſo require
both the ſaid Houſes and every Member of them, even in point
of Juſtice, Right, Duty and Conſcience, not of favor or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
inviolably, without the leaſt diminution, to maintain,
defend and preſerve theſe our Hereditary Rights and Liberties,
intailed on us and our poſterities by ſo many Statutes, confirmed
and ratified by ſuch a multitude of late <hi>Declarations, Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Remonſtrances, Vows and Solemn Covenants,</hi> wherein
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:161384:4"/>
they have mutually engaged us together with themſelves, and
for the preſervation wherof againſt the Kings Malignant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,
and Forces, and Party, (now totally ſubdued) have of
late years put us and the whole Kingdom to ſuch a vaſt expence
of Treaſure and Gallant Engliſh blood: and likewiſe pray their
publick Declaration againſt, and exemplary Juſtice upon the
preſent open profeſſed Invaders and Infringers of them, in a
more ſuperlative degree then ever heretofore.</p>
            <p>For not to enumerate the manifold Encroachments on, and
Violations of theſe our undoubted Priviledges, Rights and
Franchiſes, by Members, Committees, and all ſervants, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
military and civil imployed by both Houſes, during the
late uncivil Wars, occaſioned the inevitable Law of pure neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
all which we deſire may be buried in perpetual oblivion, we
cannot but with weeping eys &amp; bleeding hearts, complain &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrat
to your honors: that contrary to theſe undoubted rights;
Priviledges and Franchiſes; many of us who have always ſtood
wel-affected to the Parliament, and done and ſuffered much for
it, have partly through the power, malice and falſe ſuggeſtions,
either of ſome Members of both Houſes who have born a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſpeen againſt us, but principally through the malice and
oppreſſion of divers City and Country-Committees, Governors,
Officers, Souldiers and Agents imployed by Parliamentary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
been moſt injuriouſly and illegally impriſoned, ſequeſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
plundered, put out of our Offices, Benefices, Livings, Lands,
Free-holds, enforced to ſend divers ſums of money without any
Act or Ordinance, to take unlawful Oaths, enter into bonds to
make appearance, and give attendance upon ſeverall perſons
and Committees, both in the <hi>Country, London, Weſtminſter,</hi>
and other places, for divers moneths together, and have been
confined, reſtrained, and ſundry other ways oppreſſed, moleſted
and diſquieted, and utterly ruined; of which when we have
complayned to the Houſes, we can find either no Redreſs at all,
or ſuch ſlender and ſlow relief, as is as bad or worſe then none
at all. And when we have ſought our Enlargement from our
unjuſt impriſonments in a Legal way, by writs of <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora,</hi>
in the Kings Courts; our Keepers have either refuſed to
obey them, or to certifie the cauſes of our detainer, or elſe have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:161384:5"/>
certified generally, that we were detained by order or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of one or both Houſes, or of ſome Committees or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Parliament, whereupon we have been remended to our
reſpective priſons, without being charged with any particular
offence, to which we might make anſwer according to Law:
And if we ſeek to right our ſelves againſt thoſe who have thus
unjuſtly and maliciouſly impriſoned, oppreſſed, plundered and
diſſeiſed us of our Free-holds, Lands and Goods, by actions of
falſe impriſonment, Treſpaſs, Trover, Aſſiſe, or the like at the
Common Law, which is our Birthright; Theſe Members and
their Servants, who have injured and ruined us, plead exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from our ſuits, by reaſon of their Priviledges, ſo as we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can nor dare to ſue them; and Committee-men and others,
when we ſue them for any injuries, Treſpaſſes or oppreſſions
by Land or Sea, plead the Ordinances of Indempnity, to juſtifie
their moſt unjuſt and exorvitant actions, warranted by no Law
nor Ordinance whatſoever, and by colour thereof ſtay both our
Judgments and Executions at Law, after verdicts given againſt
them for our relief; and force us to travail from all parts of
the Kingdom unto <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and there to dance attendance
upon Committees of Indempnity, and the like, for many weeks
and moneths, til they enforce us to ſpend, more then the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages

Charge and Proofs againſt them; others expelled the Houſe,
and impriſoned in an Arbitrary and Illegal manner, when moſt
of the Members were forced thence by the Armies violence,
without any juſt cauſe at all, or any witneſſes legally examined
face to face, and without admitting them to make their juſt
defence as they deſired: And that divers Lords and Members
of the Houſe of Peers have likewiſe been impeached of High

Laws and Liberties (as their late printed Papers evidence) that
they cannot without apparant danger to the Parliament; King

head-ſtrong that their own Officers cannot rule, but complain
publickly againſt them: And therefore we can neither in point
of duty, conſcience, law or prudence, ſubject to pay the ſaid
monethly Tax ſo unduly procured by their violence, were we
able to do it, being contrary to our Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
for the maintenance of ſuch a mutinous and rebellious
Army, who endeavor to enſlave and deſtroy both King Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
City, Kingdom, and monopolize all their power, wealth
and treaſure into their own Trayterous hands, which they have
wel nigh effected, having gotten the Kings perſon, the <hi>Tower</hi>
of <hi>London,</hi> all Gariſons and Forces in the Kingdom by Land,
and the command of the Navy by Sea, into their power, and
put the City and both Houſes under the Wardſhip of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
guards, attending at their doors and quartering round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, and forced the run-a-way Speakers and Members
not only to enter into and ſubſcribe the ſolemn Engagement to
live and dye with them in this cauſe, but likewiſe to give them
a ful moneths pay, by way of gratuity, for guarding them back
to the Houſes, where they might and ought to have continued
without any danger, as the other faithful Members did, and to
which they might ſafely have returned without the ſtrength of
the whole Army to guard them. And to add to our preſſures
and afflictions, this godly religious Army of diſobedient Saints,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:161384:9"/>
who pretend only our Liberty and Freedom from Tyranny,
Taxes and Oppreſſion, demand not only this new heavy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethly
Tax, and the remainder of Biſhops, and all Deans and
Chapters, and Forreſt Lands in the Kingdom, and Corporation
ſtocks for their Arrears (which if caſt up only during the time
of their actual ſervice til the time they were voted and ordered
to disband, wil prove very ſmal or little, their free-quarter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
and receipts for the Parliament and Country being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted)
but (which is our foreſt preſſure) do violently enter
into our Houſes againſt our wils, and there lie in great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
many weeks and moneths together, til they quite ruine
and eat out both us, our families, ſtocks and cattel, with their
intolerable <hi>Free quarter,</hi> and that in theſe times of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
dearth and ſcarcity; for which they raiſe and receive of
us of late twice or thrice as much as their whole pay amounts
unto, devouring, like ſo many <hi>Locusts</hi> and <hi>Caterpillars,</hi> all our
<hi>graſs, hay, corn, bread, beer, fewel</hi> and proviſions of all ſorts,
without giving us one farthing recompence, and leaving us, our
wives, children, families, cattel, to ſtarve and famiſh; the very
charge of <hi>their free-quarter</hi> (beſides their inſufferable inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and abuſes of all ſorts) amounting in many places to above
ſix times, or in moſt places to double or treble our annual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues.
Beſides the abuſes in their quartering are inſufferable;
Many of them take and receive money for their quarters double
or treble, their pay from two or three perſons at once, and yet
take Oats and other proviſions from them beſides, or <hi>free-quarter</hi>
upon others: Some of them demand and receive <hi>free-quarter</hi>
in money and proviſions the double or treble the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their Troops and Companies: Others take <hi>free-quarter</hi>
for their wives, truls, boys, and thoſe who were never liſted: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of them wil be contented with none but extraordinary diet
wine, ſtrong beer, above their abilities with whom they quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
thereby to extort money from them; and if an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> complain
of theſe abuſes, he is ſure to be relieved with an addition of
more, and more unruly <hi>quarterers</hi> then he had before. If they
march from their quarters to any randezvouz, or to guard the
Houſes, they muſt have victuals and money too, til their return.
Divers of the <hi>Troopers</hi> and <hi>Dragooners</hi> muſt have quarter for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:161384:9"/>
two or three horſes a peece, which muſt have at leaſt a peck
of corn or more every day (though they lye ſtill) both <hi>Winter</hi>
and <hi>Summer;</hi> their 7200 <hi>Horſe,</hi> and 1000 <hi>Dragoons</hi> devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
above two thouſand buſhels of <hi>corn</hi> (beſides <hi>graſs, hay and
ſtraw</hi>) every day of the week, and this time of dearth, when
the poorer ſort are ready to ſtarve for want of bread. In brief,
