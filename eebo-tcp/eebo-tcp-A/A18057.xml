            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Howbeeit, foraſmuch as that ſeruaunt was of his Lord and Maister moſt highly diſcommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whiche hiding his Talent in the grounde, had thereby profited nothing: my ſelfe being very loath to incurre the ſame faulte, and ſo to become worthy the like reprehenſion, haue the rather aduentured to tranſlate this parte of Nauigation, whiche (I aſſure my ſelfe with other mens trauel and diligence) may be an occaſion of no ſmal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie and benefite to this our Countrie of Englande. And heerein the more to animate and encourage the Engliſhe Marchants, I doe onely (for breuitie ſake) propoſe vnto them the infinite treaſures (not hidden to themſelues) whiche both the Spaniardes, the Portugales, and the Venetians haue ſeuerally gained by their ſuche nauigations and trauailes.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I had taken in hande to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate thys Treatiſe, which I did for the benefite and behoofe of thoſe that ſhall attempt any newe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie in the Northweaſt partes of <hi>America,</hi> I thought good brieflye to touch the vſe of my tranſlation, that the Reader may ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the drift of my trauell. For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this Diſcourſe may ſeeme very barraine, and not to containe ſuche matter as is pretended, as beyng a particular Relation of certaine Prouinces whyche haue beene hitherto of all men rather contemned than throughly knowen: yet if the Marchant Venturer, or skilfull Pilot, or whoſoeuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of newe Diſcoueries, haue the readyng and peruſing thereof, for whome eſpecially I haue done it into Engliſhe, they will find matter worthy the looking, and conſequently, gratefully accept my paines herein. For here is the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Countrey no leſſe fruitful and pleaſant in al reſpects than is <hi>England, Fraunce,</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> the people, though ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and rude in manners, and deſtitute of the knowledge of God or any good lawes, yet of nature gentle and tractable, and moſt apt to receiue the Chriſtian Religion, and to ſubiect themſelues to ſome good gouernement: the commodities of the Countrey not inferiour to the Marchandize of <hi>Moſcouy, Danske,</hi> or many other frequented trades: the voyage verye ſhorte, being but three weekes ſayling from <hi>Bristowe, Plym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> or any commodious Porte of the Weaſt Country, with
<pb facs="tcp:5150:4"/>
a direct courſe to the coaſt of the Newe found land. Al which oportunities beſides manye others, mighte ſuffice to induce oure Engliſhemen, not onely to fall to ſome traffique wyth the Inhabitants, but alſo to plant a Colonie in ſome conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent place, and ſo to poſſeſſe the Countrey without the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying of any man, whiche was the iudgement and counſell of <hi>Iohn Baptista Ramuſius,</hi> a learned and excellent Coſmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, &amp; Secretary to the famous ſtate of <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe words, bicauſe they are not impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to this purpoſe, I haue here ſet downe. Why doe not the Princes (ſaieth he) whyche are to deale in theſe affaires, ſende forth two or three Colonies to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite the Country, &amp; to reduce this ſauage natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſome ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilitie? conſidering what a battle and fruitfull ſoyle it is, how repleniſhed with all kinde of graine, how it is ſtored wyth al ſortes of Byrdes and Beaſtes, wyth ſuch faire and mighty Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, that Captaine <hi>Carthier</hi> and his company, in one of them ſayled vppe a hundreth and foure ſcore leagues, findyng the countrey peopled on both ſides in greate abundaunce. And moreouer, to cauſe the Gouernors of thoſe Colonies to ſend forth men to ſearch and diſcouer the North lands about <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra del Lauorader,</hi> and toward Weaſt northweaſt to the Seas whiche are to ſaile to the Country of <hi>Cataya,</hi> and from thence to the Ilands of <hi>Molucke.</hi> Theſe were enterpriſes to purchaſe immortall praiſe, which the Lord <hi>Anthony di Mendoza</hi> Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of <hi>Mexico,</hi> willing to put in execution, ſent forth his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains both by Sea and by Land vpon the Northweaſt of <hi>Nuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua Spagona,</hi> and diſcouered the Kingdome of the ſeauen Cities about <hi>Ciuola</hi>

And no doubt, if the French men in this their newe <hi>Fraunce,</hi> would haue diſcouered vp further into the land towards the Weaſt northweaſt partes, they ſhoulde haue founde the Sea, and might haue ſayled to <hi>Cataya.</hi> Thus much out of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſius,</hi> where you may ſee this learned mans iudgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

the planting of Colonies, and inhabiting theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, whych might be a meane, not only to diſcouer the Sea on the backe-ſide, as he deſireth, but alſo to come vnto the knowledge of the Countries adiacent: and namely of <hi>Sague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> whiche aboundeth with Golde and other Mettalles, as in the ſeconde Relation is to be ſeene. All whyche thyngs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte they builde and inhabite, can neuer be atchieued, for as <hi>Fraunciſcus Lopez di Gomara,</hi> and dyuers other Spaniſhe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors affirme, the Spanyards neuer proſpered or preuailed, but where they planted: whych of the Portingales maye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be verifyed, as in the Hiſtories of all theyr Conqueſts and Diſcoueries doth manifeſtly appeare. And as there is none, that of right may be more bolde in this enterprice than the Engliſhmen, the land being firſt found out by <hi>Iohn Gabot</hi> the Father, and <hi>Sebastian Gabot,</hi> one of hys three ſonnes, in the yeare 1494. in the name and be halfe of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth, as both by the foreſaide <hi>Ramuſius</hi> in his firſt Volumes, and our owne Chronicles, and <hi>Sebastian Gabots</hi> letters pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents yet extant, and in his Mappe maye be ſeene: ſo there is no nation that hath ſo good righte, or is more fit for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, than they are, who trauayling yearely into thoſe partes with 50. or 60. ſaile of ſhippes, might very commodiouſlye tranſporte a ſufficient number of men to plant a Colonie in ſome conuenient Hauen, and alſo might yeeld them yearly ſuccour, and ſupply of al things neceſſary, receyuing againe ſuch commodities as the country doth produce. And this the Frenchmen had done long ſince, if firſt their warres with the Spanyardes, and ſince their cruell diſſentions at home, had not hindered them. And <hi>Iohannes Varrozzana</hi> a Florentine, if he had not beene preuented by death, purpoſed (as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde <hi>Ramuſius</hi> writeth) to perſwade <hi>Francis</hi> the French King to ſend forth good ſtore of people to inhabite certaine places of theſe coaſtes, where the aire is moſte temperate, and the ſoyle moſte fruitfull, with goodly Riuers and Hauens ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to harborough any nauie, the inhabitantes of which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might be occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bring many good purpoſes to effecte,
<pb facs="tcp:5150:5"/>
and amongeſt manye others, to reduce thoſe poore rude and ignorant people to the true worſhip and ſeruice of God, and to teache them how to manure and till the ground, tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ouer Beaſtes and Cattell of <hi>Europe</hi> into thoſe large and champion countreys, and finally, in time they might diſcouer vp into the land, and ſearch, whether among ſo many Ilands as are there, there be any paſſage to the Sea of <hi>Cataya.</hi> And thus much oute of the third Volume of Voyages and Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, gathered into the Italian tongue by <hi>Ramuſius:</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che Bookes, if they were tranſlated into Engliſh by the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of ſome noble Perſonage, ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our Captayne anſwered him, that for all his ſaying, he woulde not leaue off his going thither, if by anye meanes it were poſſible, for that he was commanded by his King to goe as farre as poſſibly he could: and that if he (that is to ſay <hi>Taignoagny</hi>) would go with him, as he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

he ſhoulde be very wel entertained, beſide that, he ſhould haue ſuch a gifte giuen him, as he ſhoulde wel content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: for hée ſhoulde doe nothing elſe but goe with hym to <hi>Hochelaga,</hi> and come againe.

This done, <hi>Donna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cona</hi> cauſed all his people to be ſette of one ſide, then making a rounde circle vpon the Sand, cauſed our Captaine with al his people to enter therein, then he beganne to make a long Oration: holding in one of his handes a Maiden child <hi>10.</hi> or <hi>12.</hi> yeares olde, whych he preſented vnto our Captaine: then ſodainely beganne his people to ſende out thrée ſhréekes or howles, in ſigne of ioy and league of friendſhippe, preſently vpon that he did preſent vnto him two other yong Male chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren one after another, but yonger than the other, at the gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of whyche, euen as before, they gaue oute ſhréekes and howles very lowde, with other ceremonies: for whyche pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, our Capitaine gaue the ſaide Lorde greate and hearty thankes.

But concerning this, <hi>Domagaia</hi> tolde oure Capitaine, that their Lorde had gyuen him thoſe children as a ſigne and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of goodwill and friendſhippe, and that he was contented to goe wyth him to <hi>Hochelaga,</hi> vppon whyche talke greate

               <p>OVr Captayne the next day very earely in the morning, hauing very gorgeouſly attired himſelfe, cauſed all his company to be ſet in order to go to ſée the Towne and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe people, and a certaine Mountayne that is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what néere the Citie: with whome went alſo fiue Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and twentie Marriners, leauing the reſt to kéepe and looke to our Boates: we tooke with vs thrée men of <hi>Hochela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi> to bring vs to the place. All along as we went, we founde the way as well beaten and frequented as can be, the fayreſt and beſt Countrey that poſſibly can be ſéene, full of as goodly great Oakes as are in any wood in <hi>France,</hi> vnder whiche the ground was all couered ouer with faire Akornes. After we had gone about foure or fiue leagues, we met by the way one of the chiefeſt Lords of the Citie, accompanyed with manye mo, who ſo ſoone as he ſaw vs, beckned and made ſignes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that we muſt reſt vs in that place, where they had made a great fire, and ſo we did. After that we had reſted oure ſelues there a while, the ſayd Lord began to make a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, euen as we haue ſayd aboue they are accuſtomed to do in ſigne of mirth and frendſhip, ſhewing our Captayne and all his company a ioyfull countenance, and good will, who gaue him two hatchets, a paire of kniues, and a Croſſe, which he made him to kiſſe, and then put it about his necke, for whiche he gaue our Captayne heartie thankes. This done, we wente along, and about a league and a halfe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we beganne to find goodly and large féeldes, full of ſuche Corne as the Countrey yéeldeth. It is euen as the <hi>Millet</hi> of <hi>Breſill,</hi> as great, and ſomewhat bigger than ſmall Peaſon, wherewith they liue euen as we do with ours. In the midſt of thoſe féelde is the Citie of <hi>Hochelaga,</hi> placed néere, and as it were ioyned to a great Mountaine that is tilled round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:5150:30"/>
very fertile, on the toppe of whiche, you may ſée ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye farre, wée named it <hi>Mounte Roiall.</hi> The Cittie of <hi>Hochelaga</hi> is rounde, compaſſed aboute with timber, with thrée courſe of Rampires, one within another, framed like a ſharpe Spire, but layde acroſſe aboue. The middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of them is made and builte as a directe line, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular. The Rampires are framed and faſhioned with péeces of Timber, layde along on the grounde, very well and cunningly ioyned togither after their faſhion. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure is in heigth aboute two roddes. It hathe but one Gate or entrie thereat, whiche is ſhutte with piles, ſtakes, and barres. Ouer it, and alſo in many places of the wall, there be places to runne along, and Ladders to gette vp, all full of ſtones, for the defence of it. There are in the Towne aboute fiftie houſes, aboute fiftie paces long, and twelue, or fiftéene broade, builte all of woodde, couered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with the barke of the woodde, as broade as any boorde, very finely and cunningly ioyned togither. Within the ſayde Houſes, there are manye roomthes, Lodgings, and Chambers. In the middeſt of euery one there is a greate Courte, in the middle whereof they make their fire. They liue in commons togither: then do the Huſbandes, Wiues, and Children, eache one retire themſelues to their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They haue alſo on the toppe of their Houſes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Garets, wherein they kéepe their Corne to make their bread withall: they call it <hi>CARRACONNY,</hi> which they make as héereafter ſhall followe. They haue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne péeces of woodde, made hollowe, like thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wée beate oure Hempe, and with certayne Béetles of woodde they beate their Corne to powder: then they make paſte of it, and of the paſte, Cakes, or elſe Tartes, then lay them on a broade and hote ſtone, and then couer it with hote Tiles, and ſo they bake their Bread, in ſtead of Ouens. They make alſo ſundrye ſortes of Pottage with the ſayde Corne of Peaſe, and of Beanes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they haue greate ſtore: alſo with other fruites, as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:5150:30"/>
Muſke Millions, very greate Cowcombers. They haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in their Houſes certayne Veſſels, as bigge as anye Boate, or Tunne, wherein they preſerue and kéepe, their fiſhe, cauſing the ſame in Sommer to be dryed in the Sunne, and liue therewith in Winter, whereof they make greate prouiſion, as we by experience haue ſéene. All their viandes and meates are without any taſt or ſauoure of ſalt at all. They ſléepe vpon barkes of Trées layde all along vpon the grounde, with the Skinnes of certayne wilde Beaſtes, wherewith they alſo cloth and couer themſelues. The thing moſt pretious that they haue in all the Worlde, they call it <hi>ESVRONY:</hi> it is as white as any Snowe: they take it in the Riuer of <hi>Cornibotz,</hi> in the manner as héere followeth.

Of them they make beades, and weare them aboute their neckes, euen as we do them of golde, accompting it the preciouſeſt thing in the Worlde. They haue this vertue and propertie in them, they wyll ſtoppe or ſtench any bléeding at the noſe, for we haue proued it.

               <p>SO ſoone as we were come néere the Towne, a greate number of the inhabitoures thereof came to preſente themſelues before vs after their faſhion, making very much of vs: we were by our guides brought into the midſt of the Towne. They haue in the middlemoſt parte of their houſes a large ſquare place, béeing from ſide to ſide a good ſtones caſt, where we were brought, and there with ſignes were commaunded to ſtay: then ſuddaynely all the Women and Maydens of the Towne gathered themſelues togither, parte of which had their armes full of yong Children, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie as could, came to rubbe our faces, our armes, and what parte of the bodye ſoeuer they could touch, wéeping for verye ioy that they ſaw vs, ſhewing vs the beſt countenance that poſſible was, deſiring vs with theyr ſignes, that it woulde pleaſe vs to touche theyr Children. That done, the menne cauſed the Women to withdrawe themſelues backe, then they euery one late downe on the ground round about vs, as if they would haue ſhewen and rehearſed ſome Comedie, or other ſhew: then preſently came the Women agayne, euery one bringing a foureſquare Matte in manner of Carpettes, and ſpreading them abroad on the ground in that place: then they cauſed vs to ſit vpon them. That done, the Lord &amp; King of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> country was brought vpon nine or ten mens ſhoulders, (whome in theyr toung they call <hi>AGOVHANNA</hi>) ſitting vpon a great Stagges Skinne, and they layde him downe vpon the forſayde mattes néere to our Captayne, euery one beckning vnto vs that he was theyr Lord and King.

After he had with certayne ſignes and beckes ſaluted our Captaine and all his company, and by manifeſt tokens bidde vs all welcome, he ſhewed his legges and armes to our Captaine, and with ſignes deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to touch them, and ſo he did, rubbing them with hys owne hands: then did <hi>Agouhanna</hi> take the wreath or crown he had about his head, and gaue it vnto our Captaine, that done, they broughte before him diuerſe diſeaſed men, ſome blinde, ſome criple, ſome lame and impotent, and ſome ſo olde that the heare of their eyeléeds came downe and couered their Chéekes, and laide them al along before our Captaine, to the ende they mighte of him be touched: for it ſéemed vnto them that God hadde bene deſcended and come downe from Heauen to heale them. Our Captaine ſéeing the miſery and deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this poore people, recited the Goſpel of <hi>Saint Iohn,</hi> that is to ſaye, <hi>In the beginning was the word:</hi> touching eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one that were diſeaſed, praying to God that it wold pleaſe him to open the harts of this poore people, and to make them knowe his holy worde, and that they might receiue baptiſme and Chriſtendome: that done, he toke a booke in his hande, &amp; with a lowde voyce redde all the paſſion of Chriſt, worde by word, that al the byſtanders might hear him, al which while this poore people kept ſilence, &amp; were maruellouſly attentiue, loking vp to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; imitating vs in geſturs.

               <p>THe ſayd Riuer beginneth beyond the Iland of <hi>Thaſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi> ouer againſt the high Mountaynes of <hi>Honguedo,</hi> and of the ſeauen Ilands. The diſtance ouer from one ſide to the other, is about 35. or 40. leagues. In the middeſt it is aboue 100. faddome deepe. The ſureſt way to ſayle vpon it, is on the South ſide, and towarde the North, that is to ſay, from the ſayd ſeauen Ilandes, where from ſide to ſide, there is ſeauen leagues, where are alſo two great Riuers that come downe from the hilles of <hi>Saguenay,</hi> and make diuers very dangerous ſhealues in the Sea. At the entrance of thoſe two Riuers, we ſaw many and great ſtore of Whales, and ſea Horſes. Ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart the ſayd Ilands, there is another little Riuer that runneth along thoſe marriſh groundes about thrée or foure leagues, wherein there is great ſtore of water fowles. From the head of that Riuer to <hi>Hochelaga,</hi> there is about thrée hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred leagues: the originall beginning of it is in the riuer that commeth from <hi>Saguenay,</hi> which riſeth and ſpringeth among high and ſtéepe hilles: it entreth into that Riuer before it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the prouince of <hi>Canada</hi> on the North ſide. That riuer is very déepe, high, and ſtraight, wherefore it is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for any veſſell to goe vpon it. After that riuer, followeth the prouince of <hi>Canada,</hi> wherein are many people dwelling in open boroughes and villages. There are alſo in the circuite and territorie of <hi>Canada,</hi> along, and within the ſayd riuer, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Ilands, ſome great, and ſome ſmall, among whiche, there is one that conteyneth aboue tenne leagues in length, full of goodly and high tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That is the place and abode of <hi>Donnacona,</hi> and of our two men we tooke in our firſte voyage, it is called <hi>Stadagona.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come to it, there are foure other peopled Townes, that is to ſay, <hi>Ayraste, Starnatan, Tailla,</hi> whiche ſtandeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a hill, and <hi>Scitadin,</hi> and then <hi>Stadagona,</hi> vnder whiche Towne toward the North, the Riuer and Porte of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Croſſe is, where we ſtayd from the fiftenth of September, vntill the ſixtéenth of May 1536. and there oure Shippes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned drie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we haue ſayde before.

we might take ſome reſt the night following, we ſtaide that day, in hope the next day we might paſſe and auoyde the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the riuer of <hi>Saguenay,</hi> which are great. That euening we went a land and found great ſtore of Hares, of which we toke a great many, and therefore we called it <hi>The Ilande of Hares:</hi> in the night there aroſe a contrarie winde, with ſuche ſtormes and tempeſt, that we were conſtrayned to bende to the <hi>Iland of Filburdes</hi> againe, from whence we were come, bycauſe there was none other paſſage among the ſaid Ila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, and there we ſtayde till the one and twentie of that moneth, that faire weather and good winde came again: and then we ſayled again, and that ſo proſperouſly, that we paſſed to <hi>Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedo,</hi> which paſſage vntil that time had not bene diſcouered: we cauſed our ſhips to courſe athwart <hi>Pratos Cape,</hi> which is the beginning of the Port of <hi>Cator:</hi> and bicauſe the wind was good and conuenient, we ſayled all day and all night without ſtaying, and the next day we came to the middle of <hi>Brions I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,</hi> which we were not minded to do, to the end we might ſhorten our way. Theſe two Ilands lie Northweſt, &amp; South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt, and are about fiftie leagues one from another. The ſaid Iland is in latitude <hi>47.</hi> degrées and a halfe. Vpon Thurſday being the <hi>26.</hi> of the moneth, and the feaſt of the Aſcention of our Lord, we coaſted ouer to go to a land and ſhallow of low ſands, which are about eight leagues Sowthweſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Brions Iland,</hi> on which are large Champaines, full of trées &amp; towns, and alſo an encloſed ſea, of which neyther could we ſée or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any gap, or any way to enter therein. On Friday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, being the <hi>27.</hi> of the moneth, bycauſe the winde did change on the coſt, we came to <hi>Brions Iland</hi> againe, where we ſtayed till the beginning of Iune, and toward the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt of this Iland, we ſawe a land, ſéeming vnto vs as an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, we coaſted it about two leagues and a halfe, and by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way we had notice of thrée other high Ilands, lying toward the Sandes, after we had known theſe things we retourned to the Cape of the ſaide land, whiche doeth diuide it ſelfe into two or thrée very high Capes: the waters ther are very déep,

&amp; the floud of the Sea runneth ſo ſwift, that it cannot poſſibly be ſwifter. That day we came to <hi>S.

The Sonday followyng, beyng the fourth of Iune and Whitſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, we hadde notice of the coaſte lying Eaſt Southeaſt, diſtant from the new found land aboute <hi>22.</hi> leagues: and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wind was againſt vs, we went to a Hauen, which we named <hi>S. Spiritus Porte,</hi> where wée ſtayed till Tuiſdaye that we departed thence, ſayling along that coaſte vntill wée came to <hi>S.

Whileſt we were in the ſaid <hi>S. Peters Ilands</hi> we met with many ſhips of <hi>France</hi> and of <hi>Britaine,</hi> we ſtayed there from S.

Then vpon Monday, beyng the <hi>19.</hi> of Iune, we went from that Porte, and wyth ſuche good and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous weather we ſailed along the Sea, in ſuch ſorte, that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>6.</hi> of Iune. <hi>1536.</hi> we came to the Porte of <hi>S.
