         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

by mine owne consent,
I left the vniuersity: and
began to apply my selfe to the studye of
the common lawes of this realme: I
felt my selfe chiefelye hindred therein,
with the entermedli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of those studies,
the which, not without great delight,
I had afore time vsed. The whych, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I was lothe to continue, to the

with whom to trifle it had bene impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
I minded, to take my farewell of

might be most profitable to the quiete

I should giue my selfe: and also should

yet found I none more meete, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this.
Which whiles I redde, I must needes
confesse, that I was neuer more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with any worke, except it were
the sacred volume of the holye Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Wherfore, when I had perused

and, that our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, might at length

I endeuoured my selfe, althoughe not

passed forth vnder the protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of one

reading of Tullie, and hearken fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie
to this litle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, that
I craue at thy handes. I minde onely,
to excuse my selfe briefeli vnto the, and
so, to dismisse the. The matters, which
I thinke, colourablie may, and will be
obiected vnto me, are these. Firste, the
lacke of yeares, and eloquence, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the translation of so weyghtye a
booke: as, the very sages of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
haue let lye still, euen from the
time that it was first writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnto this
daye. Then, the prophaning of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes
of Philosophy, whiche are estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
onelye of the learned, and neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the multitude. And therfore, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:5"/>
to be made commen for euerye
man. First, as for mine owne vnable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
for yeares, I aunswere, by Plato
and this mine authour: that I knowe
nothinge, but that, whiche my soule
nowe setled in my body, recounteth, as
thinges learned before. And the soule,
shal neuer haue the body more apte, to
whatsoeuer thinge it listeth to dispose
him, then in his youthe: whyche is, in
maner, the greenenesse of the same.</p>
            <p>Since therfore, the bodye, whych hath
no knoweledge, but by reason of the
soule, is in youth most apte and able to
execute the inuentions of the same:
what cause is there, whye the wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
one of the principall partes of the
soule, should not chiefelye in this nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes
of the bodye, vtter her force and
vertue? Then, as for lacke of eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
First, this (I thinke) they wil al grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
That, it is not possible for any man, to
expresse the writinges of Tullie, in
Englishe, so eloquently: as he hath vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the same in latine. Then, for
mine owne translation: forasmuche as
it must of necessity, be either more sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:8426:5"/>
then, the stile of Tullie, or els
more foolishe, and ful of croked termes
(for Tullies meane none can attaine)
I had rather to be partener of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
due to simplicity, and plainenes:
then, with foolyshe and farre fet wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
to make my translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seeme more
darke to the vnlearned, &amp; more foolishe
to the wise. By which my playnenes,
withoute counterfaite eloquence, if I
haue gotten no other commoditye: yet,
thus muche I am sure of, that I haue
thereby escaped, the iust reproofe, that
they deserue, whiche thinke, to cloke
their ignoraunce, wyth inkehorne ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.
For, vnlesse it were in such thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as the Lodgicians terme names
of arte, for the whych, we haue no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Englyshe words: I haue vsed none
but the playne and accustomed ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.
Now: as touching the second ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,
which containeth the vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
disclosing of the miseries of lady
Philosophye (as mayster Grymoalde
termeth her) I thynke, that suffycient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
satysfyed, yf they consyder, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydes
the raskall multitude, and the
<pb facs="tcp:8426:6"/>
learned sages, there is a meane sort of
men: which although they be not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
yet, by the quicknes of their wits,
can conceiue al such poyntes of arte, as
nature coulde giue. To those, I saye,
there is nothing in this book to darke.
Especially, inasmuche as, the reading
of one booke, will open an other. And
thus, in my opinion, I am discharged
of vnprofitable reuealinge of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes
of philosophye. Inasmuche as,
both, I hope, it shall do muche good to
this sort of men, afore mencioned: and
also, I am sure, it can be nothing hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the learned. But shal much more
enflame, all liberall wittes, wyth the
desire of knoweledge: when they shall
see, so worthye matters, contayned in
one litle boke, of that, which we terme
philosophy or learning. Besides these,
there are yet other faultes, as the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing
of manye wordes, and the yll
printing of some greeke wordes, in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
letters, &amp; of the verses also, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
then they shoulde be red. But the
blame thereof I vtterlye refuse. Inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as, euerye man knoweth, that it
<pb facs="tcp:8426:6"/>
doth nothinge pertayne vnto me. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles,
as for the firste, whych con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth
the misprintinge of wordes,
thou shalt finde them, all corrected, in
the ende of the booke. So that if thou
list to reade it, without desire of faulte
findinge: thou mayst firste, amende all
those faultes, with thy pen, in the mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geant
of thy booke, whiche in the ende
of the booke be corrected. And so haue
the sense perfecte. And as for the two
last, they were caused by necessitie.</p>
            <p>The one for lacke of a Greeke letter,
and thother, for want of a smaller let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to print the verses in a lesse roame
And for other faultes, that maye be
found in my verses, I truste they wyll
pardon me, who may meruaile, howe,
so sodaynely I am become a versifier.
But, I beseche thee, (gentle reader) to
place eche mannes faulte by him selfe:
that I may be forced to father no other
mans faultes, then mine owne.</p>
            <p>Which, as I knowe to be more, then
I would they were: so I shall desire the
to weygh them with gentlenes.</p>
            <p>Knowynge, that if such, as haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:8426:7"/>
knoweledge, to set forthe thinges
more exactlye, should heare my plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
not ouermuche discommended:
they then, should be much more prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
wyth hope of the meruaylous
fame, that their doings should deserue
if they listed, to employe some paynes,
in attempting the like. Of the whych,
as I know there is a great number (in
both the vniuersities inespetially) so I
woulde wyshe, that eyther, they ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng
any longer, to enuie knoweledge

I thoughte good to endite the

I thought it could not be so wel vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode,
either in the Greeke, or by the
<pb facs="tcp:8426:10"/>
teachers of the same language: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
my iudgemente hathe bene euer
such, that our countreymen haue either
inuented and founde out thinges, more
wisely then the Greekes: or at the least
that suche as they had taken of theym
they had made farre more perfect: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if the thinges were suche, as they
estemed worthy theyr trauaile and pay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes.
For in maners, orders of liuinge,
and maynteyning of householde: We
truly behaue our selues both farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than they, and also more liberall.</p>
            <p>And as for the comen wealth, our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers

            <p>What should I saye of warfare? in the

            <p>But as for the giftes of Nature, and
such thinges as they might attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
without learning: neyther the Gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
neyther yet any other nation, may
well be compared with them. For,
what so greate grauitye? what so

honestye? or truste, what so pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe
vertue in all kynde of poyntes,
hath bene found in any nation? that it
maye for the same be compared with

            <p>Greece passed vs. Howebe it trulye it
was a light worke to excell vs in those
thinges, in the whyche we did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
wyth them.</p>
            <p>For where as the Greekes haue had
amonges the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the most auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Poetes
that euer were counted learned (for

then Plautus or Neuius. Of late
yeares therefore Poetes were of oure
<pb facs="tcp:8426:11"/>
countreymen both knowen &amp; receyued.
Albeit we find in those histories, which
were written in the firste foundation
of our city, that at that time, they were
wont in bankets to singe certayne son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
made of the noble prowes of vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt
men. But that such men were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

by the oration of Cato, in the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
he obiected it as a rebuke to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Nobilior, that he had taken wyth
him Poetes into his prouince. For he
had led into Aetolia the poete Ennius:
as we al wel knowe. The lesse therfore
that poetes were estemed, the lesse men
coueted theyr knowledge: and yet those
fewe that gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues thereto, were
nothinge inferioure to the renowne of

            <p>Honour bredeth artes, and all men are
prouoked to studye by fame: &amp; alwayes
those thinges are neglected, whiche no

there was great conninge and knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in singinge: as well to the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
as alone: &amp; for that cause Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minundas
(in my iudgement) the prince
of Grece) is reported to haue bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in singinge to the instrumentes:
and Themistocles a fewe yeres before,
for that in a certayne banket he refused
the harpe, was counted the worse lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Therfore in Greece Musicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished:
and euerye man learned theyr

            <p>Geometrye was in greate estimacion

there was nothing with them more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,

we haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prised the arte of Geometry

Gracchi: but afterward so many and so
notable me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen to this our time, that
herein, eyther not much, or els nothing
at all, we yelded to the Greekes. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
hath bene neglected vnto this
our age: and hath bene hitherto voyde
of the light of the latine tounge: which
now must be opened, and reuiued of vs
to thintent, that if in our businesse, we
haue somwhat profyted our countrey,
we maye also do the like by some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in this our time of leasure: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
also we ought to take the more pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
because there are certayne Latine
bookes written nowe a dayes very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduisedlye:
sette forthe by men honest
enough, but not sufficiently learned.</p>
            <p>Truly it maye well be, that some man
maye inuente well, and neuerthelesse,
that which he hathe inuented, can not

the hearer: it is the poynt of such
a one, as abuseth both leasure and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge.
Therfore, theyr owne bookes
they reade with such, as they them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
are: neyther doth anye man handle
them, except suche, as would haue the
selfe same libertye in writinge graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them. Wherfore, if we broughte
any helpe by our laboures, to the praise
of Oratours, we will much more dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
open the fountaynes of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophye:
out of the which neuerthelesse,
those oure workes of Rethorique dyd
flowe. But as Arystotle, a man of won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derful
witte, and profound knowledge,
moued wyth the greate fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte
of Isocrates the Rhetorician, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
bothe to pleade, and also to teache
yong men: and so to ioyne knoweledge
with eloquence: euen so it likes me, ney<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
to lay apart mine old study of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and yet neuerthelesse, to be occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
in this more noble &amp; plentifull art.
For I haue euer iudged that to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Philosophy, which could reason of
weighty matters, as well with great
knowledge as also w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> perfect eloquence
<pb facs="tcp:8426:13"/>
In the which kind of exercise I haue so
earnestly laboured my selfe, that nowe
I durst kepe scooles after the maner of
the Greekes. As of late after your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
in my manor of Tusculanum,
beinge accompanied with many of my
familier fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, I assayed what I could
do in that maner of reasoninge. For as
afore I declamed causes, so this is my
declaming in mine old age. I willed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man to propose whatsoeuer he listed
to heare debated: and thereof I disputed
eyther sittinge or walkynge. Therfore
my disputacions in scooles holden fyue
dayes together, I haue endyted in as
many bookes. The order thereof was
this. That when he who woulde heare
anye matter discussed, had shewed his
owne opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the same, then I should
hold the contrarye. For this is (as you
knowe ryght well) the auncient waye,
fyrste vsed by Socrates, to dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
all mens opinions. For so he
thoughte, that whatsoeuer was moste
true in anye matter, might soonest be
boulted out. But to the intent you may
more playnely perceyue our reasons, I
<pb facs="tcp:8426:13"/>
wyll wryte them as if the matter were
doing, not telling, therefore nowe take
you the beginning in this maner.</p>

               <p>Now I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the Greke

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hea.</speaker>
               <p>Surely
that is but a smal matter. But I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
               <p>Because, if after deathe, there is
no euell, neither trulye is death it selfe
euell: the next time to the whiche, is
the time after death, in the whych you
graunt there is no euel. So to die truly
is no euell, because it is but a leadinge
and an entraunce to that whyche is no
euell.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hea.</speaker>
               <p>I pray you, let these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
be more plainely opened. For these

the thing that you desyre, then to
agree to it. But I praye you, what are
those greater thynges whych you mind

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
               <p>To teache (if I can) that

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hea.</speaker>
               <p>I do not necessarily
requyre so much: but I greatlye desyre
to heare it. For albeit you bryng not to
passe, that whiche you minde, yet you
shall surely perswade me, that death is
<pb facs="tcp:8426:17"/>
no euell. But I will not trouble you in
your talke, I had rather heare you

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hea.</speaker>
               <p>Then I might be coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted

which you willed me to shewe, as well
as I can, I will declare. Neuerthelesse
I would not, you should take my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
as the Oracles of the god Apollo.
Or to thinke that whatsoeuer I shall
speake is sure and certayne: but as the
sayenges of some simple man, folowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
that whiche is probable by coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For farder then likelyhoode I can
not go. It is enough for theym, to tell
certayne and sure thinges, which saye
that such thinges may be knowen: and
also professe them selues to be wyse.</p>

               <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
               <p>Death
it selfe, which euery man semes so well
to knowe, we must fyrst see what it is.
For some thinke that it is the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
<pb facs="tcp:8426:18"/>
of the soule from the body.</p>
               <p>There be other some, whiche thinke
there is no departure, but that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
and soule do dye together. But of
them, which thinke that the soule doth
departe, some saye that he is strayght-wayes
scattered: other thinke that he
remayneth longe: some for euer. But
what the soule is, or where, or frome
whence, there is great dissensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Some
thinke the hearte to be the soule: of the
which, some men are called faynt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
madde hearted, and ioyned wyth
heartes in frendshippe. And the wyse
Nasica, who was twise Consull, was
called a litle heart: and
<q>A stoute harted man Catus Aelius
the syxt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Empedocles thinketh the soule to be a
certayne bloud about the heart. Other
some, take a certayne part of the braine
to be the soule. Other like none of these
opinions: but place the soule, partelye
in the heart, and partly in the brayne.</p>
               <p>And againe, the soule some men thinke
to be the life: as oure countreymen call
it. For we commonlye saye, to laboure
<pb facs="tcp:8426:18"/>
for lyfe: to ende his life: and to be longe
lyued. But to Zeno the Stoyke, the
soule seemes to be fier. And these opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
whiche we haue recyted, of the
hearte, brayne, lyfe, and fyer, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlye
reported. But euerye pryuate
man hath other inuentions: As manye
auncyente Philosophers afore tyme,
and of late, Arist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xenus a Musicyan,
and a Philosopher lykewyse, sayd that
it was a certayne consonaunce of the
bodye, like as we see in certaine songes
and instrumentes a certayne pleasaunt
concente and agreemente, euen so that
in the nature and shape of the whole
bodye, there were diuers motions stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
as in songes soundes and noyses.</p>
               <p>He lefte not his arte: and yet he sayde
somewhat: whyche verye thynge was
afore opened, and declared by Plato.</p>
               <p>Xenocrates denyed, that the soule had
anye shape or bodye: sayeng that it was
a thinge consysting onely of members:
the power of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whiche (as Pythagoras
had afore time declared (is of no small
force, in the constitucion of mans body.
<pb facs="tcp:8426:19"/>
His mayster Plato deuided the soule in
to thre partes. The chiefe of the which
(namely reason) he placed in the heade
as in a forte: from whiche he seperated
the two other partes: namelye angre &amp;
desyre: whiche he placed in diuers roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.
Anger in the brest, and desyre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
those places whiche are aboute the
hearte. But Dicearchus, in his bookes
whiche he wrytes of the reasonynge of
learned men kepte at Corinthe, in the
fyrst bringes in manye speakers: in the
other two he bringeth in a certayne old
man of Phthios, (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he calleth Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recrates,
&amp; sayes that he came of Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calion
(reasoninge that the soule is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
And that it is but a vaine name,
neither thinketh he, that there is either
minde or soule, in man or beast, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then a certayne motion, by the
whyche we both do and suffer, spred in
all liuing creatures alike. Neyther wil
he that it should be anye other thynge,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body so shaped, that by the force
of Nature, it may haue life and sense.</p>
               <p>Aristotle who farre passed all the reste
in wyt and diligence, (alwayes excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge
<pb facs="tcp:8426:19"/>
Plato) after he hadde treated of
those foure kind of principles, out of the
which al thinges take their beginning:
thought that there was a certayne fift
nature, of the whiche the soule &amp; minde
did consist. For to thinke, to foresee, to
learne, to teache, to inuente, and diuers
such other propertyes, as to remember,
to loue, to hate, to desyre, to feare, to be
vexed, to be mery: these and suche like,
he thought were in none of these foure
kynd of causes. Therfore he addeth to
them the fyft kynde, without anye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre
name, and calleth the soule &amp; mind,
by a newe name <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whiche
signifieth a certayne continuall and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
motion. Except perchaunce
a fewe, whiche I remember not: these
are the opinions of al the philosophers,
touchinge the soule. For as for Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crytus,
a worthye man, but yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
the soule of the chaungeable
meetinge of certayne lighte, round and
indiuisible bodyes, we will nowe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe.
For there is nothinge whiche a
company of Butterflyes wil not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
make with him. Of all these opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:8426:20"/>
whiche is moste true, let some god
iudge: but whiche is moste likely to be
true, there is great doubte. Whether
wil you therfore, that we trye oute the
truest of them? or els that we retourne
to our purpose?</p>

               <p>I woulde verye
fayne heare both: if it might be. But it
were very hard to confound them togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Wherfore, if wythoute the sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of these opinions, we may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
from the feare of deathe, I pray
you do that whych we haue in hande:

               <p>That whiche I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
you would rather haue done, that
also I thinke, is more commodious.</p>
               <p>For whych soeuer of those opinions be
true, I shall lightlye perswade you by
reason, that deathe is not euell but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good. For if the hearte, bloude, or
brayne be the soule, trulye, because ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them is a bodie, it shal dye with
the rest of the bodye. If it beaer, it shall
be dispersed: if it be fyre it shall be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched:
if it be Aristoxenus musicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
it shalbe dissolued. What shall I
saye of Dicearchus? who sayeth that
the soule is nothing at all. By all these
<pb facs="tcp:8426:20"/>
opinions there can nothing after death
pertayne to anye man. For euen with
our life our sense is lost: and he that fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
nothinge, neede not to passe, what

               <p>Shewe therfore fyrste (vnlesse it

               <p>To
proue this matter which you desyre, we
may vse as good authoures as may be:
which in all causes both ought and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
is wont to be of great importaunce:
and fyrst we may confyrme it by all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity:
which, the nigher it was to the
beginning of the worlde, and progenye
of the gods, so much the better (perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture)
did see those thinges, whyche
<pb facs="tcp:8426:21"/>
were true. For emonges those auncy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
fathers, (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ennius calleth Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos)
this one thinge was comen: that
there is in death feling: and that a man
by departing of his life, is not so vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extinguished, that he should altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
peryshe. And this may you gather,
both by many other thinges, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the lawe of the byshops, and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of burials: whiche they beynge
most wittye men, would neyther, with
so great care haue obserued, neither yet
being irreuerently or vnhonestly vsed,
would so sharpely haue punished: except
this had bene faste fixed in theyr min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
that death is no destruction vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
marring and blemishing al thinges,
but onelye a certayne departure and
chaunge of lyfe: the whiche to worthye
men, &amp; women, is wont to be a guyde
into heauen: and vicious and il disposed
persons, did cause to tary on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d:
and neuerthelesse to remayne stil. By
this opinion also, and by the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of our countreymen.
<q>Romulus in heauens with gods doth
passe his time.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8426:22"/>As Ennius the Poete, agreeing to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
fame, hath writen. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence
flyeng to vs, and so to the West Occe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane,
Hercules is counted so great, and
so mightye a god. For this cause Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,
the sonne of Semele, is so muche
reported. And in like maner famous
were the .ii. sonnes of Tindareus, who
not onely in field were helpers of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Romans, but also messengers
of the same. Also Ino, the doughter of
Cadmus, is she not of the Greekes by
the name of Leucothea, and of our coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>treymen
by the name of Matuta wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped?
What? the whole heauen (to
thintent I make no longer discourse) is
it not replenished with mankinde? for
if I should assaye to searche auncyente
monumentes, and put in writing, such
thinges as be in olde Greeke bookes:
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should you wel perceyue, that such,
as we count to be the greatest goddes,
haue departed out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, into those
places of heauen. But ignoraunt men
that knewe not naturall philosophye,
whych of late came into vse, perswaded
them selues so much, as they could ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:8426:22"/>
by naturall reason. The order and
causes of thinges they knewe not.</p>
               <p>They were ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moued by visions (and
those chiefelye in the nighte) to thinke,
that such as were dead, did liue againe.
Wherfore, like as we se it a very stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to beleue that there are gods:
because there is no nation so cruel, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet anye man so beastlye: in whose
mind there is not fixed some opinion of
God. (Many neuerthelesse haue concea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued
diuers foolishe fancies of the gods)
but yet they graunte all that there is a
diuine power and nature. Neyther yet,
doth the communication or agreement
of men, cause this consent, the opinion
is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by no decrees, by no lawes:
but in euery thing, the argement of all
nations is taken for the law of nature:
So likewise, in asmuch as all nations,
haue worshipped their benefactors as
gods after theyr death (although some
more foolyshe then other it is euident,
that nature hath engraffed in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of all men, a natural opinion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that our soules are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
and remayne after this life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8426:23"/>But who is there, that would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle
the death of his friend? when he
thinkes, that he is depriued the commo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dities
of this life. Take away his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye,
and you shall take awaye all mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
For no man mourneth, but for
his discommodity. For we sorowe, and
are vexed, and all our wofull lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and sad mourning, ryseth hereof,
that him whom so entirelye we loued,
we suppose to lacke the commodities of
this life, and that to feele. And these
thinges we ymagine, onely by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting
of nature, wythout eyther rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or learninge. And hereof we wyll
talke hereafter. But the greatest ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
by the whych we may gather,
that nature it selfe, doth priuily thinke
of the immortality of our soules, is that
moste wise men, take greatest care for
thinges to come after their death.</p>
               <p>Some one sets trees, whiche may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte
in an other age (as Statius say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in his bookes entituled Synephebi
to what other ende? but for that he
knewe, that the time to come did also
pertayne vnto him? for the same cause,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:23"/>
diuers diligente husbandemen graffe
trees, whose encrease they shall neuer
see. And likewyse, manye noble men
make lawes, orders, and customes, the
obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the which, they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
beholde. What? the begettinge of
children? the spreading of fame? the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>options
of children? the diligent obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
of testamentes? the very monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
&amp; Epitaphes of graues? what
other thing do they signify? then that,
we haue al a respect to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time to come?
Besydes this. There is no doubte, but
the tryall of nature, oughte to be taken
of the best nature. But what mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyrs, which thinke
theym selues borne, to helpe, saue, and
comfort men? Hercules is departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hence to the gods. To them he shoulde
neuer haue gone, vnlesse whiles he
was emonges men, he had prepared
him selfe a way thither. But these are
old matters: and nowe also sanctifyed
by religion. What shall we thinke, of
so manye, and so notable men, in thys
our comen wealth, whiche willinglye
toke theyr deathe, for theyr countreyes
<pb facs="tcp:8426:24"/>
sake? Did they (think you) suppose? that
their memorye shoulde be extended no
lenger then the terme of theyr lyfe?</p>
               <p>Trulye, no man at anye time was so
madde, as without hope of immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to offer him selfe to deathe for his
countrey. For otherwise, it had bene
lawefull for Themistocles: to haue ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in ease, it had bene lawefull for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paminundas:
It had bene also (that we
enquire no farder of old and forren mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters)
lawfull for me. But (I knowe not
howe) there sticketh in mens mindes, a
certayne gesse of life to come: yea, and
that doth most commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly happen, in the
most stoute and harty courages, and in
them appeares most lightlye. Whiche
hope taken away, who is there so mad,
that would continually liue in laboure
and daunger? and hitherto we haue spo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of princes. But do we not se the like
of Poetes? will not they be remembred
after theyr death? Uppon what cause
then, was this writen?
<q>
                     <l>Behold ye Citisens here the shape of
Ennius image old.</l>
                     <l>Who hathe descriued youre fathers
<pb facs="tcp:8426:24"/>
factes &amp; eke their gestes hath told.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Lo, he requireth the report of fame, and
renowne at theyr handes, whose fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
he had caused by his writynge
to be famous. And the same Ennius,
wryteth in another place thus.
<q>
                     <l>Let no man me bemoane, nor wayle
me when I dye.</l>
                     <l>For whye? aliue my good reporte in
mouthes of men shal flye.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But what doubte we of Poetes? yea,
suche as liue by handcraftes, desyre af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death to be remembred. For what
other cause dydde Phydias, graue hys
shape in the tergat of Minerua? where
it was not lawefull for him to wryte?
What? the Philosophers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, do
they not in those bookes whych they
write of the despising of glory, imprint
their owne names? Certes, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of all men be the voice of nature, &amp;
al men in al places do agree, that there
is some thing, that doth pertaine to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
which are departed out of this life: we
also must nedes thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. And since
we know, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they whose mind passeth ei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
in wit or vertue (because their wit
<pb facs="tcp:8426:25"/>
is best) do se most clearely the power of
nature. It is most likely, forasmuch as
euery good man taketh care for his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
that he supposeth that there is
some thing, the sense and feeling of the
which, he shal haue after death. But
as we knowe by nature that there be
gods: But what they be, we gather by
wyt and reason: so we thinke because
of the consent and agrement of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that our soules do remayne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death. But in what place they be,
or what maner thinges they are, we
must gather by reason. The ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of the whiche, hath fayned and inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
hell and such terroures, as you see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
somewhat afore not without iuste
cause to despyse. For our bodyes being
layd in the grounde, and couered wyth
earth (whereof also suche as are buryed
are sayd to be earthed) they thought the
reste of our life should be led vnder the
ground. Which opinion hath bene the
cause of great errours: Whyche haue
bene augmented and encreased by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etes.
For the thicke companye of the
Theater, in the which there are many
<pb facs="tcp:8426:25"/>
women and children, is muche moued
hearing so terrible a verse as this.
<q>
                     <l>I here am come from hell, by wayes
full hye and steepe.</l>
                     <l>By dennes ybuylte with stoanes, by
caues ful darke and deepe.</l>
                     <l>Where lothly darknes dwels, where
cralling furies creepe.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Yea and that errour was of such force,
(which nowe I truste is nye extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed)
that whereas they sawe, mennes
bodyes burne afore: yet neuerthelesse,
they would fayne them doing such thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
in hell, as withoute bodyes, coulde
neyther be done in deede, neyther yet
ymagined. For they could not wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue,
howe the soule might liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute
the bodye: and for that cause, they
ymagined that they liued vnder some
certayne shape and figure. Uppon this
occasion, Homere wrote his booke
whiche he entituled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Hereof
spronge that Necromancie, whiche my
friende Appius was wont to use. For
this cause also, was the lake that stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not farre from mi house, called the
lake of hell.
<q>
                     <pb facs="tcp:8426:26"/>
                     <l>Whence soules are stireed vp, in darke
and grisely shapes.</l>
                     <l>Whyche when hell gates are opened
once, out at the doores escapes.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet neuerthelesse, these shapes and sha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dowes
they fayne to speake. Whyche
can not be wythout the tounge iawes,
sydes, and lyghtes. For they conceyued
very litle in theyr mindes: but referred
all to theyr bodelye eyes. But it is a
great point of wyt, for a man to reuoke
his minde, from the iudgement of his
outward senses, and to withdrawe the
consent of his thoughtes, from thinges
that haue bene alowed by custome.</p>
               <p>And I beleue trulye, that there haue
bene manye other, whiche in all ages
haue reasoned of the immortalitye of
the soules. But of those whyche haue
left any writinges behinde them, Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recides,
a Sirian taught firste, that the
soules of men were euerlasting. A man
surely of great antiquitye. For he liued
in the time of my kinsman Tullus Ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stilius.
This opinion, his scoler Pytha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>goras
did chiefely confyrme, who when
he came into Italye, in the raygne of
<pb facs="tcp:8426:26"/>
Tarquinius the proude, amased all
great Greece, with his estimation, lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning,
and authoritye. Yea, and manye
yeares after the name of the Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans
was so highely esteemed, that in
comparyson of them, no other Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
seemed to be learned. But let vs
retourne to those aunciente Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.
Commenly they would geue no
reason of anye thinge, that they spake
vnlesse it were same such thing, as they
should declare by numbers or descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
It is sayde that Plato, to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that he myghte knowe the Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goreans,
came into Italye: and there
was acquaynted both with manye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but chyefelye wyth Archytas and
Timeus, of whome he learned all the
opinion of Pithagoras: and that at the
fyrst, he not onelye thought as Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras
did, as concerninge the eternitye
of the soule, but also confyrmed the
same wyth reason. Whych (vnlesse you
be otherwyse minded) let vs ouerpasse,
and leaue of all this reasonynge of the
immortalytye of the soules.</p>

                  </gap>
you haue broughte me into so great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectacion?
I had rather to erre wyth
Plato (whom I knowe howe much you
esteeme, and I wonder at the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of your prayse) then to thinke wel
wyth other.</p>

               <p>Worthelye spoken.
For I my selfe assuredly, would not be
aggrieued to erre with him. And is
there anye doubte, but that as he hathe
handled al other thinges very learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
and profoundly, so he hath done this
also? although this hathe leaste nede of
cunning handeling. For the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians
do well proue it sayeng, that
the earthe, whiche is placed in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
of the world, in comparison of the
whole heauen, hath but the proportion
of a small poynt, whych they call a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.
And such is the nature of those four
bodyes, of the whyche all thinges take
theyr beginning, that they haue equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
diuided motions. So that all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and watery bodyes, do naturally fall
downe into the earth and sea, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
namelye fierye and aerye, lyke as
the fyrste .ii. because of the heauines of
<pb facs="tcp:8426:27"/>
theyr weyghte do tende to the middest
place of the world, so these by righte ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
flye vpwardes into the heauenlye
region: eyther because they them selues
naturallye do moue vpwardes, or els,
because they being light bodyes, are by
force dryuen from the other whiche are
grosse and heauy. Whiche sayenges,
forasmuch as they are certayne, it must
nedes folowe, that our soules, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei
are departed from oure bodies, yf they
be of fyerye or aery nature, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
ascende into the higher regions.
But if the soule be some number (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
was spoken more wittelye then
playnely) or if it be that fifte principle,
(as well the name as the nature of the
which, no man can vnderstand) vndoub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tedlye,
eyther of theym are so pure and
perfect thinges, that at theyr departure
they can not abyde on the ground. And
truly some one of these is the soule. For
so quycke a spyryte lyeth not drenched
in the heart, brayne, or bloude, as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedocles
saieth. But as for Dicearchus

of the whyche, the one seemes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to haue felt ani griefe, who thinkes
that he hathe no soule, and the other is
so delighted with his notes and tunes,
that he assayeth to allude them to these
earnest matters. But a harmonye is
made of the diuersitye of tunes, the sun
dry settinge of the whyche, maye make
many sweete harmonyes: but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitye
of a mannes lymmes, and the
whole shape of his bodye, withoute a
soule what harmonye it maye make,
I can by no meanes vnderstande. But
he be learned, may in this matter geus
place to his mayster Aristotle, and he
himselfe practise singi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. For it is wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
counsayled of the Greekes in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne

               </p>
               <p>But that foolyshe opinion, of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge
together of certayne indiuisible,
lyght, and rounde bodyes, let vs vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
roote out: which neuerthelesse De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus
ymagineth to be whole and
<pb facs="tcp:8426:28"/>
breathing, that is to saye of an aery na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
So the soule (whych if it be of any
of those .iiii. bodyes, whereof all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are made, doth vndoubtedly consist
of fyer, whiche opinion Panetius also
liketh best) must nedes flie to the higher
regions: For those .ii. elementes, name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye
fyer and aer, haue no fallynge, but
go alwayes vpwardes. So it comes
to passe, that whether they are scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
farre from the earth, or els do abide
and alwayes kepe theyr owne nature,
by all these reasons it must necessarilye
folowe, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> our soules ascend vnto heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
deuiding thys grosse &amp; compound aer,
which is next to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth. For our soule
is more whote, or rather more fyerye,
then this aer, which I termed whilome
grosse and compound. And that hereby
we may wel perceiue: because our dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishe
earthly bodies do ware whote, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
the heate of our mindes. Furthermore,
it must nedes be, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the soule must light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passe through this aer (whiche I doe
often terme grosse) because there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
more swifte then it, neyther
anye suche quickenesse, as may by anne
<pb facs="tcp:8426:29"/>
meanes be compared with the quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the same. Whiche if he remayne
vnwasted, and like to his former being
he muste needes so moue, that he, shall
pearce and cut all this lower aer, in the
which, cloudes, wyndes, and showers,
are gathered. Which is both moist and
cloudye with the exhalracions of the
earth. Which region after it hath once
passed, and attayned to a nature like to
it selfe, being there stayed amiddes the
lighte aer, and temperate heate of the
sonne, he resteth vppon the fyer, and
there maketh an ende of ascending any
higher. For when it hath gotten heate
and lyghtnes congruent to his nature,
then as a thing equallye paysed, it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
neyther vpwardes nor downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes.
And there at the last is his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
seate, when it hath once pearced
to thinges in nature like to it selfe. In
the whiche wythoute the want or lacke
of any thinge, it shalbe nouryshed, and
sustayned with suche foode as the ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
theym selues are fed and nouryshed
wythal. And whereas here, the prickes
of the fleshe are wont commonly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame

vs, to all ill motions, as we are
so muche the more kindled by them, as
we enuy those, that haue the same thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
that we desyre to haue: then trulye
we shal be happy, when our bodyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ones dissolued, we shall be rid from
all yil desyres and emulations. And
that, whiche we nowe do when we are
voyde of eare (I meane the giuinge of
oure selues, to the consideration and
weyghing of some thing perteyning to
knoweledge) that shall we then do
with much more libertie, and setle oure
selues wholy, to the contemplation and
viewinge of nature: both because natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallye
there is graffed in oure mindes,
an insatiable desyre to know the trouth
and also because the place it selfe, to the
whiche we shall come, because it wyll
shewe vnto vs, a more easie knowledge
of those thinges whyche we desyre to

desyre and loue of knowledge, the beau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye

se not so much as those thinges whyche
we se with our bodelye eyes, neyther is
there any sense in our bodye. But (as
not onelye the naturall Philosophers,
but also the Phisicians do saye, who
haue seene the same opened and disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
certayne wayes and holes there be,
bound frome the inner vaute of oure
minde, to our eyes, eares, and nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrilles.
And for this cause sometyme
it hapneth, that we are so blynded, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wyth some sadde thought, or vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente
disease, that oure eyes and eares
beynge both hole and open, yet we can
neyther heare nor see. So that we may
well perceyue, that it is oure mynde,
that seeth and heareth, and not those
partes, whiche are but the casementes
of the same. Without the whyche, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse,
the minde it selfe can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
nothinge, vnlesse it be earnestlye
bent thereon. Besydes all this, what a
thinge is it, that the minde onelye, can
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine thinges of most diuers nature?
as colours, tastes, feelynges, smels and
soundes? which by the .v. se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ses only, the

mind could neuer discerne, were it not
that al thinges comming to it by them:
it onely is iudge of all. And then truly,
these thinges shall be more playne and
clearely sene, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the soule is come
to his owne naturall libertye. For now
in deede, althoughe nature hathe verye
suttely wrought certayne passages fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the soule to the body: yet neuerthelesse,
the same are compassed, and in maner
stopped vp wyth certayne grosse and
earthlye bodyes. But when there shall
be nothinge, but the soule it selfe, then
there shal be no let, but that it may wel
discerne and iudge, what eche maner of
thinge is. I could here describe (if my
matter so requyred) howe manye, and
howe sundrye delectable syghtes the
soule shall haue, in those heauenlye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.
The whych, sometimes when I
do remember, I can not but wonder at
the vanitye of certayne Philosophers,
whiche haue the secrete knoweledge of
naturall philosophye in great admyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian:
and therefore thanke and prayse
wyth all theyr hartes, the inuenter and

God: sayeng, that by this his benefyte,
they are deliuered of ryght heauy may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:
that is to wite, continuall terror,
and dayly and nightly feare. For what
so doating a foole is there, that woulde
feare those thinges, whiche you, if you
had not the knoweledge of natural phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
would haue feared.

               </p>
               <p>Is it not a shame, for Philosophers to

haue perswaded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, that at the

(for I wil not at this time muche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with them) what haue they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
eyther to be glad or proude of? ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet can I see anye cause, why the
<pb facs="tcp:8426:32"/>
opinion of Pithagoras &amp; Plato, should
not be true. For were it so, that Piato
brought no reason (see in what estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I haue that man) his verye autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye
should moue me. But he hath con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmed
his opinion wyth so manye
proofes, that it appeareth, that both he
was willing to perswade and also hath
perswaded. But there be many against
him, whyche thinke our soules co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to death: neyther is there any other

                  </gap>f the same, then because they
can not well ymagine or thinke, what
maner thing the soule should be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the bodye. As though they coulde
vnderstande, what maner thinge it is,
whiles it is in the bodye: what shape it
hathe, what quantitye, or what place.
But if it were possible, that they might
see all the inwarde partes enclosed in
mannes bodye, whyche nowe are sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
frome oure syghte: whether they
should see the soule, or whether it is of
suche subtill nature, that they could by
no meanes discerne it, that let theym
weyghe, whyche denye, that they can
<pb facs="tcp:8426:32"/>
ymagine any soule wythout the bodye.
they must fyrst see, what maner thinge
they will thinke him to be, whyles he
is in the bodye. For to me assuredly (dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
times, when I ponder with my
selfe the nature of the soule) it seemes a
farre darker and deeper consideration,
to thinke, what and howe the soule
coulde be in the bodye, as in a straunge
habitation: then what it shall be, when
it shall depart from thence, and flye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the open heauens, as to his propre
and appoynted place. For if it be not
possible for vs to comprehende in oure
mindes such thinges as we neuer sawe
then, neyther god him selfe, neither yet
oure soule that came from God, what
it shalbe, when it is departed from our
bodyes, can we well ymagine. Dicear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus
and Aristoxenus (for that it was
a deepe and a weyghty matter, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syder
what the soule might be) said that
there was no soule at all. And surelye,
it is the chyefest poynt of wytte, wyth
the soule to knowe the soule: and that
is the wyse meanynge of that sage
<pb facs="tcp:8426:33"/>
precept of Apollo, whyche willeth vs to
knowe our selues. For I can not think
that it shoulde bidde vs to knowe oure
lymmes, stature, or shape. For we are
not bodyes: neyther, when I speake to
you, do I talke to your body. Therfore
when he sayeth knowe thy selfe, he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as muche in effecte, as knowe thy
selfe. For thy bodye is but the vassayle,
and dongeon of thy minde. Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thy soule dothe, that is thine owne
deede. And vnlesse it had bene thought
an heauenly thing, to knowe the soule:
that precepte had neuer bene taken to
haue bene of such excellency, as to haue
bene imputed to God. But, if he know
not, what maner thinge his soule is,
howe shall he knowe, that he him selfe
eyther lyueth, or moueth? And hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
is grounded that reason of Plato,
whiche is declared by Socrates, in the
booke called Phedrus, and rehearsed
of me, in my syrt booke of a come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> welth
That which alwayes moueth, is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastinge.
But, aswell that whiche mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
other thinges, as also that whiche
is moued by other, whan it ceasseth to
<pb facs="tcp:8426:33"/>
moue, ceasseth also to liue. Onelye that
therefore, which moues it selfe (because
it can neuer forsake it selfe) can not but
moue. It also, is a fountayne and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge
of motion, to other thinges
whych are moued. Nowe of a principle
there can be no beginninge. For of a
principle all thinges are made, and it
takes his beginning of no other, (for it
were no principle, if it toke beginninge
of any other thing.) Then if it hath no
beginning, neither hath it any ending.
For a principle being ones extynct, can
neyther it selfe at any time be reuyued,
neyther yet create, or make anye other
thing, wheras al thinges take theyr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of a principle. So we see, that
the beginning of al motions, procedeth
of that which is moued of it selfe. But
that, can neyther haue beginning, nor
ending (not though the skie should fal, &amp;
all thinges stande at a staye) neyther
yet any outward force, by the which it
should be moued. Wherfore, inasmuch
it appeareth, that that is euerlastyng,
whych moueth it selfe: and no man will
denye that our soules are of that sorte,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:34"/>
(for whatsoeuer is moued by anye out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not of it selfe, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
life) it must nedes folowe, that since
it is the onelye propertye and nature of
the soule (amonges so manye sundrye
thinges) to be moued of it selfe: it ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at any time heretofore had begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge,
nor at anye time hereafter shall
haue endinge. Let all the raskall Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
laye theyr heades togither,
(for so it semeth good vnto me to terme
them, whyche swarue from Plato, and
Socrates, and from theyr sect) they shal
neither at any time expresse any thinge
so eloquently, neither yet be able to per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyue
how suttelye this selfe same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is concluded. The soule therfore,
perceiueth that he him selfe doth moue:
wherewithall it feeles also, that it is of
his owne power, and not of any forren
force: &amp; that it can by no meanes chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

also, that we coulde by no meanes,
from oure childhoode haue the generall
groundes of so many thinges placed in
our mindes, vnlesse oure soule afore it
entred into our bodye, had liued in the
knoweledge of the same. And whereas
the body is nothing, as Plato in all his
workes doth reason (for he takes that
as nothing, which hath had beginning
and shall haue ending, and that onelye
to be which shall continue for euer) the
soule could not come to the knowledge
of these thinges, whiles he was enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the bodye, but brought them thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wyth him. Neyther yet dothe it

when it sodaynelye cometh into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,

that it hath reuoked and reposed it

knewe before. So to learne is no other
thing, then to remeber. But I do won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at oure remembraunce after an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

do remember? or from whence hath our
nature that force or power? I do not

Symonides was, eyther of Theodec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
or els of Cyneas, the ambassadour
whych came from Pyrrhus to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,

For although you do not see, what our
reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce is, yet what maner thing
it is, you may wel perceyue. Or, if that
you can not do, yet you may wel vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
how great a thing it is. Shall we
then thinke, that there is any capacity,
or voide place in the soule, into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which
as into a vessel, all those thinges which
we do remember are powred? That tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye
were very foolyshe. For, what bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
mighte there be, of such a vessell?
or, what mighte be the shape, of suche
a soule? or what so greate widenes
mighte there be in the soule? What?
<pb facs="tcp:8426:36"/>
should we thinke, that our soule is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed,
as it were waxe, and that our
remembraunce is the ouersight of those
thinges, which sticke imprynted in our
heartes? But what pryntes may there
be of wordes? eyther what suffyciente
marckes of thynges? or what so huge a
space maye there be in the soule, in the
which all those thynges whyche we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
myght be prynted? Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
what thynke you of that parte of
our mynde, whyche syndeth oute suche
thynges, as were neuer knowen before
and is therefore called inuention, can
that be made of this earthlye, frayle,
and compounde nature thynke you?</p>
               <p>What thinke you of him, whyche fyrst
of all, gaue euerye thinge his propre
name (whyche Pythagoras counted a
part of great wisedome) or of him whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
fyrst gathered men together, to one
society, &amp; felowship of life? what thinke
you of him also, who firste co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prised the
tunes of our voice (which somed to be in
maner infinite) in a fewe notes? Or of
him, who first marked y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> motions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
&amp; stations of the .7. planets?
<pb facs="tcp:8426:37"/>
How iudge you also of them, who fyrst
founde oute corne, cloathinge, houses,
orders for mans life, &amp; defence againste
wilde beastes? by whom, after that we
were tamed, and broughte from wilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
besydes oure necessities, we haue
inuented thinges for pleasure. For ther
is inuented, a temperate varietie of the
diuers nature of sundrye tunes, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyght
our eares, and also our eyes toke
great pleasure, in marki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, as wel those
sterres, whyche are fastned in certayne
places of the fyrmament, as also the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whiche are called (althoughe they
be not so in deede) wanderers: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersions
and motions of the whyche,
whose soule did fyrste perceyue, he dyd
playnely teache, that his soule was like
to him, which had fyrst made those thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
in heauen. For, when Archymedes
made the motions of the Moone, the
Sonne, and the other fyue Planettes,
in the artificiall Spheare, he didde as
muche as God (whome Plato bringeth
in in his booke entituled Tymcus, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
the world) when he made the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge
of one Spheare, to rule seuerall
<pb facs="tcp:8426:37"/>
motions, differynge bothe in slowenes
and swyftenes. Whiche, if in the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the whole worlde it can not be
done, wythout the hand of god, neither
coulde Archymedes in his materyall
Spheare, haue imitated the same, with
out an heauenlye wyt. Neyther yet can
I see, howe these accustomed thynges
with the whych we are dayly acquayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
can be done wythout an heauenlye
power. As that a Poete shoulde wryte
a graue and full verse, wythoute some
heauenlye influence, or that a man
should be eloquent with pleasaunt wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des,
and weyghty sentences, wythoute
some greater inuention, then the witte
of man. But philosophy, the mother of
all artes, what other thynge is it, then
(as Plato sayeth) the gyfte and (as I
thinke) the inuention of the gods? She
fyrst taught vs the worshippe of them,
and secondarelye, to vse right towards
all men, and then afterwardes mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stye,
&amp; stoutenes of stomake. She draue
away all darkenes from the soule, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
it is in the prison of the bodye, that
it might see all thinges, as well highe
<pb facs="tcp:8426:38"/>
and lowe, as farre and neare. And sure
lye, this seemes to me, to be a heauenly
thynge, whyche dothe so manye and so
wonderfull thinges. For what is the
remembraunce of wordes and deedes?
what is inuention? assuredly such thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
they are, as a man can not imagine
greater, in god him selfe. For I do not
think, that the gods are delighted with
the foode whyche the Poetes call Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosia,
or wyth the heauenlye drynke,
whych they call Nectari: neyther can I
thinke, that they haue yonge boyes
waytynge at theyr tables: neyther do I
beleue Homere, whyche wryteth, that
Ganimedes was taken vp into heauen
to be cupbearer to Iupiter. It is no suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
cause, why he should do Laome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
so much iniury. Homere fayned it,
and applied the qualities of men to the
gods. I had rather that he had deriued
the properties of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods vnto vs: name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
to be wyse, to inuent, and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
The soule nowe, whych (as I saye)
is a heauenly thing, as Euripides fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not to saye is god him selfe. And
truly, if god be either aer or fyer, he is
<pb facs="tcp:8426:38"/>
the soule of man. For as the heauenlye
nature is voyde bothe of earthlye sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and also wateryshe moysture, so
in lykewyse, is the soule of man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of none of them bothe: But if
it be a certayne fyft nature (as Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
first inuented) assuredlye, as well the
gods, as our soules, do consyste of the
same substaunce. Which opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
haue thus expressed, in our boo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes
which we entituled of consolation.
there can be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d no original nor begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning
of our soules in the earthe: sith in
them nothinge is mixt or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pound, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
made or framed of earth, nothing
moyst or a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rye, ne yet of fyerie nature:
for in these foure natures there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge,
that hath the power to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
inuent, or ymagine, that can either
beare in memory thinges paste, foresee
such as are to come, or rightly weyghe
such as are prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Which propertyes &amp;
giftes, as they are heauenly, so no man
can imagine howe they maye come to
man but from God. Whereby it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that the nature of the soule, is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then these foure: &amp; seperated from
these accustomed &amp; commen natures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8426:39"/>So whatsoeuer it is, that can discern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
by the senses, can iudge by discrecyon,
or can wil, or not will, that must nedes
be of an heauenly force and power, and
for that selfe same cause euerlastynge.
For god him selfe (whome we can not
conceyue, but by the force of oure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandinge)
we can ymagine to be no
other thing, then a loose and free soule,
seperate frome all mortall concretion,
seenge and mouing all thinges, it selfe
beinge moued of nothinge, and of this
selfe same force and nature is the mind
of man. Where then, or what is thy
soule? canst thou tel me where, or what
maner thinge it is? But if I haue not
so manye helpes to the knoweledge of
my soule as I woulde wyshe to haue,
wilte thou therfore let me, to vse those
thinges, which I haue to the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinge
of my soule? the soule is not able
in this bodye to see him selfe. No more
is the eye whyche although he seeth all
other thinges, yet (that whiche is one
of the leaste) can not discerne his owne
shape. But admit that the soule can not
consider him selfe: howebeit perhaps he
<pb facs="tcp:8426:39"/>
may. His operacions, as quyckenes of
inuention, sure remembraunce, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
and swiftnes of motion, it doth
well ynoughe perceyue. And these be
greate, yea heauenlye, yea euerlastinge
thinges. But of what shape it is, or
where it resteth we oughte not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre.
As when we see the forme and
beautye of the heauens, furthermore
suche quyckenes of motion, as we can
scarce conceyue, also the continual cour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses
of day? and nyght, the foure chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

all the beautie of vertue, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> must nedes
confesse the diuyne &amp; heauenlye power
of the same. In what place is it then? I
thinke truly in the heade. And whye I
so thinke, I can bryng many reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8426:41"/>But that we will referre to an other
time. And now dispute where the soule
is. In thee he is assuredlye. What na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hathe it? a nature properlye belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to it selfe, as I thinke. But admit
that it had the nature eyther of fyer or
aer. For that is nothinge to oure pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
This onely consyder, that as you
knowe God, althoughe his place and
shape you knowe not, so likewyse, you
ought to conceyue your soule, although
you knowe neyther his mansion place,
nor forme. And trulye, as concernynge
the soule, we can not doubt (vnlesse we
will confesse oure selues wholye igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt
in naturall philosophy,) but that
there is no motion in the same, no com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>position,
no concretion, no copulation,
nor coagmentacion. Which if it be so,
assuredlye it can neuer be seperated, de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parted,
disseuered, or sundred: and for
that cause, neyther can it die. For death
is the departing, seperatynge, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge
of those partes, whiche before
death were conioyned. Wyth this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and suche like, Socrates being mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued,
did neyther desyre anye patrone to
<pb facs="tcp:8426:41"/>
pleade for him, when the iudges gaue
him dome of death, neyther yet became
he an humble sutor to theym, for the
lengthning of his lyfe. But vttered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
a stoute stubbernes, procedinge
not of pryde, but of a hautye courage.
Yea, and the very last daye of his lyfe,
he reasoned much of this selfe same que<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stion:
and a fewe dayes afore, when he
might easely haue bene conueyed oute
of pryson, he would not: and finallye at
the time of his deathe, holdinge in hys
hand the cuppe that should poyso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him,
spake in such sort, that he seemed not to
be compelled to dye, but wyth a ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
desyre to clyme vp to heauen. For thus
he thought, and so he taught, that ther
were .ii. wayes and courses of our sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
when they departe oute of oure bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes.
For such as had defyled them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues

what pleasure is in deathe, do dye sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginge

that as ofte as we muse muche of the

as they are wonte to be, who when
they haue a long space beheld the sonne
are made in maner blynde with the
bryghtnes thereof. And so likewyse the
eyes of our minde beholdyng it selfe, do
often ware dimme: and by that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
we lose the diligence of contempla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
of the same. So the indgemente of
<pb facs="tcp:8426:42"/>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
state, &amp; come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Grecians. But
Cato our countreyma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so departed out
of thys life, as one that was glad, that
he had gotten iust occasion to dye. For
that god that ruleth wythin vs, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs to departe hence withoute his
leaue. But when soeuer he shall gyue
vs a iust cause (as he did to Socrates,
now of late to Cato, &amp; often heretofore
to manye other) then truly, euery wise
man wil gladly depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

he to breake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bandes of his prison (for
that the lawes of god do forbid) but to
depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence when he is deliuered
&amp; called by God, as an officer or other
lawfull power. For all the life of wise
men (as he in like wise sayeth) is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tise

to it selfe, and to wythdrawe it
selfe, as muche as may be, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
of the bodye: and to separate
the soule from the body, is nothing els

that is as much to saye, let vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome

talke of those partes, in the whych, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
anger, and lustes are. Which, he
against whom I nowe reason, thinkes
to be sundred and seuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mind.
For the likelynes of nature, doth more
appeare in beastes, which haue no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
but the outwarde gesse of the soule
of man, doth much consyst in the shape
of his bodye. For it is much materiall,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:45"/>
in what sortes of bodyes the soules be
placed. For there be manye thinges in
the bodye, that quycken the minde, and
manye thinges whiche dulle the same.
Aristotle sayes, that all wittye men be

He reckens vp manie thinges to

shewes the reason of it. Then, yf there
be a great force of those thynges that
are in the bodye, as concerning the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the mynde, there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitye,
why the workes of the soule
should be alyke in euerye bodye. But I

               <p>What harme (I praye you)
doth that opynion brynge? admyt that
our soule shall dye as our body? is there

in our bodye? no man sayeth so: albeit
Epicurus layeth it to Democritus
<pb facs="tcp:8426:46"/>
charge. But his scolers denye it. Then
if there be no feelynge in the bodye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
deathe, neyther doth there remaine
anye sense in the soule. For it is in no
place. Where then is the euell? But
perchaunce they will saye, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partynge
of the bodye from the soule,
is not wythoute griefe. Admyt that
there be some, howe litle is it? howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
I thynke there is none at all.</p>
               <p>For it happens commonlye wythoute
anye sence, yea, and some times wyth

so euer it be. For it is done in a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute

vs, or rather vexeth vs, the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
from all those thinges, whyche
we counte commodityes in oure lyfe.
But I feare me that they may be more
trulye called euels. What shoulde I
here bewaile the lyfe of man? although
I well maye, and that vppon iusts
and good occasyon.</p>
               <p>But what neede I, inasmuche as I
do intreate, whether after deathe we

shall be wretches, to make our lyfe in

we haue done that sufficientlye, in that
booke, in the whiche (as muche as we
might) we haue comforted oure selues.
Deathe therfore, deliuereth vs from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels,
and not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goodes, if we speake
the truthe. And that truly, is so large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reasoned of Egesyas the Cyreman,
that he was forbidden of the king Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeus
to teache the same in scooles:
for that many after his doctrine, dydde
wyllingly kyll the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues. There is an

Cleombrotus the Ambrocian: whome
he sayes, after that he had perused Pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tos
booke of the immortalitye of the
soules, foorth wyth wythout any other
apparent cause, caste him selfe heade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longes
downe from a wall. But the
matter of the booke of Egesias (of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
I spake euen now) is such. He faineth
that a certayne poore man, departed
out of this life, for want of necessarye

by his frendes: whom he aunsweryng,
reciteth all the discommodityes of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
<pb facs="tcp:8426:47"/>
I coulde do so in likewyse: howe beit I
would not do it in such sorte as he dyd:
who counteth it good for no man to
liue in this worlde. I knowe not what
it were for other: but I am sure that
death had bene beste for me. Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
nowe depryued of all comfort and
worshyp, both at home and abroade, if
I had afore time bene extinct by death:
I had assuredlye thereby bene delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from much care, whyche since hath
chaunced me, and not from any ioye or
pleasure. Admit therfore, that there be
some one man who hath no aduersyty,
who hath in no part felt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cruell stroke
of fortune. As the honorable Metellus
with his foure sonnes, and Priamus
wyth fyftye, of the whiche .xvii. were
borne of his lawefull wyfe, in bothe of
them fortune had the like stroke. But
to the one she shewed her selfe more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable.
For Metellus, many sonnes
and doughters, neuewes and neeces,
accompanyed to his graue. But Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus,

                  </gap>ye as it happened. But if he had
dyed at that presente, had he departed
from prosperitye, (thinke you) or from
aduersitye? from aduersity vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.
For then he had not waged warre
with his sonne in law, he had not bene
fayne to flye to armes beynge vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided,
he had not left his house nor fled
Italye, and finallye his armye beynge

to fall into the handes of his seruaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:
his poore children, al his substance

Loe, all suche miseryes are preuented
by death, although they do not caunce
yet because they maye chaunce.</p>
               <p>But men thinke that no suche thynge
can happen vnto theym, euerye man
hopes for the good lucke of Metellus:
as though either ther ought to be more
lucky men then vnlucky, or there were
any certaynty in the lyfe of man, or els
it were the part of a wyse man, rather
to hope, then feare. But let vs graunt,
that men lose manye commodityes by
deathe. Then will they saye that suche
as be deade, do lacke the commodityes
of this life, and therfore are miserable.
For so they must nedes reason. But I
pray you, can he which is not, lacke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
thing? this worde lackynge is a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowefull
terme. For there is included
in it, that he once had it, and nowe he
hath it not, but wants it, lackes it, and
misses it. I thinke, that is the discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditye

this must be discussed: what it is to
lacke: that there maye be no doubte in
the worde. To lacke therfore, signyfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the want of that, which you would
haue. For there is a wyshinge for those

as we take this worde in an other sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
<pb facs="tcp:8426:50"/>
For we say we lacke a thing,
in an other sense also. As whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue
not a thing, and we perceyue the lacke
of it, howebeit we may well abide the
want therof. But none of these wayes
can we terme anie lacke in death. For
we can not be sory for anye thinge that
we lack. That is sayde, to lack a good
thinge, whych is of it selfe euell. But a
man beyng aliue doth not lacke a good
thinge, vnlesse he feele the misse of it.
But of a liue ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, one may say, to lacke
a kingdome. Howbeit not so properly,
of such a one, as you who neuer was
kynge. But well of Tarquinius, who
was banished oute of his realme. But
in a dead man we can conceyue no such
thinge. For to lacke is properly sayd of
him whych feeles the lacke. But there
is no feeling in a dead man. No more
therfore is there any lacke in him. But
what nede we in this point to play the

that nothynge can be in it, which
is not, what can there be hateful in it,
which neither doth lacke, neither feele
anye thynge? Howbeit we haue talked
<pb facs="tcp:8426:51"/>
of this to ofte. But I do it because that
herein consisteth all the feare, that we
conceyue of deathe. For when we see,
that our soules and bodies being spent
and all oure partes beynge brought to
fynall destruction, that whyche was a
lyuynge creature, is nowe become no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge:
we muste nedes perceiue also,
that betwyxt a thyng that neuer was,
and kyng Agamemnon, there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ference.
And in like sorte, that Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
dead long since, doth now no more
force for the ciuill warre, which is kept
at this present, then I toke thought for
the takyng of Rome, at suche tyme as
he lyued. Why should Camillus then
be sorye, if he had knowen in his lyfe
time, that .350. yeares after him, suche
thynges should happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? or I, yf I should
imagine, that ten thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yeres hence,
some straunge nation should race oure
city. Yet such is the loue, that we owe
to our countrey, that we take thought
for it, for the good wil we beare it, and
not for any harme, that we beynge bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed,
may haue by the destruction of it.
Wherefore, deathe can not so feare a
<pb facs="tcp:8426:51"/>
man (which because of thincertainty of
our lyfe, doth continuallye hange ouer
our heades, &amp; also because of the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of oure age can neuer be farre of)
but that he ought continuallye to haue
more respect to the commen welth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to his life. And that he oughte also to
thinke, that those which shall come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, whose commodities or discom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>modities
he shall neuer feele, do in like
wise pertayne vnto him. therfore, euen
those that iudge our soule to be mortal,
may attempte thinges, whose remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
shall long endure, not for anye
desyre of glory, whyche they shal neuer
feele, but for the good wyll they bare to
vertue, whom glory of necessitie dothe
folowe, albeit you looke not for it. But
the nature of al things is such, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> as our
byrth, is the originall cause and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
of all those thynges whyche we
haue, so in likewyse oure deathe is the
ende of the same: the payne of which,
as it did nothinge pertayne vnto vs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our lyfe, so neyther shal it after our

be in death? whych pertayneth neyther

to complayne, yf she requyre it of thee
when she lyffe? For thou hadst it vnder
such condicion. The same men, thinke
it a heauye case for one to dye beynge

               <p>Yet neuerthelesse, of hym dyd nature
more sooner requyre that whyche she
had lent. O whyles he was a boye (say
they) he had not smatched the swetenes
of lyfe. But he was in lykelyhoode to
attayne to greate worshippe, whyche
euen at the time of his deathe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne

it is counted better to attayne to

then it should be otherwyse in our lyfe.
Howebeit Callimachus said very wel,
that Priamus had wept farre oftener

prayse muche theyr chaunce, which dye
in theyr age: and why so? Because (as
I thinke) if they might liue lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, their
life could be no pleasanter, then it hath
bene. But assuredlye, there is nothing
that a man may take more pleasure of,

Yet that assuredlye olde age

Do we not see, that age hath ouertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
them, which were euen now but boyes

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
we call it longe. And so euery thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges

muste needes folowe, that eyther thys
death wyll take awaye all sence from

Wherefore, yf my sense shall be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyncte,

be put to death. And ye O iust iudges,
whyche haue heretofore quitted me,
feare ye not deathe. For no harme can
happen to a good man, neyther in thys
lyfe nor after. For the gods aboue, wil
not ceasse alwaies to haue him and his
in theyr protection. For this selfe same
death, comes not to me by chaunce, but
by the iust iudgement and appoyntme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of god. And for that cause I am not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grye

which is the better, the immortal gods

<pb facs="tcp:8426:57"/>
By whose sayenge, I am put in
minde, to speake somewhat at this pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent
of buryal. Which shal be nothing
hard, presupposyng those thinges to be
true, whiche we haue afore spoken of
not feelinge. And of this, what Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
thought, it appeareth in that booke
in the whiche his death is described: of
the whyche we haue made mention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
For after that he had reasoned of
the immortality of the soule, and now
his death drewe on, beyng demaunded
of Crito, howe he would be buryed, he
lookyng towardes them that stoode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, spake these wordes. My fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
(quod he) I haue spent much labour
in vayne. For I haue not perswaded
my frende Crito, that I shall departe
hence, and leaue nothing behinde me,
that is mine owne. But trulye Crito,
yf euer thou canst come by me, or euer
get me, burye me as thou lyste. But I
knowe righte well, that when I am
hence departed, none of you all wil so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
me. Wyselye spoken. For he dyd
both permit his friende, to satisfye his
minde, and yet neuerthelesse shewed,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:58"/>
that he litle past of any such thing. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes
more rechelessely, yet wittely
inoughe, but with small ciuilitye, as a
doggyshe philosopher, wylled them to
cast his bodye abrode, wythout buryal.
And when his frendes asked him, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
he would then haue his bodye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
of byrdes and beastes?. No not
so sayeth he. For I pray you set a staffe
nye to me, that I maye dryue theym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye.
And when they asked him howe
he could do so, inasmuche as he shoulde
haue no sence after death? What hurte
shall I haue then (quod he) of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
of beastes, and peckynge of byr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
when I feele it not? But Anaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras
spake wisely, who when he was
lykelye to dye at Lampsacus, and his
frendes demaunded of him, whether if
he should chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to die there: he would
be caryed to Clazomena, to his owne
countrey, it nedeth not (quod he) for fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
euery place, there is like dista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of way
to heauen and hell. Wherfore as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng
buryall, we must knowe this,
that it perteyneth to the bodye onlye,
whether the soule dye or lyue. And in
<pb facs="tcp:8426:58"/>
the bodye it is playne, that after the
soule is once departed, there remaineth
no sense. But see howe full the worlde
is of errour. It is wrytten, that Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
drewe Hectors deade bodye at a
cartes tayle. I thinke he thoughte that
he felte the gratynge of his limmes.
And therfore he bragges of it, as if ther
by he were reuenged. But Hectors mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther

with these wordes.

               <p>Do you see in what errour this felowe

harber and reste of the bodye. Trulye
there was a greate faulte in Pelops,
that he taughte his sonne no better,
howe muche he ought to esteeme bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
But what should I here recken vp
the opinions of euerye seuerall man,
synce we may see the manifest errours
of manye nations, as concernynge bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryall.
The Egiptians spyce the deade
bodyes, and keepe theym in theyr hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
The Persians sere theyr bodyes in
waxe, and then spyce theym, that they
may abyde as longe as may be. There
is a custome amonges the wyse men
of Chaldee, not to engraue the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dies,
afore suche time, as they be torne
of beastes. In Hircania, they keepe
commen dogges, such as be noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
houndes, and the commen people ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
curres, euerye man accordinge to
his abilitie, that eate them when they
be deade, and that do they counte the
best buryall. Chrisippus, hath wryten
manye sundry fashyons as concerning
<pb facs="tcp:8426:60"/>
the same matter: as he is a man verye
diligent, in the readynge of historyes.
But some of theym be so cruell, and so
muche agaynste nature, that my pen
abhorres to endite theym. Wherfore
as concerning buryall, we oughte not
much to force it: neyther yet oure fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
to neglecte it: so that alwayes we
keepe this opinion, that the bodyes of
the deade, care for nothing. But what
men oughte to doe, for customes and
good names sake, that our fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des that
ouerlyue vs muste see to: so that they
knowe, that it nothinge pertayneth to
suche as are deade. But then trulye,
death is most welcome vnto vs, when
our lyfe beyng well nye at the wane,
can comforte it selfe wyth his owne
prayses. For no man hathe lyued to
small a whyle, which whiles he lyued,
dyd lyue vertuouslye. I my selfe haue
manye iuste occasyons of death, which
I woulde to god, I myghte haue pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in execution. For there is nothynge
that I dyd desyre more. For I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nothyng. I had plenty of worship,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:61"/>
so that euer after, I did looke for warre
and battaile wyth fortune. Wherfore,
if reason will not moue vs, to despyse
death, yet let our lyfe forepassed do it:
when we thinke we haue deserued suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
prayse and glory. For although
oure sense be paste, when we are once
deade, yet neuerthelesse we do not wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
the due reward of glorye and fame, for
those thinges, whych we haue done in
oure lyues. For although glorye of it
selfe hath no cause, why it should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syred,
yet neuerthelesse, it alwayes fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth

But as for the wronge iudgemente of

               <p>There is the like, in the booke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,

With these and such like authorities,
they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme this cause to be adiudged
by the immortall gods. Alcidamus an
auncient oratour, a man of great fame
wrote in commendacion of death: who
lacked the weighty reasons of philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie,
but had plenty of wordes inough
But the notable deathes, whiche men
suffer for their countreye, seeme to the
rhetoricians, not only glorious, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
blessed. They rehearse Erictheus,
whose doughters suffered voluntarye
death, to saue the life of theyr citesins.
And Codrus, who willingly entred in
the mids of his ennemies in the armor
of a commen souldiour, to thinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that
he mighte not be knowen to be kynge.
Because there was an oracle geuen,
that if the king were flayne, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should
the Athenienses haue the victory. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do thei ouerpasse Menecheus, who
hauing the like oracle giuen, bestowed
his bloud for his countrey. Iphigenia
also, was willinge to be slayne at Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide,
that by her bloud, her countreyme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
might more easely sheade the the bloud
of theyr ennemies. Then they come
<pb facs="tcp:8426:64"/>
nigher. They remember Harmodius,
and Aristogiton, Leonidas also the La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cedemonian,
&amp; Epaminu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>das the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban.
They knowe not our countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
whom it would aske great tyme
to recken, there be so manye, to whom
we knowe that glorious death was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye
welcome. Which inasmuche as
it is so, I must nedes wishe, that either
men would hereafter desyre deathe, or
at the least wise, ceasse to feare it. For
if at the last daye of our lyfe, our soules
dye not, but onely chaunge their place,
what ought we more to wyshe? But if
death do vtterlye destroye vs, what can
be better, then in the rage of great stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
swetely to slumber? and after that
a man hath nodded oute of this lyfe, to
sleepe euerlastingly. Which if it be so,
then oughte we rather to allowe the
wordes of Ennius, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Solan, for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius

he must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye

But yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse,
but in
fewe thinges: for
vniuersally it likes him not. And I tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
(O Brutus) must nedes vse philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
(for wherein may I better employe
my time of leasure?) But I can not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite
it to a fewe thinges onlye, as he
doth. For it is very harde, that a man
should be any thing skilfull in philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
wythout the knoweledge of moste
thinges, or all. For a man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not chose
<pb facs="tcp:8426:66"/>
a fewe thinges, but out of a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
and it is not possible, that he which
hath gotten a litle knoweledge, should
not with earnest desire study, to knowe
the rest. But neuerthelesse, in a busye
lyfe, and (as Neoptolemus then was)
much troubled with warre, both a litle
is profitable, and turnes to muche vse:
(But yet not suche as may be gathered
of all Philosophye) and yet suche ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse,
as we maye thereby be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
of desire, care, and feare. As bi that
disputacion, which we kept last in oure
manor of Tusculanum, we seeme to
haue wrought a great despyte of death
whiche is of no litle force to ease oure
mind of feare. For who soeuer feareth
that, whyche by no meanes maye be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded,
he surely, can not by any possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitye,
enioye the fruyctes of a quyete
life. But who soeuer (not onely because
he must needes dye, but also because
there is nothing in death to be feared)
doth not passe on death, he assuredlye,
hath gotten him selfe a strong staye, for
a quyet lyfe. Although I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt,
that many will speake agaynste
<pb facs="tcp:8426:67"/>
it: whose vayne reproche I could by no
meanes anoyde, vnlesse I should write
nothing at al. For if in myne oracions,
in the whiche I somewhat esteeme the
fauour of the people (for that rethoryke
is an arte appliable to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men voyce
of the people, &amp; the verye ende and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of eloquence, is the prayse and
commendacion of the hearers.) If then
I saye there were some, whiche would
like nothinge in my oracions, in the
wittes, they them selues were not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to passet and would extend their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendacion
in other mens workes no
further, then they thought their owne
whyche mighte well attayne the same:
and for that cause when any other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> passed
them in weyght of sentence and
eloquence of wordes, woulde saye, that
they lyked rather a thinne and base
then so plentifull a stile (of the whyche
sorte also they were, that were called
Attici, who boasted the profession of
that, whyche no man els knewe, who
nowe are almost laughed out of al cour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes).
If then in the allowynge of mine
orations the people were of seuerall
<pb facs="tcp:8426:67"/>
mindes, what maner of hearer (thinke
you) shall I in this grauer matter
haue of the same? For philosophy sekes
not the iudgement or prayse of manye,
but of purpose flyes the preace of the
comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people, of whom it is alwayes
eyther feared, or hated. So that, if ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any man lyst to disprayse it who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
he may do it wyth the good will of
the people, or els if he will chiefely dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
that, whych we nowe treate
of, he maye haue sufficiente ayde out of
the bookes of other philosophers. But
we haue aunswered all the foes of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophye,

and whatsoeuer was to be spo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken

            <p>But yet neuertheles, so much it lackes
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I would be angry or displeased, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man should write against the same,
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I wishe it euen with all my hert. For
philosophy in Greece it selfe, had neuer
come to suche perfection, vnlesse there
had bene suche contention, and diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sytye
amonges the best learned men,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:68"/>
as concerninge the same. Wherfore I
desyre all suche as are able to do it, that
they woulde helpe to take this prayse
also from Greece, that is already fayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and bring it into this our citye, as
our auncesters haue already done by al

perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that nowe (as natures course

to waxe aged, and within this shorte

            <p>Wherfore, nowe let philosophy, begin

But I who in al thinges folowe
probabilitie, and can go no farther the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:8426:68"/>
others without any stubbernes
and also to be writen agaynst, without
anye anger. If so we maye brynge this
kinde of exercise, from the Grecians to
our countreymen, we shall not wante
the helpe of the Greke libraries, which
are stuffed with an iufinite company of
bookes, wryten of the same matter.</p>
            <p>For manye haue wrytten the same in
effect that some others haue done afore
them. So that the noumber of bookes
is infinite. The which shal in likewise
happen to vs, when many geue theym
selues to wrytynge. But I will assaye
chiefelye to prouoke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to write, who
being wel learned, and instructed with
perfect eloquence, can endyte philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phye
with a good trade and order. For
there is a certayne sort of men, whych
wyll needes be counted philosophers,
that are reported to haue wryten ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
latine bookes, whiche surelye I do
not despise, because I neuer redde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
but inasmuche as the aucthours them
selues, do playnely confesse, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they can
wryte neyther distinctlye, orderlye, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
nor trimlye, I assuredlye neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb facs="tcp:8426:69"/>
the readyng of that, which shoulde
nothynge at all delyght me, inasmuche
as they care not, what they wryte: I
knowe not why anye man shoulde be
bounde to reade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but suche as ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of
the same opinion that they be. For as
all men reade Plato, and the workes
of other, scolers of Socrates, &amp; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
of others, that were taughte of
them, although they agree not in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
wyth them, or at the least wise do
not greatly alowe them, but Epicurus
and Metrodorus none almost handles,
but suche as be of theyr owne secte, so
these late latine wryters they onelye
reade, which thinke the same to be wel
and wysely wryten. But me semeth,
that whatsoeuer any man would set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode,
ought afore to be commended by
the iudgement of suche as are learned.
And for that cause, the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t custome
peripatecian and academias, to reason
on eyther parte of euery question, doth
maruaylously well like me: not onelye

delyghted, or rather strengthened with
your yesterdayes reasonynge. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I am assured, that I was at no
time to muche desyrous of my lyfe,
yet neuerthelesse there woulde come
<pb facs="tcp:8426:70"/>
come sometime both feare and gryefe,
to my heart, when I thoughte, that I
should one day lose the fruition of this
pleasaunt light, and eke of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
of this life. Of this trouble
assuredly, I am nowe so eased, that I
care for nothinge lesse.</p>

               <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
               <p>It is no
maruayle truly. For such is the effecte
of philosophye: it helpeth the minde, it
taketh a way all vayne care, riddes the
mind of desyre, and driues away feare:
but this her power is not of like force
wyth all men. But then it worketh
most, when it chaunceth on a good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For stoute men not onely fortune
doth helpe (as the olde prouerbe is) but
much more reason. Whiche in maner
wyth certayne preceptes, confyrmeth
the strengh of fortitude. Nature fyrste
made you hye minded, and meete to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
all earthlye thinges, and for that
cause, in your stoute stomake', the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of sufferynge death is lyghtly
rooted. But thinke you, that these selfe
same perswasions, do so much preuaile
wyth them (except very fewe) of whom
they were first inuented, reasoned, and
<pb facs="tcp:8426:70"/>
written? No truly. For howe manye
philosophers shall you finde, whose life
and behaui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur is such as reason requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth?
Or that doth vse theyr teachynge
not as a brag and boastinge of knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but as the law and order of good
life? Or howe manye of theym shall ye
fynde, that are ruled by theym selues,
or obeye theyr owne decrees? you shall
see some of such lyghtnes, and arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
that it had bene better for them, ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer
to haue learned. Some other coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
men: many verye desyrous of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye:

                  </gap>aues of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
So that, theyr talke and their life
seemes meruaylously to differ, whiche
assuredlye, seemes to me a thyng wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye
great reproche. For like as if one
that did professe gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer, should speake
false latine, or one that would be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a musician should sing out of tune,
his fault were so muche the worse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is in that kynde of knowledge
which he professeth: so lykewyse, a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
shewing yll example of liuing
is so muche the more to be blamed, as
he offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in that thing, of the which

he professeth him selfe a teacher, and
professinge the arte of lyfe, offendeth in

            <sp>
               <speaker>Hea.</speaker>
               <p>Is it not then to be

                  </gap>
wythout a cause? For what can be a
greater proofe, that it is not auaylable
then that diuers notable philosophers
do lyue abhominably?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
               <p>Truly it is
no proofe at all. For as all fieldes that
are tilled are not fruitefull, and it was
falsely sayde.
<q>
                     <l>Although the fruitefull seede in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren

                     <l>Yet it at length wil there take roote

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So not all the mindes that are sowen
with the seede of philosophy, do brynge
fruyte therof. And that I maye persyste
in the same similitude, as the grounde

doubted not to saye, that griefe
is the greatest euel that might happen
to man. This nice and effeminate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
Epicurus was verye readye t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

take: and after him one Hierome a
Rhodia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sayd, that to want griefe, was
the greatest good that myghte be. So
much euell he thought was in sorowe.
And diuers other, except Zeno, Aristo,

worse then it. For that which both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it selfe, and also all stoute courage
<pb facs="tcp:8426:72"/>
doth deny, I meane that you should not
counte griefe the greatest euell that
myght be, but that shame didde farre
passe the same) that also philosophy the
maistresse and lady of our life doth still
mayntayne. For what dutye, what
prayse, what ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esty, will he so muche
esteeme, that he will put his bodye to
payne for the attayninge of the same,
who thynketh gryefe to be the chyefest
euell? And what shame, what disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
would not a man suffer to escape
gryefe, yf he thoughte it to be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
miserie? To conclude, who is there
not wretched, not onely then, when he
is oppressed with payne, if griefe be so
miserable, but also in asmuche as he
knoweth it may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him? For
who is there to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it can not chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce?
So hereof it must needes folowe, that
none at all can be blessed. Metrodorus
truly thynkes him to be happy, whose
bodye is in good health, and is assured,
that it shall be so for euer. But who is
he, that can promise him selfe any such
assuraunce. Nowe Epicurus opinion
is suche, that I thinke he inuented it
<pb facs="tcp:8426:73"/>
purposelye to moue men to laughter.</p>
               <p>He affyrmeth in a certayne place, that
yf a wyse man be burnt, if he be vexed,
yet he will beare it, and not yelde vnto
it. A great prayse surelye, and worthye
of Hercules him selfe. But yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
this will not suffyce Epicurus
a hard and a stoute man (god wot).</p>
               <p>For he albeit he were in Phalaris bul,
will saye, o howe pleasaunt is it? howe
litle do I care for it? yea it is eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sweete
to me. Why is it not inough, if it seme
not bitter? For they truly them selues,
that saye that gryefe if no euell, are
not wont to saye, that torment is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt
to any man. But that it is sharp
hard, hatefull and agaynst nature: and
yet neuerthelesse no euell. And he that
thynketh this onely to be euel, yea and
the extremest of all euels, thinkes that
a wyse man will count it pleasaunt. I
do not requyre you to terme griefe so
lightly, as Epicurus (a man wholy gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to pleasure) doth. Let him saye on
gods name, that it were alone to him,
to be in phalaris bull, and in a softe fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therbed:
I do not requyre in a wise ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8426:73"/>
so great pacience agaynst gryefe. If he
be able to perfourme his dutye in suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it, I do not requyre him to be glad
of it. For vndoubtedly, it is a heauye
thyng, sharpe, bitter, enemy to nature,
hard to beare, and suffer. For see Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locteta,
whom we muste gyue leaue to
mourne. For he had seene Hercules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

of the greatnes of the griefe that he suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fered.

               <p>You say trouth. But
he did it withoute anye choyce or elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
But Philo both kept the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his verse, and vsed choyse therin
and placed them also conueniently.</p>
               <p>Wherfore since the time that I fyrste
fell in loue with this declamation of
mine olde age, I doe gladly brynge in
my talke the verses of our poetes. And
if they chaunce to be imperfecte in any
poynct, I haue translated the same out
of the Greeke: because I woulde not,
that our tongue should want any kind
of ornament that the Greekes had.</p>
               <p>But do you see the discommoditie that
Poetes cause? Fyrst they bring in stout
men lamenting, which weakeneth the
readers courage. Then they be so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt,
that men do not onlye read the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but also learne them wythout booke.</p>
               <p>So, when to litle learninge, and to a
wanton and effeminate life, poetes are
once adioyned, they vtterly slake all the
prickes of vertue. And for that cause,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:78"/>
they are worthelye banished of Plato,
out of that cicie, whiche he framed as
the most perfect forme of a well framed
and gouerned common welth.</p>
               <p>Yet neuerthelesse, we beinge learned
so to do of the Grecians, do both reade
theym euen from oure youthe vpwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
and also learne theym withoute
booke: thinkinge their learninge to be
both good &amp; honest. But what shoulde
we blame Poetes? since there haue ben
philos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>phers, who ought to haue bene
the maysters of all vertue, which haue
thoughte sorowe &amp; gryefe to haue bene
the greatest euell: and whereas you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but a yonge man, and euen nowe
of the selfe same opinion, with thys
onely demaund, whether it were grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then shame, did foorthwyth relente
and forsake your vaine opinion: Now<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
aske Epicurus the same question, and
he will say, that small griefe is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
euell, then the greatest shame that
maye be. For he wyll saye, that shame
is no euell, vnlesse gryefe do folowe.</p>
               <p>I meruayle then, that there dothe no
gryefe folowe Epicurus, when he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:8426:78"/>
that gryefe is the greatest euell:
whyche is the moste shamefull thinge,
that any Philosopher myght haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
Wherfore you did well aunswere
when you sayde, that shame seemed to
you a greater euell then gryefe. And if
you will persiste in that opinion, you
shall lyghtly perceyue, howe much we
ought to auoyde griefe. For we must
not so muche searche, whether gryefe
it selfe be an euell yea or no, as howe
we oughte to strengthen oure myndes
to beare the same. The Stoykes occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye
them selues in certayne light rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to shewe the cause whye it oughte
not to be called an euell. As if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie
were of the worde, and not of
the matter. Whye doest thou deceyue
me Zeno? For when thou denyest that
gryefe and formente (whyche seeme to
me horrible thinges) are any payne at
al: I am strayght delyghted therewyth
and become desirous to knowe, howe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
whiche I esteeme the greatest miserye,
can be counted no euel at all. There is
nothing euel (sayeth he) but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which is
dishoneste or vicious. Nowe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> tryflest.
<pb facs="tcp:8426:79"/>
For that which greued me moste, thou
leauest vntouched. I knowe that paine
and gryefe is no sinne. Ceasse therfore
to tell me of that. Teache me, whether
it be any thing materiall to sorowe, or
not sorowe. Nothing at al (thou sayest)
as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning a blessed life, which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
in onelye vertue. But yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
it is not to be vsed, but left: and
why so? Because it is sharpe agaynste
nature, payneful to suffer, heauye and
hard. Here is plenty of wordes in dede
and yet neuerthelesse, all this in effecte
is no more but euell. And by thys va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietee
of wordes, thou doste descrybe
and defyne vnto me, what gryefe is,
and not howe I shoulde rid my selfe of
it. Thou callest it sharpe, repugnaunt
to nature, scarce able to be borne, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dost thou lye therein. But thou
shouldest not haue vsed suche copye in
wordes, and faynted in matter. As to
saye, that nothinge can be good, that is
not honest, nor nothinge ill that is not
dishonest: that is to wyshe a thinge as
it shoulde be, and not to teache it as it
is. But that was said much better and
<pb facs="tcp:8426:79"/>
truer, that all thinges whiche nature
doth abhorre are euell: and contrarye
wyse, suche thinges as it coueytes are
good. This foundation beinge placed,
and all contention about wordes set a
parte, yet neuerthelesse, that selfe same
thynge whyche the Stoikes so muche
esteeme, whych we call honesty, right,
and comelines, and whiche we some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
compryse vnder the name of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
shall so muche passe all other, that
the goodes of the bodye and fortune,
may well seeme ryght small in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of it. Wherfore, if (as you graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the beginninge) shame is worse
then payne, then trulye is payne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
at all. For when thou shalte
thinke it a shame, for one that woulde
be counted a man, to groane, crye, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and bewaile, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shalt thou haue
afore thine eyes, the beautye of stoute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
&amp; honesty. According to the which,
as longe as thou shalte rule thy selfe,
thou shalt vndoubtedlye perceyue, that
gryefe wil yelde &amp; giue place to vertue.
For where so euer vertue is, there is
no feare of gryefe. For fyrst as for pru-without
<pb facs="tcp:8426:80"/>
the whiche a man can not so
much as vnderstand any other vertue.
Will she suffer the to do anie thyng or
attayne to any profyte, withoute la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure
or trauayle? Will temperaunce
suffer the to do anye thinge, wythoute
moderation? And iustyce what man
can obserue, that for feare of payne
would dysclose secretes, that were told
him, betraye his frendes, or ouerpasse
many other dutyes of a iust man?</p>
               <p>But inespeciallye, what wilt thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
to fortitude and her mates, stout<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
of stomacke, grauity, patience, and
despysyng of al worldly thinges? what
wilt thou lie like a miser, complaining
lamentablye, to thintente to heare
some other call the a stoute man?</p>
               <p>Nowe assuredlye, one in that case, no
man would esteeme to be a man.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, either we must despise ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
courage, or els bury griefe. What?
know you not this, that although, you
loose one iuell, yet the residue of your
substaunce may be safe? But if you lose
one vertue (but vertue can not be lost)
or if you confesse that you lacke one,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:80"/>
you must nedes lacke all? Maye we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
call Philocteta afore mentioned, a

or a pacient or a graue man? For I had

that youth should be broughte

laded with stripes, that ofte times a

was tolde me, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was in that coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trey)
euen to the death. Yet of them all
not one, did at any time not onelye not

Why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suffer so much,
&amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing? or shall custome so much
preuayle, and reason nothinge? There
is a difference betwixt labour &amp; griefe,
yet neuerthelesse, they are verye nyghe
in nature. But they differ somewhat.
For labour is the exercise of the minde
or bodye, in some busye worke or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle.
But gryefe is a sharpe motion
in the bodye, contrary to the senses.</p>
               <p>These both, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Grecians, whose tongue
<pb facs="tcp:8426:81"/>
is more plentifull then oures do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
vnder one name. Therfore, pain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full
men they name desyrous and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of gryefe. But we, much more
aptelye, call theym paynefull. For it is
one thing to labour, and an other to be
gryeued. O Greece, sometimes yet bar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ren
of wordes, with the whiche thou
thinkest thy selfe chiefelye to flowe. I
saye, there is great diuersitye betwyxt
gryefe and laboure. It was a gryefe to
Caius Marius, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vaynes in his
thigh were cut. But it was a laboure
for him, when in a whote day, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
afore his armie. Yet neuerthelesse
there is some affinitye betwixte these.
For the vse and custome of labour, cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seth
griefe to be more easy to be borne.
And for that cause, they whiche fyrste
gaue lawes to the commen wealth of
Greece, commaunded inespecially that
yonge man should be acquaynted with
trauayle: whiche the Lacedemonians
applied in likewise to their women.</p>
               <p>Who (whereas in other cities they sit
shaded wythin the walles of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
clothed in nice apparell) liued there
<pb facs="tcp:8426:82"/>
nothing after that sort. For they more
desired to wrestle, to bathe them selues
in the riuer Eurotas, to abide the heat
of the sonne, duste, trauayle, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
then to syt ydle and beare childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And among these paynefull exercyses,
griefe must sometimes be entermedled
For they are some times beaten, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and cast downe. But custome it
selfe doth euen harden them from fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the gryefe. But nowe as for war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
(I talke not of the Spartans, who

wyth farre fette and trifelinge conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
in the whiche the sense of man
hath no iudgement, assaye to conclude,
that gryefe is no euell. But I (what so
euer thing it be) thinke assuredlye, that
it is not so great as it semeth, and that

when it is done, that I saye, eyther to
feare when it is comminge, or els not
to beare when it doth come, is it not a
great shame? And whereas al the good
affections of the minde, are properlye
called vertues, it seemeth to me, that
that name, doth most properly belonge
to that onely, which doth farre passe all
the reste. Nowe the name of vertue, is
deryued of the name of man, whiche in
latine is vir. To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vertue that
doth most properlie belong, and apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne,
is fortitude and stoute courage.
The two chiefest poyntes of the which
are the contempte of death, and despy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng
of griefe. These therfore we must
vse, if we wil be counted the obtayners
of vertue, or rather thoughte worthye
of the name of men: because of this
worde (vir) whiche in latine sygnifyeth
this worde man) the name of vertue is
taken. But perchaunce, thou wilt aske
me, howe shoulde I beare griefe? And
<pb facs="tcp:8426:86"/>

appoyntes neyther any measure of the

what to be short in time. Wherfore let
vs ouerpasse him, whose wordes are to

that we ought not to seke remedy

that gryefe was the greatest of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels:
althoughe he him selfe in his dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease

we desyre to know, what is most mete
for vs to doe) at their handes, whyche
thinke that whiche is honest, to be the
chiefest good: and contrarywyse, that
whych is dishonest, to be the principall
euell. In theyr presence trulye, thou
durste not syghe, nor yet to bragge of
such trifles. For vertue it selfe, by their
voyce will commen with the, in this
sort. Wilt thou (seeing children in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon,

beare it: some for prayse, some to auoyd
shame, and some for feare: and are we

afrayd, least that which so many men,
in so many diuers places haue suffered
our nature wil not beare? But it truly
wil not only beare it, but also requires
it. For there is nothinge that it dothe
more esteeme, neyther yet anye thynge
that it doth more coueyt, then honesty,

By these diuers names, I meane
but one thinge. But I vse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to shewe
the thing more euidently by many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.
But my meaninge is this, that
that thing, is farre aboue al other most
conuenient for eche man, whiche is to
be desyred for it selfe: as a thing eyther
issuynge out of vertue, or els beynge it
selfe placed amonges some one of the

               <p>Howbeit I do not well knowe howe a

speache, of beinge your owne mayster,
as though one part should rule, &amp; tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

spoken vnaduisedly. For our minde is
diuided into two partes: of the which,
the one is endued with reason, and the

when we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to rule
oure selues, this is the effecte thereof,
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we ought by reason to rule rashenes.
There is in all mennes mindes some

That this may gouerne that part
of the minde, which ought to be subiect

they that wythstoode it, do often ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
depart, hauing the vpper hand.</p>
               <p>For there be some thinges, in the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
our mynde dothe resemble our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye.
For as oure bodyes are the better
able to beare burdens, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we stretche
out our limmes, and setle our selues to
abide the weyghte thereof, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryewyse
when we haue no courage to
it, an easye burden ouerlades our lasye
limmes: so likewyse, our mind hauing
an earnest atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue desire to any thing,
can lightly caste of the weyghte of anye
burden troubling it from the same.</p>
               <p>But if it once slacke his good will, it is
to kept downe, &amp; depressed by the same,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:91"/>
that it can neuer after rayse it selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
And (if we wil say that which is
truth) in the execution of all such thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as appertayne to our dutye, there
oughte to be an earnest and zelous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre
of our minde, whiche is the onelye
mayntayner and preseruer of all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes.
But this chiefely we must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
in the sufferyng of all gryefe, that
we do nothinge fearefully, cowardlye,
slauishely, or effeminatelye: and aboue
all other thinges, that we vtterlye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
suche lamentable complayntes, as
Philocteta made. To sygh and groane
maye be well graunted and permitted
to a man: but to crye out, not so mcuhe
as to a woman. For, suche mourninge
the lawe of the .xii. tables forbiddeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
man to vse in funeralles. Neyther
trulye, wyll a stoute or wyse man, at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time so much as syghe, vnlesse it be
to setle him selfe more strongly, for the
abidinge of gryefe. As runners some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in their race, crye as loude as
they can. So do the wrestlers in theyr
exercyse, and the champions, euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they lift theyr clubbes to strike at their
<pb facs="tcp:8426:92"/>
aduersaryes, vse to groane. Not for
that they feele any payne, or that theyr
heart faynteth them, but because with
theyr lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>de shoute, the strengthe of
theyr bodye is pulled togyther, and so
there commeth a sorer strype. So, they
that are mynded to crye very loud, are
not contented to applye thereto theyr
sydes, tounge, and iawes, whiche are
the instrumentes of the whiche the
sounde of our voyce is caused, but that
also wyth theyr hole bodye, and euerye
parte of the same, they assaye to poure
out theyr voyce. Trulye I sawe when
Marcus Antonius pleadynge verye
earnestlye for him selfe, touched the
ground wyth his knee. For, as stone
bowes, and other gunnes, that shoote
out stoanes, and arowes, cast so muche
the faster, as they be stiffer bente, and
drawen more hardlye: so oure voyce,
runnynge, or stroke, is so muche the
greater, as it proceedeth from the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
endeuoure of the whole bodye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
bent to nothinge els sauynge that

                  <pb facs="tcp:8426:92"/>
suche syghynge in the sufferynge of
gryefe, as proceedeth from the same, be
to the confirmation and strengthening
of oure courage, suche I thynke best
that we vse. But as for the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
weake, abiecte and wofull crye, to
that I saye, who so euer shall giue him
selfe, him surely, would I scarse thinke
worthye the name of a man. Which if
it did bryng anye ease to his payne, yet
were it the parte of him to consyder,
what were the dutye of a stoute and
couragyous man. But synce it asswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
no parte of our smart, why should
we shewe oure selues lewde wythoute
anye cause? For what is more fonde
then to weepe lyke a woman? And
this precepte, whyche we nowe gyue
of gryefe, extendeth further. For all
suche thynges, as we ought to auoyde,
we must wythstande wyth as earnest
desyre and affection, as we oughte
gryefe it selfe. For if we burne wyth
anger, or frye wyth the flames of lust,
we must runne to the same fort, &amp; take
the same weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to wythstand it. But
since our purpose here is to entreate of
<pb facs="tcp:8426:93"/>
gryefe, we wil ouerpasse those thinge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
To beare gryefe therfore quietelye and
pacientlye, it is necessarilye expedient,
that we haue our hole entent fyxed on
the honestye of the thinge, wherfore
we suffer it. For we are of nature (as I
sayde before (howebeit I must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

the glimse of the whyche, if we once

But farre otherwise dyd our
countrey man Possidonius, whome I
my selfe haue often sene, and of whom
I wyll tell you, what Pompeius was
wont to remember. Which was, that
when he departing out of Siria, came
to Rhodes, he would gladli haue heard
Possidonius. But vnderstanding that
he was greuouslye sicke, wyth an ache
in all his limmes, &amp; that for that cause,
he coulde not heare him dispute, yet he
thought good to see the noble philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.
To whose presence whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came
and had honourablye saluted him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge
that it grieued him verye muche,
that he could not heare him reason of
philosophye, at that present: you maye
<pb facs="tcp:8426:94"/>
very well, yf you please (quod he) for I
wil neuer suffer, that a litle ache of my
bodye, shoulde cause the iourney of so
noble a man, to be taken in vayne. So
Pompeius told me, that he lyeng, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
verye sagelye and eloquentlye of
this position, that nothing is good but
that whiche is honest. And when the
thornes of gryefe would nowe and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
pricke him, he woulde often saye, all
this is to no ende O griefe: for be thou
neuer so troublesome vnto me, yet wil
I neuer confesse the to be euell.</p>
               <p>So all noble and renoumed laboures,
euen wyth despysynge of theym are
made tollerable. Do we not see in the
scooles of fence, that suche as esteeme
the prayse of the same, passe for no

those, whome the prayse of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
and rydynge the horse doth more
delyghte, do they refuse anye payne,
in learninge the same? What shall I
speake of oure ambition for offyces,
for greedye desyre of honoures?</p>
               <p>What fyre is there, throughe whiche
they woulde not runne that sue for the
<pb facs="tcp:8426:95"/>
same, wyth tooth and nayle, as a man
would saye. Africanus had alwayes in
his handes Xenophon the scoler of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,
whom amonges all other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
he chiefelye praysed for this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge,
that the selfe same laboure, was
not alike greuous to the capitaine, and
to the souldiour. Because the honoure
makes the capitaynes labour but light
But it chaunceth commonlye, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges
the commen sort of fooles, the
opinion of honesty is of some force, but
it it selfe they can not discerne: and for
that cause, they are muche moued with
commen reporte and iudgement of the
multitude, and so thinke that onelye to
be honest, whych most men commend.
But I would not wyshe you, although
you be in the fauour of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
yet to stande to theyr iudgement:
neyther to esteeme that best which they
do. You must vse your owne discrecion
and iudgement. If you like your owne
iudgement in esteeminge such thinges
as be honest, you shall not onely be able
to rule your selfe, (as I sayd somewhat
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore) but all other men and all other
<pb facs="tcp:8426:95"/>
thinges likewyse. Wherefore propose
to your selfe a certayne stoutenes, and
highenes of stomake, which is of great
force to cause a man to contemne and
despyse all gryefes. Thinke also, that
there is but one thinge which is moste
beautifull of al other, and that so much
the more, if it wante the prayse of the
people, and not looking for it, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyghte
it selfe wyth his owne commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dityes.
Truly all suche thinges as are
done wythout boasting, or commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the people, seeme to me more
prayseworthy then the contrarye. Not
for that I woulde haue suche thinges
done out of the face of the people (for al
honest deedes loue to be placed in the
light) But, because there is no greater
prayse that vertue requyreth, then the
good iudgement of a sounde and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
conscience. And let vs chiefelye
thinke, that this sufferaunce of griefe,
whiche we haue sayd often heretofore,
ought to be strengthened with the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desyre of the minde, oughte to be
equally and indifferentlye shewed and
applyed in all cases. For many whyche
<pb facs="tcp:8426:96"/>
eyther for desyre of conqueste and dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye,
or couetyse of glory, haue stoute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
abyden manye cruell strokes, yet
neuerthelesse sometimes the selfe same
men, are not able to abyde the paynes
of a dissease. For the cause is, for that
that payne whiche they suffred afore,
they suffred not learned by the guyde
and conductynge of reason, or wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but onelye for desyre of glorye.</p>
               <p>And for that cause many rude and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
people, can stoutely weld theyr
weapons, and yet neuerthelesse can
not behaue theym selues manlye, in
theyr disease. But the Grecians being
men not verye stoute, but wyse inough
(as the wyttes of men are diuerse) can
not behaue them selues stoutly against
theyr enemyes, and yet neuerthelesse
can beare disseases pacientlye, and as
it becometh men. And the Cimbrians
and Celtiberians, are stoute in the
field, and playne women in their sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
For, nothing can haue any equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litye
or measure in it, whych dothe not
proceede of reason. And when you see
<pb facs="tcp:8426:96"/>
them, whom eyther earneste desyre, or
els a vayne opinion moueth to coueyte
anye thynge, in folowynge and attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge
the same, not to be wearyed of
gryefe, then oughte you to thinke, that
gryefe is eyther no euell at all, or els if
there be anye hardenes in it, or anye
thinge contrary to nature, and for that
cause it may please you to call it euell,
yet neuerthelesse, that it is so litle, and
so muche ouercome of vertue, that it
can not appeare at all. Whiche I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seche
you ponder wyth your selfe. For
this reason wyll serue you to manye
more vses, then to auoyde gryefe. For

inasmuch as at our laste ende, there is

glorye is a sounde and perfect thynge,
and no coloured shadowe. And that is
the incorrupted and vniuersall prayse,
of al good men, proceeding of the right
report of the excellencie of vertue.</p>
            <p>Whyche trulye is in maner the eccho
of vertue. For it alwayes aunswereth
to the sound of the same. Which in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly it foloweth all good
deedes, is not to be refused nor despy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

which will needes be an imitatour of

of vice, and naughtines, and vnder

Wyth the ignoraunce of the whyche

For some haue rased theyr owne cities
and some haue slayne them selues.</p>
            <p>And so they seekynge thynges that are
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues good, are deceyued, not so
much of a set purpose, as because of the
ignoraunce of the waye, by the whych
they should come to the same. Nowe,
those whiche haue theyr mindes vexed
wyth the greedye desyre of money, or
with the filthy lust of pleasure, or they
whose mindes are so muche disquyeted
wyth the same, that they are not farre
frome madnesse (as foolishe men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlye
are). Haue all these sortes of
men no neede of helpe thinke you? ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because the disseases of the minde
haue lesse neede of helpe then the sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of the bodye, or els for that there
is an arte inuented to cure the bodye,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:100"/>
and none to heale the soule? But trulie
the diseases of the minde are both more
deadlye, and also more in number then
those of the bodye. For they be so much
the more greuous, as they pertayne to
the mind, and the vexing thereof, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
being sicke, doth alwayes erre (as
Ennius sayeth) and can for griefe ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do, neyther suffer any thing well.
And furthermore neuer ceasseth to be
vexed with desyre: then both the which
maladies, that is to wite, griefe and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sire,
what greater diseases maye there
be? And who can proue, that the soule
is not able to cure it selfe, inasmuch as
it firste inuented medicines for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye?
and also, whereas the healinge of
the bodyes, doth muche consyste in the
constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and nature of the same, and
al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to be cured,
haue not bene healed, yet euery mans
mind which was willing to be healed,
and was therein ruled bi the preceptes
and counsels of wise men, hathe bene
alwayes vndoubtedlye cured. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decine
of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> minde, is philosophy, which
helpeth vs (not as the diseases of oure
<pb facs="tcp:8426:100"/>
bodye are holpen) by thinges withoute
vs, but we our selues must wyth al our
power &amp; endeuour, laboure to cure our
selues. But of philosophy vniuersally,
how much it should be eyther esteemed
or vsed I haue sufficiently spoken (as I
thinke) in my my booke entituled Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensius.
And of other wayghtye questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I haue not bene slacke, eyther to
dispute or wryte. But in these bookes,
I haue endited those questions whiche
I reasoned with my familiar frendes,
in my manour of Tusculanum. And in
asmuch as in the twoo fyrste bookes,
you haue hearde oure disputacions of
death, and of the griefe of the bodye, in
this third booke you shall receyue oure
reasoning kept the third day. Therfore
when I came downe to my scoole (the

some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that were prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to put

I sayde afore) is no more hole then our
bodyes in sickenes. So it must needes
be, that wysedome is the healthe of the
soule, &amp; follye the syckenes of the same.
Which we may call eyther madnes or
folyshenes. The whych is better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the latine wordes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> greke.
As it chaunceth in many other termes
besydes. But therof we shall treate an
other time. Nowe let vs speake of that
we haue in hand. This therfore, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we treate, what it is, the worde it
selfe doth sufficiently declare.</p>
               <p>For we must needes thinke theym to
be hoale, whose mind is troubled with
no motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in maner of disease, and such
as contraryewyse are vexed wyth the
same, to be diseased. The latine worde
of the which called <hi>Insania,</hi> doth proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
signifye madnesse. And therfore we
vse to saye in the latine tongue, that
suche as are out of theyr wyttes, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
fransye, eyther with luste or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
<pb facs="tcp:8426:101"/>
Although, anger it selfe is a parte
of luste: for thus it is defyned.</p>
               <p>Anger is the lusting affter vengeance.
They therfore, whyche are sayde to be
out of theyr wyttes, are so termed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they can not vse theyr wittes to
the whyche nature hath graunted the
rule of the mynde. But whye the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians

But we distinguishe the same better
then they. For this vnhealthfulnesse
which being all one in effect with foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyshenesse,
extendeth very farre, we se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from madnesse. So the Greekes
would. But they haue no apte worde
for it. For that whyche we call mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
they call <hi>Melancholian.</hi> As though
men were made frontike onelye wyth
melancholye, and not rather and more
ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with great anger, griefe, or feare.

did vnderstand, the want of a good and
perfecte disposicion. Howe be it they
thought, that a man in such case might
well accomplishe al duties, pertayning
to the commen and accustomed trade
of lyfe. But madnesse, they thoughte,
was the blyndenesse of the minde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
all thinges. Whiche although
it seeme to be a great deale worse, then
the vnhealthfulnesse of the minde, yet
trulye it is suche, that it maye sooner
chaunce to a wyse man, then this
lacke of healthe of the minde, I meane
folishenesse. But that is an other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
Let vs retourne to our purpose.
You sayde (vnlesse I be deceyued) that
you thoughte, that griefe of minde
might chaunce to a wyse man.</p>

               <p>You doe but
like a man, in that you thinke so. For
we are not made of flynte. But there
is naturallye in vs some tender and
softe thinge, which gryefe of mind sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
as a storme. Neyther was it euell
<pb facs="tcp:8426:102"/>
sayde of Crantor, who was a man of
great reporte in oure vniuersitie. I do
not agree wyth them (quod he) who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
so much insensibilitye of gryefe,
which no man eyther can, or oughte to
haue. I would not gladly be sicke (quod
he) but if I be, let me feele it whether
they cut away anye deade fleshe, or els
take any thing out of my body. For to
feele nothinge at all, can not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great dulnesse in the mind, nor ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sinesse
in the bodye. But weyghe ye
wel, whether by this talke, he agree to
our infirmitie, or fauour our softenes.
Wherefore, let vs attempte to cut of,
not onely the braunches of these foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe
miseries, but also to pull vp all
the mores of the same, by the roote.</p>
               <p>Yet do we the best we may: some thing
will remayne. Follye hath rooted so
deepe in mens heartes. But yet onelye
so much shall remayne as is necessarye
to be le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>te. Wherfore, knowe you this
for a certayntie, that vnlesse our minde
be cured (whiche by no meanes can be
done wythout philosophye) we shal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
haue an ende of miserye. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:103"/>
knowe you this for a certayntye,
that vnlesse our minde be cured (which
by no meanes can be done without phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>losophye)
we shall neuer haue an ende
of miserye. Wherfore as we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne,
so let vs wholy yelde our selues
to it, to be cured. We shall be healed if
we list. And I wyll goe somewhat far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
For I will treate not of the griefe
of the minde onelye (although thereof
chiefelye) But of all the perturbations
or rather diseases of the same, as the
Greekes terme them. And firste if you
be so pleased, let vs folowe the order of
the Stoikes: who are wont, fyrste in a
shorte compasse to frame the force of
theyr argumentes. And afterwardes,
we wil talke of the same more at large
after our accustomed vse. Who so euer
is a stout man, he must nedes be bold,
but whosoeuer is bold, feareth not (for
boldenes and feare are thinges diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente
in nature) But to whom so euer
gryefe of minde maye chaunce, to hym
lykewyse feare maye come). For what<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>soeuer
thinges do grieue vs when they
chaunce, the same afore they come we
<pb facs="tcp:8426:103"/>
feare. Therfore gryefe of the mynde, is
contrary to stoutenes of stomake.</p>
               <p>Furthermore it is likely, that who so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
may feele griefe, he must also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
feare and faynte hartednesse, the
whyche twoo, in whom so euer they be
founde, he maye be subiecte to affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and must nedes confesse him selfe
ouercome wyth them. But none of all
these can happen to a stoute man.</p>
               <p>Therfore neyther gryefe maye. But
none can be a wyse man, vnlesse he be
stoute. Wherefore, to no wyse man,
can any gryefe happen. Furthermore,
it must needes be, that he whyche is a
stoute man, shoulde haue a hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and who so euer hath suche cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
is inuincible of all euell moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And he that is so inuyncyble will
despyse all casualtyes, that may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to man, as thynges worse then hym
selfe. But no man despiseth those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
the misse of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which should grieue
him, but a stoute man. Whereof it is
concluded, that all stoute men are voyd
of gryefe. But in a wise man, stoutnes
<pb facs="tcp:8426:104"/>
is requisite. No wise man therfore can
feele gryefe. And like as a troubled eye
is not in good estate to execute his fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and so likewise the other partes
of the bodye, or the whole bodye, when
it is once moued from his quiete state,

                  </gap>ue his dutye. But the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the minde is to vse reason well:
And the mynde of a wyse man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
so disposed, that it can guyde it
selfe according to the vse of reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is
then neuer troubled. But all gryefe is
a trouble to the minde. Wherefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye
wyse man must needes be voyde
of the same. It is likely also that euery
temperate man, whome the Greekes
call <gap reason="foreign">

Who soeuer therefore is frugall, or

power, &amp; notable felicitie, but nothyng
skylfull howe to vse his prosperity. So
as pitye is a gryefe conceyued of other

for other mens prosperitye. Who so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

But to enuye is no point of a wise

yf a wise man shoulde take greuouslye

be subiect to pitie. All gryefe therefore

               <p>These are the reasons of the Stoykes,

(then the whyche we philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
can be eyther more eloquente,
more learned, or more sage) can not
well perswade me, that there is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocritie
of the perturbations, or disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the mind. For euery euell thing,
though it be but meane, yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
is to muche. And we intende to
shewe, that there can be no such griefe
in a wyse man. For as the bodye, if it
be but meetely sicke, yet neuerthelesse,
is farre from healthe: so trulye if the
mind be but meanely troubled, it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
health. Therfore oure countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as they haue well geuen manye
proper and meete names to other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
so haue they verye well termed
gryefe, care, and anguishe of the minde
(for the likenes that it hathe to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
of the bodye) sickenesse. Wyth
the like worde, do the Grecians terme
<pb facs="tcp:8426:107"/>
all perturbations. For they cal al trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
motions of the minde <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>athos</hi>
whyche is as much in effecte as disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
For the sickenes of the minde doth
muche resemble the diseases of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye.
But lust is not like to a disease.</p>
               <p>Nor immod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>te ioye, which is the me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye
moode of the minde. Neyther is
feare it selfe any thinge lyke a disease,
although it is verye nygh vnto griefe.
But that whyche is called a disease in
the bodye, is commonly called a griefe
in the mind. We must therfore, shewe
the originall beginning of this gryefe.
I meane the thing that worketh griefe
in oure mindes, as some other thynge
doth disease in the bodye. For as the
phisicians, when they haue once found
out the cause of any disease, thinke the
cure thereof to be but lyght: so we whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we haue once founde the cause of thys
gryefe, shall lyghtlye fynde some helpe
for the same. Al the cause therefore con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sisteth
in our owne opinion. I meane
not only of gryefe of the minde, but of
all other perturbations also: which are
but foure generallye. But there are
<pb facs="tcp:8426:107"/>
more branches and partes of the same.
For, inasmuch as euery motion of the
minde is eyther voyde of reason, or a
despyser of reason, or disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and that motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is stirred with the
opinion eyther of good or euell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
these .ii. partes, all the foure pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations
are equally contayned. For .ii.
proceede of the opinion of good: of the
whyche the one, is called immoderate
ioye, whych ryseth of some marueilous
goodnes beyng atchieued and gotten:
and the other is named desyre, whyche
is an immoderate lust after some thing
of the whiche we haue once conceyued
a great opinion of goodnes, not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge
to reason. And as these two are
moued with the opinion of goodnes, so
are the other .ii. raysed of the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
some euell. For feare comes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of some great euel, which is at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d:
&amp; sorowe is the opinion of some euell,

vanquyshe gryefe if we may. For that
is our purpose, inasmuche as you sayde
that you thought it myghte chaunce to

               </p>
               <p>These euels, thou thy selfe O foolishe
Aeta, wast the causer of: for they were
not amonges those thinges whyche
chaunce cast vppon the. For all sorowe
as I will hereafter shewe, proceedeth
of the opinion of some euell that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
But thou mournest trulye, for the
lacke of thy kyngdome, and not of thy
doughter. For her thou didst hate, and
that perchaunce not wythoute a cause.
But it grieued the greatly, to lacke thy
kyngdome. Trulye it is a shameles so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe,
to mourne, for that thou mayst
<pb facs="tcp:8426:109"/>
not keepe free men in seruitude. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisius
the tiranne, when he was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
from Siracusa, taught children at
Corinthe. So great desire he had, to
beare rule. But who could be more im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pudent
then Tarquinius? Who wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
warre wyth them, that would not
suffer his pride. He at the laste when
neyther the armyes of the Ueientes,
neyther yet the Latines, coulde restore
him into his kyngdome, wente to the
citye of Cume in Italye, and there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wyth
age and anguyshe pyned awaye.
And thinke you, that the lyke maye
chaunce to anye wyse man? I meane,
to be wasted wyth thoughte? which is
no better than meere miserye. For
whereas euerye perturbation is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
kynde of misery, chiefely sorowe
is the very torment of a troubled mind
Lust bryngeth heate, ouermuche glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
causeth lightnes, and feare bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a basenes of courage. But so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe,
causeth farre greater thynges
then all these, as pynynge, veration,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:109"/>
affliction, and filthinesse. It teares
eates, and murders the minde. It vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we laye aparte, that we vtterlye
shake it from vs, we can neuer wante
miserye. And this trulye is playne and
euidente, that the cause of gryefe of the
minde, is when any thynge whych we
account to be some marueylous euell,
seemeth to be euen at hande, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentelye
to pricke vs. But Epicurus
thinketh, that the opinion and thought
of anye euell, causeth sorowe: so that
whosoeuer beholdeth anye great euell,
yf he thinke that the same hath at anye
time chaunced vnto him, he by his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
must needes be troubled wyth so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe.
The folowers of Aristippus,
called Cyrenaikes, thinke that gryefe
of minde, ryseth not of euerye gryefe,
but onelye of suche as commeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked
for, and vnprouided.</p>
               <p>And assuredlye, that is of no small
force to encrease the gryefe: for all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne
chaunces seeme to be more
greeuous then other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8426:110"/>
And for that cause are these verses wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thelye
commended, as the sayenges of

this so wyselye, whyche he borowed of

For this is the same counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce

of al lookes, dyd neuer varye, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bothe I will take of the Cyrenai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
these weapons agaynst chaunces,
that is to breake theyr force, with long
forethinkynge of the same: and also I
iudge, that that euel which is in griefe
consysteth in mens opinion, and not in
the thinges them selues. For if it were
in the thinges, that chaunce vnto vs,
wherefore shoulde the foresyghte of
them, make them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lighter. But there
may be more suttle reasoninge of these
matters, yf fyrste we see the opinion
of Epycurus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8426:112"/>
Who thinkes it necessary, that euerye
man, to whom any euell is chaunced,
shoulde foorthwith lyue in gryefe and
sorowe aswell although he did foresee,
and prouide for those chaunces afore
hand, as also when they waxe olde.</p>
               <p>For neyther doeth the lengthe of tyme
make the euels the lesse (sayeth he) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet the foresyghte of theym, make
vs to beare them more lightly. He say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
also, that suche forethinkynge of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels,
is very fond. Because it maye be,
that they shall not chaunce at all.</p>
               <p>Euerye gryefe (sayeth he) is odious y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughe,
when it doeth chaunce: but he
that alwayes lookes for some aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye,
makes it to him a continuall and
euerlastinge miserye. And if it shoulde
chaunce not to come, in vayne then
should a man voluntarilye sorowe.</p>
               <p>So he thinketh, that a man is alwaies
vexed, eyther wyth the chaunce, or els
wyth the thought of some euell. But
the ease of sorowe, he placeth in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge
of gryefe, the other in drawyng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
it to the contemplacion of pleasure.</p>
               <p>For he thinketh, that our minde may
<pb facs="tcp:8426:112"/>
aselye obeye reason, and folowe her
guyde. Reason (sayeth he) dothe forbyd
vs to thinke on gryefe. It drawth our
dull wittes from the sharpe thoughtes
of sorowe, to beholde the miserye of the
same: from the whiche, when she, hath
once wythdrawen vs, she then moues
and stirres vs, to beholde and handle
sundrye sortes of pleasure: the whyche
both to remember when they are past,
and also to hope for, when they are
comming, he thinketh to be the perfect
lyfe of a wyse man. Thus I haue vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his opinion, according to my fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
But the Epicureans do it after an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sorte of theyr owne. But nowe
let vs consider, howe lightelye we
esteme theyr wordes in this poynct.</p>
               <p>Fyrste of all, they do without cause re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
the forethinking of euels to come.
For there is nothinge, that maye so
much dul or lighten the force of griefe,
as a continuall thought and perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
through out all our lyfe, that there
is no miserye, whych maye not happen
vnto vs: as the ponderynge of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and estate of man: as the lawe
<pb facs="tcp:8426:113"/>
of our life, and study to obeye. Whiche
causeth vs not to mourne alwaies, but
neuer. For who so pondereth with him
selfe, the state of euery thing, the incon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stancie
of his lyfe, and the weakenes
of mankynd, he doth not then mourne
but rather then chiefelye doth the part
of a wyse man. For hereby he getteth
two commodityes. The one, that in
wayghynge the frayletye of man, he
doth execute the duty of a philosopher,
the other, for that agaynst aduersity, he
hath gotten three confortes. The first,
for that he thought longe afore, that it
might happen. Which onely thought
doth most of all other, swage and wipe
away all sorowe. The second, for that
he thinketh, that all chaunces whyche
may happen to a man, are paciently to
be borne. And last of all, because he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that there is no euell but where is
some faulte. And it is no faulte of his,
inasmuche as that, which a man could
not withstande, is chaunced. For that
reuoking of our mind fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thought
of grefe (which Epicurus would haue)
<pb facs="tcp:8426:113"/>
is to no poynct at all. For it is not in
our power, when we are prycked with
miserye, or mischaunce, to dissemble or
forget it. For suche chaunces teare,
vexe, pricke, and enflame vs. And fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallye,
suffer vs not to take anye quy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ete
rest. And yet neuerthelesse, thou
Epicurus, wyllest me to forget that,
whyche is agaynst nature.</p>
               <p>But nowe, to the helpe whyche thou

               <p>To these goodes O Epicurus, yf thou

I count theym not worthye the

Of what sort I pray the? Of the body,

we do eyther remember that oure bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye

Do I trulye interprete thy meanynge?
For they are wonte to saye, that we do
not vnderstand what Epicurus mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.
<pb facs="tcp:8426:115"/>
Euen this truly he meaneth.</p>
               <p>And this the olde Zeno, the Grecian,
at Athenes in my hearynge was wont
very earnestlye to affyrme, that happy
was he, whyche dyd eyther presentlye
enioye pleasure, or els did hope, he
should enioye it: eyther throughout all
his lyfe, or at the least wyse, throughe
the greatest parte, withoute anye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse
of gryefe. Or if there were
any, if it were extreame, that it should
be shorte. Or if it were somewhat long
that it should haue more pleasure, then
myserye. He that did so thinke, he sayd
should be blessed: especially if he were
contented wyth the pleasure, that he
had before taken, and also feared not
god. Thus here you see the happye life
appoynted by Epicurus, descrybed so
playnelye, wyth the wordes of Zeno,
that therein is nothing that he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye.

               <p>¶Trulye, if anye man with his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce
hath loste his courage also, he
must seeke his remedye of those graue

those slaues of pleasure. For what com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panie
of goodes is it, that they meane?
Admit trulye, that it were the chiefest
good that mighte be to feele no griefe.
Howbeit that can not well be called
pleasure. But is that such a thinge, as
the syghte or minding thereof myghte
ease our sorowe? Admit that gryefe be
the greatest euell, that may be. Shall
he then that feeleth not it, foorthwyth
enioye the chiefest felicitye? But why

perceyue what good thing I may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
voyde of those pleasures, that con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sist

whych the eyes do gather of fayre beau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyes:
or lackinge the pleasures requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to any of the foure senses in man.
Neyther maye we trulye saye that the
delight of the minde is onelye in suche
goodnes as wante all these. For I
knowe, that the minde will so reioyce,
euen wyth the onely hope of those plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sures,
which I haue afore named, that
when it hath once attayned them, it is
voyde of all griefe. These be the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of Epicurus. By the which euerye
man maye righte well perceyue, what
pleasure Epicurus ment. For some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
after. Right oft, I haue demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of theym that were counted wyse,
(sayeth he) what they would accompte
good, if they take away those pleasures
by me afore named. But I could get
<pb facs="tcp:8426:116"/>
nothing of them, but onelye bare wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.
Who if they will name vertues,
and wysedome, they do no more then
shewe the waye of those pleasures, by
me afore named. Those wordes that
folowe are to the same purpose. And to
conclude, all his booke entituled of the
chiefest good, is stuffed with such wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
&amp; sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. Wilt thou then to this
life reuoke Telamo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ease his griefe?
And if thou chaunce to see anye of thy
frendes vexed wyth sorowe, wylt thou
gyue him rather a daynty dyshe of fishe
then some comfortable booke of Socra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes?
Wilte thou exhorte him, to heare
rather the counsell of dayntye courty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
then of Plato? Thou wilt set afore
him freshe syghtes to gase on, burne
sweete smelles at his nose, and set gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes,
and roses about his head.</p>
               <p>Trulye (I thinke) yf thou adde anye
thinge more thou must needes take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye
all his mourninge. Eyther all
these comfortes Epicurus must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,

<pb facs="tcp:8426:117"/>
his whole booke must be called in
For it is full of commendation of plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sures.

<pb facs="tcp:8426:118"/>
Let vs ease him of his gryefe. Howe?
Let vs laye him on a softe featherbed,
brynge him a singinge woman, let vs
burne cedre at his nose, and bring him
some pleasaunt potion, and therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
prouide him of some good meat.</p>
               <p>Be these the goodes that are able to
slake the greatest sorowes? For you
euen nowe sayde, you knewe none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
goodes. But I could well agre to
Epicurus, that a man in sorow ought
to be called to the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation of good
yf we could agree what that is whyche
we terme good. But some man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce,
will saye. What? thinke you
that Epicurus ment as you enterprete
him? And that his sentences, are to be
referred to bodilye pleasure. No truly.
I thinke nothing lesse. For I see many
thinges, grauelye and notablye spoken
of him. But as I haue often heretofore
sayd the controuersy is of his wordes,
and not of his maners or lyfe. Let him
saye, that he despyseth those pleasures
whyche he did whylome commend, yet
I will well remember, what felicity<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
he seemeth by his wordes to declare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8426:118"/>
For he did not onelye name it by thys
worde pleasure, but also expounded his
owne sayeng, taste (quod he) &amp; the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brasyng
of fayre and seemelye bodyes,
playes, and songes, and those shapes,
with the which the eyes are pleasaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
delyghted. Do I fayne? Do I lye?
I desyre to be reproued. For what els
do I coueyte, but that the trueth maye
appeare, in euerye question. He sayeth
also, that the pleasure dothe not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
the gryefe beyng gone: and yet
that it is the chiefest pleasure, to feele
no gryefe. In a fewe wordes, he hathe
made three great faultes. One, in that
he is contrarye to him selfe. For euen
nowe he said, that he could not so much
as thinke, anye thynge to be good, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the senses were tickled wyth the
pleasures of the same. And nowe he
sayeth, that to lacke gryefe is greatest
pleasure that may be. May any thinge
be more contrarye? An other faulte is,
that whereas there be naturally thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
yoyntes, the one to reioyce, the other to
sorowe, the third neither to be glad nor
sorye: he thinketh, the first and the last
<pb facs="tcp:8426:119"/>
to be all one, and dothe not separate
pleasure from the wante of gryefe.</p>
               <p>The thyrde faulte (whyche is commen
to some men) is, that whereas ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is the thynge, whyche we oughte
moste of all other to desyre, because
that for the attaynynge of the same,
Phylosophye was chiefelye inuented,
yet he hathe separated felicitye frome
vertue. But (some man will saye) he
doth often commend vertue.</p>
               <p>And trulye, Caius Gracchus, when
he gaue abroade the commen moneye,
and beggered the treasure, yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
in his talke defended the
same. What shoulde I heare his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
when as I see his deedes to the
contrarye? Piso the thryftye, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
wythstoode the lawe of dystry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butynge
corne. Yet neuerthelesse, that
lawe beinge establyshed, he beynge
once afore Consull, came to take
corne. Whom when Gracchus espyed
he asked him in the audience of all the
people, what he meant, to come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
<pb facs="tcp:8426:119"/>
corne by that lawe, whyche
he had alwayes disswaded.</p>
               <p>Whereunto he aunswered, I woulde
not gladlye, O Gracchus (quod he)
that thou shouldest distribute and geue
awaye my goodes. But yf thou wylte
needes do it, I will take some parte
my selfe. Did not that graue and wyse
counsayler, sufficientlye in those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
declare that by the lawe of Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,
the commen treasure was scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered?
Reade the oracions of Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,
you will saye, that he is a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the treasure house. So Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus
denyeth that a man maye lyue
pleasauntlye, vnlesse he lyue also ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouslye.
He denyeth also, that fortune
hath anye force on a wyse man.</p>
               <p>He preferreth a bare liuinge, before a
sumptuous and costlye. He sayeth that
there is no tyme, in the whych a wyse
man is not happye. All these thynges
are worthye to be spoken of a philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
neuerthelesse they are contrarye
to pleasure. But he meaneth not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8426:120"/>
what pleasure he will, so he dothe not
meane such a pleasure as hath in it not
so much as one iote of vertue. Well, if
we vnderstande not what pleasure he
meaneth, neyther do we knowe what
gryefe he vnderstandeth. But I do
thinke that he whyche thinketh gryefe
to be the chiefest euell, ought not once
to make mention of vertue. Truly the
Epicureans complayne, that I do of a
set purpose inueyghe agaynste Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.
As though we dyd stryue for some
honour or worshippe. I thinke that the
chiefest good consysteth in the minde,
and he placeth the same in the bodye.
I thinke vertue to be it, and he taketh
pleasure for the same. And hereaboute
they contend, and call for theyr neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
helpe, with great outcryes.</p>
               <p>But I am one, whiche litle passe for
suche contention. For I do not nowe
reason of the warre betwixt vs and the
Carthaginenses: wherein neuertheles
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> M. Cato, and L. Lentulus were
of seuerall opinions, yet they did neuer
stryue about it. But these men are
nowe to muche angry, whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
<pb facs="tcp:8426:120"/>
they do not stoutelye ynoughe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
theyr opinion: for the whych they
are afrayd, either afore y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Senate, or at
the barre, afore the army, or in prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of the Censors, to pleade. But wyth
them I wil reason at other times, and
that truly, not wyth the minde to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende:
but wholye glad to yelde to their
reasons. Onely thus muche I will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishe
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that if it were true, that a
wyse man should referre all thinges to
his body, or (to speake somewhat more
honestlye) that he should do nothinge,
but that were for his owne profyte, or
commoditye, because these thinges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
no commen prayse, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> laugh
in theyr sleeues (as they say) and leaue
of theyr open bragges. Nowe there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Cyrenaikes:
whych thinke, that gryefe is then one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
caused, when any mischiefe comes
vnloked for: and trulye that is a great
occasion of gryefe, as I sayde before.</p>
               <p>And also, I knowe that Chrisippus,
thinketh, that chaunces not foreseene,
happen most vehementlye. But this is
not all. For we knowe, that the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne
<pb facs="tcp:8426:121"/>
commynge of our enemyes doth
more trouble vs than when we looke
for theym: and also, a tempeste in the
sea, risinge on a sodayne, dothe more
feare the saylers, then that whyche
they haue foreseene afore. And so is it
most commonlye in all other thinges.
But if you do diligentlye weyghe, the
nature of suche sodayne chaunces, you
shall perceyue, that they seeme the
greater chyefelye for two causes.</p>
               <p>Fyrst, because we haue not leasure to
consyder, howe great the thynges are,
whiche, haue chaunced vnto vs. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarilye,
for that we thinke it might
haue bene auoyded, if it had bene fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene:
and so, thinkynge it to haue
chaunced onelye through oure owne
faulte, it maketh oure gryefe the shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
Whyche to be true, time it selfe
declareth. Whiche in space doth so as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage
oure sorowe, that the euels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maygninge
all one, yet oure gryefe, is

               <p>Manye Carthaginenses lyued in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage

               <p>Yet neuerthelesse, the sodayne sight of
the reced walles of theyr citye Coryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,

whose heartes, the dayly sight thereof,

               <p>We reade the booke of Clitomachus,
whych he, after the subduynge of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage
sente to the citesens, that were
prisoners, to comfort them. Therein is
wrytten a disputacion of Carneades:
whych Clitomachus sayeth, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he there
hath abridged. In it when it was fyrst
proposed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it semeth that a wise man
shoulde lamente the captiuitye of his
countreye, forthewith folowe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Carneades to the contrarye: in
<pb facs="tcp:8426:122"/>
the whyche truly, the philosopher, doth
so much comfort theyr prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t calamity,
as in an old gryefe a man would scarse
haue wyshed, or desyred. And trulye, if
that booke had bene sent a fewe yeares
after to theym, it would not so muche
haue holpen theyr sores, as their skar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.
For sorowe, by litle, and litle, in
processe of time, dothe weare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume:
not for that the thinges theym
selues, eyther are wonte, or maye be
chaunged: but because, at the last, that
whych reason ought to haue done, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
dothe perswade vs: namelye
that those thinges are but smal, which
seemed to be so great. Why then (some
wyll saye) what neede haue we of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
Or of anye of those comfortes,
whyche men do vse, when they would
lyghten the sorowe of such as mourne?
As this and suche other, that nothyng
that is chaunced ought to seme straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
or vnlooked for? Yes trulye, he
shall more tolerablye beare euerye dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditie,
who knoweth, that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie,
suche thinges must chaunce to

<pb facs="tcp:8426:122"/>
do make the euell it selfe nothynge the
lesse, only hereof it putteth vs in mind
that nothing is happened, which was
not to be looked for. Neyther yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are that sorte of perswasions, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
auaylable, to the curynge of
gryete: but they are rather of all other,
the best. Wherefore, these sodayne
chaunces, are not of suche force, that
they onelye should be the causers of all
gryefe. They smyte vs perhaps more
sharpelye, then the rest. But they are
not able, to make those thinges, which
so chaunce, greater then the rest. They
seeme greater, because they are newe,
and freshe, and not because they came
sodaynely. But there are .ii. wayes, to
fynde out the truthe, not in those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
onelye, whych haue the apparance
of euell, but in those also, whyth seeme
to be good. For eyther we question of
the nature of the thing it selfe, of what

               <p>So the tryall of other men afore hand,
maketh that those thynges, whyche

is nothynge els, then the opynyon of
some great euell that is prosent and at

And the lyfe honestly and worshypful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye

those whyche haue so lyued, eyther
gryefe toucheth not at al, or at the least

that we thinke we oughte, and
that it is our dutye to take such chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

For of that opinion, proceede those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers

               <p>Whereupon, there is a merye ieste of
Byon. Sayenge that the foolyshe king
pulled of his heare, as though baldnes
would helpe his sorowe. But all these
thinges they doo, thinkynge that they
ought of ryght so to do. And for that
cause, Aeschines inueygheth agaynste
Demosthenes, for that he three dayes
after the deathe of his daughter, had
done sacrafyce. But howe rhetorically
pleadeth he? what reasons gathers he?
Howe wryeth he his wordes? So that

vnlesse we had this foolishe opinion in

Herof it commeth, that in greate

<q>
                     <l>If this time were the fyrste, that I
such miserye did trye.</l>
                     <l>And that afore I had not felte, the

                     <l>Then had I iuste cause to lamente,

                     <l>Beare yll the bridles bit, when fyrst

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore inasmuche as the weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of miseryes, doth lighten griefe,
we must nedes confesse, that the thing
it selfe, which is chaunced vnto vs, is
not the cause of oure sorowe. Those
that are chiefely studious of wisedome
and haue not as yet attained the same,
do they not sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly vnderstand, that
they are in great misery? for they haue
not gotten the perfection of wisedome.
And truly there can be no greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serye,
then the imperfection of wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Yet neuerthelesse, they do not
lament this miserye. And why so? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
to this sorte of euels, there is not
affixed that opinion, that it is ryghte
and iust, or any part of our duty to take
it heauilye, for that we are not wyse.</p>
               <p>With the which opinion, that gryefe
is alwayes accompanyed, oute of the
whyche proceedeth mourning. For A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,
blaming the auncient philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:129"/>
whiche thought that their wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
had made philosophye perfect: say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that they were eyther most foolishe
or els most vayne glorious of all men.
For he sawe, that within fewe yeares
the same was greatly encreased. So
that it was likely, that in shorte time,
it would be finished. But Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,
at the time of his deathe is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to haue blamed nature. For that to
hertes and dawes, whom the same ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued
to litle vse, she had graunted longe
life: but to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to whom it mighte haue
bene most commodious, she had graun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
but a short terme. Whose age, if it
might be lengthened, it woulde come
to passe, that all artes beynge made
perfecte, the lyfe of man shoulde be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourned
wyth all kynd of learning.</p>
               <p>And therefore, he did complayne, that
when he fyrst began to perceyue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
therein, then it was his chaunce
to be taken out of this life. Lykewyse
of all the rest, doth not euerye of them
that is counted wisest and grauest wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:129"/>
confesse the ignoraunce of manye
poynctes? And that there are manye
thinges, the whiche he would gladlye
learne? And yet neuerthelesse, albeit
they knowe that they sticke in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce,
then the which there can be no
thinge worse, they do not sorowe nor
mourne. For they haue no suche opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it is anye parte of theyr dutye,
to be sorye. They whyche thynke that
men oughte not to mourne, as Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Maximus, who buryed his onelye
sonne, that had bene once Consul: as
Lucius Paulus, who loste bothe hys
sonnes in one daye: as Marcus Cato,
whose sonne dyed when he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyncted
to be Pretor: As all the rest
whom we haue reckened vp in ours
booke whyche is entituled of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte
of Philosophye. The mournings
of all these men (I saye) what other
thyng dyd staye, but that they thought
sorowe and sadnes to be thynges not
properlye belonging to any man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8426:130"/>
So whereas other men, delayed with
an opinion of dutye, do yelde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues
to gryefe, they thinkinge it a shame,
did wythstand sorowe. Whereby it is
euident, that griefe of mind, consisteth
not in the nature of the chaunce, but in
the opinion of men. Agaynst this it is
sayde, who is there so madde, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> would
of his owne voluntary will be sad and
mourne? Nature bringeth sorowe. To
the whyche, your Crantor (saye they)
thinketh, that we ought to yelde. For
it doth pricke, and burden vs, neyther
can we resyst it. So Oileus in Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which comforted Telamon afore,
when he mourned for the deathe of
Aiax, he (I saye) when he hearde of his
owne mischaunce, was euen ouercome
wyth sorowe. Of the sodayne chaunge
of whose minde, these verses are wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
<q>
                     <l>I thinke no man so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stant is, whose
wytte can serue him so.</l>
                     <l>That though he counsayle other, to
asswage theyr gryefe and woe.</l>
                     <l>Yet when that fortune hath on him,
once layd her heauy stroke.</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb facs="tcp:8426:130"/>Would not be ouercome, and wyth
his owne hurt straight way broke</l>
                     <l>So that the wordes which he afore,
to others wysely spake,</l>
                     <l>Should slippe awaye as thinges the
which aduersity did slake.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>By suche kinde of proofes, they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to perswade, that we maye by no
meanes withstand nature. Yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
they them selues confesse, that
men sometimes take greater sorowe,
then nature constraineth them. What
madnes is it then, that we shoulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre
euery man so to do? But there are
manye causes of sorowe. Fyrste, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
which we haue, that is an euell
whiche is chaunced vnto vs. Whyche
when we be once perswaded, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> griefe
of minde doth necessarilye ensue. The
second occasion is, for that they thynke
theyr mourninge to be acceptable to
suche, as are departed. And hereunto
is adioyned, a certayne effeminate su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.
For they thynke, that they
shall the sooner contente the anger of
the immortall gods, if they as men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonyed
wyth theyr heauy stroke, do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>lycte
<pb facs="tcp:8426:131"/>
and vexe theym selues. But in
the meane tyme, these men marke not
howe contrarye they are to theym sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.
For they commend theim, whiche
dye wyllinglye. And yet they disprayse
those, that beare not heauilye the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of theyr frendes. As though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
it might be by anye meanes, that anye
man shoulde loue another better than
him selfe. That is a notable sayenge,
and (if you marke it well) ryghte and
true, that such as ought of all other to
be dearest vnto vs, we loue as our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.
But that we shoulde loue theym
more then our selues, I thinke that is
trulye impossible. Neyther trulye is it
to be desyred in frendeshippe, that my
frende should loue me more, then hym
selfe: or I hym more then my selfe.</p>
               <p>For thereof woulde ensue, a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the whole trade of oure lyfe,
and of all sortes of dutyes. But hereof
we will reason, in other places. Nowe
this shalbe sufficiente to admonyshe,
that to the losse of frendes we doe not
<pb facs="tcp:8426:131"/>
adioyne our miserye: and that we loue
them not more, then they them selues
would, or at the leaste wyse more then
our selues. For whereas some saye
that suche kinde of comfortes, do helpe
manye men nothynge at all, and adde
thereunto, that suche as comforte o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
when fortune tourneth her face
to theym, are not able to cloke theyr
owne miserye: the aunsweryng of both
is easye ynoughe. For these are the
faultes not of nature, but of follye.</p>
               <p>But to inueyghe agaynste such follye,
although I might at this present very
largelye, yet I wyll not. For both they
whych do not suffer theym selues to be
holpen, do thereby prouoke others to
miserye, &amp; also, they y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> take theyr owne
chaunce more greuouslye, then afore
they counsayled others, are not more

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8426:132"/>
For it is a commen practise of fooles,
to espye other mens faultes, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
theyr owne. But this is a great
proofe, that whereas it is certayne,
that time taketh aways sorow, yet that
helpe doth not consyste in time it selfe,
but in long musing and ponderynge of
the mischaunce. For if both the chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and also the man him selfe, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
one, howe maye the sorowe be
any part swaged? yf neyther the thing
whiche caused it, neyther yet the man
whych soroweth, are chaunged? wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
this continual opinion, that there
is no euell in the thinge, that is chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
doth helpe the sorowe, and not the
length of time. Here some men bryng
in the moderation of all perturbations
whych if it be naturallye in man, then
wyll nature it selfe appoynt a measure
of sorow. But they consist onely in the
opinion. Let that opinion be wholye
rooted out therefore. Nowe (I thinke)
we ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

procedeth of the opinion of some
present euel: to the which opinion also,
this is adioyned, that we oughte of
<pb facs="tcp:8426:132"/>
ryght to lament and be sorye. To this
definition, Zeno hath well added, that
that opinion of some presente euell,
ought to be fresh. By the which terme
he doth vnderstand, not onelye that to
be freshe, whyche hapned but late, but
also, as longe as, in that whyche we
tooke to be euell, there is anye force or
countenaunce whyche troubleth vs.</p>
               <p>As Arthemisia, the wyfe of Mausolus,
kinge of Carya, whyche made that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
tombe at Halycarnassus, she (I
saye) all her life time lyued in sorowe:
and therewyth also at lengthe consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
To her, this opinion whiche we
nowe talke of, was continually freshe.
He therefore that wil assaye to comfort
any man, in his sorowe, oughte eyther
vtterlye to roote oute his gryefe, or to
appease it, or els to mitigate it as
much as maye be, or els to suppresse it,
not suffering it to spreade any further,
or els to tourne his minde frome one
gryefe to another. There be some, who
thinke, that this onelye is the dutye of
him that would assay to comforte anye
man, to proue that it is no euell at all.
<pb facs="tcp:8426:133"/>
Of the whyche opinion Cleantes is.</p>
               <p>There are other some whyche would
huae him shewe, that the euell is not
so great as he taketh it. And of this
minde are the Peripatetikes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be, whyche thynke it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente
to shewe, that it is no straunge
chaunce, whyche is happened. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus
thinketh, that it is one of the
chyefest poynctes of comforte, to take
awaye from him that is in heauinesse
this opinion, that he ought of dutye to
lament, and be sorye. There be some
also, that put al these thinges togyther
for dyuers men are dyuerselye moued.
I haue put theym all in my booke,
whyche I wrote of consolation. For at
that present, my mynde was greatlye
vexed, and I assayed all meanes to
helpe my selfe. But we must take our
tyme, as well in the diseases of the
minde, as of the bodye. As Promethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
in Aeschilus. To whom when one
sayde.
<q>
                     <l>But this (Prometheus) I do thinke,

                     <l>That reason force full lightly may,

                  </q>

his medecine.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The fyrst precept therefore in consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is to shewe that that whyche is
chaunced, is eyther no euell, or els ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
small. The nexte is, to shewe the
commen estate and miserye of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde.
The thyrde, that it is meere
follye in vaine to waste him selfe wyth
sorowe: especiallye, in asmuche as he
perceyued, that he is nothinge holpen
thereby. For Cleantes comfort, serues
but for a wyse man, who nedes no com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forte
at all. For yf you perswade a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowefull
minde, that nothing is euell,
but that whiche is dishonest, you shall
not by that meanes take awaye his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe,
but his follye. But trulye both
the time, is yll t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> teache, and also it
seemeth, that Cleantes sawe not,
that gryefe of mynde myght be styrred
sometimes, vppon suche occasion, as
I am sure he hym selfe wyll confesse
<pb facs="tcp:8426:134"/>
not to be greatly euell. For what wyll
he say hereunto? when Socrates per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
Alcibiades, that there was no
poynct of manhode in him, and that he
was no better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vilest slaue, that
went on the grounde. When Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
did for thys cause afflicte him, and
humbly weeping, requested Socrates
to enstructe him in vertue, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he mighte
flye vyce: what? wil you say Cleantes?
that the cause of Alcibiades griefe was
no euell at all, because it was not the
greatest euell that might be. Lycon,
mindinge to make men esteeme griefe
of minde, as a light matter, sayes that
it is stirred vppon small occasions: as
wyth the mischaunces of fortune, and
bodilye hurt, wythout anye euels per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynyng
to the minde. But dyd not the
griefe of Alcibiades, ryse chiefelye for
the vyces, whiche he felte in his owne
minde? Nowe of the consolation of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurus
we haue spoken sufficientlye
heretofore. Neyther truly is that kinde
of comforte verye stronge, although it
both is much vsed, and also manye ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
taketh effecte, I meane, to shewe,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:134"/>
that suche chaunces come not to hym
onely. It helpeth in deede (as I haue
sayde) but neyther at all times, neither
yet all men. For there are some that
despyse it. But it is a great matter,
bowe we beare it. For we oughte not
to tell, what mischaunce euery priuate
man hathe suffered, but howe wyselye
wyse men haue borne it. The consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chrisippus, is the strongest for
the truth of the sayenge: but hardest to
perswade in time of sorowe. For it is a
hard worke to proue to one that mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
that he dothe it of his owne free
will, and for that he thinketh he ought
so to do. Wherefore, as in pleadyng of
causes, we do not alwayes vse one
kynde of state (for so we terme the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye
sortes of controuersyes) but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
confyrme oure selues, to the tyme,
the nature of the question, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearer, so must we do in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaging
of griefe. For we must marke
what kynde of cure eche man is apt to
take. But I knowe not howe I haue
made a longe digression from our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
For you moued your question of a
<pb facs="tcp:8426:135"/>
wyse man, to whom eyther nothynge
maye seeme euell, that wanteth disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestye,
or els if any euell chaunce vnto
him, it is lightly ouercome wyth wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
so that it is scarce sene. Because
he fosters no fonde opinion, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of his gryefe. Neyther thynketh
it wysedome to vexe and waste hym
selfe wyth mournynge. Then the

But to brynge backe my talke to
my fyrst purpose: in howe shorte tyme,
howe many and howe notable poetes,
but chiefely what excellent oratoures,
haue there bene amonge vs? So that it

And of other studyes, we bothe will

rooted truly among vs: howebeit afore
the time of Lelius and Scipio. I scarse

that Diogenes the Stoike, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades

&amp; being borne the one at Cyrene, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

they had neuer bene appoynted to that
office, vnlesse in theym, as in certayne
principall men, all studyes of learnyng
at that time had chiefelye flouryshed.</p>
            <p>Such men, when they employed theyr
wyttes, to writinge, some penned the
ciuile lawe, some their owne orations,
some the monumentes of theyr fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.
But this moste ample and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarye
arte of all the rest. I meane the
rule of good lyfe, they taughte more
<pb facs="tcp:8426:140"/>
wyth theyr sincere cunning, then with
anye monumentes of learninge. And
therfore of that true and excellent phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophye,
which inuented of Socrates,
hath hitherto remayned amonges the
Peripatetikes, there be almost, eyther

to such as were rude and ignoraunt.</p>
            <p>But while those worthy sages whisted

the which, the one they say is endewed
with reason, &amp; the other is wholy voide
of the same. In that part which is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of reason, they place quietnesse
with an assured consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy. In the other,
they say, are al the troublous motions,
as well of anger as desyre, whiche are
all enemyes, and contrary to reason.</p>
               <p>Let this therfore be oure foundacyon:
but in describyng these perturbations,
we wyll vse the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> definitions and diuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

a lust, as hath swarued farre from the

their beginninge of the two sortes of
goodes, and two sortes of euels. And
so there are in noumber foure. Two
<pb facs="tcp:8426:142"/>
that are stirred by the opinion of some
good thing: whych are desyre and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
For gladnes proceedeth of ioye,

And two that are caused of the opinion

in a wyse man onelye, and defyne it
thus. Willynge, is that, whyche desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
any thyng according to reason.</p>
               <p>But it whych coueytes agaynst reason
is called lust, or immoderate desyre,
whyche is in all fooles. Also when we
haue attayned anye good thynge, oure
minde is moued two maner wayes.</p>
               <p>For eyther it is quyetelye moued vnto
mirth according vnto reason: and then
it is called i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wythout measure, and then it may
wel be called light or ouermuch mirth.
Whyche they defyne to be the ioye of
the minde, wythoute reason. And as
we do naturally coueyte such thinges,
as seeme in oure eye to be good, so doe
we naturallye flye from those thinges
which seeme to be euell. Whych if we
do according vnto reason, we may wel
call it warynes: and saye, that it is in
none, but onely such as are wyse. But
yf it be wyth an humble submission,
wythout reason, then may it be called
feare. So feare is wearynes agaynst
reason. But as for anye affection
that should be in a wyse man, because
<pb facs="tcp:8426:143"/>
of some presente euell, there is none at
all. But that wherwith fooles are com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bred,
is sorowe, whych procedeth of the
opinion of some present euell, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
theym to abate theyr courage, and
faynt, contrary to reason. For the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
cause, it is defyned, to be a faynting
of the minde, contrary to reason. So
there are foure kindes of perturbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s:
and but three sortes of good motions,
because there is no good motion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to sorowe. But they thinke, that
all these perturbations are stirred of
our owne iudgement, and free wyll.</p>
               <p>And for that cause, they defyne they<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:8426:144"/>
Desyre is the opinion of some good
likely to come vnto vs, whych it were
for our profyte presently to haue. But
in these opinions, they do not onelye
place the perturbations theym selues,
but also those thinges whych are done
by them. As gryefe of minde, causeth a
certayne nippinge of sorowe, and feare
a fayntinge &amp; submission of the minde,
and ioye an vnreasonable mirthe, and
lust an immoderate desyre. And this
worde opinion, which we haue put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
euery one of the former definitions,
they interprete to be a lyght agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
But of euerye perturbation, there are
many partes of the same sorte. As of
gryefe of minde, inuyenge, (for we
must vse at this time that word, albeit
it be not much in vse. For enuye is not
properly sayd to be in him onely, which
dothe enuye another, but also in hym
whych is enuied) emulation, obtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
pitye, anguyshe, waylynge, mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge,
gryefe, sadnesse, lamentacion,
carefulnesse, trouble somenes, afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
desperation, and such like. The sundry
sortes of feare, are slouthfulnes, shame
<pb facs="tcp:8426:144"/>
terrour, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>are, dread, extreame, feare ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>amination,
trouble, fearefulnesse. Of
ioye, there is maleuolence, reioycing at
other mens losse, vaine delg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>htes, boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinge,
and others like. Of luste, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre,
there are anger, shaking, hatred,
enmity, indigence, desyre, wyth others
of the same sorte. And all these partes,
they defyne after this sorte. Enuienge,
is a sorowe taken for some other mans
prosperity, which nothinge hurtes the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>your. For, yf anye man be aggree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with the prosperitye of anye man,
that is noysome to him, he can not be
well sayde to enuye him. As no man
would saye, that Agamemnon did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye
Hector. But he, whiche is grieued
wyth the prosperity of some other man
whyche is nothing hurteful to him, is
sayde to enuye. But emulation is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
two maner wayes, the one prayse
worthy, thother discommendable.</p>
               <p>For, the desyre to excell in vertue, is

                  </gap>alled emulation. But thereof we will
say nothing at this time. For it is com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendable:
and also, there is emulation
which is a gryefe taken, for that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:

Mourninge is a lamentable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
Griefe is a paynful sorowe. Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

Fearefulnesse, is a continual feare
The partes of feare they describe in
this wyse. Maleuolence, is a pleasure
conceyued of an other mans aduersity,
which is nothinge to our profyte. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyghte,
is a pleasure reioycinge the
mind, with some pleasaunt noise, sight
touching, smell, or taste. Which are al
of one sorte. Pleasures inuented to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate
the minde. Boastinge, is a
light and a bragginge pleasure. The
partes of desyre they define in thys
wise. Anger is a desyre to punishe him
which seemeth to haue hurt vs wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cause. Chafing, is an anger soone
begon &amp; soone ended, which in Greeke
is called <hi>Thymosis,</hi> Hatred, is an inuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
malice. Enmity, is anger, waiti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
time to reuenge. Discorde, is a bytter
<pb facs="tcp:8426:146"/>
anger, conceyued with inward hatred,
from the heart. Indigence, is an insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable
lust. Desyre, is a lust to see some
thinge that is not presente. But, the
fountayne and spryng of all perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
is intemperance. Whiche is a
swaxuinge of the whole minde, from
the obedience of reason: so strayed from
the rule of the same, that the lustes of
the minde, can neyther be ruled nor
brydeled. Wherfore, like as tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce
doth quiete all lustes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
theym to obey reason, and kepeth
the iudgementes of the minde vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted:
so the enemye of the same, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperaunce,
disquieteth, troubleth,
and vexeth euerye part of the mynde.</p>
               <p>And for that cause, bothe sorowe and
gryefe, and also the other perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
are stirred by her. Like as when
the bloud in the bodye of man, is once
corrupted, or fleaume or choler doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
it causeth syckenesses and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases

               <p>From it, do procede all honest desyres,

the whole rule of reason. Howebeit,
vertue it selfe, may in the bryefest ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
well be termed the rule of reason.
To this vertue, vyce is contrarye, for

that it had at these dayes purchased the

a frugall man doth all thinges well.</p>
               <p>Which selfe same sayeng, the Stoikes
affyrme wyth great constancye, and
stoutenes. Whosoeuer therfore, hath
so fortifyed his minde with moderance
and constancye, that he is neyther py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with sorowe, nor discouraged with
feare, neyther gredely coueytinge anye

reioysing, with excessiue mirth, dothe
become effeminate: he is that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we seke. He is happy to whom neither
anye griefe shall seeme so intollerable,
that it may constraine him to abate his
courage: neyther yet any ioye so great,
that it shoulde cause him vainelye to
boaste and bragge of him selfe. For
what may seeme great to him, in thys
worlde, who museth on eternitye, and
knoweth the largenes of the wide
worlde? For what, either in the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of man, or els in this shortenes of
life, may seeme straunge to a wise ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
whose minde, is alwayes so watche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that nothing can befal to him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked

straunge. Who also spreades his wyt
<pb facs="tcp:8426:153"/>
so farre on all partes, that he dothe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
see bothe place, and also tyme,
howe, and where he maye liue in tyme

fortune shall caste on him, he will qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
take it, and be content therewyth.
Which, whosoeuer doth, he shal want
not onelye gryefe of minde, but all the
other perturbations also. And trulye,
the minde being of them eased, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
and absolutelye happye. And the
same stirred and drawen bi them, from
sure and perfecte reason, doth lose not
onely constancy, but also, al his health.
Wherefore, fonde and effeminate is
the reason and talke of the Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,
who thinke it necessary, that our
myndes should be troubled. But, they
appoynte a certayne meane, which we
ought not to exceede. Will you make
anye meane in vyce? Or is it no vice,
not to folowe reason? Or doth not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
teache, that it is not good, eyther
thirstily to coueyte any thing, or when
thou hast obtayned it, to reioyce vayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye?
Doth she teache, that it is no euel,
eyther to be ouercome, or els not to be
<pb facs="tcp:8426:153"/>
quiete in minde, because of sorowe?</p>
               <p>Doth not she shewe the: that all excea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
sadnes, or vayne myrthe, proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
of erroure? For let vs seeke some
meane in sorowe. For in it men take
most payne. Fanius wryteth, that
Publius Kutilius, toke greuouslye his
brothers repulse, when he stoode in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
for the Consulshippe. But it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that he passed measure. For it
was the onelye cause of his death. He
ought then, to haue taken it more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately.
But, what if whiles he tooke
this so greuouslye, the death of some of
his children had chaunced also? Then
there had also come a newe griefe. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse,
moderate: but yet it had
bene a great encrease of his former so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe.
What, if then, there had ensued
some disease in his bodye, the losse of
goodes, blyndenes, banishemente, and
some newe gryefe, and a newe sorowe
for euerye one of theym? then it were
made the greatest gryefe that myghte
be: which could not be borne. So we se
that, who so euer sekes to appoyncte a
meane in anye vyce, dothe, like as if a
<pb facs="tcp:8426:154"/>
man would thinke, that one y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> shoulde
cast him selfe downe from a rocke, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the sea, myght staye him selfe, when
he would. For trulye, like as that can
not be, so, neyther can a troubled, or
moued minde, staye it selfe, where and
when it wil. Also, those thinges which
are yll, when they come to their rype<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and proofe, those same also are
nought, when they are tender &amp; yong.
But sorowe, and all other perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when they are encreased to the
most, are vndoubtedly pestilent. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
euen at the fyrst breeding they are
not wythout vyce. For when they are
departed once fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reason, they encrease
of theyr owne accorde: and ouer owne
frayletie flatters it: and so at the laste,
vnwares launches into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> depe, where
it can not stand. Wherfore there is no
difference, whether they allowe a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocritie
of perturbations, or a meane
of vnryghtuousnes, slouth, and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraunce.
And he whych appoynteth a
meane in vyce, confesseth, that some
part thereof ought to be borne. Which
bothe is odious of it selfe, and also so
<pb facs="tcp:8426:154"/>
much the worse, as all vices are of slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
nature, and beinge once begon in
anye man, do continually cause him to
fall and slyde into all noughtines. So
that, he can by no meanes, staye hym
selfe. Furthermore, what a thing is it
that the Parepatetikes saye, that these
perturbations, which we thinke ought
to be pulled out by the rootes, are not
onelye placed in vs of nature, but also
that the same was done for a greate
commoditye? For this is theyr sayeng.
Fyrst they commende anger hyghlye,
naming it the whet sloane of fortitude
and sayeng, that it enflameth the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of men, more stoutely both agaynst
theyr enemies, and also agaynst a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
citesen: terminge theyr reasons
lyghte, who dyd thus perswade theym
selues. It is right that we should wage
this warre, that we shoulde fyghte for
our lawes, libertye, and countrey.</p>
               <p>These thinges, are of no force to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
oure courage (saye they) unlesse
anger be present. Neyther do they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
thus of warriours onely. But they
thinke also, that there can be no seuere
<pb facs="tcp:8426:155"/>
iudgementes, without some sharpenes
of anger. Neither do they allowe anye
oratour, not onely being pleintife, but
also defendaunte, vnlesse he pleade an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerlye.
Or, if he be not angry, yet both
in his wordes, and iestures, do fayne
anger: so that, his wordes, may kindle
and prouoke the hearers to anger. To
conclude, they thinke he is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that
can not be angry. And that whyche we
call gentlenes, they terme lenitie: and
counte it a fault. Neyther do they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
commend this kynde of lust (for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
as I haue already defyned it, is the
lust to reuenge) but saye also that that
other sorte of lust, or desire, was geuen
vs of nature for a greate commodytie.
For they thinke that no man can do
anye thinge notable, vnlesse he haue
an earnest luste, or desyre vnto it.</p>
               <p>Themistocles walked in the nyghte
tyme, in the open streete, because he
could not sleepe. The cause whereof,
when some men did enquyre, he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that the triumphe of Milciades
would not suffer him to take hys reste.
who hath not harde, of the watcheful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="tcp:8426:155"/>
of Demosthenes? who sayd that it
greued him very much, if he shuld here
any workemen vp afore hym. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
the chiefest Philosophers, should
neuer haue profyted so muche in theyr
studies, without a burning desire, and
zeale of learning. We haue heard, that
Pithagoras, Democritus, and Plato,
searched the farthest countreis that are
knowen, for knowledge. For where so
euer they harde, that there was anye
thing for them to learne, thether, they
thought, that they oughte to trauayle.
And thinke we, that they woulde so
haue done, wythout a great heat of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre?
Nowe, sorowe it selfe, whyche I
sayde, that men oughte wyth all theyr
myght to flye, as an horrible and vgly
beast, they thinke to haue bene appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of nature, not without some singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie. Which is, that it should
gryeue men for theyr faultes to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened,
rebuked, and put to shame. For
they seeme safelye to haue sinned, who
beare shame and reproche (whiche they
deserued for theyr faulte) wythout any
sorowe. It is better to haue his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb facs="tcp:8426:156"/>
gnawed wyth repenta unce.</p>
               <p>Whereof proceeded that sayeng of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franius,

               </p>
               <p>¶Also, the other two partes of sorowe
they saye, are profitable. Pity, to helpe

emulation is not vnprofitable: whych
is, when we are agryeued, that eyther
we haue not attained that, which some
other hath, or els some other hathe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
the same, whyche we haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
But feare, if any man should take
away, then were all diligence (thynke
they) vtterlye gone. Which is chiefely
sene in them, whyche feare the lawes,
the officers, pouertye, shame, death, or
sorowe. All these thinges, they saye,
ought to be cut of, from theire ful styr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng
and liberty, but to be rooted out,
they thinke they neyther can, neyther
neede to be. So that, as in all other
thinges, so in this also, they thinke the
<pb facs="tcp:8426:156"/>
meane to be best. In whych reasons,
thynke you, that they speake any thing
to the purpose, yea or no?</p>

               <speaker>Hea.</speaker>
               <p>Truly,

And therfore I looke, howe you

               <p>I will
fynde some what to obiect agaynst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
But this one thinge before. Do you
marke, howe great modesty there was
emonges the Academikes? For they
speake playnelye to the purpose. The
Peripat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tikes, are aunswered of the
Stoykes. Let theym contende for me:
who neede not, but to enquyre what
is most likely to be true, in euerye que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
What is there then in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
whereby that may be tryed? far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the whyche the wytte of man
can not reache, the definition of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations:
whych I thynke, that Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
hath well expressed. For he dothe
thus defyne it. A perturbation, is a mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
contrarye to reason, and agaynste
the nature of the mind. Or more brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
thus. A perturbation, is a veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
appetite, or lust. By vehement, be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth
such an appetite, as should
<pb facs="tcp:8426:157"/>
farre swarue, from the constancye of
nature. What is there that I may say
agaynst these definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? But these are
for the most parte, the wordes of wyse
and suttel disputers. But these termes
of the Peripatetikes, the heate of the
mynde, and the whetstones of vertue,
come oute of the Rhetoricians scooles.
But can not a man be stout, but when
he begins to stomake the matter. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that is a poynct of masters of fence:
howebeit, oftentimes in them also, we
see great modestye. They commen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither,
they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany together, they aske
questions one of another. So that they
seeme to be pleased, rather then angry.
But of their opinion, let there be some
one like Pacidianus, whom Lucilius
describeth wyth these wordes.
<q>
                     <l>Ile kill him strayght, and beate hym
sure, if that be it you seke.</l>
                     <l>But first perhaps his chaunce maye

                     <l>Afore my sword within his heart or

                     <l>I hate the slaue, and therfore nowe

                     <l>
                        <pb facs="tcp:8426:157"/>
Then til his sword out of his sheath
into his hand he take.</l>
                     <l>So much I long my hatefull wrathe
vpon his bloud to slake.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But wythout this dronken anger, we
see Aiar in Homere, comming out ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye
times, wyth great mirth, when he
should fyght wyth Hector. Whose en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye
into the field, when he had put on
his armour, reioyced his felowes, and
feared his foes. Insomuche, that, (as
Homere wryteth) it repented Hector
him selfe, that he had prouoked hym to
battell. And they trulye; commoninge
gently, and quyetely, the one wyth the
other, afore they foughte, did not in
theyr very fyght, do any thyng anger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
or outragiouslye. I trulye thynke,
that not Torquatus, who gotte his
name by fyghte, did wyth an angrye
moode, take awaye the frenche mans
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hayne. Neyther, that Marcellus was
therefore to be counted stoute, at Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stidium,
because he was angry. For A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricanus,
because he is better knowen
vnto vs, for that he lyued but of late
yeares, I durst sweare, that he was not
<pb facs="tcp:8426:158"/>
then inflamed with anger, when he co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uered
with his Tergat, Marcus Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enus,
a Pelignian, &amp; fastned his darte,
in the breste of hys enemye: of Lucius
Brutus, there is more doubt whether,
because of the vnmeasurable hate, that
he bare agaynste the Tirant, he ranne
more fiercely against Aruns or no. For
I vnderstande, that either of them, at
one course, slew the other. What nede
you, to bring in anger then? Hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
no force, vnlesse she beginne to

what may there be more foolyshe, then
Achilles in Homere? or then Againem

both to madnes, and also to death. For<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titude
therefore nedeth not the ayde of
anger. It is sufficiently furnished, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and ayded of it selfe. For after
theyr opinion, we may saye, that dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes,
is profitable for fortitude. And
so likewyse of madnes. Because, bothe
madde &amp; dronken men, do many thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
verye stoutelye. Aiax was at all ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
stoute, but most of all in his mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
For then he did a valiaunt feate,
when the Grecians, beinge readye to

the batayle. Shal we therfore say, that
madnes is profitable? Weygh the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of fortitude. So shall you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue,
that it nedeth not anger. Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
therefore, is an affection of the

in sufferyng thinges. Or the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
of a stable and sure iudgement, in
the suffering or auoyding, of those thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
which seeme to be feareful &amp; terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb facs="tcp:8426:159"/>
Or, the knoweledge of such thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,

a sincere iudgement of the same. Or
els, more bryefely, as Chrisippus doth
(for all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> former definitions, are made
by one Spherus, who according to the
iudgementes of the Stoykes, is expert
in defininge, and they are all in maner
lyke, but the one declareth some thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
mere playnely then the other.)</p>
               <p>Howe then sayeth Chrisippus? Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
is the knoweledge (sayeth he)
howe to beare, or suffer gryeues. Or it
is an affection of the minde, obeyinge
the hyghe lawe of reason, in bearynge
and sufferynge withoute all feare. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though,
we vse to scoffe at these philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
as Carneades was wont, yet
I feare, least they onely, are to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
philosophers. For, whiche of these
definitions, doth not open vnto vs, the
opinion, which is hidden, and closed in
our mindes, of the nature of fortitude?
Whyche beinge opened, and knowen,
who is there that would seeke anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
aide, for a warriour, iudge, or ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.
<pb facs="tcp:8426:160"/>
Or would not thinke, that they,
wythout madnes or anger, could do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thyng stoutely? Why? the Stoykes
when they proue, that all fooles are
madde, do they not rehearce, these thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
amonges theyr follye, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
Take awaye the perturbations,
and anger chiefelye, theyr reasons wil
seeme to be monsters. They reason
thus. We saye, that all fooles are mad
likeas we saye, that donge smels yll.</p>
               <p>But as donge doth not alwayes smell
yll, but when you stirre it, you shall
then perceyue it: so lykewise, an angry
man, is not alwayes angerd. but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
him a litle, and then shall you see
him starke mad. What? this warlyke
anger, when it entreth into any house
what diuision maketh it, betwyxte the
man and wyfe, children, and all the
householde? Is it then profitable also?
Is there anye thinge, that a dysquyete
mynde, can better do, then a quiet and
constant? Or can any man be angrye,
wythout the disquieting of his minde?
Our countreymen therefore, whereas
all diseases of the minde, are greate
<pb facs="tcp:8426:160"/>
faultes and vices, yet, because none of
them was worse then anger, did terme
onely those, whych were angrye men,
si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ke persons. But an oratour trulye,
anger becometh not, and to dissemble,
is it not a shame? Do you thinke vs
then to be angry, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we speake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
earnestly, or vehemently in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge?
Also, when the matters beynge
paste and gone, we wryte oracions, do
we then wryte angerly? Dyd any man
thinke that eyther Aesopus, pleaded be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
angrye? or, that Accius, wrote in a
chafe? All thinges, are handeled more
notablye, and farre better, of some ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
then of ani stage plaier. But they
are handled by them, quietlye and pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sablye.
Nowe, to commend luste, what
a toye of luste is it? You brynge for the
Themistocles, and Demosthenes, to
whome you ioyne also, Pythagoras,
Democritus and plato. What? do you
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all earnest studye, a lust? which beinge
referred to the best sorte of thinges, yet
ought we to be quyet and stedfast. But
in praysing sorowe, of all others moste
detestable, what philosophers, do they
<pb facs="tcp:8426:161"/>
shewe them selues? But Afranins said
well.
<q>If one part grieue the, would to god,
that all might smart alike.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For he spake it, of a rechelesse, and a
dissolute yonge man. But we put our
question of a constant and a wise man.
And so let vs leaue that anger, to some
capitaine, or souldiour: whom we nede
not here to rehearce. For it is good, for
them to vse the motions of their minde
who can not vse reason. But we (as I
haue often heretofore sayd) put our que<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stion
of a wyse man. But emulation,
obtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctation, and pitye, are also profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
Why shouldest thou pitie a man
rather then helpe him, if thou canst?
Can we not be liberall without pitye?
We ought not to sorowe for other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
put if we can, to ease others of sorowe.
Nowe, obtrectation, and emulation,
whereunto are they profitable? since it
is the poynct of emulation, to be vexed
at an other mans commoditye, whiche
he him selfe hath not: and the nature of
obtrectacion is, to be gryeued, with the
prosperitye of an other, for that he hath
<pb facs="tcp:8426:161"/>
gotten the selfe same commoditie, that
we had. But who coulde fynde in his
heart, to come to the experience of thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
by sorowe? And the mediocritye of
euels, who can iustly commende? For,
who is there, in whome there is anye
lust, or desyre at all, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is not a noughty
luster, &amp; desirer of that, he should not?</p>
               <p>Or who is there, in whom ther is any
anger, that is not an angry person?</p>
               <p>Or who is there, in whom there is so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe,
that is not soroweful? In whom
is there feare, that is not feareful? And
thinke you, that a wise man, maye be a
vicious desyrer, of that, he should not,
or an angrye, sorowefull, or fearefull
person? Of whose prayse, althoughe, I
could speake very much, yet thus much
I will briefely saye, that wisedome, is
the science, and knoweledge, of the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per,
&amp; appointed causes, of euery thing:
as well in heauen as in earth. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
it appeareth, that it pursueth onely
such thinges, as are heauenly: &amp; earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thinges, it doth subdue &amp; rule, wyth
vertue: Did you then saye, that to him,
as a sea lyeng open for euerye wynde,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:162"/>
anye perturbation might chaunce.</p>
               <p>What is there, that coulde trouble so
greate grauitie, and constancie? Maye
some sodayne or vnprouided chaunce
do it? But what such thinge, may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to him, to whom no chaunce, that
may happen to man, doth come vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for? For whereas they saye, that
that, whych is ouermuche ought to be
cutte awaye, and that those thynges
onelye, whych are naturall, oughte to
be left: what one thing is there, engraf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fed
in vs of nature, of the whyche, we
haue ouer much? For all these thynges
sprynge oute of the rootes of erroure:
whych oughte wholye to be pulled vp,
and not to be pared, or cut away. But
because I thinke, you do not put youre
question of a wyse man: but of youre
selfe, or of some other commen person,
(for him perchaunce, you thinke to be
voyde of all perturbations) let vs see
what store of remedyes, philosophye
hath deuysed, to helpe the diseases of
the mind. For assuredly, there is some
medecine. For nature was not so cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
bent agaynst mankind, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:162"/>
she hath inuented so manye reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
for the bodye, she woulde deuyse
none for the minde. Of which also, she
hath better deserued. For that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the medecines of the body, are made
of thinges without the same: the helth
and helpes of the minde are closed
within it selfe. But looke, howe much
more noble, and heauenly theyr nature
is, so muche the more diligence they
neede to be cured. Reason therfore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in good plite, sees what is beste to
doe: But being neclected, or impure, it
is wrapped in many errours. To you
therfore now I must turne al my talke
For you fayne, that you put your que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of a wyse man. But, perhaps you
meane it by youre selfe. Of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations
therfore, whych I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed,
there are diuers and sundrye
remedyes. For all sorowe is not swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
after one sorte. For, there is one
waye to helpe him that mourneth: an
other, to helpe him that pityeth: and
an other to helpe him that enuieth. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
there is this doubte in all the fower
perturbations, whether we oughte, in
<pb facs="tcp:8426:163"/>
consolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to applie our talke against
all perturbations generallye (whyche
are the despisinge of reason, or els a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
appetite) or els frame our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion,
agaynst euery singuler pertur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bation.
As agaynste feare; desyre, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
of all the reste. And whether we
ought is reason, whether this pryuate
chaunce, for the whyche he is so vexed,
ought patientlye to be borne: or els, to
shewe, that we must not be sorye for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
chaunce. As if a man were pricked
with pouertye, whether, woulde you
proue vnto him, that pouertye is no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
at all, or els, that a man oughte to
take no mischaunce heauily. This last
truly were the better: least, if you shuld
not perswade him, that pouertye is no
euel, you must nedes geue him leaue to
sorowe. But if you take awaye all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of gryefe, wyth suche reasons, as I
yesterday vsed: you shal in maner, take
awaye, all the euell of pouertye. But,
let euery such perturbation, be finished
with the quietnes of the minde. whych
comes, when you proue, that it is no
good, that we so desyre: or that causeth
vs, to reioyce: and that it is no euell,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:163"/>
whereof oure feare, or gryefe doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede.
And this is a sure and approued
remedye: to shewe, that the perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
them selues, are vicious. And, that
they are not in vs of nature: neyther
are caused by necessitye. As we see that
commenlye men swage their sorowe,
when we cast in theyr teeth, the weake<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
of theyr effeminate minde: &amp; when
we commend vnto theym, theyr graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and stedfastnes, whych wythout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
trouble, do beare the like. Whyche
trulye, is wonte sometimes to chaunce
to them, whyche thynke them to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elles
in deede, and yet neuerthelesse,
that they are to be taken in good part.
As perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, some man thinkes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to be a good thing: and some other
hath the same opinion of moneye: yet
neuerthelesse, both the one maye well
be stayed from ryot, and also the other
from coueteyse. But the other maner
of perswasion, whych doth assaye, both
to take away theyr fonde opinion, and
also to ridde theyr sorowe: is in deede,
more profitable. But it takes effecte
but feeld, And also, it is not to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
<pb facs="tcp:8426:164"/>
to the commen people. Also, there
are some sortes of sorowes, which that
medecine can not helpe. As if any man
be aggryeued for the lacke, that he fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in him selfe, of vertue, courage,
good behauiour, or honestye: he trulye,
were gryeued for a thynge, that is in
deede euell. But there muste be some
other salue ministred to him. And that
is such trulye, as maye well ynoughe
be a helpe of all the rest. For this euery
man ought to confesse, that although,
those thinges whych stirre vs to feare,
or sorowe, be euell, yea, or no: or those
thinges, whych cause vs to desyre, and
reioyce, be good, yea or no: yet assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that motion or stirring of the minde
is euell. For, we will, that he, whome
we terme a stout hearted, and valaiunt
man, should be constant, quiete, gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
and such a one, as should treade vnder
his feete, all chaunces, that might hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pen
to man. But such a one, can not be
a sorowefull, fearefull, desyrous, or a
fond, ioyous person. For, those thinges
are in such, as suffer chaunces to beare
dominion ouer them. Wherfore, thys
<pb facs="tcp:8426:164"/>
is one precepte, commen amonges all
philosophers, that we speake not of
that, whyche troubleth the minde: but
onelye of the perturbation it selfe. And
therfore, fyrste as concerninge desyre,
when we minde to take away that per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turbation,
we must not alwayes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
whether that be good or no, which
moued vs to desyre: but the desyre it
selfe, must be taken awaye. So that,
whether honestye be the chiefest good,
and therfore chiefely to be desyred, or if
pleasure be it, or els both of theym ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
togyther, or all those three sortes
of goodes, namely of the minde, bodye
and fortune: yet neuerthelesse, if we vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
much desyre, euen vertue it selfe: we
must vse the like meanes, to disswade
men from that, as we vse in al the rest.
Also, the description of the nature of
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being set afore our eyes, is a great
meanes to quiete our minde. Whych,
that they may more playnely beholde,
you muste describe in youre talke, the
commen state, and miserye of mannes
life. And therfore, it is reported, that
Socrates, not without cause, cut away
<pb facs="tcp:8426:165"/>
these three fyrste verses of Euripides,
from that tragedie, in the which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth
the historye of Orestes.
<q>
                     <l>The fearefulst chaunce, that eyther

                     <l>That chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce may bring, or gods down

                     <l>The nature yet, and hearte of man,
with pacience wel may beare.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>¶Also, to perswade, that it whiche is
chaunced, both may, and also ought to
be borne, the rehersall of many, whych
haue suffered the same, is very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Howebeit, we haue shewed, howe
sorowe might be swaged, both in oure
yesterdayes talke, and also in our boke
of consolation: whyche, (for I muste
nedes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse: that I am no wise man)
I wrote in the middes of all my gryefe
and sorowe. And whereas, Chrisippus
doth forbyd vs to minister oure mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
when our minde is freshe swol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
wyth the wound: yet I did it, and
ioyned thereunto, the whole strengthe
of my nature: that, the sharpnes of my
sorowe, myghte yelde, to the strength,
of the medecine. But next to sorowe (of
<pb facs="tcp:8426:165"/>
the which we haue sufficiently spoken)
comes feare. Of the whych also, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
must be sayde. For as sorowe,
proceedeth alwayes, of some presente
griefe: so is feare alwayes caused, of
some griefe that is to come. And for
that cause, some sayde, that feare was
a certayne braunche of gryefe: other
some, sayd it was the forerunner and
guyd of gryefe. Wherfore, by the same
meanes, that we maye beare gryefe,
when it is presente, by the same also
we maye despyse it, that is likelye to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. For we must take great heede,
that in them both, we do nothing more
humblye, lowelye, wantonlye, effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,
or abiect like, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it becometh a
man. But, although, we must treat of
the inconstancie, weakenes, &amp; lyght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of feare: yet it is good to despyse
those thinges, whiche most men feare.
And for that cause, whether it were by
chaunce, or els of set purpose, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
very wel, that the first, and second
daye, we reasoned of those thinges,
whych men most of all feare, namelye
of death, and of payne. Our reasons of
<pb facs="tcp:8426:166"/>
the whyche, who so euer doth like, and
beare away well: he may easelye be rid
of feare. And hitherto we haue treated
of those perturbations, whych procede
of the opinion of some euell. Nowe, let
vs consider those, which are styrred, by
the opinion of some goodnes. Whyche
are ioy and desyre. And I thinke trulye
that of all perturbations of the minde,
there is one onely cause: and that, they
are al in our power: and, that we suffer
them to enter vpon vs, of oure owne
voluntarye free will. This erroure
therefore, and fayned opinion, must be
taken awaye, &amp; as by reason, we make
those thinges, which seeme to be euell,
more tollerable, so we muste in those
thinges also, which are thoughte to be
greate and notable goodes, make oure
minde more quiete and peasible. And
this truly, is commen, as well to those
thinges, which are counted euell, as al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so
to those whyche are counted good:
that, if there be anye difficultie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade,
that those thinges, which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
his mind, are not good, or that they
are not euell, yet neuerthelesse, we

               <p>Alceus, beynge a man of good reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

are onely of loue. But moste of
all other, Rheginus Ibicus, euen bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with loue: as it appeareth by hys

are become the commenders, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourers

to get amitie: stirred by the syghte of

that olde loue is driuen awaye with
some newe fancye, lykeas, when wyth

chyefelye we must put him in mynde,
what madnes is in loue. For of all the

that which is commen to euery pertur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bation:
that namelye, that they are all
taken of a fond opinion, and of oure
owne free wyll. For, if loue were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
bothe all men shoulde loue, and

loue, yea, and all men one thing. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

although it doth longe trouble the

by force of the whych, there riseth
sometimes, euen amonges brethren
such like chiding.

               <p>You knowe what foloweth. For, verse

betwyxte those brethren. So that it
maye lightlye appeare, that they were
the sonnes of Atreus. Who museth,
howe to inuent some straunge cruelty,
agaynst his brother.

               </p>
               <p>Lo he sets the bowelles of his children
afore him. For what crueltie is there,
to the whych, anger, &amp; madnes woulde
not perswade a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? And for that cause
we do well saye, that angrye men are
out of theyr owne power. By the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,
we meane, that they are wythoute
counsell and reason. Whych onelye,
ought to rule our mindes. From suche
<pb facs="tcp:8426:171"/>
men, we must remoue them, on whom
they would gladly auenge them selues
till such time, as they come agayne to
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues. Which, what other thinge
is it, then to bryng home, the scattered
partes of the minde, into their owne
place? Or els we must desyre and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
them, that if they haue any great
desyre to reuenge: yet they would dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
it, to some other time, till theyr
anger coale. For, in theyr anger, the
heate of theyr minde, doth euen boyle
agaynst reason. For the whyche cause,
the sayenge of Architas, is much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.
Who, being angry with one
of his hindes, sayde. O howe would I
haue beaten the, vnlesse I had bene an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gry?
Who be they then, that saye, that
anger is profitable? (so may madnes be
profitable) or naturall? Can any thing
be naturall, which is contrarye to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
Also, yf anger were geuen vs of
nature, howe should one man be more
angrye then another? Or, howe could
any man be sory for that, which he had
done in his anger? As we haue heard
of kynge Alexander, who when in hys
<pb facs="tcp:8426:172"/>
rage, he had caused his very frend Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
to be put to death, afterwards, for
sorow he would haue slayne him selfe.
So much it did repent him. Wherfore
is there any doubt, but that this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
also, doth wholye consiste in oure
owne opinion, and will? For, who
doubteth, that all diseases, suche as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueytousnes
and desyre of glorye are: do
rise, and are caused hereof: namely, for
that we haue those thinges, of the
whyche they take theyr beginninge, in
great reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Wherfore, we do wel
perceyue, that euery perturbation, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sisteth

a certayne and sure knoweledge, and a
constant opinion, not agreing rashely
to any thing: then is feare, a mistrust,
and doubt of some euell, that we looke
for euen at hande. And, if hope, be the
expectation of some good thinge: then,
is feare the expectacion of some euell
thing. As feare ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of erroure. But, such, as are sayd natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallye
<pb facs="tcp:8426:172"/>
to be angry, pitifull, enuious, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

any such like: they truly, haue an il con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stitution
of theyr mindes. But neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
they may well be healed. As it
is reported of Socrates, in whome,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one Zopirus (which professed the
knowledge of euery mans disposition,
by the syghte of his face,) had reckened
vp a great number of vices, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of some of the frendes of Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
who knewe, that he was not
faulty in theym: they laughed him to
scorne. But Socrates, defended him.</p>
               <p>Sayeng, that those sygnes and coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were in him in deede. But, that
he did ouercome them wyth reason.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as men beinge in good
health, may seeme yet, some more then
other, to be giuen, to this or that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease:
so likewyse some mans mynde is
more prone to vice, then some others.
But their vices, who are not of nature
but onely be theyr owne fault vicious,
consiste, of the false opinions of those
thinges, which they count eyther good
or euell. And a disease once rooted, like
as in the bodye, so in the minde also, is
<pb facs="tcp:8426:173"/>
hardly holpen. For, easier it is, to heale
a sodayne swellinge, of the eyes, then a
continuall blearynesse. So, the cause of
al perturbations, being once knowen,
whyche take theyr beginninge, of the
sundrye iudgementes, of opinions, we
will here finishe this dayes disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For the endes of good, and euell,
beynge knowen, as muche as a man
may knowe them, nothynge more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
maye be wyshed, or desyred, of
all Philosophye, then those thynges,
which in these foure daies we haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed.
For, to the despysynge of death,
and bearynge of all bodilye payne, we
ioyned the ease of sorowe. Then the
whiche, there is nothinge more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous,
to man. For although euerye
perturbation be greuous vnto vs, and
doth not muche differ frome madnes:
yet, when men are in anye of the other
perturbations, as feare, myrth, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre,
we saye, that they are but trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
or disquieted. But, those that are
subiecte vnto sorowe, we terme wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
afflycted, and full of calamitye.</p>
               <p>And for that cause, it was not by
<pb facs="tcp:8426:173"/>
chaunce, but well, and aduisedly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by you, that we made a seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
discourse of sorowe, from all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perturbations. For, in it, is the
sprynge and fountayne, of all miserye.
But there is one waye, to helpe, bothe
it, and also al the other diseases of
the minde. Namely, by the shewynge,
that they are caused onelye, by oure
owne fond opinion and will, because
we thinke it ryght, and dutye, to take
them on vs. This erroure, as the roote
of all euell, philosophye promiseth to
pull vppe, euen by the rootes. Let vs
therefore, yelde our selues to it, and suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fer
it to heale vs. For, as long as these

in the whiche, we
reasoned of that Question, which you,
most of all others are wont to allowe.
For I perceiued, both by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> boke, which
you wrote vnto me, &amp; also bi your talk,
at manye other times, that you like
this opinion very well. Namelye, that
vertue is sufficiente of it selfe, to the
mayntayning of a happy and a blessed
life. Which although it be verye harde
to proue, because of so manye and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye
strokes of fortune: yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:174"/>
suche it is, that we oughte to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle,
and take paynes for the proofe
thereof. For, there is nothing in al phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>losophye,
more grauely or more wisely
spoken. For, inasmuch, as it moued all
those, that first gaue them selues to the
studye of philosophye, despysynge all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinges, to setle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
to the searchinge of the happyest
state of lyfe: trulye, they tooke so great
trauayle, and paynes, onely in hope, to
attayne a blessed life. And truly, if such
men, haue eyther found out, or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyshed
vertue: and if they found suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

of a blessed lyfe: who woulde
not iudge, that well, and worthelye,
both they did fyrst inuent, and we also
haue, folowed, the studie of philosophy?
But, if, vertue beinge subiecte, to sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye
and vncertayne chaunces, is the
slaue of fortune, and not of sufficiente
ability, to mayntayne her selfe: I feare
muche then, least it be all one, to truste
to the ayde of vertue, for the obtaining
of a blessed life, &amp; to sit still, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d wishe
after the same. In deede, remembring
<pb facs="tcp:8426:175"/>
manye times, the chaunces, wyth the
whyche, fortune hath galled me. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
to mistruste this opinion, and to
feare, the weakenes, and frayletye of
mankynde. For, I am wonte to feare,
least, inasmuch as, nature hath geuen
vs weake bodyes, to the whyche also,
she hath fastned sundrye sortes of incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
diseases, &amp; intollerable grieues:
least, she (I say) hath likewise geuen vs
mindes, agreable to the diseases &amp; gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
of our body. And also of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues,
wrapped in other seuerall cares &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
But, in this poynct, I correct my
selfe. For that, I iudge of the strength
of vertue, according to the wantonnes
and weakenes of other, yea, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce
of my selfe: and not by vertue
it selfe. For vertue trulye (if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye

of this faulte, as also, of all the rest, we
must seeke the redresse, in philosophye.
Into whose bosome, beinge, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

after that I was tost, wyth most trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
stormes, I haue euen fled to
the same, as to the hauen, from the
whych I once departed. O philosophy,
the guyde of our lyfe, the searcher of
vertue, the expeller of vice, what were
not we onely, but generally, all the life
of man able to do wythout thee? Thou
foundedst cityes, thou reclaymedst
men, whiles they were yet wylde and
wanderers, to a commen societye and
feloweshippe of life: thou bredst loue
betwyxt theym: fyrste by neyghbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode,
nexte by mariage, and laste of
all by communicatinge of talke, and
<pb facs="tcp:8426:176"/>
wrytinge. Thou, wast the inuenter of
lawes, the mistres of maners, and of
all good order. To the we flye, of the
we aske succour. To the, euen as afore
for some part, so nowe, I geue my selfe
wholye, to be ruled and gouerned. For
one daye, wel spent, accordinge to thy

should we rather vse, then thyne?
Who, both hast graunted vs, the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes

so muche it lackes, that philosophye is
so much commended, as it hath deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of the life of man, that it is, of the

dispraysed. Who woulde thynke, that
any man durst, to disprayse the parent
of his life, and so defyle him selfe with

whych he ought to feare, yea though he

this errour and miste, is bredde in the

are not able to discerne the truthe: and
<pb facs="tcp:8426:176"/>
for that cause, thinke, that they were

the rest that since haue folowed, and
placed theyr studye, in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the nature of thinges: were,
both counted, and also named wyse.</p>
            <p>Which name continued vntil the time
of Pithagoras. Who (as Heraclides
borne in Pontus, a scoler of Plato, a
man verye well learned doth wryte)
came to Phliuns, a citie in Greece.</p>
            <p>And there, reasoned bothe learnedlye
and largelye, wyth Leo the chyefe of
the same towne. Whose wyt, and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
Leo wonderinge at, asked of
him, in what arte he was mooste per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte.
Whereunto, he aunswered, that
he knewe no arte. But, that he was, a
louer of wysedome. Leo, wonderynge
at the straungenes of the name, asked
of him, who were those louers of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And what difference was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twyxte
them, and other men. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
Pithagoras aunswered, that the
<pb facs="tcp:8426:177"/>
lyfe of man myght well be resembled,
to that fayre, whych, wyth al pompe of
playes, al Greece is wont to frequent,
and sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pnyse. For, like as there, some
by the exercise of theyr bodyes, woulde
assaye to winne some game, &amp; crowne:
and, some other, came thither, for the
desyre to gayne, by byeng and sellynge
and also, there was a thirde sorte, farre
passing al the rest, who sought neither
game, nor gaynes, but came thither
onelye to beholde, and see, what was
done, and howe: so likewyse we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge
into this life, as it were into a
great frequented fayre, or market, seke
some for glory, and some for money.</p>
            <p>But very fewe, there are, which despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge
all other thinges, woulde studye
the contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nature. But those
(he sayde) were they, whome he called
the louers of wisedome. And like as
there, it is counted a greater worship,
to come for the syghte of thinges, than
to medle wyth byenge and sellynge:
euen so lykewyse in this lyfe, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templacion
and knowledge of thinges
did farre excell all other worldlye trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
<pb facs="tcp:8426:178"/>
Neyther truly, was Pythagoras
onely, the inuentour of this name, but
also an increaser of the studye it selfe,
Who, when after this communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at Phliuns, he came into Italy, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
that countrey, whych is nowe
called great Greece, bothe priuatelye,
and also openlye, wyth moste notable
orders, and artes. Of whose doctryne,
perhaps, we shal haue some more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
time to speake. But that phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophye,
whych in auncient time was
in vse, till the time of Socrates, who
was the hearer of Archelaus, the sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of Socrates: dyd onelye treate of
numbers, and motions, and whereof
al thinges were made, and whereinto
they did ende. They did also curiouslye
search out the quantity, distaunce, and
courses of the starres, and other heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bodyes. But Socrates, fyrste of all,
turned philosophy, from the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the heauenly motions, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
it in cityes, and brought it, euen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our housen: makynge it, to reason of
our life, and maners: of al thinges that
are good and euell. Whose sundrye
<pb facs="tcp:8426:178"/>
kinde of reasoninge, wyth the varietie
of the thinges them selues, and the son<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>drye
compasses of mens wits, made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
sectes of dissenting philosophers.
Of all the which, I folowe that, which
I suppose Socrates dyd vse. Namelye,
to conceale, mine owne opinion, and
reproue other mens errours. And, in
al reasoning, to enquere, what is most
likely to be true. Which custome, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche
as, Carneades did continue,
maruaylous wittelie, and copiously: I
also, enforced my selfe to do the same,

they are commen: but also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
like as colde wines haue no taste
in the water: so these reasons delyghte
me, rather in the fyrst taste, then when
I haue dronke them vp. As this whole
companye of vertues, when it cometh
to tormentes, placeth images and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
afore our cies, with great maiesty:
so, that it would seeme, that blessed life
would euen strayghte wayes, come to
them, and not suffer them to thynke,
that she would forsake them. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
you haue, once turned youre minde,
from these pictures and shades, to the
thinge, and truth it selfe: then there is
this onely left bare, whether any man
may be happy, as longe as he is in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Wherefore, hereof let vs reason
But you nede not to feare, least the ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tues
should complayne, that they are
forsaken, betrayed, and left of a happy
lyfe. For, if there can be no vertue
wythoute prudence, prudence it selfe
must nedes foresee, that all good men,
can not be happye. She remembreth
many historyes, of Marcus Attilius,
Quintus Cepio, and Marcus Aquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:180"/>
and such others. And (if you thinke
good, rather to vse the allusion of the
images, then the thinges them selues)
euen stayes her, when she would come

doth not onely feare suche thinges,
when they are coming: but also can not

Also, he that is euen puffed vp

               <p>But this is the maner
of the Mathematicians, and not of phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>losophers.
For, the Geometricians,
when they will proue any thynge, if it
pertayne to any of those thinges which
they haue afore proued, they take all
those thinges afore proued as thinges
that ought to be graunted, and are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted.
And onely expre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
wherof they wrote nothing afore.
Philosophers, what so euer thing they
haue in hand to proue, bringe in forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
all thinges, that are appliable to
the proofe of the same. Althoughe they
haue wrytten the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in some other place,
afore. For otherwyse, what needed the
Stoykes, in prouinge, that vertue is
sufficient, to make a blessed lyfe, to vse
so manye wordes? whereas, it were
enough for theym, to aunswere, that,
they had shewed afore, that nothing is
good, but that which is honest. Which
being graunted, it must nedes folowe,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:182"/>
that a blessed lyfe may, be attayned by
vertue onely. And, like as this doth fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
vpon that, so lykewyse, by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this is concluded. That, if vertue
onely will brynge vs to a happye lyfe,
then no other thinge can be good, but
that which is honest. Yet neuerthelesse
they do not so. For, both of honestye,
and also of the chiefest good, and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
they haue wryten seueral bookes.</p>
               <p>And, although, it be hereof sufficiently
proued, that vertue is able enoughe of
it selfe, to bringe vs to a blessed lyfe: yet
neuerthelesse, they make a seueral dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
more at large of the same. For
euery question, must be handeled with
his owne propre reasons, proofes, and
admonitions, especially being so nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and so large, as this is. For, I
would not haue you thinke, that, there
is any thinge more cleare in all philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophye,
or that there is any promisse of
the same more plentifull, then this is.
For, marke wel, what it doth professe.
Namely, to bryng to passe, that who so
euer doth obeye the lawes of vertue,
should be alwayes armed, agaynst for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:182"/>
and shoulde haue in him, all the
aydes, of a blessed and happy lyfe. And
to conclude, that he should be alwayes
happye. But we wil talke in other pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces,
of the effectes of philosophy. In
the meane time, I esteme that greatly
whyche she promyseth. For Xerxes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
glutted wyth all the rewardes and
gyftes, that fortune myght gyue: not
contented, wyth an infinite companye
of horsemen, and footemen, with a
wonderful sayle of ships, nor yet with
innumerable store of golde, proposed a
rewarde for him, that could deuise any
straunge pleasure. For filthy lust hath
no end nor measure. I would we could
get one, who for hope of reward would
make vs beleiue this more stedfastlye.</p>

               <speaker>Hea.</speaker>
               <p>I would wyshe so lykewyse. But
I haue one thing to saye vnto you. For
I do well agree, that of those thinges,
whyche you euen nowe rehearsed, the
one doth well folowe vpon the graunt
of the other. Namely, that, lyke as if it
be graunted, that onely, that whiche is
honest, is good: it must needes folowe
that happy life consysteth in onely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:
<pb facs="tcp:8426:183"/>
so if happy life do consist in vertue
onely, then it must nedes be, that there
is nothing good but onely vertue. But
youre fryende Brutus, folowynge the
aduise of Aristo, &amp; Antiochus, thinketh
not so: for he thinketh, that there are
other sortes of goodes, besides vertue.</p>

               <p>What? thinke you that I will at

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
               <p>Then, to shewe, howe these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
folow, the one vpon the other,
we wil deferre it to some other time.</p>
               <p>For herein, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was captiue, being
at Athenes, I dissented, both from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,
and Aristo. For I thoughte,
that no man might be happye, as long
as he might be in any euell. And truly,
a wyse ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be combred with euels
yf those, which they cal the euels of the
bodye, and of fortune, be anye euels at
all. Hereunto, this was aunswered,
which also, Antiochus hath wryten in
many places. Namely that vertue of it
selfe, may make a blessed life. But not
the most blessed, that may be. Also that
many thinges, take their name of the
<pb facs="tcp:8426:183"/>
greater part, although some parte dyd
want or misse. As we call men strong,
helthfull, riche, honourable, glorious,
because they haue a great parte of such
thinges in theim, althoughe they haue
not the thinges the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, as perfecte,
as they might haue. So likewise, a bles<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
life, they sayd, although it halted in
some part: yet it toke his name of the
greater part. I nede not now curiously
to pike out these thinges. Howebeit
they seeme to me, to be spoken scarse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stantly.
For both, I can not vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
what he that is happye, should lacke to
make him selfe more happye: (for if he
lacke any thing then is he not happye
at al). And also, whereas they say, that
euerye thinge is named of the greater
part, that is true in some other thinges
and not in this. But whereas they say
that there are thre sortes of euels: shall
we say (I pray you) that he, that is bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dened
with the .ii. first sortes, namely,
eyther with the aduersitye of fortune,
orels wyth diseases in his bodye, doth
therfore want any thinge of a happye
life? Or of the happyest of all?</p>
               <p>This is it that Theophrastus woulde
<pb facs="tcp:8426:184"/>
not say. For when he had wryten, that
strypes, tormentes, punishementes,
the rasinge of our countrey, exyle, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennes,
&amp; such like, were able to make
our life miserable, he was ashamed to
speake stoutely, inasmuche as he wrote
so fayntly, Although he doth not iustly
complayne, yet truly he is constante in
his owne opinion. And therfore, I like
not them, who when they haue graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the originall, yet will denye or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
that, whyche necessarilye depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
thereof. For they reprehende this
moste excellente, and learned philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.
But slenderly, for that he appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth
three sortes of goodes. Yet they al
reproue him in that booke, whiche he
wrote of the attayning of a happy lyfe.
For that, he reasoneth muche, that he
which is in torment, can not be blessed
In that booke also, they thinke he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that to the whele (which is a kinde
of torment among the Grecians) hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
life cannot come, trulye he saieth in
no place so. But he saies as much in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
And truly, if I should graunt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
man, that the grieues of the bodye
<pb facs="tcp:8426:184"/>
or the shipwrackes of fortune, ought to
be counted euels: could I be iustlye an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grye,
wyth the same, if he should saye,
that then, al good men are not blessed?
For as much as, such euels, might hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pen
to the best me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that myght be. The
same Theophrastus, is bayted at, as
wel in the bookes, as in the scooles of
all philosophers, for that he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this sayeng of Calisthenes.
<q>Not wysedomes lore, but fortunes
force, this world loe doth rule.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They say, that no philosopher, myght
haue spoken any thing more fayntly.</p>
               <p>And therein in deede they saye well.</p>
               <p>But yet I can not see, howe he myght
speake more constantli, folowing their
opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For, if there be so many goods
in the bodye, and so many wythout the
body, subiect to casualtye and fortune:
is it not probable, that fortune, whych
is the ruler of all outward thinges, per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayning
to the body, should beare more
swaye in our life then prudence? Or ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
should we folowe Epicurus, who
oftentimes speaketh many thinges ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wisely? but litle cares, how constant
<pb facs="tcp:8426:185"/>
and agreable he be in his talke. He
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth bare liuing. And truly, so it
becomes a philosopher. If Socrates or
Antisthenes, had said it, &amp; not he, who
esteemeth pleasure to be the ende of all
goodes. He denies, that any man may
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lue pleasauntly, vnlesse he liue honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
wysely, and iustly. Truly, nothynge
could be more sagely spoken, nor more
worthye a philosopher. Unlesse, he dyd
referre that same honestye, wysedome,
and iustice, to pleasure. What can be
better spoken, then that a wise man
oughte to be contented, wyth a meane
and bare life? But doth he saye this?
Who inas much as, he hath not onely
sayde, that gryefe is the chiefest euell,
but also, that it onelye is euell: maye,
euen then, when he shal boast him selfe
moste agaynste fortune, be ouercome
wyth a litle gryefe in his bodye? the
same also, Metrodorus spake in stouter
wordes. Sayenge, I haue nowe taken
the captiue O fortune, and stopped vp
all thy holes, so that thou mayst by no
meanes come vnto me. A notable say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge,
if it had bene spoken, eyther of
<pb facs="tcp:8426:185"/>
Aristo, Chius, or Zeno the Stoyke.</p>
               <p>Who would thinke nothing euell, but
that whych were dishonest. But thou,
O Metrodorus, which hast placed all
good in dayntie dishes, and delicate fee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinge,
and haste defyned that to be the
chiefest good, that doth consiste in the
good health of the bodye, and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
hope, that it shall so endure:</p>
               <p>Hast thou (I saye) shut vp all the holes
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f fortune? How: I pray the. For, that
whiche thou thinkest to be so greate
good, thou mayst lyghtye lose. But,
these are your baytes, for suche, as are
vnlearned, and such se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tences haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
so manye to be of that sect. But it
is the poynct of a wyse reasoner, not to
waye what euerye man doth saye, but
what they ought to saye. As in thys
selfe same position, which is nowe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to dispute: I saye, that all good
men are happye and blessed. Whom I
name good, it is playne enough. For
such as are adourned with all kinde of
vertues, we terme both wyse and good
men. Nowe, let vs see, whom we call
blessed. Truly I thinke, those whyche
<pb facs="tcp:8426:186"/>
enioy such thinges, as are good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the entermedling of any euell. For
truly, when we call anye man blessed,
we vnderstand thereby, no other thing
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the perfect conioyning of such thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as are good, seuered, and disioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
from all those thinges that are
euell. It, vertue can neuer attayne, yf
there be any thing good besides it. For
there wil alwaies be at hand, a throng
of euels (if we maye well terme theym
euels) such as pouerty, basenes of birth
solitarines, the losse of fryendes, gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
infyrmities of the bodye, the losse
of health, weakenes, blyndnes, the cap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiuitie
of our countrey, banishemente,
and bondage) In these, and such lyke, a
man may be good, and wyse. For these
thinges, casualtie, and chaunce, bryng
vpon vs, whych may happen euen to a
wyse man. But, if these thynges be
euel, who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iustly affirme, that a wise
man is alwayes happye? since, euen in
all these, he may be at one instant.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, I wyll not gladly graunt,
neyther to bothe our maysters, nor yet
to those auncient philosophers, Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:186"/>
Speusippus, Xenocrates, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon:
that inasmuch as they count al
those thinges, which I haue afore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hersed
to be euel) thei may wel affirme
that a wyse man shoulde be alwayes
blessed. But, if this fayre, and glorious
sayeng doth delyght the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: being in deede
most worthy of Pithagoras, Socrates
and Plato: then, let them finde in their
heartes, to despyse those thinges, with
the whych they are nowe so muche de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted.
namely, strength, health, beau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye,
ryches, honour, and substaunce.</p>
               <p>And to set at noughte those thinges,
whych are contrary to that which they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ayne they do desyre. Then maye they
playnly professe, that they are nothing
moued neyther wyth the force of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
neyther with the opinion of the
people, neyther with gryefe nor pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye.
But that all theyr ayde, consisteth
in theym selues: and that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wythout theyr power, that they
esteeme to be good. For it can not be
by any meanes, that any should speake
these wordes whych belong, to a stout
and hie minded man: and yet shoulde
<pb facs="tcp:8426:187"/>
think those thinges to be good, or euel,
which the common people so counteth.
With the whych glory, Epicurus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
moued, firste rose vp who (if god
will) thinkes, that a wyse man may be
alwayes blessed. He is delyghted with
the worthines of this sayeng. But tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
he woulde neuer saye it, if he did
agree to his owne wordes. For, what
is there lesse agreable then, that, he,
whych thinketh griefe to be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
euell, or els, that it onelye is euell,
that he (I saye) shoulde thinke, that a
wyse man euen in his torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes should
saye? O howe pleasaunte is this? We
must not therfore, iudge philosophers,
by euery perticuler saieng: but by their
continuall, and constant asseueration,
in all their assertions.</p>

               <p>Because I did of late, read youre

In the whyche, me thoughte, that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soninge
agaynste Cato, you assayed to
proue, this (which liked me very well)
<pb facs="tcp:8426:187"/>
I meane, that betwyxte Zeno, and the

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the straungenes of certaine
termes. Whiche, if it be true, what
cause is there, whye, yf Zeno thinke,
that vertue is of it selfe sufficiente, to
leade an honest life, the Peripatetikes
also, do not thinke the same?</p>
               <p>For, I thinke, we oughte to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
to theyr meaninge, and not to
theyr wordes.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>You trulye, worke
strayghtly wtth me. For, you reporte,
whatsoeuer I haue sayd or wrytten.</p>
               <p>But I reason wyth other men, which
wel nie of necessity maintaine the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of any one sect, after this sort. We
liue but a shorte time, whatsoeuer see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
probable vnto vs, that we do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme.
Wherfore, we onely, of al other
are free. But forasmuche as, I spake
somewhat afore of constanry, and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastenes:
I minde not in this place, to
dispute, whether it were true, that Ze<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>no
liked best, and his folower Aristo: I
meane, that that onely is good, whych
is honeste: but, that, if it be so, then he
<pb facs="tcp:8426:188"/>
should place blessed and happy lyfe, in
onely vertue: wherfore, let vs graunte
to my frend Brutus, that according to
his opinion, a wise man shoulde be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
happye. For, who is more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
to haue the glorye of that sayenge,
then he? But yet, howe well it doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
wyth his owne opinion, let hym
selfe consider. But let vs holde that
a wise man is alwayes most happye.</p>
               <p>And although Zeno, a straunger born
in Citium, a towne of Cypres, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
caruer of wordes, woulde gladly
creepe into the name of an aunciente
philosopher: Yet, the grauitie of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
ought fyrst to be deriued, from
the authority of Plato. In whom, this
is verye often repeated, that nothynge
ought to be called good, but onely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
As in his booke, which he entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Gorgias, when one demaunded of
Socrates, whether he did not thinke,
that Archelaus (who the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was counted
most fortunate of all other) was happy
&amp; blessed? He answered, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he knew not.
For, he neuer talked with him, in all
<pb facs="tcp:8426:188"/>
his life. What? sayest thou so? canst
thou not knowe it otherwise? No tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.
Doest thou doubte, then, whether
the myghtye kynge of the Persians be
happye, yea or no? Whye should I not
since I knowe not, howe learned he
is, or whether he be a good man, or no?
Whye? thynkest thou, that happy lyfe
consysteth therein? I truly thinke, that
all good men are happye: and that all
noughty men are wretched. Is Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus
then a wretche? Yea trulye, if he
be a vicious lyuer. Doth not this man
(thinke you) place happy lyfe in vertue
onely? He also, in his booke, whiche is
entituled <hi>Epitaphium,</hi> hath these wordes.
For that man (quod he) who wythin
him selfe, hath all thinges necessarye
for a happy life, and wauereth not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
vpon the good or euel chaunce
of anye other thinge, he hath euen got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
the trade of a perfect life. He is
a modest, stoute, and a wyse man. He,
although all other forrayne commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
eyther ryse or fall, will alwayes
obey the olde precept, &amp; neyther reioyce
<pb facs="tcp:8426:189"/>
neyther sorowe ouer much, because, all
his hope is fixed onely in him selfe.</p>
               <p>Out of this holy and sacred sprynge of
Plato, shall flowe all our talke that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
From whence therefore maye
we better take our beginninge, then,
from nature: the common parent, and
authour of all thinges? Who, what so
euer she made, not onelye beinge a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
creature, but also, either any such
thing, as springeth out of the ground:
made it, euerye thinge, perfecte in his
owne kynde. And for that cause, both
trees &amp; vines, &amp; also the lowe floures,
whiche can not springe hie from the
ground, some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are alwaies grene
And some of them, being made bare in
the winter, yet reuiuing in the spring,
beginne to bud out agayne. For there
is none of theym, that is not so noury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
eyther wyth some inwarde moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or els some power enclosed in it,
that it dothe not at certayne times of
the yeare, yelde eyther, floures, fruites
or beries. And all thinges, as much as
partayneth to theyr nature, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
wythin them selues, vnlesse, they
<pb facs="tcp:8426:189"/>
be hurt by the iniury of some forrayne
force. But we may much more plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
perceyue this power of nature in
beastes. Because, there are by nature,
senses geuen to theym. For some bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
nature would to be swimmynge,
and abiding in the waters: whiche are
called fishes. To other some, she gaue
the open aer, to inhabite: which are cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led
birdes. Some she made crepers, &amp;
some goers, and of theym all, some she
made solitarye: and some flockers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
some wylde: some tame: some
hidden and couered with the ground.
And of all these, euery one folowynge
his dutye, and, being not able to turne
into the nature of any other liuing cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ature:
abydes still, within that lawe,
which nature hath appoynted it. And,
likeas, there is naturallye geuen to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
beast, some especial property from
al the rest, which it doth alwayes kepe
and neuer parte from: so is there lyke
wyse to man. But it is much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
then the other. Howe be it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
is not properlye spoken, but of
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se thinges, betwyxte the whiche,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:190"/>
there is some comparyson. But the
mynde of man, proceedinge fyrst, euen
from the spyryte of God, oughte to be
compared wyth no other thynge, then
God him selfe. It therefore, if it be
well garnished, and his sighte so clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that it be not blynded with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
then it becomes a perfect mind,
which is, as much to saye, as absolute
reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which is eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vertue
is. And if that be happy, which lacketh
nothing, but is perfect of it selfe in his
owne kinde, and that properlye belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
onelye to vertue: then nedes must
all suche as haue attayned vertue, be
happye. And herein, trulye both Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
Aristoteles, Xenocrates, Speusip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,
and Polemon, do agree with me.
But I thinke further, that suche as
are partakers of vertue, are also moste
happye. For what doth he lacke to a
happye life, whyche trusteth on no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
goodes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his owne? Or he that
doth mistrust his goodes, howe can he
be happie? But he must nedes mistrust
them, who makes thre sortes of goods
For, howe can he assure him selfe, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:8426:190"/>
of the good estate of his bodye, or
els of any staye in fortune? But truly,
no man can be made happy wyth anye
good, vnlesse the same be stable and
sure. And what certayntye is there, of
any of those goodes? None at all. To
the whych, that mery sayenge of a cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin
of Lacedemon, may in my opinion
be wel applied. To whom, when a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
marchaunt man made his brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that he had set forthe a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye
of shippes, to sundrye realmes,
laden with marchaundise: nowe trulye
(quod he) I lyke not thys wealth, that
hangs all on gable endes. And is it
any doubte that those thynges whyche
maye be loste, are not of that sorte of
goodes whyche make a hapyye, and a
blessed life? For, none of those thynges
of the whyche such a lyfe doth consyst,
can eyther waxe aged, peryshe, or
moult and fall away. For he that stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in feare of the losse of anye suche
thynges, can not be happye. For we
wyll, that he, whom we counte hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye,
shall be quyete, inuincible, and
<pb facs="tcp:8426:191"/>
troubled I saye, not with a litle feare,
but wyth none at all. For as he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
innocent, which not onelye hurteth
no man lyghtlye, but also, hurteth no
man at all: so he is to be counted voyde
feare, not whyche feareth smallye, but
who feareth nothinge at all. For,
what is fortitude, otherwyse, then a
pacient affection of the minde, as well
in attempting perillous affayres, as
also in abidinge trauayle and griefe,
farre from all feare? And trulye, thys
were not so, vnlesse, all good did consist
in honestye onely. But howe might he
obtayne quietnes of minde (whyche
euery man so greatly wysheth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syreth
(by quietnes, I meane the lacke
of all sorowe, in the whych happy lyfe
doth consist) who eyther presentlye had
or els myght haue, a great number of
euels fall on him? Also, howe maye he
be stoute, and hye minded, despysing al
chaunces, which may happen to man:
as trifles (as a wise man must) vnlesse
he think, that he nedeth no more helpe
then that which is within him selfe?</p>
               <p>The Lacedemonians, when kynge
<pb facs="tcp:8426:191"/>
Philip threatned them, that he would
barre al their enterprises: asked of him
whether he wold forbid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also to die?
And shal we notsoner find out this one
man, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we nowe treate of, of such a
stomacke, then a whole citie? Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
when to this stoutenes (of the
which we nowe talke) temperaunce is
once adioyned, whyche is the cooler of
all motions: What then may he lacke
of a blessed lyfe? whom fortitude shall
defend from gryefe, sorowe, and feare:
and temperance shal reuoke from gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
desyre, and vayne mirth? And that
these thinges are wrought by vertue,
I would now proue, if I had not, more
largely shewed the same afore. And in
asmuche, as the perturbations, &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of the minde, do make a wretched
life: and, contrarywise, the quietnes of
the same, causeth a happye life: And
there are two sortes of perturbations:
the one proceedinge out of the opinion
of euel, whych are sorowe, and feare:
the other caused of the opinion of good:
which are desyre and lyght mirth: inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche
as, all these striue with reason,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:192"/>
and councell, will you doubte to saye,
that he whyche is quyete, and rydde
from such troublous motions, repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and contrarye the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is blessed? But, a wyse man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
so. A wyse man therefore, is
alwayes blessed. Also, we oughte to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce,
of all thynge, that good is.</p>
               <p>But that, whych we ought to reioyce,
of, is worthy prayse: and, what so euer
is suche, it also is glorious. If it be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
it is also commendable. But
whatsoeuer is commendable, the same
is honest also. Therfore, whatsoeuer
is good, the same is honest. But those
thinges, whych these men call goods,

that they are honest. But that onelye
is good, whyche is honest. It foloweth

saye) to call him wretched? Wherefore
what maner goodes be these, which he
that hath, neuerthelesse, may be wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched?
We must remember, that like as
a heape of corne, is made of a number
of graynes, of one sorte: so lykewyse
happye life doth consist of many partes
in nature, lyke to it selfe. Whych, if it
be so, then must we frame a happy life,
of those goodes onelye, whyche are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest.
For if there be a mixtion of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke
and contrarye partes, then can
there be no honestye made thereof.</p>
               <p>Whych being taken awaye what can
there be happye? For whatsoeuer is
good, that oughte to be desyred. And
whatsoeuer ought to be desyred, ought
to be allowable. whatsoeuer oughte to

<pb facs="tcp:8426:193"/>
fully to be accepted. And for that cause
it must be had in worshippe and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
also. Whych, if it be so, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must
it needes be laudable. All good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is laudable. Whereof, I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that whatsoeuer is honeste, the
same onely is good. Which assertion,
vnlesse we holde fast, we shall make an
infinite number of goodes. For, that I
ouerpasse ryches (whiche, inasmuch as
euery man (be he neuer so vnworthye)

For, that which is good, no noughtye

also, nobilitie, the brute of the
people, raysed by the consent of fooles,
and vicious persons. Yet these tryfles
whyche I will rehearse, will be
counted goodes. White teethe, rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng
eyes, a beautiful complexion, and
that which Euriala praysed, when she
washed the feete of Ulires, namelye
gentle speache, and tender fleshe. And
these thinges, if we do once cal goods,
what more wyt shall there be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
in the graue wysedome of philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
then in the rashe brute of the

those men terme goodes, the Stoykes
call additions. Withoute the whyche,
they thinke a happy life can not be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
furnished. But these men thinke,
that wythout them, there is no happy
life at all. Or if it be happye, that it is
not the happiest life of all. But we wil
haue it, to be the happyest of all.</p>
               <p>And that we confyrme, by a conclusion
of Socrates. For in this sorte, that
prince and founder of philosophy, dyd
reason. Suche, as the affection of man
is, such is his talke. To his talke, his
deedes be like. To his deedes his lyfe.
But there is no affection in the minde
of a good man, but good and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.
Then it must needes be honest
also, if it be commendable. Whereof it
is necessarilye concluded, that all good
men leade a happye life. For, haue we
done nothing wyth our former disputa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions?
Haue we made a vayne speake
onely, for pleasure, and to spende the
time, when we reasoned, that a wyse
man was alwayes free from all moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the minde, whych I terme per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations?
<pb facs="tcp:8426:194"/>
And, that there is alwaies
nothing, but quiete peace, within hys
heart? Therfore, a temperate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
man, wythout any feare, wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any gryefe, wythout anye excessiue
mirth or desyre, is not he (I saye) hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye?
But a wyse man is alwayes so.</p>
               <p>He is therfore alwayes happye. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
howe can a good man do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

a blessed life therefore, is attayned by
vertue. The same also, is concluded
after this sort. There is nothing praise
worthye, eyther in a miserable life, or
els, in suche, as is neyther miserable,
nor blessed. But there is some kinde of
life, in the whych there is some thinge
prayse worthy, and to be desyred. As
Epaminundas sayeth.
<q>Our wittye counsels haue debased,
the Lacedemonians prayse.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And Africanus sayeth.
<q>

                     <l>From farthest East, where sonne doth

                     <l>He liueth not whose feates my deedes
or famous factes may passe.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Whiche if it be so, then a happye lyfe
ought to be desyred. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
els, that ought to be praysed, or
desyred, Which being once concluded,
you knowe what foloweth. And truly,
vnlesse that lyfe be happy, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
honeste, there shoulde be somewhat
better then a blessed life. For if hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stye,
and it, myght be separated: euerye
man would graunt, that honesty were
better. And so there shoulde be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
better then a blessed life. Then
the whyche, what could be sayde more
fondly? Also, when they confesse, that
vice is sufficiente, to make vs leade a
miserable life: do they not then graunt
that vertue is of the lyke power, to
make a happye life? For of contraries,
the conclusions also are contrarye.</p>
               <p>And in this place, I woulde fayne
knowe, what Critolaus ment, by his
balance. Who, when into the one
scale, he had put the goods of the mind
<pb facs="tcp:8426:195"/>
and into the other, the goods of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
and of fortune, makes, that scale
of goods of the minde, so farre to wey
downe the other, as the heauen doth
the earth and seas. What lets hym
then, or Xenocrates, that moste graue
philosopher (who doth so much amply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the power of vertue, and debase and
depsise al the rest) that he can not finde
in his hearte, to place the happyest lyfe
of all others, in onely vertue? Whych
truly, vnlesse it be so, there must nedes
ensue, the decaye of all vertues. For, to
whom sorowe maye come, to hym also
maye feare. For fearinge is a carefull
wayting for sorowe, that is comming.
And whosoeuer is subiecte to feare, he
must needes be combred also with all
the mates of the same: fearefulnes,
dreade, and quakynge. And for that
cause, he must not thinke him selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible,
neyther that, that sayenge of
Atreus was spoken to him.</p>
               <l>Let no man in this wretched lyfe,
him selfe so ill behaue,</l>
               <l>That vnto fortunes cruell stroke
he shewe him selfe a slaue.</l>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8426:195"/>
But suche a man, will strayght ways
be ouercome: and not onely be vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
but become euen a slaue. And we
will haue vertue alwayes free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible.
For otherwyse it is no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
But if there be sufficient helpe, in
vertue it selfe to liue well: there shalbe
sufficient also, to liue blessedlye. For
truly, vertue, is able enough, of it selfe
to make vs liue stoutelye. If it be able
enough, of it selfe, thereto, it is able al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
to make vs to be of a stout courage.
So that, we shal neither be feared, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet ouercome, of any other thing.
And thereof, it must nedes folow, that
nothing maye make vs to repent: that
we may lacke nothynge: nor nothinge
can withstand vs. So we shal haue all
thinges abundantlye, fullye, and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouslye.
And for that cause, blessedly
also. Furthermore, vertue, is able e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughe,
to make vs liue stoutelye, and
for that cause happely also. For, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
althoughe it hathe obtayned that,
whiche it did desyre, yet neuerthelesse,
neuer thinkes it selfe satisfied: so wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
contraryewyse, is alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb facs="tcp:8426:196"/>
wyth that whyche it hath, and
neuer repenteth her owne estate.</p>
               <p>Thinke you, that it was not al one, to
Caius Lelius, to be once chosen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull,
and another time to take a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse?
Althoughe, when a wyse, and a
good man (as he was) lacketh voyces:
the people, ought rather to be deemed,
to haue the repulse from a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull,
then that he hath anye repulse, of
the vayne multitude. But whether
would you (if you might choose) be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull
once, as Lelius was, or foure ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
as Cinna? I do litle doubte what
you will aunswere. For I knowe to
whom I speake. I would not so boldly
aske the same, of some other. For, I
knowe, that some there be, that would
aunswere me, that thei would preferre
not onely the foure Consulshippes, of
Cinna, but euen one day of his raigne
afore the liues of many notable men.
But Cinna, commaunded the heades
of his felowe consul Caius Octauius,
of Publius Crassus, and Lucius Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,
thre most notable me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (whose wits
had bene well proued, as well in time
<pb facs="tcp:8426:196"/>
of warre, as peace) of Marcus Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
also, the moost eloquente Oratour,
that euer I heard: and of Caius Cesar
(in whom, in my opinion, was the per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fection
of all gentlenes, pleasauntnes,
and mirth) to be stryken of. Is he then
happye, which put these men to death?
Truly, in my opinion, he is not onely
wretched, for that he caused that to be
done: but also, because he behaued him
selfe so, that he myght do it. Although,
no man maye lawefully sinne. But I
erre, vsing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wonted maner of speach.
For, we saye commonlye, that a man
may do that, whyche he hath power to
do. Yet whether was Caius Marius
more happye, then, when he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
the glory of his victory, which
he obtayned agaynst the Cymbrians,
wyth his felowe in office Catulus, in
wysedome an other Lelius: (for in my
opinion, they maye well be compared)
or els, when he, being conqueroure in
the ciuile battayle, angrye with the
frendes of the same Catulus, whyche
entreated for him, would geue theym
no other word, but let him dye: let him
<pb facs="tcp:8426:197"/>
dye. Nowe truly, more happy was he,
that obeyed that blouddy commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then he, that commaunded it.</p>
               <p>For, bothe it is farre better, to suffer,
then to do iniury: and also, willynglye
to meete death, when it approcheth (as
Catulus did) it was farre better done,
then as Marius did: by the death of so
worthy a man, to stayne the glorye of
his sixe firste consulshippes: and with
bloudshed, to defile the last time of his
age. Eyght and thirtye yeares, Dioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius
was tyrant of Siracusa, comynge
to the kingdome, at .xxv. yeares of age.
That beautifull citie, of so notable
wealth, howe did he kepe in bondage?
And of this man, we reade thus much
written in historyes. That he vsed a
merueylous temperate dyet, and that
in all his deedes, he proued him selfe a
maruaylous wittye, &amp; a paineful man.
And yet neuerthelesse, he was of a
mischieuous cruell nature. Wherefore
to all such, as do well weygh his case,
he must nedes seeme to be wretched.</p>
               <p>For, that, which he so much desired, he
could not then attaine, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thought
<pb facs="tcp:8426:197"/>
he might haue done, what he lysted.</p>
               <p>Who, hauinge good and honeste pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes,
and beinge come of an honest
stocke, (howebeit thereof diuers men
diuersly do write) hauing also great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quayntaunce,
and familiaritie wyth
princes, and also certayne yong boyes,
according to the maner of Greece, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
for his loue &amp; playe: yet, durst,
to trust none of them all. But commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the custody of his bodye, to certaine
slaues, whom he him selfe had made
free: to hyred seruauntes, and to cruell
Barbarians. So, onely, for the desyre
he had, to beare rule: he had in maner,
shut vp him selfe, into a pryson. Also,
because he would not trust any barber
to shaue him, he caused his owne
doughters to learne to shaue. So the
maydens of honoure, when they had
learned, that filthy and slauishe science
as barbers, shaued the beard, &amp; heares
of theyr father. And yet neuerthelesse,
theym also, when they came to yeares
of discrescretion, he would not truste,
wyth a raser: but, commaunded that
with the shales of walnuttes heated,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:198"/>
they should burne of his beard, and his
heares. And although he had two wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
Aristomache borne in the same
citye, and Doris, borne in the citye of
Locris: yet, he would neuer come to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them, in the night, afore that, all
places were searched, for feare of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
And then, would he haue an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
trench aboue his bed, whych had
but one way, to passe ouer, which was
by a draw bridge. Which he him selfe
when the chamber dore was locked,
would draw to him. And furthermore
daringe not, to come to any place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorte,
he would talke to his subiectes,
downe from a hye tower. On a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
time, when he woulde playe at
tenesse (for that game he vsed verye
much) it is sayde, that he deliuered to a
yonge man whom he loued very well
his sworde to kepe. which when one of
his familiar frendes, espyenge, sayd in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>este: to him nowe you truste your life:
and, the yong man smyled at it: he com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded
them both to be slayne. The
one, because he had shewed the waye
howe he might be slaine: the other, for
<pb facs="tcp:8426:198"/>
that he seemed in smilinge, to allowe
the same. But, that deede afterwardes
so much repented him, that nothing in
all his life, greued him more. For, he
had caused him to be put to death, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he loued entierly. But this tirant, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
him selfe, to haue shewed, howe
happye he was in deede. For, when on
a time, Damocles, one of his flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
did recken vp his power, myght,
maiestie, and rule: his greate aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce
of all thinges, and his magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
in building, sayenge, that there
was no man at any time, more happye
then he: wylt thou then, O Damocles,
(quod he) because this life doth so much
delight the, thy selfe taste thereof? and,
try the pleasure, of my happy chaunce?
Whereunto, when he aunswered that
he would very gladly: Dionisius, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
him, to be layde in a bedde of
gold, hauing a couerlet of cloth of gold
and hanginges of beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gold: wrought
with verye fayre workes. Also he set
coupbordes, and chestes afore him, full

<pb facs="tcp:8426:199"/>
boyes of notable beautye, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
on his person, and to be readye at
his becke. There were brought in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

the perfumes burnt in euery place, and
the tables were spredde, wyth the most

                  </gap>ayntye dishes that mighte be gotten.
Then, seemed Damocles to be happy.
But, in the middes of all this iolitye
Dionisius commaunded a glisterynge
sword, to be hanged ouer his head, by a
horse heare. So that it mighte well
nye touche his necke. Wherewyth,
Damocles being feared, could neyther
fynde in his hearte, to looke vpon hys
fayre boyes, neyther yet vpon the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
gold, neyther would he reache his
hand to the table, to taste of any thyng
that was thereon. The crownes fell
downe from his head. To be shorte, he
desyred the tyrant to lycence him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.
Sayeng, that he would no longer
be happye. Dyd not he (thynke you) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
sufficientlye, that he can haue no
happynesse, ouer whom there hangeth
any feare? Yet neuerthelesse, he trulye
was not able to retourne to iustice.</p>

from his youth vpwarde bred in tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye.
So that, though he would haue re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pented,
yet he could not haue lyued in
safety. Yet how much he desyred frend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shippe
(the vnfaithfulnes of the which,

of the whyche, when he was taken for

at a certayne daye to suffer death: and,
the other came in deede, at the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted:

What a miserye was it, for him to

were written vpon his tombe. Which
did declare, that vpon his graue, there
was a spheare, and a Cilindre. But I,
after I had diligently vewed on euery
syde, (for there is at the gates called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gragians,
a great company of graues)
I espied at last, a litle piller, somewhat
higher then the bushes, in the whyche
there was the forme of a Spheare, and
of a Cilindre. Then, I tolde the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull
of the citie, whyche were there
with me, that I thoughte, that same
was it, which I l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oked for. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
certayne labourers, set in wyth
scyues, and cutting hookes, opened the
place. Into the which, when we came,
at the farther part of the bottome, ther
appeared an Epigramme, wyth the
later part of certayn verses, some who
lye worne away, &amp; some, halfe remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and halfe worne. So, one of the
noblest cities in all Greece, yea, and in
time paste one of the best learned, had
<pb facs="tcp:8426:201"/>
not knowen the tombe of this theyr
most famous citesin, vnlesse, they had
learned it, of a man borne at Arpinas.
But I will retourne thither, from
whence I firste came. What man is
there, who hath anye familiaritie, not
wyth the muses onely, but eyther with
any part of honestie, or learninge, that
woulde not wishe him selfe, rather to
be this Mathematician, then that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran?
If we desyre to knowe the maner
and trade of bothe their liues. The
minde of the one, liued in the searching
and conferring of reasons wyth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyght
of knoweledge: which is the swe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>test
foode, that our soules may haue.</p>
               <p>But, the minde of the other, was nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
wyth slaughter, and iniury, and
beset wyth continuall feare. But now
brynge in Democritus, Pithagoras,
and Anaragoras. What kyngedome,
or what riches, would you preferre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
theyr studies and delyghtes? For
trulye, that, whyche we nowe seeke:
namely, the most happy and blessed life
of all others: muste needes be in that
part, whyche is best in all the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8426:201"/>
But what is there in anye man, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then a wyse and a good minde?</p>
               <p>That therfore, whiche is the chyefe
good of the minde, we muste studye to
attayne, if we will be happye. But the
chiefe good of the minde, is vertue.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, it must needes folowe, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in
it is contayned a happy life. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
issue all those thinges, which we cal
beautifull, honest, and fayre. But we
must speake this same more at large.</p>
               <p>For all these thinges are full of ioye.</p>
               <p>But of continuall and perfect ioye, it
is euident, that a happye life doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede.
Wherfore it must needes consist
of honestye. But, let vs not onelye in
wordes, moue the same, which we wil
proue: but also, propose some certayne
ymage of the same, whyche may nowe
moue vs the more, to the knoweledge,
and vnderstandinge of these thynges,
For let vs propose some notable man,
endued with most excellent qualities,
and imagine and conceyue him, onelye
in our minde. Firste, he must needes
haue a notable witte. For dul heades,
do not so easely attayn vertue, as those
<pb facs="tcp:8426:202"/>
whyche are quicke witted. Then, he
must needes haue a very earnest zeale,
and desire, to searche out the truth.</p>
               <p>Whereof, rise those three properties,
of the mind. The one, consisting in the
knoweledge of thinges, and descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of nature: the other, in the descry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of those thinges, that ought to be
desyred or auoyded: and the thirde, in
iudging, what doth necessarily folowe
of anye thinge, or what is contrarye to
the same. In the whyche, is contayned
both all the sutteltye of reasoning, and
also the truthe of iudgementes. What

<pb facs="tcp:8426:202"/>
the syghte of those, moued and learned
those auncient philosophers, to searche
further. Thereof came the firste sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge
oute of principles, as it were of
seedes, and the enquiring, whereof all
thinges, had theyr beginninge and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge.
As well thinges liuing, as wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
lyfe. As wel dumme, as speaking.
Also, howe they lyued, and by what na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tural
cause they came to death and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
Also, howe one thing is chaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged
and tourned to another. Howe the
earth had fyrst his beginning. Howe it
was so paysed, in the middest of the
world. Also, into what vautes, it doth
receyue, the flowing and ebbing of the
seas. And howe that all heauy thinges
naturally fall into it, as into the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell
place of the world. Which is, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the lowest, in anye rounde bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye.
About these thinges, whiles the
minde is busyed nyghte and daye, he
must needes also some times remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that precepte, whyche the God of
Delphos gaue. Namely, that it knowe
it selfe free from all vyce, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande,
that it is parte of the nature of
<pb facs="tcp:8426:203"/>
god. Whereby, it is filled with insati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ioy. For, the very thinking, of the
power, &amp; nature of the gods, enflames
our heartes, to folowe that eternitye,
and not to despayre for the shortnes of
lyfe. Inasmuch as, we see the causes of
all thinges, to be necessarilye knyt one
to an other. Which euen from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
cotinuing til the end, yet the
mind, &amp; reason, of men may well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
and rule. These thinges, he
beholding, and maruaylinge at, wyth
what quietnes of minde must he nedes
consider, both all earthly thinges, and
also all other aboue the same? Hereof
riseth the knoweledge of vertue. And
hereof springe out all the sondry sortes
and braunches of the same. Hereby we
fynde out, what is the best of al goods,
and what is the vttermost, and extree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
of all euels. Also, to what end we
ought to referre all our dutyes, in this
life. An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> what trade we ought to chose

other like thinges, beinge once founde
out, then is that brought to passe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
in this reasoning we seke to proue.
<pb facs="tcp:8426:203"/>
Namely, that vertue is of it selfe onely
sufficient, to make a man leade a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
life. There foloweth nowe the
third kynd, whych spreadeth and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued,
through out al the parts of wise<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome.
Which defyneth euery thynge:

I meane, the trade and oder of reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge.
Of the which, there ryseth, both
great profite, in the weyging of ouerye
question, and also very great delyghte,
and euen worthy of a wyse man. But
all these thinges, pertayne to tyme of
leasure: let the same wise man, come
to the gouerninge of a common welth.
Who can do it better then he? inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as, he shall see, that in his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

(who is a philosopher onelye, to

I woulde not gladlye take
from him) that there is no tyme, in the
whych a wyse man, although he were
<pb facs="tcp:8426:204"/>
burned, racked, or cut in pieces, would
not say, howe litle do I esteme al this?
Whereas he him selfe thinketh, that
all euel consisteth in paine: and al good
in pleasure. And iesteth at those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
whiche we call honest and dysho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest.
Sayenge, that we are occupyed
onely in vaine wordes, and care for no
thinge, but onely the gentle or sharpe
sufferinge of the bodie. He therefore,
whose iudgement doth not muche dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
from the iudgemente of brute bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes:
may lawefully forget him selfe.</p>
               <p>And so, despyse fortune. Whereas all,
his good and euell, doth consiste, onely
in the power of fortune. He may think
him selfe happy in payne and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
whereas he not onelye thinketh,
that pain is the greatest euel that may
be, but also, that it onely is euell. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet hath he gotten these remedies
agaynst the suffering of griefe. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the stoutenes of stomacke, shame of
dishonesty, exercise, and custome of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferynge
the preceptes of fortitude, and
manly stoutenes. But he, sayeth, he is
contented onely with the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce
<pb facs="tcp:8426:205"/>
of his former pleasures. As if, a man
well nye parched wyth heate, so that,
he is no longer able to abide the sonne
should comfort him selfe, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce,
that once heretofore, he
had bathed him selfe in the colde ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of Arpynas. For truly, I see not,
howe the pleasures that are past, may
ease the gryeues that are present. But
inasmuche as he (I saye) sayeth, that a
wyse man is alwayes happye, who, if
he woulde be agreeable to him selfe,
might worst of al other speake it: what
shall they do whyche thinke, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
ought to be desyred, or counted
good whyche wanteth honesty? Truly
in my opinion, let the Peripatetikes,
yea, &amp; the auncient Academikes, ceasse
any longer to doubte: and playnely say
that happye life, maye come euen into
the bull of Phalaris. For let there be
foure sortes of goodes that we maye
nowe departe from the brakes of the
Stoykes, whiche I vnderstande nowe
that I haue vsed more then I would.</p>
               <p>Let there be therfore (I say) thre sortes
of goodes, so that the goodes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:205"/>
and of fortune, maye lye on the
ground: and be counted goodes, onely,
because they are not to be refused. But
the other, which are in maner heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
may in comparison of them, reache
vnto the heauens. So that we neede
not doubt, to call him, which hath once
attayned them, not onelye happy, but
euen the happyest that may be. Nowe,
shall a wyse man feare gryefe?</p>
               <p>Whereas he is most contrarye to this
opinion. For agaynst the feare of oure
owne deathe, and the sorowe that we
might take for the death of our frendes
we seeme to be sufficientlye armed and
prepared by the former dayes disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But, payne seemeth, to be the
sharpest aduersarye of vertue. It sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his brandes at vs, it threateneth,
that she will weaken fortitude, stoute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of minde, and patience. To it, shal
vertue geue place? Or the happye lyfe
of a wyse and constant man yelde? O
god, what a shame were that? The
boyes of Sparta, do not so muche as

companies of yonge men, in Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
striuinge one agaynste an other,
wyth theyr fystes, heeles, nayles, and

Yet neuerthelesse, emonges theim
those whyche are counted wyse men,
are fyrst bred vp, bare and naked. And
yet suffer both the colde of the hil Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casus,
and also, the sharpenes of the
winter, without any paine. And when
they come to the fyer, they are able to
abide the heate, well nie, till they rost.
But the women there, when anye of
theyr husbandes dieth, are wont to fal

               <p>Trulye, custome would neuer ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

ydlenes, and slouth, do first infect
our mindes. And afterwardes effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
it, with peruerse opinions, and
euell custome, we cause it euen wholye
to degenerate. Who is ignoraunt, of
the errour of the Egiptians? who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
with a foolishe opinion, would
rather abide anye tormente, then they
woulde hurte the beast called Ibis, or
the serpent called Aspis, or a Cat, or a
Dogge, or a Crocodyle. But, if they
chaunce, to hurt any of them vnwares
they wil refuse no punisheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te for the
same. Hitherto I haue spoken of men.
But what shall I saye of beastes? Do
not they suffer cold and hunger? runne
both vp hill and downe hill, when they
be coursed? Do not they fyghte so for
theyr whelpes, that they are oft woun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded,
fearing no blowes nor strokes? I
ouerpasse here, what paynes ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
men take, to obtayne honour. And
vaine glorious men, to get that, which
they thinke to be glory. Or such as are
enflamed wyth loue, to accomplyshe
theyr desyre. Our life is full of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
But I will measure my talke,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:207"/>
and retourne thither from whence I
first strayed. Happye life (I saye) will
offer it selfe into tormentes. And wyll
not, inasmuch as it hath alwaies afore
folowed iustice, temperance, fortitude,
stoutenes of stomake, and patience: as
soone as it shall see the face of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentoure,
then turne backe and slip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye.
And inasmuch as al the vertues
wythout any feare, shall hasarde them
selues, in the payne of tormente: she
onely, shall not stand wythout the dore
and entry of the prison. For what may
be more filthy or ill fauoured, then hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pye
lyfe, when it is destitute, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the fayre traine of vertues?
Which neuerthelesse, can by no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
be. For, neyther can a man haue
all the vertues, without a happye lyfe:
neyther yet may there be a happy lyfe,
wythout vertue. And for that cause
they will not suffer it to tary behinde.
But wil alwayes, take her with them
to what so euer griefe, or torment they
shall go. For, it is the poynct of a wyse
man, to do nothiuge that may repente
him, nor anye thinge agaynst his will.
<pb facs="tcp:8426:207"/>
But, to do al things comely, constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
grauelye, and honestlye. To looke
for nothinge, as thoughe it were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne.
And also to thynke nothynge
straunge, or vnaccustomed, when it is
happened. To referre all thinges to
his owne discrecion, and stande to hys
owne iudgement. Then the which tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly.
I can see nothing that may be moe
happye. The Stoykes, conclude this
question lyghtlye. Sayenge, that inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as, the chiefe ende of all good, is
to agree vnto nature: and to lyue accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyng
vnto her preceptes: and, it, is in
the power of a wyse man. It must nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
folowe, that in whose power it is,
to attayne the chiefest good, in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
also it lyeth, to leade a quyete life.
So, euery wise man, doth leade a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

I thynke to be moost stoutelye spoken,
of a blessed and happy life. And (as the

agaynst all opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. That it may, by it

               <p>(whych also Carneades was wonte to

his minde was in maner enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
But we wil do the same quietly.
For, if the Stoikes, haue well appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted

the matter dispatched. For then must
a wyse man nedes be happye. But let
vs examine, the opinions of all the rest
that, this, so notable a decree, of a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

which yet continue, and are openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the endes of good
and euell (as farre as I knowe) are
these. Firste, foure generall, or simple
opinions. Namely, that nothinge is
good, but that whych is honest. As the
Stoykes say. Or that nothing is good
but pleasure. As Epicurus affyrmeth.
Or that nothinge is good, excepte the
lacke of payne. As Hierome thinketh.
Or that nothing is good, but to enioye
and encrease those most excellente and
principall goodes, whych are geuen vs
of nature. These are the generall, or
<pb facs="tcp:8426:209"/>
simple opinions. But the mixt or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
are these. Fyrst the three sortes
of goodes. The chiefest of the minde,
the next of the body: and the last of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
As the Peripatetikes saye. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient Academikes, much
dyffer from them. But Clitomachus,
and Calipho, ioyned pleasure with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestye:
and Diodorus the Peripatetike
ioyned the want of gryefe, with hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stye.
These are all the opinions, which
haue any certayntie in them. For, the
opinions of Aristo, Pirrho, Herillus,
and manye others: are euen worne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
What would folowe of all these
opinions, ouerpassinge the Stoykes,
(whose authoritye, we haue alreadye
sufficiently defended) and the Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetikes
(whose cause is alreadye deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
exceptinge Theophrastus, who
wyth his folowers, feared griefe more
then he neded) let vs nowe se. For tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye,
as for all thother, they maye do (as
they commonly are wont) namelye, to
amplifye the grauitye, and dignitye of
vertue, which, when they haue extolde
euen to the skyes, (as eloquente men
<pb facs="tcp:8426:209"/>
should) in all the rest of theyr talke they
treade it vnder feete, and despyse it.</p>
               <p>But they, which think, that we ought
euen with gryefe, to labour for praise:
must not they nedes confesse, that they
are happye which haue attayned it?</p>
               <p>For although they be in some euel, yet
this name of a blessed, and happye lyfe
extendeth farre. For, like as tillage, is
counted a gaynefull, &amp; profytable trade
although some yeare, tempest or some
other chaunce doth let the successe: yet
it is counted profitable, because it is so
most commonlye. Euen so our lyfe not
onely if it be replenished with al goods
but also, if it haue more goodes, then
euels, is to be counted happy. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by theyr owne reason, happy life,
must needes accompanye vertue, euen
to punishement. And shall go with her
into tormentes. Yea, Aristotle, Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,
Speusippus, &amp; Polemon, wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing
the same. And shall neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
it, at the entyseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a fewe flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
pleasures. To the same ende,
shall come the opinions of Caliphon,
and Diodorus: both the which, so em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb facs="tcp:8426:210"/>
honesty, that they thinke, that al
such thinges as are wythout the same,
ought vtterly to be despysed, and set at
nought. The other philosophers sticke
more. And with more payne, swimme
oute of the myer. I meane Epicurus,
and Hieronimus, &amp; all the rest, whiche
a say to defend, the eloquent Carnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.
For there is none of them, whiche
thinketh that the minde oughte to be
the iudge of all goods: or that doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome
the same, to despise those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
whych onely haue the apparaunce
eyther of good or euell. For what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
thou thinke O Epicure, the same
wil both Hieronimus, and Carneades
and also all the rest saye. Yet, who of
them is there, not sufficiently prouided
agaynst death or gryefe? Let vs begin
of him (if you please) whom we call so
wanton and full of pleasure. Doth not
he (thinke you) despyse death and paine
who counteth that daye, in the whyche
he shall dye, happy and blessed? And
thinketh, that suche as are in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
panges of payne, may comfort the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
selues, with the remembraunce of plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sures
<pb facs="tcp:8426:210"/>
past? Neyther yet doth he speake
that, as if he did rashely blabbe it out.
For his reason why death oughte not
to be feared is this. Because when the
life is gone, al sense is past. And, when
we are once withoute sence or fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge:
there is no maner chaunce, that
maye greue vs. Also, he hath certayne
remedies for griefe. For, if it be greate
he comforteth him selfe with the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the time, that it shall endure.</p>
               <p>And if it be long, then he thinketh that
space of time wil make it waxe lyghter
and lyghter. I praye you, in what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

against these two most dreadful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore you may wel come quietly

the which, you thinke you should plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
me, I pray you geue theym eyther
to your owne citesins, or els to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
gods. Truly, all philosophers,
of whatsoeuer secte they were, vnlesse
they be suche, as a vicious nature hath
turned from the rule of reason, maye
well be of the same minde. Socrates,
when there was a great plenty of gold
and siluer brought vnto him, now lord
(quod he) howe litle do I passe for such
store? Xenocrates, when the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb facs="tcp:8426:211"/>
whych came to him from Alexan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der,
had brought him twenty talentes
(whiche was counted at that tyme, at
Athenes inespeciallye, a great summe
of money) he brought the ambassadors
into that place, where Plato once kept
his scoole, and there made them a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
onely of so muche, as was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
without any great cost. And when
they asked him on the morowe, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he would haue theym tell the money,
Why (quod he) did you not vnderstand
by the supper, I made you y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laste night
that I lacke no money? But when he
sawe them very sadde at that sayenge,
he toke thirty poundes, least he should
seeme to despise, the kinges liberalitie.
But Diogenes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Alexander asked
what he lacked, aunswered more like a
currishe philosopher. Sayenge, stande
out of the sonne. For he stoode betwixt
the sonne and him. And he was wonte
to dispute, how much he did surmount
the king of Persia, in a happy lyfe, and
good lucke. Sayeng, that he lacked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and the other would neuer hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
enough. And that he desyred not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb facs="tcp:8426:212"/>
wyth the which, the other could
not be satisfyed. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> those pleasures,
which he felt, the other might neuer at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne.
You remember (I thinke) howe
Epicurus deriued the sondry sortes of
desyres: although not ouer suttelly, yet
commodiously enough. Sayenge, that
they are partly naturall and necessary:
and partly, neyther naturall nor neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.
And that suche as are necessary,
may be contented, and suffised, wel nie
with nothing. For, sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for nature
may lightly be gotten. But the seconde
sort, he thinkes it neyther harde to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne,
neyther yet to lacke. And the
thrd, because they were vtterly vaine
and fonde, and were requisite, neyther
for necessity, nor nature: he said ought
vtterlye to be rooted out. Hereabout,
the folowers of Epicurus reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much,
and do debase, and despise in their talk
these pleasures, very much. Which ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerthelesse,
they do not despyse, but
seeke to haue plentye of. For, both they
saye, that filthy pleasures, of the which
they haue great talke, are easy, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
and ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:8426:212"/>
do require the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they thinke they oughte
to be measured, by beautye, age, and
hansomnes. And that it is nothinge
harde to abstayne from them, if eyther
our health, duty, or fame, do so require<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
And that this kind of pleasure, is then
best, when it hurteth not. For it neuer
profyteth. And all these preceptes of
pleasures, he gaue, to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ende, he would
shewe, that pleasure, for it selfe onely,
because it is pleasure, is to be wyshed
and desyred. And contrarywise, that
payne onely, because it is payne, ought
to be hated and auoyded. And this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
he thinketh a wise man ought
to vse. Namelye, to flye pleasure, if he
think that it wil bring a greater paine
And to suffer payne, if he thinke, it wil
cause a greater pleasure. And that all
pleasure, although it be iudged by the
senses of the bodye: yet neuerthelesse,

that for that cause, the bodye doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce,

man to be happye? Beware that you

and glory that euery man so much
desyreth, doth bring more trouble, then
pleasure. And therefore truly, Demost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes
was to lyght, who sayde, that it
delyghted him, to heare a woman, as
she wente to fetche water, (as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

was he? But it appeareth, that
he was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te to talke much afore other

conscience. We must therefore knowe
this, that neyther hye place, or glorye,
are for theym selues to be desired: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pouertie and basenes to be feared.
For, Democritus sayd. Come to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenes,

               <p>A constante man, and a graue trulye:
whych gloryeth that he was withoute

glorye. Shall trumpetters and other

Is there any thing more foolysh?
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that those, whom takyng one and

to thinke (I saye) that those altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are any better? But a wise man
truly, will despise al our ambition, and
lyghtnes. Yea, he will despise all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure,
though it be profered vnto him.
But we can not despise them, afore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce
driue vs to it. In the bookes
Hermodorus a wryter of naturall phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophye,
there is such a sayenge. He
would, that all the Ephesians should
be put to death. For that, when they
banyshed Hermodorus theyr king, out

be so, let him go to some other place,

in the common people euerye where

for that he liued in his countrey: then

Xenocrates? Or Polemon, then Arce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silas?
Or howe is that citie to be este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

               <p>But nowe the motions, the cares, and
gryefes of the minde, are swaged with
forgetting the same, and drawynge of
the mind to pleasure. It was not with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
some cause therfore, that Epicurus
durst to saye. That a wyse man, hathe
alwayes manye goodes, because he is
alwayes in pleasure. Whereof he thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth
that it must necessarilye folowe,
that a wyse man is alwayes happye.</p>

               <p>Yea, For he despyseth
euen these lackes also. And fyrste of all
this horrible blindenes, what pleasure
wants it? Inasmuch as some say, that
all the other pleasures, are wythin the
senses them selues. But those thinges
whych we see, are not anye pleasure to
our eyes. As all those thinges, whiche
we taste, smell, feele, or heare, are in
that selfe same parte where we feele
them. But in the eyes there is no such
thinge. Our minde taketh those thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which we see. But the minde may
be delighted, many and diuers wayes,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:218"/>
although our bodye can not see. For
now I speake of a learned man, whose
life is study. His thoughtes and wytte
require not eyes to see that, whyche
wyth his minde he can not see. Truly,
if night can not let a man, but that he
may be happy: why should a day like to
nighte do it? For the aunswere of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,
the Cyrenaike, is not so honest,
although it be not much from this pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose.
Whose blindenes when certaine
women did lamente: what meane you
quod he? Is there no pleasure in the
night thinke ye? We perceyue, both by
his offices, and also by his deedes, that
that olde Appius whyche was blynde
many yeres, yet in that his mischau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
supplied his dutye, bothe at home, and
also abrode in the common welth. Also
we haue heard that the house of Caius
Drusus, was wonte to be full of Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

So that wheras they that could
see, could not see theyr owne case, they
were fayne to take a blinde man, to
theyr guyde and counsaylour. Whiles
I was a boye, Cneius Aufidius, who
had bene once Pretor, beynge blynde,
<pb facs="tcp:8426:219"/>
dyd both giue counsaile to his frendes
and wryte an historye in Greeke, and
also had good skill in all learnynge.</p>
               <p>Diodorus the Stoyke, being blinde, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
manye yeares at my house. He
(which is scarse credible) besydes that,
he did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually take more paynes in
the study of philosophy, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did afore
and also played on instrumentes, after
the maner of the Pithagoreans: &amp; had
bookes red vnto him, day and night, in
the whych studyes neuertheles he dyd
not much neede his eyes: yet besides al
this I saye (which may scarse be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out
eyes) he vsed the practise of Geometry.
Teaching his scolers howe farre, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
what sort, they should drawe euery
line. They saye, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Asclepiades, no base
nor meane philosopher, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one asked
of him, what disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditi blindnes had
brought him he answered, that he had
more nede of one boy, to waite on him.
For, like as extreme pouerty were tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,
if a man might do as certayne
Grecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may, so likewise may blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
easely be borne, if we lacke not hel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pes,
for our necessity. Democritus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
loste his eyes, could not discerne

white &amp; black. But thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges good &amp; euell
iust &amp; vniust, honest &amp; dishonest, profita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
&amp; vnprofitable, he could discerne.</p>
               <p>So, although w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out the sight of sundry
coloures he could liue happelye, yet w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the knowledge of thinges he could
not. And he also thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
&amp; quicknes of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mind was hindred by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
sight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eyes. And wheras other men
scarseli can se y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>, which lieth afore their

nature of eueri thing, so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g could
be hidden fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. It is sayd also, that
Homere was blinde. But y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they maye

For what region, what coaste, what

that, those thinges which he him selfe

Homere, fayni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Poliphemus to haue

               <p>For he was no wiser then the ramme,

was one thing worse than that, belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

my opinion, was wythout cause. Our
Epicures can not vnderstande, nor

Epicures latine. They therefore were

likewise, these men in theyrs. And all

so greatly delyghted wyth songes and

that afore anye suche thinges were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented,
there were manye wyse men,
that ledde a happye lyfe. And also, that
there may be farre greater pleasure ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,

commende vnto blynde men, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the eares: so we maye vnto
deafe men, commende the pleasures of
the eyes. And furthermore, who soeuer
can commen secretelye with his owne
conscience, he shall not neede the talke
of another. Nowe let all these mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
be put together. So that some ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
lacke both his syght and hearinge: and

are able at the first to kil a man
or els if they tary any thinge longe, do

that he should haue occasion to abide
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet what neede we to trouble oure
selues? Inasmuch as, there is alwayes
a hauen &amp; baye readye for vs. Death I
meane, the euerlastinge home of oure
body, when it is once past sence. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lisimacus threatned him,
that he would put him to death, sayde.
Surely youre power is great, if you be
able to do asmuche, as a Cantarides.
Paulus whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Perses desired him, that
he might not be led in his triumph: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.
That is in your choyce. Of
death we spake much the first day whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we disputed purposely of it &amp; sumwhat
also, the next day, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we entreated of
gryefe, we sayd thereof: which who so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
doth remember, there is no doubt
but he wil either wishe for death, or at
the least wise not feare it. I thinke that
herein, we ought to kepe that custome
which the Grecians vse in their feastes
for they haue such a terme. Eyther let
him drink or els depart. And but right
For, eyther let him wyth other kepe
feloweship in drinkinge: or els, least he
<pb facs="tcp:8426:221"/>
being sober, should be in the companye
of dronkardes, he must departe before.
So likewise, the iniuries of fortune,
which we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not abide, we ought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde
by flight. The same that Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
sayeth, Hieronimus also affirmeth
almost with the selfe same wordes.</p>
               <p>Therfore if these philosophers, which
think, vertue of it selfe to be of no force
&amp; that al that, which we cal honest and
laudable, is but a vaine thing, only co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured

of fortune. And some other count these
to be no goods at al, but place al things
in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> minde only. Whose controuersie,
Carneades was wonte to finishe like

there was no cause of controuersie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

to ryches, good health, and other suche
like, then the Stoikes, when it comes
to the pdndering of the thinge it selfe,
and not of the word. And, as for the
philosophers of other sectes, howe they
can haue any place in this opinion, let
them selues see. Yet I am glad, that
they professe some thinge worthye the

of a wise man to liue well. But, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
