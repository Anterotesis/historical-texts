            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough it cannot bee vnknowen to our Subiects by the former</hi> Declarations Wee haue published, what our purposes and proceedings haue bene in matters of Religion since our comming to this Crowne: Yet the same being now by Us reduced to a setled Forme, Wee haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to repeat somewhat of that which hath passed; And how at our very first entry into the Realme being intertained and importuned with Informations of sundry Ministers, complaining of the errors and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertections of the Church here, aswell in matter of Doctrine as of Discipline; Although We had no reason to presume that things were so farre amisse, as was pretended, because We had seene the Kingdome vnder that forme of Religion which by Law was established in the dayes of the late Queene of famous memory, blessed with a peace and prosperitie, both extraordinary and of many yeres continuance (a strong euidence that God was therewith wel pleased,) Yet because the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of the Complainers was great, their affirmations vehement, and the zeale wherewith the same did seeme to be accompanied, very specious; We were mooued thereby to make it our occasion to discharge that duety which is the chiefest of all Kingly dueties, That is, to settle the affaires of Religion, and the Seruice of God before their owne. Which while we were in hand to doe, as the Contagion of the sickenes raigning in our City of London and other places would permit an assembly of persons meet for that purpose; Some of those who misliked the state of Religion here established, presuming more of our intents then euer Wee gaue them cause to doe, and transported with Humor, began such proceedings as did rather raise a scandal in the Church, then take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence away. For both they vsed Formes of publique seruing of God not here allowed, held assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies without Authoritie, and did other things carying a very apparant shew of Sedition, more then of Zeale: whom We restrained by a former Proclamation in the Moneth of <hi>October</hi> last, and gaue intimation of the Conference Wee intended to be had with as much speed as conueniently could be, for the ordering of those things of the Church, which accordingly followed in the moneth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> last at our Honour of <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, where before our Selfe, and our Priuie Counsell were assembled many of the grauest Bishops and Prelats of the Realme, and many other learned men, as well of those that are conformable to the State of the Church established, as of those that dissented: Among whom, what Our paines were, what Our patience in hearing and replying, and what the indifferencie and vprightnesse of our Iudgement in determining, Wee leaue to the report of those who heard the same, contenting our Selfe with the sinceritie of Our owne heart therein. But wee cannot conceale, that the successe of that Conference was such as happeneth to many other things, which moouing great expectation before they be entred into, in their issue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce small effects. For wee found mightie and vehement Informations supported with so weake
<pb facs="tcp:19065:2"/>
and slender proofes, as it appeared vnto Us and our Councell, that there was no cause why any Change should haue bin at all in that which was most impugned, the Booke of Common Prayer, conteining the forme of the publike Seruice of God here established, neither in the doctrine which appeared to be sincere, nor in the Formes and Rites which were iustified out of the practise of the Primitiue Church. Notwithstanding We thought meete, with consent of the Bishops and other learned men there present, That some small things might rather bee explaned then changed; not that the same might not very well haue bene borne with by men who would haue made a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble construction of them: but for that in a matter concerning the seruice of God We were nice, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ielous, that the publike forme thereof should be free not onely from blame, but from suspition, so as neither the common Aduersary should haue aduantage to wrest ought therein conteined, to other sence then the Church of England intendeth, nor any troublesome or ignorant person of this Church be able to take the least occasion of cauil against it: And for that purpose gaue forth our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission vnder our great Seale of England to the Archbishop of Canterbury &amp; others, according to the forme which the Lawes of this Realme in like case prescribe to be vsed, to make the said Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, &amp; to cause the whole booke of Common Prayer, with the same Explanations, to bee newly printed. Which being now done, and established anew after so serious a deliberation; Although We doubt not, but all our Subiects, both Ministers and others will receiue the same with such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence as apperteineth, and conforme themselues thereunto euery man in that which him concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: Yet haue We thought it necessary, to make knowen by Proclamation Our authorising of the same, And to require and enioyne all men, aswell Ecclesiasticall as Temporall, to conforme themselues vnto it, and to the practise thereof, as the onely Publike Fourme of seruing of God, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished and allowed to be in this Realme. And the rather, for that all the learned men, who were there present, aswell of the Bishops as others, promised their conformitie in the practise of it, onely making sute to Us, that some few might be borne with for a time.</p>
            <p>Wherefore wee require all Archbishops, Bishops, and all other publique Ministers aswell Ecclesiasticall as Ciuill, to doe their dueties in causing the same to be obeyed, and in punishing the offendours according to the Lawes of the Realme heretofore established, for the Authorizing of the said Booke of Common Prayer. And we thinke it also necessarie, that the said Archbishops, and Bishops, doe each of them in his Prouince and Diocesse take order, That euery Parish doe procure to themselues within such time as they shall thinke good to limit, one of the said Bookes so explaned. And last of all Wee doe admonish all men, that hereafter they shall not expect nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any further Alteration in the Common and Publique forme of Gods Seruice, from this which is now established, for that neither will Wee giue way to any to presume, that Our owne Iudgement hauing determined in a matter of this weight, shall bee swayed to Alteration by the friuolous suggestions of any light spirit: neither are We ignorant of the inconueniences that doe arise in Gouernment, by admitting innouation in things once setled by mature deliberation: And how necessarie it is to vse constancie in the vpholding of the publique determinations of States, for that such is the vnquietnesse and vnstedfastnesse of some dispositions, affecting euery yeere new formes of things, as, if they should be followed in their vnconstancie, would make all Actions of States ridiculous and contemptible: whereas the stedfast maintaining of things by good aduise established, is the weale of all Common wealths.</p>
