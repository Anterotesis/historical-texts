            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>UPon mature deliberation, it is found fit, and reſolved, that notice be given to all their Miniſters abroad, of all the Reaſons which induce their H. and M. to aſſiſt the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> going over to <hi>England</hi> in Perſon, with Ships and Forces', with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the ſaid Miniſters, to make uſe thereof in the ſeveral Courts where they reſide, as they ſhall think moſt convenient; and that it be alſo writ to the ſaid Miniſters, that it is known to all the World, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, hath of a good while, very much murmur'd and complained, that the King (no doubt, with the Evil Council, and inducement of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) had gained upon their Fundamental Laws, and laboured through the violation thereof; and by the bringing in the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, to oppreſs their Liberty, and to ruine the Proteſtant Religion, and to bring all under an Arbitrary Government: That as this inverted and unjuſt Conduct was carried on more and more, and that the apprehenſions thereupon were ſtill greater, and that thereby ſuch diffidence, and averſion, was ſtirred up againſt the King, that nothing was to be expected in that Kingdom but general diſorder and confuſion. His Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> upon the manifold repreſentations, and the reiterated and earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt deſire, which was made to His Highneſs by ſeveral Lords, and other Perſons of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in that Kingdom; as alſo upon the account, that Her Royal Highneſs, and His Highneſs Himſelf, are ſo highly concerned in the Welfare of that Kingdom, could not well endure, that through ſtrife and diſunion, they ſhould run the danger, however it went, of being excluded from the Crown, held himſelf obliged to watch over the Welfare of that Kingdom, and to take care thereof; and alſo had the thoughts of aſſiſting the Nation, and giving them a helping hand, upon ſo many Juſt and Good Grounds, againſt the Government that Oppreſſed them in all manner of ways that lay in his Highneſs Power, for that His Highneſs was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the Welfare of this State (the Care whereof is alſo entruſted to him) was in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner concerned, that the ſaid Kingdom might continue in Tranquillity, and that all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding between the King and the Nation might be taken away. That His Highneſs well knowing, that to ſucceed in ſo Important and Laudable a Cauſe, and not to be hindred and prevented by thoſe that were Evil inclined towards it, it was neceſſary to paſs over into that Kingdom accompanied with ſome Military Forces, hath thereupon made known his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to their Highneſs, and deſired aſſiſtance from their Highneſs, that their Highneſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving maturely weighed all things, and conſidered that the King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> ſtood in very good Correſpondence and Friendſhip one with the other, which their Highneſs have been frequently very well aſſured of, and in a ſtrict and particular Alliance; and that their Highneſſes were informed and advertiſed, that their Majeſties had laboured upon a concert to divide and ſeparate this State from its Alliances; and that the King of <hi>France</hi> hath upon ſeveral occaſions ſhew'd himſelf diſſatisfied with this State, which gave cauſe to fear and apprehend, that in caſe the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> ſhould happen to compaſs his aim within his Kingdom, and obtain an abſolute power over his People, that then both Kings, out of Intereſt of State, and Hatred and Zeal againſt the Proteſtant Religion, would endeavour to bring this State to Confuſion, and if poſſible, quite to Subject it, have reſolved to commend His Highneſs in his undertaking of the aboveſaid Deſigns, and to grant to him, for his Aſſiſtance, ſome Ships and Militia, as Auxiliaries; that in purſuance thereof, His Highneſs hath declared to their Highneſs, that he is reſolved, with Gods Grace and Favour, to go over into <hi>England,</hi> not with the leaſt inſight or intention to Invade or Subdue that Kingdom, or to remove the King from the Throne, much leſs to make himſelf Maſter thereof, or to invert or prejudice the Lawful Succeſſion, as alſo not to drive thence, or perſecute, the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, but only and ſolely to help that Nation in Re-eſtabliſhing the Laws and Priviledges that have been broken, as alſo in maintaining their Religion and Liberty, and to that end, to further and bring it about, that a free and lawful Parliament may be call'd in ſuch manner, and of ſuch Perſons, as is regulated and qualified by the Laws and Form of that Government, and that the ſaid Parliament may deliberate upon, and eſtabliſh, all ſuch matters as ſhall be judge'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to aſſure and ſecure the Lords, the Clergy, Gentry, and People, that their Rights, Laws and Priviledges, ſhall be no more violated or broken, that their High and Mightineſſes hope and truſt, that with Gods bleſſing, the Repoſe and Unity of that Kingdom ſhall be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed, and the ſame be thereby brought into a condition, to be able, powerfully, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the common benefit of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and to the reſtoring and maintaining of Peace and Tranquillity in <hi>Europe.</hi> That Copies hereof be delivered to all their Foreign Miniſters, reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding here, to be uſed by them as they ſhall ſee occaſion.</p>
