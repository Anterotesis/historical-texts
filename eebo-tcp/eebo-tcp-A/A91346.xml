            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REFORMATION IN COURTS,
and Caſes Teſtamentary.</head>
            <p>BEfore the late abolition of Epiſcopacie this Nation
ſuffered under too many Teſtamentary Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
ſome Counties had no leſſe then 50. or 60. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiars:
and in ſome Counties divers Lords of Manors,
and Corporations had a priviledge to prove Wils, and
ſpeed buſineſſe of that nature upon a Lay account.</p>
            <p>The People found themſelves divers wayes aggrieved
by this multiplicitie of Juriſdictions: and therfore to give
ſome eaſe, and redreſſe therein, the Metropolitans Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Courts were erected about 400. yeers ago.</p>
            <p>In the yeer 1643. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Merick,</hi> Judge of the Prerogative
Court of Canterbury, removed his office to <hi>Oxford:</hi> and
then there was a Committee appointed to conſider of a
new ſettlement of that Court, but nothing was reported
thereupon.</p>
            <p>In the yeer 1644. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Maynard</hi> brought in an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for making Sir <hi>N: Brent</hi> Judge in D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>: <hi>Merricks</hi>
place: and the ſame was paſſed with ſome other materiall
alterations in the Prerogative Court.</p>
            <p>In the yeer 1646. All Epiſcopall Juriſdiction was
taken away: ſince which there is no true power remaining
any where to diſpatch Teſtamentary buſineſſe upon the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
ſcore, except that of Sir <hi>Na: Brents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Na: Brents</hi> Juriſdiction has two defects, and ſo is as
yet inſufficient to do right to the whole Nation: it wants
exteſinon of bounds: and a competent Power of coertion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:118086:2"/>
For want of Extenſion it cannot proceed duly within
the Province of <hi>York,</hi> nor within the ancient Province of
<hi>Canterbury:</hi> but onely in ſome ſpeciall Cauſes. Hereupon
occaſion has been taken by divers private man without, and
againſt Authority of Parliament, not onely where the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
has no cognizance, but alſo where it has to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
Teſtamentary Juriſdiction: and ſo by theſe miſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
the deceived people is put to much unneceſſarie
charge, in as much as they are neceſsitated to take out Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations
the ſecond time, and be at the expence of
new Probates as often as any Suit ariſes.</p>
            <p>For want alſo of a ſufficient Coercive Power (for a
Court without a Coerſive Power is no Court) the preſent
Judge cannot force men to bring in true Inventories, or
ſubmit to order in other points: whereupon a vaſt licence
is taken by many to defraud Creditors, Legatees, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Intereſſents: yea the State it ſelf is often injured here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
aſwell as multitudes of private men.</p>
            <p>There is now living at <hi>Guilford</hi> an Executor which refuſes
to bring in an Inventory: yet the Teſtator died under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration,
owed good ſummes upon Bond to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:
and beſides the main bulk of his eſtate, He gave
away in his Will above 900 l. in pety Legacies.</p>
            <p>In Order to a Reformation of theſe things, a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
of Parliament was choſen in <hi>April 1646.</hi> which after
3. yeers ſitting made Report in <hi>May: 1649.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The matter of that Report was referred to a new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
to be formed into a Bill, and in <hi>July</hi> following for
the better maturing of that buſineſs, other Members were
added to that Committee, and a ſpeciall care thereof was
recommended to Sir <hi>Pe: Wentworth,</hi> and Mr: <hi>Miles Corbet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since that time a Bill has been prepared, and twice read
in the Houſe, but notwithſtanding ſo much time is elapſed,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118086:2"/>
it ſtill hangs under a recommitment, and fails of giving
ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why the reforming of theſe things (though
the State it ſelf, and thouſands of particular men remain
ſufferers in the mean time) proves ſo dilatory, and difficult,
is ſuppoſed to be: becauſe moſt men are poſſeſſed with
two contrary extreme opinions: and few there are that pitch
upon the middle and more moderate way.</p>
            <p>Some men are wholly for the Civilians, and out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to them, they would have no leſſe then 20. Courts
erected, wherein none but of that profeſſion ſtould ſit as
Judges.</p>
            <p>Some men are as oppoſite to Civilians, and they would
have that whole profeſsion removed, and quite eradicated,
aſwell ſuch as have been faithfull to the Parliament during
theſe late troubles, as ſuch as have been Enemies: only that
Teſtamentary buſines might be thronged, and obtruded
upon the other Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while there is a third opinion, that mitigates
both theſe extremes, and thereby declines the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
occurring on both hands.</p>
            <p>According to this Third Opinion: if the Court (now
cal'd the Prerogative) were inabled with ſuch a Coercive
power, as other Courts of Juſtice have: if it had a Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in all Cauſes Teſtamentary whatſoever, throughout
the whole Land: if it were likewiſe animated with as many
Judges, as uſe to ſit in other Courts (which the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>
thought neceſſary many yeers ago) and if it were ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinated
to another higher Court, of as many Judges, in all
matters worthy of appeal: it would prove an excellent
ſettlement: and without any further dangerous Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(we take in all other reſtrictions, and points of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
preſcribed to other Courts againſt delayes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsive
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118086:3"/>
fees, and arbitrary proceedings) would be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſerviceable to thoſe publick ends, we all aime at.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable alſo that the Advantages, and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
which commend to us this middle way are many,
and very weighty. For,</p>
            <p>1. Hereby that admirable light of the Civill Law, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provedly
uſefull in Monarchies, and yet by ſome held more
uſefull in Democracies, will be preſerved in our Engliſh
Horizon, and ſaved from utter extinction. There is ſcarce a
State in Chriſtendome, whoſe higheſt Councels, and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories
are not mainly ſwaid by the profound Profeſſors
of Civill Law: and as learned Polititians are generally the
ableſt ſervitors to all States; ſo no other ſtudy, or breeding
has more eminently accompliſht Learned Polititians, then
this of the Civill Law. Without a competent practice
this knowledge will be loſt to our Natives: and this being
ſo loſt, we ſhall be driven, though to our ſhame, to have
forreiners in p<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nſion. Now to reject the ſervice of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen,
when we are to treat with aliens: and not onely to
truſt, but alſo to gratifie with our Engliſh gold men born
to a forrein Intereſt, will be a great diſcouragement to our
own Students ſo rejected. Beſides Teſtamentary buſines
is common to us with other Nations, it never had hitherto
any thing peculiarly municipall in it, the formes and the
proceſſes, and proofs of the Civill Law have ever hitherto
ſo prevailed, that Engliſhmen might confidently as to Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamentary
Intereſts demand, and recover their rights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and ſtrangers might do the like in <hi>England.</hi> And
tis not yet eaſie to foreſee what inconveniencies may enſue
if in this infancy of our Republick we preſently depart too
far from ancient legall communities and correſpondencies
with other neighbouring Nations.</p>
            <p>2. As the ſtudy of the Civil Law will be preſerved, by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118086:3"/>
the number of Doctors and Advocates, that will be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by one Admiralty, and theſe two Teſtamentarie
Courts: ſo the Students of the Civil Law will be hereby the
better reduced. Heretofore, when there were ſo many Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiars,
and Judicatories in <hi>England,</hi> the very number of
them was oppreſſive to the people: and yet there is not
left now the tenth part of buſines, and imployment for Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians,
as was then. All the cognizance of Decimal caſes,
and queſtions about Matrimony, Incontinence, Canonicall
obedience, and granting Licences of many ſeverall ſorts is
taken away; and therfore it remains, that we muſt leſſen our
Courts, as we have leſſned the buſines appertaining to our
Courts, or elſe our Lawyers themſelves will feel the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
of it, as well as Clients. Countrey practiſe
addes little to the skill, and ability of our Gownmen, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when there is a ſcarcity of Countrey Practiſe too, (as
there muſt needs be, if no fewer then 20. Courts be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht
for ſo little buſines, as is now remaining) the very
number of Profeſſors will become a burthen to the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
rendring them, as indigent, as it does illeterate.</p>
            <p>3. This due reducement of Civilians will be for the
States eaſe, as wel as for the commodity of our long-robed
Gentlemen. For multiplicity of Juriſdictions, what by their
own claſhings, and what by the craft of their Miniſters, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
begets multiplicity of needles Suits, and tis poſſible that
more publick and dangerous differences may be occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their diſputed limits, and diviſions, and all theſe will
be damageable to the Common-wealth. If we calculate
what the neceſſarie charge will be of maintaining twenty
Courts, as ſome propoſe in favour of Civilians: or what
will maintaine ſo many Clerks, and Officers, as there are
Counties in <hi>England,</hi> according to the propoſal of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, we ſhall finde, it will amount to no ſmall value.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:118086:4"/>
4. This juſt apportionment of Civilians to the latitude
of their buſines, by bringing with it an inlargement of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
and ſubſiſtence to thoſe few practiſers which remaine
unreduced, will inable them to ſerve the State more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
and cheaply then their predeceſſors have done hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto.
Tis manifeſt that the ſame practiſe which with
moderate fees will creditably and amply maintaine twenty
practiſers, will not maintain fourty, though they be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to exact fees more immoderately. It is propoſed
therefore in behalf of this new ſettlement, that the Judges,
and their Dependents above, without any demand of new
fees, ſhall at their proper coſt maintaine, and depute ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Officers belowe in the chief Towne, or City of each
County, that is diſtant above 60, or 70, miles from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi>
to diſpatch all ſuch Teſtamentary buſines there, as is in
common forme, and may be diſpatched by letters: and ſo
ſave the greateſt number of ſuitors their travaile to <hi>London.</hi>
It is alſo undertaken, that the ſaid Deputies ſhall in favour
of the poorer ſort do buſines <hi>gratis,</hi> and neither take grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
nor reward where the Inventory exceeds not 10 l.
and in all other diſpatches of greater value it ſhall be the
ſame Deputies part to tranſmit all things up to <hi>London</hi> that
deſerve regiſtring, and reſerving, without grating upon Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.
Likewiſe, the ſame Deputies, if Authority thinke fit,
which thus intend Teſtamentary buſines below, may finde
leaſure, and opportunity enough to keepe authenticall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires,
and records of all other contracts, and ſolemne acts
betwixt party, and party, which deſerve to be treaſured up
for publick ſearch. How acceptable therefore ſuch a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would be to the people, when it ſhould ſpeed all mens
buſines ſo compendiouſly, and the poores ſo gratuitouſly,
and how full of grace it would appear to the generality,
need not be further demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:118086:4"/>
5. Hereby the exceſsive incumbring, and over-charging
of our Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with a ſurpluſage of Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
buſines (not yet foreſeen by ſome practiſers of the
Common Law) will be aptly prevented. It will be the
wiſdome of the Parliament to provide, that we have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too many Courts for our ſuits, nor too many ſuits for
our Courts: both being attended with great inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
but the ſecond with far greater, then the firſt, ſome
would have in every County a Court, and reduce us to the
old manner of Juriſdiction, which was uſed in <hi>England</hi> long
before the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, when this was a cantoniz'd
Country, and obeyed ſeverall pety Princes: and this is preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
as very counſellable, by that party, which would canto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
us the ſecond time: but tis to be fear'd, if this deſigne
prevaile, our quarrels, and controverſies will abound, and
increaſe upon us, as faſt as our Judicatories do. That fire
which is now kept up in one hearth at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> will be
then ſcatered all over the Houſe, and ſo ſpread its flame
much wider then before. Other objections lie againſt too
many Courts, eſpeſcially when they are attended with more
illiterate Judges, and unexpert Counſellors: but the intent
of this paper is to ſhew that there is leſſe publick preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
in too many Courts, then in too few. Tis with the
politick, as with the natural body: both finde obſtructions
more fatal then fluxes, and both receive more torture from
a defect in the expulſive faculty, then from a defect in the
relentive faculty. Too much vexation from many Courts
may be compared to a diſentery: but want of expedition
by reaſon of too few Courts is like the nephriticall mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and kils us with pangs inexpreſsible. The Parliament of
late has taken away half our Courts almoſt at <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi>
and thereby doubtles it has taken away from amongſt us
many of our ſuits, and Law-queſtions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is as far out of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118086:5"/>
doubt withall, that all the differences that were formerly
decided in thoſe aboliſht Courts, are not aboliſht together
with thoſe Courts. This together with the calamity of our
late broiles, and confuſions, has begotten a very great glut
of buſines at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall: and this glut of buſines has
moſt undeſervedly begot a complaint againſt <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
Hal. Every man ſees that the <hi>Chancery</hi> at preſent grants not
Clients ſuch diſpatch as is expected: but every man ſees
not the true cauſe of this: and the plain truth is, the fault is
not in the Court, nor in the Commiſſioners, nor in the
Pleaders: tis too great a confluence of buſines that chokes
up, and obſtructs Chancery proceedings: and twere much
better for the Common-Wealth to be at the charge of
two Chanceries for too little buſines, then to maintaine
one thats over burthened with too many Cauſes. Oh that
the Parliament would conſider what want of a due hearing,
and redreſſe is in Chancery, and other Courts, yea and
within its own walls. The greateſt of our grievances, the
grievance of all our grievances at preſent is; that our grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
can have no vent, and that our complaints know no
place, where they may effectually disburthen themſelves,
many thouſands at this day being no where remediable but
in Parliament, have wofull petitions to preſent, yet can
obtaine no acceſſe at all to the Houſe: and ſome thouſands
of thoſe that obtaine acceſſe, either waſte themſelves in a
diuturnall fruſtraneous attendance, or are at laſt denied their
requeſts, or are undone for want of a timely deniall.</p>
            <p>There is now a Priſoner in <hi>Warwick</hi> Caſtle, whoſe long
durance has ſunk him into the deepeſt of all worldly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and his languiſhment is now almoſt deſperate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
though He has alwayes in other matters deſerved
well of the Parliament, and no great ill in this (as He
hopes to prove, if He may be admitted to any Triall) He
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118086:5"/>
ſees the Houſe which can hear his accuſation, yet cannot
find leiſure to hear his defence, nor will provide for Him
any other iſſue out of this miſerable condition. I my ſelf
in a Caſe of no meer, private concernment have attended
upon Committees for diſpatch at leaſt ſeven yeers: and
though that attendance has much broken my Fortunes, and
diſappointed me of divers hopefull preferments, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me cauſe to complain againſt my undoers: yet am I
fain to ſtrangle my griefes in private, leſt I ſhould by a new
ſupplication condemne my ſelf again to the torture of
<hi>Siſyphus,</hi> for ſeven yeers longer. I uttet not this here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it burns, and feſters like a deep ſuppuration in my
minde: but becauſe I beleeve there are very many others in
my condition, to whom want of expedition (being like the
ſtoppage of the ſtone in the uritories) apears more into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,
and procures more deſperate diſaffections then it
does to me. Pardon this Digreſsion, it means no ill: it
would onely demonſtate, that there is danger, and damage
in too many Tribunals, yet not ſo great as in too few.</p>
            <p>6. Hereby there will be one cettain place for all Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
to diſpatch their buſines at, and that place will be <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
our Metropolis, incomparably the moſt commodious
of the whole Land for ſuch diſpatches: when there are
many Judicatories, and Regiſtries in ſeverall Counties, and
Provinces to reſort unto, there cannot but follow much
uncertainty to Clients; and uncertainty in matters of this
nature is ever the mother of confuſion, and diſtraction.
Some men which look no further then to the eaſe of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors
and Adminiſtrators, ſuppoſe <hi>London</hi> too far diſtant
from ſome Counties, and therefore they propoſe to have
all Wils proved, and Adminiſtrations granted where each
Teſtator or partie Inteſtate dyes: but theſe in the mean
time have no regard to the eaſe of Creditors, Legatees, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118086:6"/>
other intereſſents who often are more in number, and whoſe
rights are often of more value, then the Executors and
Adminiſtrators. Wherfore foraſmuch as one that lives in
<hi>Cornwall,</hi> another in <hi>London,</hi> and a third in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> may be
concerned in a Will or Adminiſtration at <hi>Barwick,</hi> or
<hi>Carlile,</hi> and ſo by this Propoſition muſt accidentally tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
to <hi>Barwick</hi> or <hi>Carlile,</hi> the moſt incommodious places
of all <hi>England:</hi> and ſtill there is no certain place deſigned
to any man before-hand; what a generall vexation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
is this likely to produce in many Caſes? Now
<hi>London</hi> as it is a place alwayes fixed, and pre-determined,
ſo it does for manifold conveniences deſerve that prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
before all other places whatſoever. For, 1. <hi>London</hi>
is the Common Juſtice ſeat for all Suitors to reſort unto
in all other differences; and therefore Teſtamentary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
are moſt neceſſarie to be there kept, where they are
to be oftneſt produced, and where they may be moſt ready
at hand upon all occaſions to be uſed. 2. All ages can
teſtifie, that Teſtamentaries Records have there been ever
moſt ſafely treaſured up: whereas if an inquiry be now
made of the Regiſtries belowe, without doubt it will be a
ſtrange account that will be returned of their Records, and
ancient minniments. 3. If ſuits ariſe (as they do moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
about Wills, Adminiſtrations, &amp;c.) No other
place can afford ſo able Advocates, Sollicitors, &amp;c. as
<hi>London</hi> can. 4. <hi>London</hi> is ſo qualified for correſpondence,
by reaſon of the vaſt concourſe of people there about other
buſines, that any man may write thither, and by writing have
buſines diſpatcht there with leſſe trouble and expence, then
he can ride twenty miles any other way: And the greateſt
part of Teſtamentary buſines is diſpatchable by Letters.
5. As the beſt choiſe of Able reſponſall Regiſters and
other Officers are to be had at <hi>London,</hi> ſo if they miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118086:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
themſelves, there is the readieſt remedy to be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againſt them. 6. The diſpatch of buſines below is not
left to the meer care and coſts of Intereſſents farr remote
from <hi>London,</hi> that is in in great part to lie upon the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of ſuch as ſhall have Deputations from above as the
buſines is here ſtated:</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter therefore it may rationally be
concluded: 1. That a ſpeedy ſettlement of ſome new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Juriſdiction is worthy of the Parliaments ſerious
conſideration. 2. That this ſettlement here propoſed, is the
moſt adequat to our publick, nationall intereſt of any that
has been yet debated: if every man would know that the
generall intereſt comprehends his particular, as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
does the leſſe: but not on the contrary: and ſo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and Civill Juriſt would not confine their thoughts
to what is the advantage of their profeſsion; Nor the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſe
of ſuch a Town, nor the Lord of ſuch a Mannor, nor
the Knight of ſuch a Sheere; reſtrain themſelves within
their own narrower Circles, but would obey the rapture of
the higheſt orbe; all our motions would be far more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and concentrick.</p>
