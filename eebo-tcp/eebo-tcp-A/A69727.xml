            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

a time, when any Heart, but your Fearless and Invincible one, would have been wholly fill'd with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of <hi>Danger.</hi> For, as I have had the Honour to hear from that Oracle of Truth and Wisdom, Your <hi>Majestie's</hi> own Mouth; You were pleased to visit that <hi>Monument,</hi> and, for many hours together, entertain Your self with the delightful view thereof, when after the defeat of Your Loyal Army, at <hi>Worcester,</hi> Almighty God, in Infinite Mercy to Your three Kingdoms, miraculously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered You out of the bloody Jaws of those <hi>Monsters</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Cruelty,</hi> who taking Counsel onely from the Heinousness of their <hi>Crimes,</hi> sought <hi>Impunity</hi> in the highest <hi>Aggravation</hi> of

            <p>This, as at first it animated Me, to make strict Enquiry into the <hi>Origine,</hi> and <hi>Occasion</hi> of the <hi>Wonder</hi> (so the Vulgar call it) so far as the gloomy darkness of Oblivion would admit; so hath it now emboldned me, to lay at Your Majesties Feet the following Account of my <hi>Success</hi> in that Enquiry: in all possible Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Reverence, beseeching You to Honour, with Your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Acceptance,</hi> the <hi>RESTORA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION</hi> of that Gigantick Pile, whose dead Remains You so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            </p>
            <p>The FIRST <hi>Natural,</hi> namely a certain desire of Immortality, inherent in, and as it were Essential to the Human Soul. Which being an Immaterial Essence, participant of Divinity both in its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Hopes, perpetually carrieth about it this impress or character of that Eternal Being, from whence it was derived; that it abhorreth Oblivion, and as not contented with that perpetuity in posterity, which Nature hath ordained by propagation of the Species, (an institution common also to Brute Animals) it aims at another kind of Eternity, by seeking to deliver the Remembrance of some notable actions to all succeeding Generations. So strong are the incitements of this our congenial Ambition, that the Dullest Souls are not altogether insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of them, and Heroique ones feel a sort of felicity in suffering themselves to be transported by them: Yea, many have preferr'd the Imaginary life of Glory, to that Real one of Nature; and through most

horrid dangers and pains exposed themselves to death, meerly out of an obscure hope of being soon revived by Fame, and obtaining a better subsistence in the immortality of their Names. With such sentiments as these Old <hi>Ennius</hi> doubtless was toucht, when he rejoyced in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of reputation, that he fancied to himself from the merits of his Verses, and exultingly exclames</p>

            </q>
            <p>Nay, the grave <hi>Roman Orator</hi> himself was not exempted from the secret titillations of the same proleptical perswasion, when <hi>(Pro Mare.)</hi> he brake forth into this pathetic expression: <q>
                  <hi>Non haec vita dicenda est, quae corpore &amp; spiritu continetur; illa, inquam, illa vita est, quae viget memoria saeculorum omnium, quam posterit as alit, quam ipsa aeternitas semper intuetur.</hi> This is not to be accounted life, which consisteth in the conjunction of Body and Soul: that, I say, that is life indeed, which flourisheth in the memory of all ages, which Posterity nourisheth, which Eternity it self ever looketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q>And into another of the like heighth <hi>(Philip.</hi> 12.) in these words: <q>

               </q> Now, albeit this Affection of the Mind, in some persons meeting with the humor of Vain Glory, becomes an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> and misguides them to a false Eternity (for, the last cold we catch in our graves, makes us deaf to even the loudest praises of men: and if it did not, yet would the pleasure of those praises be as short and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory, as the breath that gives them being:) yet cannot it be easily denied to be a considerable argument of the Souls <hi>Immortality;</hi> forasmuch as the most rigid of Philosophers find it to be Natural <hi>(Aristotle</hi> 2. <hi>de Anima,</hi> terms it <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48257:10"/>
no man but thinks himself somewhat concerned in times that shall come after him; and that the most excellent works of men had their first beginnings from this Appetite of posthume Fame. For, whence came the foundations of Empires, the institutions of Republiques, Sects, Societies, and Laws to govern them? Whence the building of Cities, the erection of Pyramids, Mausoleas, Obelisks, Temples, Amphitheatres, Statues, Palaces, and the like costly Monuments? Whence, those many Volumes of History, Annals, Philosophy, Arts and Sciences, and all other kind of Knowledge? Whence all the brave performances and atchievements in Warr? Whence the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of Testaments, the adoption of Heirs, the affiancing of great Families, the desire of Islue? Whence, I say, can we derive all these, and in truth all other the principal designs and actions of Mankind, if not from that which <hi>Cicero</hi> (1. <hi>Tuscul)</hi> calls <hi>saeculorum quoddam augurium futurorum,</hi> a certain implanted Ambition of men to extend the prospect of their hopes beyond the dark vale of Death, and have their names survive their Funerals? so that though some Sceptiques may perhaps dispute, whether this Ambition be purely Natural, or meerly Opinionative: yet, I presume, none will contradict this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest truth, That all Nations are beholding to it for their chiefest Ornaments and Memorials; especially if due consideration be had of the neer affinity betwixt this their First Cause, and</p>
            <p>The OTHER, which is <hi>Politique;</hi> namely an incitement of men to hazardous undertakings, and enterprizes of difficulty, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before their eyes the glorious Examples of such among their Predecessors, who by actions of eminent fortitude, prudence, justice, knowledge, piety to their Country, or other the like Virtues, have highly obliged mankind. For, since Glory and Renown is one of the sharpest spurrs to Heroical spirits; and that glory is alwayes great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, that is most permanent: it was a high point of Wisedome and Policie in our Forefathers to erect publick memorials of great and worthy men, such as being lookt upon by their Successors, might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire them with a generous Emulation to atchieve the like meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions, that so they may attain to the like honour and esteem, with those that shall come after them. Virtue, though a sufficient reward to it self, would yet have but few followers, unless attended on by Fame. Whereupon <hi>Cicero (in</hi> 1. <hi>Tusculan.)</hi> discoursing of gallant men, sayes positively, <hi>Eorum nemo unquam, sine magna spe</hi>

            <p>Among the most durable Memorials of worthy Men and Actions, by which generous spirits are animated to tread in the rough and crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy wayes of Virtue, upon expectation the Gratitude of posterity will endeavour to vindicate their names and deserts from the devouring jaws of Oblivion; the first place belongs to those, which the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans call <gap reason="foreign">

The word <hi>Monumentum</hi> deriving it self from <hi>Moneo;</hi> and that again holding from <hi>Memoria;</hi> as <hi>Varro (de lingua Latin. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>) monere est a memoria dictum, quod is, qui monet, perinde sit ac memoria.</hi> So that a Monument, in propriety of signification, is an <hi>Admonition by putting in remembrance.</hi> In which sense <hi>Cicero</hi> speaking to <hi>Caesar,</hi> saith, <hi>sed Ego, quae monumenti ratio sit, nomine ipso admoneor, ad memoriam magis spectare debere posteritatis, quam ad praesentis temporis gratiam.</hi> And in a Manuscript Registre of the Gray Friers in London, kept in <hi>Sir Robert Cottons</hi> Library, there is this agreeable definition of a Monument; <hi>Monimentum est quasi mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens mentem, &amp; sic solet a doctioribus Etymologiari: monet namque bifariÃ m humanam mentem, cum aut mortis memoriam incutit, visis praecedentium sepulchris; aut eisdem conspectis, alii ad virtutis iter strenue calcandum incitantur &amp; animantur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it comes, that notwithstanding the things invented to give notice to posterity of the laudable atchievements of their Progenitors, be almost infinitely <hi>various</hi> in their natures, materials, forms, &amp;c. yet still hath the word <hi>Monument</hi> been used, as a general name, to denote them: which <hi>Festus</hi> long since observed in this saying; <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum est, quod mortui causa aedificatum est, &amp; quicquid in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam alicujus factum est, ut fana, porticus, scripta, &amp; carmina, &amp;c.</hi>

To enumerate the several Kinds, or Differences of these inanimate Remembrancers; and deduce each of those differences from its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Causes and occasions, is neither necessary to, nor consistent with my present design, which is confined within the circle of one single monument. Let it suffice, therefore, if I in the general advertise, that their Variety is owing not onely to the diversity of Peoples and Nations, that founded, erected, composed them of different Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, after sundry manners, and with various artifices, each according to their proper Genius, Belief, Customes, Commodities, and the like: but also to the circumstances of Time, Place, Fortune, and Occasion. So that no wonder, if these (as all other the works of Man) are vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different among themselves, in Matter, Form, Magnitude, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Cost, Magnificence, Situation, and Design.</p>
            <p>Nor is it more a wonder, that this great <hi>Difference</hi> sometimes turns to the <hi>Confusion</hi> of ancient Monuments, and makes them no Monuments at all; by rendring their particular significations so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinct, that even the best Antiquaries (those Masters of the Rolls of time) fall into contention not onely concerning the <hi>Authors</hi> by whom, and the <hi>Times</hi> wherein; but also about the <hi>Ends,</hi> or Purposes for which they were at first set up. For, the Monuments of even one and the same Nation, in one and the same Country, having been now and then varied in fashion, magnificence, &amp;c. according to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vicissitudes of Time, mutations of Religion, and other revolutions of Fate: it cannot but be highly difficult for late posterity, who are left in ignorance of the respective occasions and motives of those changes, to search into the intentions of their Founders; especially, where History hath been either altogether silent, or (what's as bad) full of uncertainties concerning their Originals. And where the darkness of Oblivion hath been added to that of aged Time; certainly, our Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity can hardly find the way to truth, nor is the glimmering light of Reason likely to afford other discoveries, but what are Conjectural. So true it is, that <hi>Monuments themselves are subject to</hi> Forgetfulness, <hi>even while they remain: and that when neither the Writings of men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the same age, or not long after their erection, nor uncorrupted Tradition hath concurred to give them life; they usually stand rather as dead objects of popular wonder, and occasions of Fables, than as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain records of Antiquity.</hi>

Do you require an Instance, or <hi>Example</hi> of the truth of what I here say? Please you to convert your eyes upon that most notable Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, commonly called STONEâHENG, on <hi>Salisbury</hi> plain; you shall there find one most eminent, most fit for your purpose, most worthy your contemplation. For, though this Gigantique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main be wonderfull as well in respect of the strangeness of its Form, as of the vastness of the stones, of which it is composed; and therefore among all the Antiquities of this our Island, none seems better to have deserved the commemoration of our ancient Writers: Yet such hath been its Fate, that it hath out-lived it self, and buried as well the Names, as Bones of those Worthies to whose memory it was consecrated; nor can you meet with any story of credit to inform you when, or by whom it was erected. Having raised horror and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment in the Beholder; it leaves him to entertain himself with thoughts as various, as the plain it stands upon is wide, and as confused, as Ruine hath made it stones: the prospect of it at a distance not more delighting the eye, than the neer survey doth perplex the brain, or the date of it amuse the understanding. What the vulgar idlely feign of the stones of it, namely that they are innumerable, not in respect of the greatness of their number, but of I know not what magical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment supposed impressed upon the whole pile, that deludes the attempts of Arithmetique; I find true of the Years of its continuance, its Beginning being as obscure, as the Fable of <hi>Merlins</hi> transportation of it out of Ireland, by witchcraft, is absurd and ridiculous; yea so far hath oblivion prevail'd, that now we are in doubt, not only what King, Prince, or General, but also what Nation it was, that bequeathed us this Wonder for a Legacy.</p>
            <p>The consideration of this, together with a certain deep resentment of the misfortune of the Founders of this prodigious Fabrique, who in despite of its greatness and durability, seem utterly lost and forgotten, as if they had been entombed in the bowels of the deepest Ocean, or in the sandy deserts of <hi>Arabia:</hi> as it hath often raised in me a kind of indignation against the enviousness of Time, (which hardly endures that Creatures subject to mortality in their Nature, should be above it in their memory, and, in derision of mans greatest works, sometimes brings the River <hi>Lethe</hi> to flow as well above ground, as below;) so did it enkindle in me an ardent desire to contribute my mite toward the researching, who or what those Worthies were, that entrusted their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48257:12"/>
remembrance to this forgetfull Heap. And in compliance with this desire, having from the necessary imployments of my profession bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed some hours, for the reading of such Authors, as well ancient, as modern, who have either lightly mentioned, or professedly treated of this venerable piece of Antiquity, or others resembling it; and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably examined the respective probability, or improbability of their different opinions touching its Origine, by comparing them with the agreeableness, or disagreeableness they hold to the parts and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the building it self, and with the concurrence of History, Time, Place and other circumstances: I at length believed, I was arrived, though not at perfect satisfaction, yet at reasonable grounds for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that most probably it was a Monument anciently erected by the <hi>Danes,</hi> at such time as that warlike Nation usurped the soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this our fertil Island. After this, being further animated by this meditation; that if it be, as doubtless it is, a kind of Inhumanity and Sacrilege, to despoil the dead of the glory due to rhem, by alienating the memorials they studiously left behind them, and transferring the honour of their works upon strangers, who have no better title there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, than what the mistake, or flattery of after ages gave them; on the contrary, it must be a sort of Piety to endeavour to restore the true owners to the possession of their Merits, by reviving the justice of their claim: I indulged my self the liberty to conceive, the Candid and Ingenious would take it in good part, if by publishing the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that induced me to be of that Opinion, I modestly made them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so judges of its probability; contenting my self only with the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and innocence of my devoir, and submitting my collections to their wiser examination. And thus you have the <hi>Occasion, Motives, Design,</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> of the following discourse. As for the <hi>Method,</hi> and <hi>Style</hi> of it; you will soon perceive the <hi>One</hi> to be somewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, the <hi>Other</hi> altogether rude and unpolished: so that it cannot be denied, but I have in some sort observed a <hi>decorum</hi> with the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I speak of; the parts thereof being now in great disorder, and the stones alwayes unhewn, as they come from the Quarrie. But both being <hi>Natural</hi> and unaffected, I hope you will bear with their other defects; especially when you shall consider, that in Arguments of this nature, cleerness of proofs, and authority of testimonies, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of quotations are much to be preferred before exactness of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and Elegancy of Phrase.</p>

               <p>About six miles from <hi>Salisbury,</hi> northward (saith He) on <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> Plain, is to be seen a huge and monstrous piece of work, such as <hi>Cicero</hi> termeth <hi>insanam substructionem.</hi> For, within the circuit of a ditch, there are erected, in manner of a Crown, in three ranks or courses, one within another, certain mighty and unwrought stones; whereof some are twenty eight foot high, and seven foot broad: upon the heads of which others, like overthwart pieces, do bear and rest crosswise, with small tenents and mortescies, so as the whole frame seemeth to hang; whereof we call it STONE-HENG, like as our old Historians termed it, for the greatness, <hi>Chorea Gigantum,</hi> the Giants Dance.</p>

               <hi>B.</hi> the Overthwart stones, called Cronets, of six or seven Tunn weight.</p>
            <p>Here in all likelihood, You will a little wonder, both by what way <hi>Mr. Camden</hi> could attain to the weight of these so ponderous masses, so as to be positive in the assignment of it: and why, having first made the altitude of the Erected stones, or Columns to be twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight foot, he immediately, in the explication of his pourtraict, brings it down to onely twenty four foot. Nor, indeed, can I ease you of that wonder; otherwise than by referring the former to his meer Conjecture, and the other to his Forgetfulness. But this transitory remarque is of as small importance to our main scrutiny; as His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription comes short of that satisfaction, which is required to an exact survey of all parts of the wonder. Let us pass, therefore, if your curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity and leisure permit, to the more ample</p>

               <bibl>Description of Stone-heng, by Mr. Inigo Jones. Who being, and not unworthily, called by <hi>Mr. Web</hi> (in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to <hi>Mr. Jones</hi> his Book, entituled <hi>Stone-heng Restored)</hi> the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Vitruvius;</hi> and having, as Himself professeth, in the 56. <hi>page</hi> of the same Book, with no little pains, and charge, measured the whole work, and diligently searched the Foundations of it: seems to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise us a more full account in all particulars.</bibl>
               <p>This Antiquity (saith He) because the <hi>Architraves</hi> are set upon the heads of the upright stones, and hang as it were in the air, is generally known by the name of <hi>Stone-heng.</hi> The whole work, in general, being of a Circular form, is 110. foot diameter; double winged about, without a roof; anciently environed with a deep trench, still appearing about thirty foot broad. So that betwixt it, and the work it self, a large and void space of ground being left; it had from the Plain three open Entrances, the most conspicuous whereof lies North-east. At each of which was raised, on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the Trench aforesaid, two huge stones, Gate-wise; parallel
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48257:15"/>
whereunto, on the inside, two others of less proportions. The Inner part of the work, consisting of an Exagonal figure, was raised, by due symmetry, upon the bases of four Equilateral Triangles, which formed the whole Structure. This Inner part likewise was double, having within it also another Exagon raised; and all that part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Trench, sited upon a commanding ground, eminent, and higher by much than any of the Plain lying without, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thereof upon a foundation of hard Chalk, the work it self was placed. Insomuch, that from what part soever they came unto it, they rose by an ascending hill.</p>
               <p>In the inmost part is a Stone appearing not much above the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Earth, and lying towards the East, four foot broad, and sixteen in length. Which, whether an Altar, or no, I leave to the judgment of others.</p>
               <p>The Great stones, which made the Entrances from the outside of the Trench, are seven foot broad, three thick, and twenty high.</p>
               <p>Their Parallels, on the inside of the Trench, are four foot broad, and three thick; but so broken, their proportions in hight cannot be exactly measured.</p>
               <p>The stones, which make the Outward Circle, carry in breadth seven foot, in thickness 3 and Â½, and in hight 15 and Â½: each stone having two Tenons mortaised into the Architrave continuing upon them, throughout the whole circumference. For, these Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traves being joynted directly in the middle of each of the Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular stones, that their weight might have an equal bearing; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each side of the joynt a Tenon wrought (as remains yet to be seen): it may positively be concluded thereby, the Architrave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued round about this Outward Circle.</p>
               <p>The smaller stones of the Inner Circle are two foot and Â½ in breadth, 1. thick, and 6. high. These had no Architrave upon them, but were raised perpendicular, of a Pyramidal form.</p>
               <p>The Stones of the Greater Hexagon, 7. foot and Â½ in breadth,

three foot nine inches in thickness, and twenty foot in hight; each having one Tenon in the middle.</p>
               <p>The stones of the Inner Hexagon, 2. foot 6. inches broad, 1. foot and Â½ thick, and eight foot high; in form Pyramidal, like those of the Inner Circle.</p>
               <p>The Architrave lying round about upon the Perpendicular stones of the Outward Circle, is three foot and Â½ broad, two foot and Â½ high or thick.</p>
               <p>The Architrave on the top of the great stones of the Outward Hexagon, 16. foot long, 3. foot 9. inches broad, 3. foot 4 inches high. This Architrave continuing onely from stone to stone, left betwixt every two and two, a void space, free to the air, unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>After this Survey (and some other Designs, that he fancied cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent thereunto) He obligeth his Readers with the whole work in Prospective, as it now lies in its ruines, representing it self to the eye thus.</p>

               <hi>The Figure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which <hi>P.</hi> represents the manner of the Tenons, of a round form, mortaised into the Architrave of the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Circle: and</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> the Tenons of the like form, in the middle of the stones of the Greater Hexagon.</p>
            <p>Reflecting upon these two Descriptions, and comparing them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with due care: You'l find them at open variance, and differing in so many, and so considerable particulars, that 'twill be a hard task for you to keep them from mutually discrediting each other. For</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Mr. Camden</hi> expresly affirm's, He observed the Ranks, or Courses, in which all the Stones were erected, to be only <hi>Three,</hi> one within another; and <hi>Mr. Jones</hi> as confidently avouches, He found them to be <hi>Four.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48257:18"/>
(2.) The <hi>Former</hi> saith all those three Courses are <hi>Circular:</hi> the <hi>Later</hi> saith, of his Four, two only are Circular, the other two <hi>Hex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agonal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>This</hi> gives you a punctual account of <hi>Three open Entrances,</hi> marked with two huge stones perpendicularly raised on the outside of the Trench, and other two of lesser dimensions in like manner sited on the inside, in position parallel: <hi>That</hi> is utterly silent concerning any such matter; yea implicitly denies it, in that hee delivered, that all the stones observed the circumferences of their proper Circles.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) In like manner, the <hi>One</hi> stumbles upon an <hi>Altar-stone</hi> (for such He conceived, and such He would have us believe it to be, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his seeming to leave men to the liberty of their own judgment in that point:) over which the <hi>Other</hi> leaped cleerly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out so much as ever touching it.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) <hi>Mr. Camden</hi> assignes to the Perpendicular stones of the largest size, twenty four foot of Altitude: but <hi>Mr. Jones</hi> will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to exceed twenty foot.</p>
            <p>Behold, here, a notable Example of the <hi>discrepancy of Mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, even in things easily determinable by the sense! and how hard it is to discern truth with others eyes!</hi> What, then, shall we conclude on in the case? Upon whose relation may we, with greatest security to our belief, depend? If we compare the <hi>Reputations</hi> of these two Authors; we find them equally high and venerable: the One being worthily esteemed one of the principal <hi>Antiquaries,</hi> and most Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men of his time; the Other as worthily reckoned among the most excellent <hi>Architects</hi> this Nation ever bred, and a general Scholar. If we ballance their several <hi>Abilities</hi> respective to the matter in hand; no great advantage of weight appears on either side: for if <hi>Mr. Jones</hi> were more conversant in <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> and more exact in the Rules of <hi>Geometry; Mr. Camden</hi> was not ignorant of the Art of Designing taught by the one, nor unacquainted with the use of the <hi>Other,</hi> as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from many passages in his immortal Writings. However, He was certainly skilfull enough in the common wayes of measuring and surveying, not to be mistaken in the dimensions and platform of Stone-heng. If we compute the <hi>Times,</hi> in which they severally took their draughts of this Wonder; the difference will be so small, as not to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48257:18"/>
solve the variousness of them: for, they were Contemporaries, and not above forty years, at most, seem to have intervened betwixt the Writing of one and the other, concerning this Argument. A small space of time to wear off four foot of hardest stone from the heads of the Perpendiculars or Columns; especially considering not so much as an inch is diminished from their sides. And much too short a time, for so many new stones to grow up in, as <hi>Mr. Jones</hi> discovered more than the other perceived. Lastly, as for their <hi>Veracity;</hi> that's a thing sacred, admitting of neither dispute, nor comparison; and 'twere breach of Charity not to be confident of this; that both of them had so great devotion and reverence toward the majesty of Truth, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would dare to offend her, by willingly deluding the present and future ages, with counterfeit Certificates, or by adding or diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where they pretend to exactness and fidelity. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, such is their misfortune, and our trouble, we cannot give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to both at once: that one hath mistaken, is manifest; that both were mistaken, and about the same particulars, is improbable; to determine on which side the Error lies, is difficult, but by a new survey; and to reconcile them in all points, seems impossible. Wherefore, though the clue of my slender Observations upon the place, be not strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to conduct you out of this Labyrinth: yet, I hope, my zeal to truth may excuse my plainness and freedome, if I adventure to assure you, that having more than once or twice delighted my self with view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this admirable Antiquity, and with all possible attentiveness of mind contemplated the form, order, and parts of it; I alwaies obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Mr. Camdens</hi> Draught to come much neerer in resemblance both to the work it self, and to the idea thereof formed in my Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation out of its ruines, than that bequeathed to the world by <hi>Mr. Jones,</hi> though much more elaborate and artificial. Neverthelesse, the Model I have conceived of the whole Fabrique in General, being not cast in the mould of Architectonical Principles, nor adjusted by the maxims of Geometry; but rude and simple, such as my Eyes deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in to my brain: I think it not worth the labour of Copying; but leave every man to the liberty of fancying as he pleaseth, when he hath sufficiently gazed upon the Original. In the mean time, let us proceed to our Capital Enquiry, <hi>Who were the Authors of this stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Building,</hi> that doth so amaze and amuse its beholders.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Scaliger</hi> wittily and truly said, in one of his <hi>Exercitations,</hi> concerning the nature of <hi>Colours;</hi> viz. <hi>that objects most cleer and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48257:19"/>
               <hi>to the Sense, are often most full of difficulty and obscurity when brought home to the Understanding:</hi> holds true also of this Monument, which is not more conspicuous to the Eye, for its greatness and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, than dark to the Mind, in respect of its original and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which no certain remains are to be found. So that we are not more beholding to Time, for suffering the <hi>Sceleton</hi> or Bones of this Giant to stand so long; than injured by it, in that it so soon extinguisht the <hi>life,</hi> or <hi>story</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>For, first, our most ancient, and most authentique Historians, who committed to record the most memorable actions and traverses of Fortune among the Britains; and who may with good reason be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to have been not much above one age younger than Stone-heng it self: have passed it over in silence, as a thing, either of whose Being they were utterly ignorant, or of whose Beginning they were utterly uncertain. So that from their Writings, nothing can be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced toward our information.</p>
            <p>And then, as for such others of our Country-men, as well <hi>Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographers,</hi> as <hi>Antiquaries,</hi> who living at less or greater distance of time after the former, have treated expresly of it; they deliver reports so various and inconsistent among themselves, and severally so embroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with improbabilities and incongruities; that they appear to have taken up their respective opinions either from obsolete and darksome traditions, or from slender and questionable authorities, or at best from plausible conjectures. So that from these Authors likewise, little is to be borrowed toward our determination. However, it being my duty to presume, you are not unwilling to hear these Opinions, what and whose they are; I shall not decline the labour of collecting and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing them sincerely and faithfully: especially for as much as <hi>many things are well worthy our Knowledge, that cannot yet deserve our Belief; and even Fictions sometimes have accidentally given light to long obscured verities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Eldest</hi> and most vulgarly received Opinion, then, concerning the first Foundation of Stone-heng, is, <hi>that it was erected by that so much renowned Brittish-roman</hi> (for, a Roman He was, <hi>materna ex parte,</hi> by the Mothers side) Aurelius Ambrosius, <hi>in memory of those four hundred and sixty Noble Britains, in peaceable manner invited to a treaty of accommodation, to be held in or neer the Town of Ambresbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48257:19"/>
               <hi>by that bloody invader and leader of the Saxons,</hi> Hengist; <hi>and upon a watch-word given, most treacherously murdered by him and his equally inhuman confederates, upon the place in which they were assembled.</hi> And the principal, if not the first Author of this report, was <hi>Geffery Monmouth (in lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Histor. Britannic.)</hi> to whom I remit you for a more full narration of the manner how this perfidious Massacre was designed and executed, and how the Monument of Stone-heng was set up, as a perpetual Memorial of those many Worthies, who there suffered a Civil Martyrdome, being sacrificed in honour of their Country.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Next</hi> (neer of Kin to the first, as to Time; though <hi>Ã¨ diametro</hi> contrary, in all other respects) is, <hi>That the same</hi> Aurelius Ambrosius <hi>being deceased, his sorrowfull subjects, the Britans, to testifie to succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ages how high an honour they had for the reliques of Him, under whose valiant and prudent conduct, and by whose couragein-spiring Example, they had so often repulsed and defeated their savage Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, raised this Magnificent structure over the place of his sepulture, as a most durable witness of his Heroical Virtues, and their own grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full piety.</hi> And this conceit seems derived chiefly from <hi>Polydor Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> who <hi>(in lib</hi> 3.) relating the passages of warr, betwixt the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans and Saxons of those times, expresly affirms it as a memorable truth, in words of this sense. <q>In memory of his atchievements for the liberty and good of his Country, the Britans set up a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Sepulchre for their General, <hi>Ambrosius,</hi> made of great square stones, in form of a Crown <hi>(observe here, how exactly</hi> Polydor's <hi>des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of the general Aspect of Stone-heng agrees with that of Mr.</hi> Camden <hi>formerly mentioned)</hi> in that very place, where He was slain in fight; that the fortitude of so noble a Chiestain, might be neither forgotten among themselves, nor left unremembred to posterity. Which Monument is yet remaining in the Diocess of Salisbury, near to the Town called Amesbury.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Conjecture we meet with, which though of much younger date, doth yet pretend to be grounded upon an Accident of Warre so ancient, that we have scarcely any records of the actions betwixt the Britans and Romans in this Island, of certainty above it; and it is, that <hi>Stone-heng was built by the old Britains as a Sepulchral Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their Magnanimous, but unfortunate Queen,</hi> Bunduca <hi>or</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adicia, <hi>Dowager of</hi> Prasutagus, <hi>King of the</hi> Iceni; <hi>who with all her</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48257:20"/>
               <hi>principal Nobility, and a numerous Army, was fatally overthrown in battel by that handfull of</hi> Romans, <hi>under the command of</hi> Suetonius Paulinus, <hi>then Lieutenant in</hi> Britanny. The Father of this more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, than probable fancy, was the Translator of <hi>Lucius Florus</hi> (one <hi>Mr. Bolton,</hi> as I have been told by several Stationers) and Author of that ingenious Book, entituled <hi>Nero Caesar,</hi> published no longer agoe, than in the year 1624. who out of a certain excess of devotion to the Fame of that British Amazon (as each Historian must have his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Heros, or Heroine, whose virtues he delights to magnifie above all others) willing to heighten her glories by all means possible; and taking advantage of these words of <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> concerning her fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rites, <hi>Britanni humavernnt Eam magnifice,</hi> the Britans inhumed her with solemn and magnificent pomp: rather than suffer her to want a Toomb proportionate to the grandure of her birth, soveraignty, and spirit, would needs be so courtly, as to bestow that huge pile of stones upon her, to which the laws of History gave her no right at all. But let us hear with what fervor of Zeal, and freedom of vote, He conferreth this favour upon the Lady. <q>The Story of <hi>Bunduca,</hi> saith He, <hi>[Nero Caesar p.</hi> 182, &amp; 183.] than which neither our own noble Country, nor the whole globe of <hi>Earth,</hi> hath a rarer, was so little understood by <hi>Monmouth,</hi> as it doth not appear at all, that ever the bare sound thereof arrived within his hearing. But had the pretious volumes of the <hi>Cornelian Annals,</hi> and <hi>Dio Cassius,</hi> and <hi>John Xiphiline</hi> (where her Heroick deeds are upon record to all posterity) been within the sphear of his studies; not <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius,</hi> nor those four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and threescore noblemen of Britain murdered in <hi>Vortigers</hi> Reign, should perhaps have carried away with him the fame of this Material wonder, but Her Magnanimous self. Higher than to Her no Books do reach, with any probability of a Person more capable of such a Testimony, than she; and the profound oblivion which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Author, and the first intention of rearing them, where now they still defie the weather, doth strongly fortifie my suspition, that the stones were consecrated to the glory of <hi>Bunduca,</hi> and of her Captains slain in her Quarrel, so long time since as <hi>Nero Caesars</hi> dayes, much above fifteen hundred years, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here, after the recital of these Three so different Suppositions, I should immediately have proceeded to the <hi>Examination</hi> of them in order: but <hi>Mr. Inigo Jones</hi> having, not many years past, with singular judgement, and great pains, fully detected the particular weaknesses of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48257:20"/>
each, and improbabilities of all; and my Genius being alwayes averie to the dull and unprofitable drudgery of transcription; I think it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, if I refer You to His elaborate discourse upon the same ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse Argument, while I apply my self to the serious consideration of a <hi>Fourth</hi> opinion, to which His fruitfull Imagination seems to have given birth, and His ample skill in Architecture, credit.</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>Mr. Jones <hi>his Opinion, then, of the Founders, Antiquity and Design of Stone-heng, is</hi>
               </bibl>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it was a work of the ROMANS, built by them, when they flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished here in greatest peace and prosperity, and happily betwixt the times of</hi> Agricola's <hi>government, and the reign of</hi> Constantine <hi>the Great, about</hi> 1560 <hi>years agoe; not as a Sepulchral Monument, but as a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and particularly consecrated to the imaginary Deity of</hi> Coelus, <hi>or</hi> Coelum, <hi>from whence their superstitious belief derived the original of all things.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>The <hi>Grounds</hi> whereon He advanced, and <hi>Reasons</hi> with which He endeavoured to support this so new and strange surmise; being brought into order, and few words, are these that follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> that the <hi>Romans</hi> were, and no other Nation could be Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Stone-heng,</hi> He argueth from (1.) the <hi>Magnisicence;</hi> (2.) the <hi>Order;</hi> (3.) the <hi>Architectonical Scheme;</hi> (4.) the double <hi>Portico</hi> in the greater <hi>Circle</hi> of Stones, and another <hi>Portico</hi> in the <hi>Cell,</hi> or <hi>Hex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agon;</hi> (5.) the <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Position</hi> of the Columns of the Building; and (6) from the Roman <hi>Reliques</hi> frequently found neer the place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> that it was a <hi>Temple,</hi> He would infer from (1.) the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall,</hi> or spacious Court round about; (2.) the <hi>Cell,</hi> and its <hi>Porticoes;</hi> (3.) the <hi>Altar,</hi> and its position Eastward; (4.) the <hi>Mixt,</hi> or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound <hi>Order;</hi> (5.) the <hi>Aspect</hi> of the whole Fabrique; and (6.) from the <hi>Skuls of Beasts</hi> digged up in the circumjacent ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that this so plausibly imagined Temple was consecrated in particular to the God, <hi>Coelus;</hi> He concludeth from (1.) the <hi>Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;</hi> (2.) the <hi>Aspect Hypaethros;</hi> (3.) the <hi>Manner,</hi> or <hi>Form;</hi> (4.) the <hi>Order;</hi> (5.) the <hi>Decorum</hi> of the structure; (6.) the <hi>Pyramidal</hi>

Figure of the stones; and (7.) from the <hi>Kinds</hi> of Beasts customarily offered in sacrifice to that Deity. And this is the Summary of all those particulars, from whose concurrent hints He seems to have deduced his Invention.</p>
            <p>An Invention exceedingly fine and subtle, I confess; savouring of a pregnant Wit, and no small Learning, especially in the mysteries of ancient Atchitecture in use among the <hi>Romans;</hi> and therefore much applauded by some of more than vulgar judgment: yet not so firmly founded, as to be impregnable; nor so closely compacted in all its parts, as to keep out all weather of Contradiction. Wherefore though it be far from my design to batter and demolish it (for, in truth, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to stand, though meerly for the pleasantness:) yet my devotion to truth, and the interest of my present disquisition concur to excuse my boldness, if having brought you to it, I adventure to shew you the several Flaws, chinks, and defects discoverable therein; leaving it at last to your own judgment, whether it be strong enough to secure any mans belief, that shall set up his rest in it.</p>
            <p>Let us, therefore, begin at the First Partition, <hi>viz. That Stone-heng was a peice of Roman Architecture;</hi> and carefully view the strength of those Reasons alleged to prove it so to be.</p>
            <p>(First,) As for the <hi>Magnificence</hi> thereof; what <hi>Aristotle</hi> (4. <hi>Eth. cap.</hi> 2.) terms <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, the Latines <hi>Magnificentia &amp; Majestas,</hi> doth not consist alone in the Magnitude or Massiness of either the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of a Building, or the whole Pile (for, then those huge stones lying one upon another, call'd <hi>Wringchees,</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> would be a magnificent structure): but in an artificial Decorum, or agreeable pulchritude conjoyned with greatness of bulk. Which two Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties meeting together in any Fabrique, cause it to present it self to the eye with a certain twofold gracefulness or majesty, that instantly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a kind of Respect, and where it is rare and excellent, a kind of delightfull Wonder also in the beholders. So that we use not to call Great things, Majestical, in respect of their large dimensions alone: nor Little things, Magnificent, notwithstanding their Elegancy. And this I conceive to be the adaequate notion of <hi>Magnificence</hi> among all Architects. Now, according to this notion, though the stones of <hi>Stone-heng</hi> be, indeed, extraordinarily big and ponderous; yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as they are rude, rough, craggy, and difform among themselves,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48257:21"/>
and destitute of any great Art or Elegancy in their general disposition and construction; I perceive my self under no constraint or necessity of apprehending it as a Magnificent building, at least in so high a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as <hi>Mr. Jones</hi> would have us believe, when He affirms, <hi>that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt</hi> Rome <hi>and our Island, there is no Monument, in which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Magnificence is more conspicuous, than in this.</hi> If by Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence He meant <hi>Magnum apparatum,</hi> the difficulty of the Means, strength of Engines, multitude of hands, length of time, &amp;c. necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made use of in bringing together, and raising so many and so large stones; then doth his Inference fall to the ground: there being many antique Monuments yet remaining, some in <hi>England,</hi> others in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> others again in <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway;</hi> which consisting of the like materials, and those perhaps further fetcht too, could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire like strength, labour, and art to their erection, and yet the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had no hand in setting up either of them; as shall be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, when the thread of my discourse hath brought me to mention them more opportunely. Furthermore, what judicious Eye, that hath once beheld the remains of <hi>Diocletian's</hi> Baths, <hi>Nero's</hi> Palace, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> his Theatre, <hi>Vespasians</hi> Temple of Peace, the great <hi>Cirque,</hi> or other the monstrous buildings of the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> can afterward fancy any such thing as Roman Magnificence in this formless Uniform Heap of massy stones at <hi>Stone-heng?</hi> there being as little of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or resemblance betwixt this and those, as betwixt <hi>St. Pancrace</hi> Church, and <hi>St. Pauls;</hi> or as betwixt a Welsh montaineers cottage, and the Royal Palace of <hi>Hampton Court.</hi> Nor am I alone of this judgment; for the <hi>Author</hi> of the life of <hi>Nero Caesar,</hi> formerly cited, apprehended so little of Magnificence in the thing, that from the very <hi>Rudeness</hi> thereof He concludes it (though erroneously) to have been a work of the <hi>Britains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(Secondly,) As for the <hi>Order,</hi> which <hi>Mr. Jones</hi> affirms to be the <hi>Tuscan;</hi> that you may the more cleerly discern, whether any such thing was observed by the Builders of <hi>Stone-heng,</hi> in that work, or not, it i needfull for me to put you in mind at least, What that Tuscan Orde is, what Conditions it hath that are Common to the other orders also and what distinct Proprieties. The Ancient Roman Architects ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally divided their structures <hi>in parietes continuos, &amp; intermissos,</hi> into <hi>Intire</hi> or <hi>Continued</hi> walls, and <hi>Intermissions</hi> made by Columns or Pillars. Of these <hi>Columns</hi> they had, partly from the <hi>Grecians,</hi> partly of their own invention, Five different Kinds, or sorts; which reckoned
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48257:22"/>
according to their respective dignity and perfection, are the <hi>Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian,</hi> and <hi>Compound,</hi> or (as it is commonly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) <hi>Italic.</hi> The <hi>Tuscan</hi> (which alone relates to our present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) <hi>est plana, massiva, seu rustica columna, similis robusto alicui &amp; benÃ¨ artuato ruricolae, viliter amicto,</hi> is a plain, massive, or rustical Column, carrying some resemblance to a strong and well-limbed Country-man, meanly clad; as <hi>Vitruvius (lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.) not unfitly describes it. The <hi>Conditions</hi> common to this Pillar with the rest, are principally <hi>Three,</hi> according to <hi>Sr. H. Wottons</hi> enumeration of them, <hi>in prima parte Elementorum Architecturae,</hi> for the Excellency thereof translated into Latin by <hi>John de Laet. First,</hi> the Pillars of all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are <hi>Rotundae figurae,</hi> of a Round figure. For, though some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Column <hi>Atticurges,</hi> of which <hi>Vitruvius</hi> speaks <hi>(lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.) was Square; yet was it lookt upon as irregular, and never admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the orders, but among other extravagant inventions, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Him. <hi>Secondly, Omnes diminuuntur &amp; contrahuntur insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliter, plus aut minus, secundÃ¹m proportionem suae altitudinis, ab tertiae parte scapi sui sursum,</hi> All are Contracted or lessened insensibly, more or less, according to the proportion of their altitude, from the third part of their Scape, or lower part, upward. Which <hi>Guilielm. Philander,</hi> (one of the best Interpreters of <hi>Vitruvius,)</hi> from the exact dimensions of sundry antique Remains survey'd by himself, prescribes <hi>tanquam venustissimam diminutionem,</hi> as the most comely and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diminution; and most resembling the Taper growth of Pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, from whose pattern the Figure of all Columns was first taken. <hi>Thirdly, Omnes suos habent Stylobat as, altitudine tertiae partis totius Columnae, comprehensa basi &amp; capitulo;</hi> All have their <hi>Pedestals,</hi> of the hight of the third part of the whole Column, from the base to the head. The <hi>Proprieties</hi> of the <hi>Tuscan</hi> order (to omit others of lesse importance) consist principally in two things, <hi>viz.</hi> the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Longitude of the Pillar it self, and the <hi>Intercolumnium,</hi> or distance betwixt Pillar and Pillar. The <hi>Hight,</hi> or Length of the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ought to be <hi>Sex diametrorum crassissimae partis inferioris ipsius sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi> six Diameters of its thickness in the biggest part a little above the bottome. For <hi>Vitruvius (lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.) accounts the length of a Mans foot to be the sixt part of his whole body, in ordinary dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and Man, according to <hi>Protagoras,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>of all exact Symmetry the Prototype, or first Exemplar.</hi> And the <hi>Intercolumnium,</hi> or Intervall betwixt the Pillars, is required to be <hi>circiter quatuor illius diametrorum,</hi> of about four Diameters.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48257:22"/>
Now, these Qualifications of the <hi>Tuscan</hi> order being thus set down, on one side of the parallel: let us turn our Eyes upon <hi>Stone-heng</hi> and see what Analogy is to be found therein, to make up the other. (1.) At <hi>Stone-heng,</hi> very few, or none at all of the Upright stones, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns are <hi>Round,</hi> no nor in any degree related to that figure; but broad and flat, and mostly resembling Parallelipipeds, rather than Cylinders; as the eye witnesseth. So that here is a manifest inconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Figure required indifferently in all the five orders. (2.) Their <hi>Contraction,</hi> or Lessening upward is not Uniform, but rudely various, in some greater, in others less, in none insensible, in all irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular: so as therein likewise they want the due proportion of Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution common to all genuinely figured Columns. (3.) They have no <hi>Pedestals</hi> at all, being set in the ground; which is a third incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. (4.) The Perpendiculars of the Greater Circle are, according to <hi>Mr. Jones</hi> his measure, in altitude 15. foot and Â½, in depth 3. foot, and in breadth seven foot. Where then is to be found the proportion of Longitude to six Diameters of the thickest part of the Column? (5.) Their <hi>Intervalls,</hi> or middle spaces seem to be about nine foot. For, <hi>Mr. Jones</hi> himself computes the length of each <hi>Epistylium,</hi> or <hi>Architrave,</hi> continued in round from Column to Column, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely 16. foot; and there must be half the breadth of the Column, at each end, allowed for the meeting of the two Architraves in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, if not for the more firm bearing of their weight: so that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring the distance of the supporters, by the remaining part of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitrave, it will be nine foot. Which agrees not with the <hi>Intercolum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> of <hi>Tuscan</hi> Pillars. To conclude this paragraph, therefore; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Conditions of the <hi>Tuscan</hi> Order here recited, are not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rules of Architecture taught by <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> and his excellent Interpreter. <hi>Sr. H. Wotton:</hi> or <hi>Mr. Jones</hi> was mistaken, when He conceived the Order of <hi>Stone-heng</hi> to be <hi>Tuscan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(Thirdly,) As for the <hi>Architectonical Scheme, in use among the</hi> Romans, <hi>consisting of four Equilateral Triangles inscribed within a Circle by which He thought the whole work of</hi> Stone-heng <hi>designed and formed;</hi> it is much easier imagined, than demonstrated to be really therein. For (1.) that Rule of <hi>Vitruvius (lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.) to which He referrs us for certification; if you take it intire, and not the later half only, as He cunningly did, runs thus. <hi>Ipsius autom Theatri con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatio sic est facienda, ut quÃ m magna futura est perimetros imi, centro medio collocato circumagatur linea rotundationis; in eaque qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuor</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:48257:23"/>
               <hi>scribantur trigona paribus lateribus &amp; intervallis, quae extremam lineam circinationis tangant, quibus Astrologi, ex musica convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia astrorum, ratiocinantur.</hi> By the very first words whereof it is most manifest, the Rule it self concerns the designation, not of a round Temple, but of a <hi>Theatre;</hi> and the Context of the whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter following declares it to have been invented for a threefold use, namely the most advantageous disposition of the <hi>Proscenium, Scena,</hi> and <hi>Orchestra;</hi> the equal diffusion of the voyces of the Singers and Actors; and the convenient ordering of Seats for the Spectators. But, what's this to <hi>Mr. Jones</hi> his conceipt of a <hi>Temple;</hi> and such a one too, as must bear the Aspect <hi>Hypaethros, sive sub divo, i. e.</hi> open at top? However, conceiving this Text might serve his turn, and the great name of <hi>Vitruvius</hi> give some authority to his Phancy, that otherwise would hardly pass among judicious men; he industriously usurped the quotation of it, by perverting the genuine sense to a wrong purpose; and to the end his Readers might be the longer in finding out the fraud, artificially omitting the citation of the particular Chapter, he leaves them to a tedious research through the whole Book; a labour so great, the patience of most, though Learned, would not extend to the enduring of it, upon so slender an occasion. (2.) The Question is, not whether this kind of Architectonical Scheme were anciently used by the <hi>Romans,</hi> in some of their publick Aedifices; but <hi>whether</hi> Stone-heng <hi>was formed according to such a Scheme, or not? Mr. Jones,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, hath expresly affirmed it: but, how hath he made it appear? That he hath drawn four Equilateral and Equidistant Triangles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the circumference of the Greater Circle of stones, so as all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles are terminated in the circular line, is not sufficient to prove it: forasmuch as every Novice in Geometry understands how to inscribe not onely 4. but 400. and many more such Triangles, in the <hi>area</hi> of a Circle much less in diameter, than that he describes. Nor is it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, that he tell's us, <hi>the intersection of the several Triangles fully demonstrateth after what manner the Greater Hexagon, made open at</hi> Stone-heng, <hi>was raised from the solid wall environing the</hi> Cell <hi>of the</hi> Peripheros: because our sense assures us, there are no foot-steps or remains of any such solid wall of a circular form, raised where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersections of the Triangles are supposed to be made; and because we have no evidence, but his single word, that there is any <hi>Hexagon</hi> at all in the work; whereas, neither <hi>Mr. Camden,</hi> nor the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Nero Caesar,</hi> nor My self, nor any other (for ought I could ever learn, and yet I have enquired of many Gentlemen who had carefully survey'd
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48257:23"/>
the Antiquity, and were well able to discern a Hexagon from a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle) could ever perceive any such matter. Again, though he speaks of <hi>Three Entrances leading into the Temple of</hi> Stone-heng <hi>from the Plain, and those likewise comparated by an Equilateral Triangle:</hi> yet is it manifest even from his own Draughts of the work, and its Platform, that all the Perpendiculars or Columns of the Outward Circle are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distant each from other; and if so, where are those Three Entrances? or how should we distinguish them from the other intercolumniary, or void spaces? All which considered, there remains (as I think) no tye upon any mans belief, that <hi>Stone-heng</hi> was a Roman Structure, in respect of the Scheme, by which it was designed and composed.</p>
            <p>(Fourthly,) As for the <hi>Double Portico reported to be in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Circle, and another within the Greater Hexagon, formed after the Roman fashion in structures of great Magnificence:</hi> that you may be the better able to judge, whether He were in the right, yea or no; give me leave to acquaint You, what a <hi>Portico</hi> properly is, what the <hi>Roman</hi> Architects called a <hi>Double Portico,</hi> and what <hi>Mr. Jones</hi> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>Porticoes</hi> in this place. <hi>Vitruvius (lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 9) setting down precepts for the construction of <hi>Porticoes</hi> belonging to a Theatre, begins his discourse thus. <q> 
                  <hi>Post scenam Porticus sunt constituendae, uti cum imbres repente ludos interpellaverint, habeat populus, quo se reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piat ex theatro:</hi> Behind the Scene are to be made Porticoes, to the end the people may have whither to withdraw themselves out of the Theatre, when suddain showrs disturb their sports.</q> And <hi>Philander</hi> commenting upon these words, saith thus; <q>
                  <hi>Porticus additae sunt sacris aedibus, illustrium virorum domibus, &amp; publicis aedificiis, necessitatis, aut ornamenti, animive caussa; sub eis repentinas pluvias vitabant, um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>br as ac frigora captabant, variis sermontbus diem consumebant, a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridie solem hyeme, a septentrione aestivas umbras excipientes:</hi>  To sacred buildings, to the houses of great personages, and to publique aedifices are added Porches, for necessity, or ornament, or delight; under them they sheltred themselves from suddain rains, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired for shade and coolness, and talked away the day; receiving Sunshine from the south in winter, and in summer shadow from the north.</q> From whence it is most cleer, most certain, that all Porticoes are additional structures, wherein men may be protected from rain and sun; such as the memorable Porticoes of <hi>Apollo Palatinus,</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus in campo Martio,</hi> of the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> of the <hi>Capitol</hi> on the side of the <hi>Capitoline</hi> hill, in <hi>Rome.</hi> Of these Porticoes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48257:24"/>
               <hi>some</hi> are made with <hi>parietibus continuis,</hi> solid walls on one side, and Pillars on the other; as in all <hi>Peristylia,</hi> or paved walks enclosed with Columns, such as the costly Palace of <hi>Urbin</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> is adorned with, such as the <hi>Cloysters</hi> in Monasteries, such as the walks under the <hi>Old Exchange,</hi> and those commonly called the <hi>Piazzaes</hi> of <hi>Covent-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Others</hi> consist of solid walls on both sides, with rowes of Pillars set at distance from the walls; of which sort we have a glorious exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the <hi>Portico</hi> at the west end of <hi>St. Pauls</hi> Church, in designing and raising of which <hi>Mr. Jones</hi> himself was principal Architect. But <hi>all</hi> are <hi>Tectae,</hi> Roofed or covered at top; otherwise how should they satisfie the use or end for which they were intended, namely to shelter men from excessive heat in summer, and from wet weather in all sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the year? As for <hi>Double Porticoes,</hi> they are no wayes different from single ones, except in this only, that they have a double order or range of Columns. For, <hi>Philander</hi> interpreting these words of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius (loco citato) circa theatra sunt Porticus &amp; ambulationes, quae videntur it a oportere collocari, uti duplices sint, habeantque exteriores columnas Doricas, cum Epistyliis &amp; ornamentis, ex ratione modula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis Doricae perfect as;</hi> expresly saith, <hi>Porticus Duplices appellatae sunt a duplici columnarum ordine,</hi> Porches are termed Double, from the double order of Pillars, of which they are composed. And these, doubtless, are the adaequate notions of Porticoes, both simple, and double: and what every man understands, when he hears them spoken of. But what <hi>Mr. Jones</hi> intendeth by Porticoes in <hi>Stone-heng;</hi> is difficult to be conceived from his own discourse; and more difficult to be found in the work it self: so that we are confined to the liberty of conjecturing. By the double Portico, therefore, in the outward Circle or wing of stones; He means either the double row of Pillars set in round, of which the inner consisteth of smaller stones, such as he compares to <hi>Pillasters:</hi> or the space between each two Columns, with an <hi>Architrave</hi> over head. If the <hi>first;</hi> then it may be demanded, why the inner order of Columns are not equal in altitude to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as they ought to have been by <hi>Vitruvius</hi> directions, and as they alwayes were in Roman double Porticoes? and why is one order co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Architraves, the other not? If the <hi>other;</hi> it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, the Portico then can be but single, contrary to what it is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be. The same may be said likewise of the other Portico imagined in the Greater Hexagon. But, whatever part of the Fabrique He fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied to be a Portico; thus much is evident, that it will not afford de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence against the injuries of immoderate heat or rain; and therefore
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48257:24"/>
deserves not that Title, in strictness of speech. And it seems, He that took the liberty so to call it, was put to a hard shift to blanch over the singularity of his conceipt: For, striving to assert it, to be customary among the old <hi>Roman</hi> Architects, to form the like Porticoes in their Temples, and more particularly in such Temples, as properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Aspect <hi>Hypaethros,</hi> or were Roofless; rather than want the Patronage of <hi>Vitruvius</hi> in the case, he was forced to deprave the Text he alleged toward his defence. The words there lying in this order, <hi>(lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>sub finem) Reliqua omnia eadem habent quae Dypteros, sed interiore parte columnas in altitudine duplices, remotas Ã  parietibus ad circuitionem (ut porticus) Peristyliorum:</hi> not as He <hi>(pag.</hi> 70.) unfaithfully recites them, thus (observe I pray) <hi>Hypaethros in interiore parte habet columnas remotas Ã  parietibus, ad circuitionem (ut porticus) Peristyliorum;</hi> adding and omitting what he thought fit. A course highly disingenious, and in the end as highly scandalous. For, whoso usurps the licence of falsifying the Text of any Author, much more of one so grave and oraculous, as <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> whatever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he imagines may arise from thence to his private opinion, in case the imposture be not detected: certainly it cannot countervail that shame and discredit that inevitably follows, when the judicious and examining Reader shall come, by having recourse to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, to find how grosly he might have been deluded, had he trusted to the Quotation. And <hi>he that makes no scruple to impose an error, by corrupting another's Doctrine, forfeits the credit he expects to his own, and is almays to be suspected of partiality to his Tenents, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where he broacheth Novelties, and venteth them upon no other Reputation, but that of his single testimony.</hi> It is but justice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if meeting with nothing in our Antiquity, that answers to any form of Porticoes, which, as Appendages to their Temples, were antiently erected by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and described by <hi>Vitruvius;</hi> nor having any other obligation to grant the being of any Portico there, besides Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> his bare conjecture, and that upon grounds obscure and fallible: I say, it is but justice if we suspect, that He onely ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd them to be such.</p>
            <p n="5">(5) As for the <hi>Artifice, or Manner of Workmanship</hi> shewn in <hi>Stone-heng,</hi> by which you are to understand onely the placing of the Upright Stones, answerable to Columns; most true it is, indeed, the old <hi>Romans</hi> used to set the Columns of publique Fabriques, at so much the less distance one from another, by how much greater the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48257:25"/>
Columns were in Diameter, naming that particular kind of range, <hi>Pycnostylos,</hi> i. e. <hi>Crebris Columnis,</hi> the <hi>close</hi> order, from the close or thick standing of the Pillars. Nor is it less true, that in our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, the Perpendiculars, though extraordinary great in compass, have their intercolumnary spaces little in comparison; because of the weight of the incumbent Architrave, which might otherwise break of it self. And yet nevertheless I think it scarce warrantable thence to conclude, those Perpendiculars were erected by a <hi>Roman</hi> Artist. For, if you consult <hi>Vitruvius (lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.) about the true proportions of the Close order; you may soon be informed by him in these few words:  <q>
                  <hi>Pycnostylos est, cujus intercolumnio unius &amp; dimidiatae co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnae crassitudo interponi potest;</hi> The <hi>Pycnostyles</hi> is that, where the Intercolumnium, or Intervall, is equal to the thickness, and half the thickness of the Column it self.</q> To whom <hi>Bernaldinus Baldus</hi> fully assents, in his explanation of the word <hi>Pycnostylos, (Lexic.

After, perchance, you may give ear to my conjecture, That the Builder had respect chiefly to the length of the overthwart Stones, placing the Supporters accordingly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other consideration or precept of Art, rather of Necessity, than Choice: and that if he could have been furnished with Stones fit for Architraves, of larger dimensions in length and depth, (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they could not have born their own gravity) in all likelihood he had proportionably enlarged the spaces of the Columns; it being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he made use of the greatest Stones he could get, of both sorts. But this is not material; it being sufficient, that the Rule of the <hi>Pyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nostylos</hi> was not exactly followed in the position of the Columns at <hi>Stone-heng;</hi> and consequently, that the Manner is not <hi>Roman,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> would perswade.</p>
            <p n="6">(6) As for the manner of <hi>fixing the Architraves upon the head of the Perpendiculars by Tenons and Morteses;</hi> that likewise seems but an uncertain sign of <hi>Roman</hi> Masonry. For, those Architraves being to be placed <hi>in Aequilibrio,</hi> so as the point of Rest at each end ought to be there, where the weight was found equal on each side: all the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48257:25"/>
Workman had to do toward their continuance in that posture, was, to contrive so to fasten them, as that no force of wind or tempest, nor any other (unless extreme) violence, by diminishing the gravity on one side, might incline or sway them to sink down on the other; which could not otherwise be effected, but by corroborating the <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> by Tenons made in the Supporters, and let into holes or Morteses in the Architrave, no kind of Morter or Cement being strong enough for that purpose. And thus much common reason might teach the Masons, without any great skill in Geometry, or hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recourse to either the Rules or Patterns of <hi>Roman</hi> Architecture. Which, perhaps, was the cause why <hi>Vitruvius</hi> spake so little of this way of confirming great stones in buildings, as taking it for granted, the contrivement was so plain and obvious to men, even of but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon understanding, as that it was needless for him to insist upon any Precepts concerning it: For, all I can meet with in his whole Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, relating thereunto, is onely a slight, transitory, and obscure touch, <hi>(lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.) which is this, <hi>Quod si quis noluerit in id vitium incidere, medio cavo servato secundÃ¹m Orthostratas intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, ex rubro saxo quadrato, aut ex testa, aut silicibus ordinariis, struat bipedales parietes, &amp; cum ansis ferreis, &amp; plumbo frontes vinctae sint: it a enim non acervatim, sed ordine structum opus poterit esse sine vitio sempiternum, quÃ²d cubilia &amp; coagmenta eorum inter se se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia, &amp; juncturis alligata non protrudent opus, ne<expan>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> in the close of his Discourse concerning <hi>Stone-heng,</hi> makes report of a certain Table, or plate of Metall, as it had been Tin and Lead commixt, found in or by the Monument, in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the viij. whereon were engraven many Letters, but in so strange a Character, that neither <hi>Sir Thomas Eliot,</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> Schoolmaster of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> could tell what to make of it; and so took no care to preserve it. Now certain it is, this Inscription was not left by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who generally wrote all their Memorials in their own Language, whose Character hath long out-lasted their Empire, continuing the same in all Ages; as appears even by their Coins of greatest Antiquity, and all their Monumental Epigraphs, of which <hi>Camden</hi> hath collected a great number, such as have been found in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Gruterus</hi> a large volume of others, dispers'd not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48257:26"/>
onely through <hi>Italy,</hi> but all parts of the Earth, where ever the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle pearch'd. Nor doth it appear to have been either <hi>Greek,</hi> or <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or <hi>British,</hi> or <hi>Saxon;</hi> because all these Languages, and their several Characters, were well known to Sir <hi>Thomas Eliot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> who were excellent Linguists, and good Antiquaries, as the yet living Fame of one, and Writings of the other testifie. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, therefore, that these were <hi>Barbarous</hi> Characters: and if so, what hinders, but that we may guess them to be <hi>Litterae Runicae, sive Gothicae,</hi> the <hi>Runic</hi> or <hi>Gothic</hi> Characters, such as were constantly used by the <hi>Danes</hi> in all their antique monumental Inscriptions, or Engravements? Especially since <hi>John Speed,</hi> in his Description of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> writes, That <hi>near</hi> Exmore <hi>are certain remains of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Work, namely, mighty Stones, set some in form of a Triangle, others in round, orderly disposed; and that upon one of them was an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravement in</hi> Danish <hi>Letters, which could not be read by men most learned.</hi> And that grave and universally learned man, <hi>Olaus Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,</hi> (Physician to the present King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and not above four years past deceased, and who hath vouchsafed sometimes to honour me with his Epistles) in his first Book, <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>de Monumentis Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicis,</hi> taketh special notice of this Inscription, and deploreth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate loss of it, with <hi>Utinam bono publico communicatum fuisset; sorsan de rebus praeclaris Ã  nostratibus ibidem gestis testaretur.</hi> That the <hi>Danes</hi> of old, affecting (as all other Nations of the world, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever rude and illiterate) to perpetuate the remembrance of their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table actions and successes, delighted to raise Monuments of their Battels, Victories, and other Atchievments, as also of their Kings, principal Commanders, and great Persons; and leave short Records of the particular occasions of those Monuments, ingraven in <hi>Runic</hi> Letters; besides this, that they had none but the <hi>Gothic</hi> Language in use among them, is manifest from the testimony of <hi>Saxo Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi> who <hi>(in Praefation.

            <p>Again, This our Monument consisteth wholly of Stones <hi>unwrought, rough,</hi> and <hi>rude,</hi> as they lay in their beds of earth, (their <hi>Tenons</hi> and <hi>Morteses</hi> onely excepted) and of such various shapes, that the most curious eye can scarcely find a perfect similitude in any two of them: and Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> ought to have evinced, either by Testimonies authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, or by Examples, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had ever raised any publick Structure of the like Materials; which being above his power (as I conceive at least) he warily omitted to attempt it, as he did the proof of many other particulars equally important toward the verification of his grand Position. Whereas <hi>Olaus Wormius</hi> hath been so liberal in his Contributions toward the maintenance of my Supposition, as to furnish me with not onely verbal Descriptions, but lively Draughts or Pictures also of sundry Antique <hi>Danish</hi> Monuments, as well in the Bulk and Rudeness of the Stones, as in the Order and Manner of their position and situation, much resembling our <hi>Stone-heng;</hi> and (as may be not obscurely collected from a Conference of Times, Actions, Histories, Ruines, &amp;c.) not much different as to Antiquity. And this I think an Argument not unworthy your serious consideration; if not weighty enough to counterpoise all the reasons urged by Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> to enforce his Dream, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of <hi>Stone-heng.</hi>

(1) From the spacious <hi>Court</hi> lying round about it, agreeing with those of <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatrous Temples, wherein Beasts brought for Victims were slain, and into which none but Priests might enter. To which it may be objected, first, That the void space betwixt the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Circumvallation or Trench, in <hi>Stone-heng,</hi> and the Building it self, doth not exactly correspond with the <hi>Atria</hi> of <hi>Roman</hi> Structures; and therefore cannot, without corrupting the severe Dialect of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitects, be termed a <hi>Court.</hi> For, whoso attentively peruseth <hi>Vitru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> his Discourse <hi>De Atriis, (lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.) will soon perceive, that He by the word <hi>Atrium,</hi> constantly means <hi>primum aedificium, quod anteriori janua intrantibus occurrit,</hi> the first Building that offers it self to the sight of those who enter by the fore-gate: And <hi>Bernal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinus Baldus,</hi> in his Note upon the first line of that Chapter, saith, <hi>Arbitramur nos vetera Atria, nostrarum aedium parti illi respondere, quam vulgo</hi> Anditum <hi>dicimus,</hi> Andatam, Caminatamve; <hi>quae qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem prima post ingressum ostii introgredientibus occurrit; ea<expan>

Again, Indulging Him the liberty of our vulgar phrase, according to which the <hi>Area,</hi> or plot of ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Building and its Boundaries, may rightly enough be call'd a Court: yet, where is the necessity, yea, where the probability, that that Court was originally design'd and marck'd out for a place for the slaughter of Victims? Must all Structures environed with such <hi>Areae</hi> be Temples? or all <hi>Roman</hi> Temples be accommodated with the like out-lets?

For, these are destitute of all outward circumvallation or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment. But the force of this Argument depends, perhaps, upon its conspiracy with its fellows; and therefore, if from them all put together, it shall appear, that our Monument was intended for a Temple; I shall no longer doubt, whether the void space of ground within the Trench be the Court belonging to it.</p>

(2) From a large Stone, 16 feet long and 4 broad, appearing not much above the surface of the earth, in the Eastern part of the lesser Hexagon, which He takes for an <hi>Altar.</hi> Whereunto I cannot assent, for two considerations. First, the Humility of the Altar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys the supposed Dedication of the Temple. For, the Rule of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius,</hi> how Altars ought to be placed in Temples, so as to carry a due Decorum, and visible Analogie to the nature and proprieties of that particular Deity therein to be worshipped, is this, <hi>(lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.) <hi>Altitudines Ararum sic sunt explicandae, ut Jovi, omnibus<expan>

So that, this Stone was either no Altar at all, or not ordained for Oblations to the god <hi>Coelus.</hi> If it be objected, that the Stone perhaps was set <hi>upright;</hi> I answer, Then it was as much too <hi>narrow</hi> on the top, for the use assign'd, as now too <hi>low</hi> for the God to whom it is ascribed. Secondly, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Jones,</hi> in his Description of the Monument (as you may remember) speaks of three open <hi>Entrances</hi> leading from the Plain into the work it self, the most conspicuous of which lay <hi>North-East:</hi> which is openly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the custome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who always made the grand Entrance into the Temple, whatever it were, <hi>Ã¨ regione AltÃ¡ris &amp; Signi,</hi> in that part, which was directly opposite to the place where the Altar and Statue stood erected; and the reason was, <hi>Ut adoratum venientes Divinitatem suspicerent,</hi> That the people coming up to make their adoration, might at their entrance have both Altar and Image in front, so as to behold them at first elevation of their eyes.

            <p>(Thirdly,) From the <hi>use of the ancient</hi> Romans <hi>to erect the like Round Temples, that lay open without Walls, surrounded only with Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and uncovered also on the top, or Roofless.</hi> Which being his part to prove, and he finding it impossible; he betook himself to multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Fictions, confusion of things cleerly distinct, and other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenious shifts; such as have indeed amuzed and imposed upon vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar heads, but can never convince the Learned and judicious, who are not ignorant, how strictly constant the <hi>Roman</hi> Architects were to their set Forms and Orders of Building, upon no occasion commixing or confounding them in publique structures, especially sacred ones, where the passenger was to be instructed at first sight, what Deity was adored within, by the peculiar forme of the Temple apparent without; that so he might prepare and address his devotion accordingly, without being mistaken either in the Object, or ceremonies of it. But, let us not judge Him unheard. He allegeth, out of <hi>Vitruvius (lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.) that the <hi>Romans</hi> had round Temples of two divers Forms: whereof the one, named <hi>Monopteros,</hi> had neither continued walls about, nor Cell within, but was encompassed only with a round of Columns; the ther, termed <hi>Peripteros,</hi> had a Cell enclosed with a continued wall,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48257:29"/>
and Columns set at convenient distance, so as to make a Portico round about on the outside. And this I allow to be true: but what though? our <hi>Stone-heng</hi> resembles neither of these Forms: not the <hi>Monopteros,</hi> because it hath a <hi>Cell,</hi> as Himself supposeth; not the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripteros,</hi> because it wants a continued <hi>wall</hi> to incompass that Cell, as our eyes witness. Where then is the Similitude and Conformity? Why, rather than fail, our Author shall adventure to make that like to both, which really is like to neither. For stealing the outward Circle from the <hi>Monopteros,</hi> and the Cell from the <hi>Peripteros,</hi> and then again surrounding that same Cell (not with a Circle, as he ought, but) with a <hi>Hexagon</hi> of Pillars: of both Forms He makes a <hi>Third,</hi> not being able to withhold from confessing (so much had the joy of his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, transported him) in the end, that it was a <hi>New Invention,</hi> which yet he needed not to have told us. So here you find him guilty of a double fault; confounding of two perfectly and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileably distinct Forms of sacred Edifices; and converting a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, the essential and proper figure of all such Cells, as belonged to the <hi>Peripteros,</hi> into a <hi>Hexagon.</hi> Is this fair and candid dealing, think you, in a man of Letters? Doth it become one of the most famous Architects of our age, thus to build Castles in the air, and flye to a sanctuary made up of Fictions? But this is not all. From a strange and unheard of confusion of several Forms, He proceeds to blend toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also several <hi>Orders</hi> of consecrated Buildings. For, He will have the Order, of which his Temple of <hi>Stone-heng</hi> must consist, to be partly <hi>Tuscan,</hi> partly <hi>Corinthian:</hi> affirming, that <hi>as the plainness and solidness of the</hi> Tuscan <hi>order, appears eminently through the whole Work, so the narrowness of the spaces betwixt the Stones, visibly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the delicacy and softness of the</hi> Corinthian. Where (not to take notice of the manifest contradiction in the very terms) He incurrs a grand Error, in commixing, in one Temple, two so different Orders; when, by his own confession, <hi>(pag.</hi> 90.) <hi>the</hi> Romans <hi>had for each of their Deities a certain particular Order of Temples, and observed that distinction of Orders so strictly, that they seldome or never varied them.</hi> According to that of <hi>Vitruvius, (lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>) Non omnibus Diis iisdem rationibus aedes sunt faciendae, quÃ²d alius alia varietate sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Religionum habet effectus.</hi> And had they not done so, How could the <hi>Roman</hi> Architects of old, have been able, at first sight, to judge to what Divinity this or that Fane was peculiarly devoted? or, How could the Modern Architects of <hi>Italy,</hi> at this Day, by seeing onely the ruines of them, give such probable conjectures, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48257:29"/>
their antiquity and proper Dedication, as are very hardly to be contradicted? But, why am I thus prodigal of my time and pains, in shaking an opinion, that hath no foundation of either Precept, or Precedent from antient Architecture? especially when the Founder Himself was forced to excuse the fragility and weakness thereof, with this Plea; <hi>The learned in Antiquities very well know, those things, which oblivion hath so long removed out of mind, are hardly to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.

            <p n="4">(4 And lastly) <hi>From the Heads of Bulls, or Oxen, of Harts, and other such Beasts, digged up in or near this Antiquity;</hi> as if no man could imagine other, but those were the Heads of such Beasts, as were antiently made Holocausts in that place. Why, is it not equally probable, they might be the skulls of Cattel slain for the sustenance of some one or other of those many Armies, that encamped on the adjacent Plain, where the Lines of their Entrenchments and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses are yet visible? Was it not a common thing for Armies to carry along with them whole Herds of Beasts for their Provision, and to bury the bones of such as they killed, in places somewhat remote from their Camps? And, as for Harts; it is well known, both by tradition among the Inhabitants of the neighbouring Villages, and by other testimonies yet remaining, that all the Plain from <hi>Stone-heng</hi> to <hi>Ambresbury,</hi> was, till within these 200 yeares, a Forest full of great Trees: and therefore not improbable, but the Heads of Deer might lie there, without any relation at all to <hi>Stone-heng.</hi> But grant them to be the Offall or Resiques of Sacrifices; yet what reason, they should be <hi>Roman</hi> Sacrifices, when the <hi>Danes</hi> also used the like, as may appear from what I lately delivered out of <hi>Olaus Wormius,</hi> of the custome of that Nation to offer Beasts in Sacrifice to the Ghosts of their deceased Commanders, upon their Sepulchral Monuments? This Argument, therefore, being as invalid as the rest, and altogether very unsatisfactory: it plainly appears; that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Jones</hi> his Imagination had too powerful an Influence over his Reason, when He judged, upon such slender Evidences, that our Antiquity was antiently a <hi>Roman</hi> Temple.</p>

Here let us make a stand for a minute or two, and reflect upon a few particulars that offer themselves to our observation. <hi>First,</hi> these two Sepulchral Monuments are situate in <hi>Campis patentibus,</hi> in open and spatious fields; a cleer evidence, the <hi>Danes</hi> (as many other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) anciently used to bury in large and wide plains. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they threw up mounts of Earth over their dead: and those of two sorts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the qualities of the persons inhumed. For, of these <hi>Tumuli,</hi> such as were simple and naked, served to denote the interrment of Common Souldiers, together with their inferior officers, slain in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel upon the place: but those compassed about with great stones, set in single, double, or treble order, were designed to conserve the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of great Captains or Generals. For, <hi>Wormius</hi> touching upon these <hi>Tumuli,</hi> left this remark concerning their Distinction. <hi>Qui ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diores sunt, ex sola terra in rotunditatem &amp; conum congest a constant; ex iis, qui una vel multiplici Saxorum serie circa basin cinguntur, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercituum Imperatoribus, aliisque Magnatibus dicati creduntur; ut Simplices nullis ornati lapidibus, militibus strenuis, &amp; athlet is de pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria bene meritis.</hi> Howsoever, in those Martial times, when no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue could render any man noble or great, but Fortitude, and Honour lay in the strength rather of the Arm, than of the Head; the Armies of this Nation constantly preferred monuments of mighty stones, much above those <hi>Tumuli,</hi> or (as we call them) <hi>Burrows;</hi> nor ever entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the fame of their Worthies to such simple and homely conservato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but only in places where Rocks and Quarries were scarce. This we learn from a very remarkable text in the Commentaries of <hi>Petrus Lindebergius. Sciendum autem, quÃ²d Dani, cum propter defectum saxorum Pyramides ac Obeliscos extruere minime potuerint, olim in memoriam Regum &amp; Heroum suorum ex terra coacervata ingentem molem montis instar eminentem statuerint.</hi> From whence it is very plain, that the old <hi>Danes</hi> used not to inhume their Chieftains and highest Commanders under Tombs of Earth, but in case of necessity, where neither the place of the battel, in which they were slain (if they dyed in war) not the Country neer it, afforded them stones of dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions fit for Pyramids and Obelisques. Otherwise they made use of stones of the largest size they could possibly get: sparing no pains nor cost to raise them up into the most magnificent Fabriques, their little skill in Architecture could amount to. Hereupon <hi>Wormius; Aetatis progressu plus operae in Magnatum tumulis positum videtur.

Erant,</hi> saith He, <hi>Magnatum Danicorum sepulturae in sylvis &amp; agris, tumulosque aggestis lapidibus vestientes muniebant; quod genus complures passim adhuc visuntur, qui Gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Strata vocantur.</hi> Mark here the near affinity of the very Name; <hi>Stone-heng</hi> being by all our Authors, who have mentioned it, called <hi>Chorea Gigantum,</hi> the Giants Dance, and the most magnificent Stony Monuments of the <hi>Danish</hi> Princes, <hi>Strata Gigantum,</hi> the Giants pavements or paths. The <hi>last</hi> observable is, that in many of their Sepulchral piles they placed an Altar; <hi>eo fine,</hi> saith <hi>Wormius, ut ibidem in memoriam defuncti quotannis sacra peragantur;</hi> that they might yearly offer sacrifices to the defunct, at least in memory of them, upon the place of their inhumation. Of this we have a sufficient confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a note of <hi>Ubbo Emmius, (lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Histor. Fris. pag.</hi> 21.)  <q>

Nam jacentibus nonnullis, alia iis imposita sunt plana, relictumque foramen, per quod reptare homo pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit:</hi> it deserves commemoration, that in this Country are found multitudes of Stones congested of so vast masses, that you would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them impossible to be removed by any Engines, by any the greatest strength of Men; and so disposed, as to represent Altars. For upon the heads of some, others are imposed, of a plain figure, and a hole or empty space left underneath, through which a man may creep.</q> Nor ought it to seem so singular and strange a piece of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstirion, for a phlegmatique and dull-headed Northern Nation, to set up Altars in the midst of such ampse and massive Tombs: when Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples themselves first grew up out of meaner Sepulchres, even among the Grecians. This perhaps, you'l smile at, as a paradox; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behooves me to produce some credible Authority to assert it. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus (in Protreptico)</hi> is the man, who both expresly avoucheth it, and brings several Instances to prove it, thus. <hi>Superstitio templa condere persuasit.

               </p>
               <p>For a <hi>Fourth,</hi> I have, among many others, chosen the notable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of King <hi>Harald Hyldetand</hi> (whose courage, continency, and wisedome, together with his happy successes in warr, are highly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by <hi>Saxo Grammaticus)</hi> which yet remains neer <hi>Lethra,</hi> or <hi>Leire,</hi> in <hi>Seland,</hi> anciently the seat of Kings, now a decaid obscure village: <hi>saxis grandioribus stipatum, in meditullio immensa mole qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drata, minoribus aliis innixa exornatum;</hi> compassed about with stones of extraordinary greatness, and in the middle ennobled with one Square stone, or rock, of an immense bulk, resting upon the heads of others of inferior magnitude; whose picture, though in too small a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule, is taken also by our Author.</p>
               <p>Now, from the various structure of these four grand Sepulchres, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which doth fully quadrate with other; it is manifest, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were not strict in observing any such set form of placing their stones, that might at first view distinguish them from other Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; unless in this onely, that the Exterior Muniment or pale of great stones was commonly either exactly square, or neerly approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that regular figure. And yet sometimes they varied from that also, as <hi>Wormius</hi> himself confesseth.

               <p>As these Courts of Justice were rude in their Fabrique, so for many Ages together, were the ways of <hi>Trial</hi> practised in them. For, from <hi>Frotho Magnus,</hi> who swayed the <hi>Danish</hi> Sceptre, about the most happy time of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Nativity, down along until the Reign of <hi>Suenotto,</hi> in the year of our Lord 986. all weighty and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult controversies were decided <hi>per Monomachiam,</hi> by Duel; the Defendant being obliged to combat the Plaintiff openly within the lists of the Court, and prove the goodness of his cause by the sharpness of his weapons, without other Advocate but his own courage. A very savage and unequal manner of trial this! where always the Sword of Justice was put into the hand of the Criminal, where many times Right had no Vindication but from Fortune, and the most Innocent, if overcome, was either to die upon the place of his purgation, or, what's more grievous, to become Slave to his unjust Accuser. Yet men were hereto bound by a severe Law, made by the said <hi>Frotho,</hi> and recited by <hi>Saxo Grammaticus, (Hist. Danic. lib.</hi> 5.). After, the Beams of the Christian Faith shining on those northern Nations, and in some degree overcoming the gloominess of their barbarous Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Customes; that Law was abrogated, and in the place of Duels, the somewhat less cruel, but not much less uncertain way of Trial <hi>per Ordelium,</hi> by <hi>Fire-Ordeal,</hi> succeeded; and was continued in the same Courts, till about the year of Christ 1350. it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by a decree of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, and an Edict of King <hi>Woldemarus</hi> II. an Extract of which you may find in <hi>Wormius, (Monum. Danic. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.) Then began all causes to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the judgment of twelve <hi>Jurors,</hi> as here with us in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> not but this way was much more antient, (for it is ascribed to <hi>Regnerus</hi> sirnamed <hi>Lodbrog,</hi> who ruled in <hi>Denmark</hi> about the year of Christ 820; and as some <hi>Danish</hi> Writers boast, was derived from him to our <hi>Etheldred)</hi> but it seems not to have been either by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal custome established, or by strict and penal Laws enforced, so as totally to exclude the <hi>Ordeal</hi> in all cases, until the said <hi>Woldemarus</hi> his days. And <hi>Harald</hi> the vij<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, after the abolition of Duels, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a new, but pernicious manner of determining contentions, by which the Party accused might purge himself of whatever Crime charged upon him, <hi>Solo juramenti sacramento,</hi> by onely his own single Oath, <hi>id<expan>

               <p>These were, indeed, always designed by Great stones, but not constant to any one Figure, so as to be thereby alone distinguishable, without the help of Tradition.

               <p>In the Diocess of <hi>Bergen,</hi> on a wide mountainous place, near a Village, called <hi>Tysnes,</hi> you may, with a delightful wonder, behold six stones of an incredible magnitude, resembling Pyramids, erected at equal distances, in two semi-circles, one within another; each en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with two entire circles of lesser stones of Oval figure; and in the middle of the intercolumnary spaces in each semi-circle, a great multitude of the like stones heaped one upon another, till they amount toward a Cone: and all in a most elegant order, set up in memory of a bloody Battel fought upon the place; as the people of the Country report by hear-say from their fore-fathers, though their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations differ in many circumstantial particulars.

The neighbour Inhabitants term them <hi>Hurlers;</hi> as being by a devout and godly error perswaded, they had been Men sometimes transformed into Stones, for profaning the Lord's Day with hurling the Ball. Others would have it to be a Trophy or Monument, in memorial of some Battel.</q> And so doubtless this was, and not improbably left by the <hi>Danes.</hi>

                  <q>Not far from <hi>Burford,</hi> upon the very border of <hi>Oxford-shire,</hi> is an antient Monument, to wit, certain huge stones placed in a circle. The common people call them <hi>Roll-rich stones,</hi> and dream they were sometimes Men, by a miraculous Metamorphosis turned into hard stones. The Draught of them, such as it is, pourtraied long since, here I represent unto your view. For, without all form, and shape they be, unequal, and by long continuance of time much impaired. The highest of them all, which without the Circle look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the earth, they call the King; because he should have been King of <hi>England</hi> (forsooth) if he had once seen <hi>Long Compton,</hi> a little Town lying beneath, and which one may see, if he go some few paces forward: other five, standing at the other side, touching as it were one another, they imagine to have been Knights mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Horseback; and the rest the Army. These would I verily think to have been the Monument of some Victory, and haply erected by <hi>Rollo</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> who afterward conquered <hi>Normandy.</hi> For, what time He with his <hi>Danes</hi> troubled <hi>England</hi> with depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, we read, that the <hi>Danes</hi> joyned Battel with the <hi>English</hi> thereby, at <hi>Hoch Norton;</hi> a place for no one thing more famous in old time, than for the woful slaughter of the <hi>English</hi> in that fough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten field, under the Reign of King <hi>Edward the Elder.</hi>

And for a perpetual memory of this Victory, you may find very many great stones in that country erected after the antique manner upon hillocks, in those places wherein He had been Conqueror, with these words engraven,</hi> Hic fuit Victor Haraldus: <hi>Here was Harald Canqueror.</hi> Now these being sufficient instances of <hi>Danique</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal Monuments, it remains onely that we search after some of their <hi>Loca Comitialia,</hi> or</p>

For, there were not then, as now a dayes, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain appointed places for that affair; but such were chosen, at the pleasure and judgment of those, who excelled others in authority and power. Upon the stones brought hither, those to whom the right of electing was delegated, mounting up, delivered their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages, the people standing round about below.</q> The same in every particular is confirmed by the learned <hi>Stephanus Stephanius,</hi> in his Commentaries upon the first Book of <hi>Saxo Grammaticus</hi> his History of <hi>Denmark;</hi> whither I remit the unsatisfied.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Examples</hi> of this noblest and most magnificent sort of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents; <hi>Olaus Wormius</hi> hath furnished us with Three very conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous ones; one in <hi>Seland,</hi> neer <hi>Leire,</hi> called <hi>Kongstolon,</hi> or Kings throne; another in <hi>Schoneland,</hi> not far from <hi>Lundie,</hi> in which homage was annually paid to King <hi>Olaus,</hi> and <hi>Christianus</hi> the first was with royal solemnity inaugurated and invested with regal ornaments; a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48257:37"/>
third neer <hi>Viburg,</hi> in the <hi>Cimbric</hi> territory, in which common tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will have <hi>Dane</hi> the first to have been likewise elected, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hroned, as the name <hi>Danerliung,</hi> which to this day it bears, seems to witness. And the reason he gives, why there is one in each of these three Provinces, is, that anciently they were distinct Principalities, and under the dominion of as many petty Kings; though now redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced under the soveraignty of a Monarch, the present King of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor are we destitute of the like in <hi>England.</hi> For, in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> on a large plain, called <hi>Biscaw Woun,</hi> near a village named <hi>St. Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> stand erected, in a circle, nineteen huge stones, distant each from the other about twelve foot; with one stone far higher and greater than the rest in the Centre. Which though <hi>Camden</hi> supposeth to be some Trophy left by the <hi>Romans,</hi> under the later Emperors; or else by <hi>Athelstane</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi> when he had subdued the <hi>Cornish</hi> men: yet considering, on one side, that the <hi>Romans</hi> used not to eternize their victories here, or else where, by any such Trophies; and, on the other, that there was a time, when the <hi>Danes</hi> also had not only <hi>Cornwall,</hi> but all <hi>England</hi> beside, under their barbarous subjection; and that this Monument doth in all particulars correspond with the Courts of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections Royal in <hi>Denmark,</hi> of which I am now speaking; considering this, I say, no reason appears to the contrary, but I may assent to the opinion of <hi>Wormius,</hi> that it was, after a great defeat of the English <hi>Saxons,</hi> by his Country-men, erected for the Election of their own King, and the investiture of him with the soveraignty of his newly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Principality.</p>
               <p>Here, perhaps, You'l be a little surpriz'd, if I adventure to make our <hi>Stone-heng</hi> it self bring up the rear of this last and most Gigantique division of <hi>Danique</hi> Antiquities. But, it is my Conjecture; the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate scope of my so laborious Enquiry; the point in which all the lines of this long discourse concentre. Wherefore, having now at length brought you to a place, where You may at once behold the strength of all those several Reasons, that conspired to suggest that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to me: it is fit I should draw them together in as small a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, as I can, and so present them to your consideration, while what hath been delivered both of all the <hi>Danish</hi> Unletter'd Monuments in general, and in particular of their <hi>Courts for Election of Kings,</hi> is yet fresh in your memory. And this, I conceive, may be most concisely,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48257:37"/>
and most advantagiously effected, by way of Parallel, or Comparison, in this plain and easie Method.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thus far, You see, the <hi>Parallel</hi> holds in all particulars, even to a high degree of Resemblance; there being no one thing in the <hi>Antique Courts of Parliament</hi> yet remaining in <hi>Denmark,</hi> which is not to be found also in our <hi>Stone-heng.</hi> Somethings, I must acknowledge, are observed in <hi>This,</hi> more than in <hi>those:</hi> and lest I might be thought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-favourable and partial to my own Conceipt; if I should omit to note them; I shall particularly observe what they are.</p>
               <p>The <hi>First</hi> apparent Difference, then, consists in this; that <hi>in</hi> Stone-heng <hi>the number of stones is much greater.</hi> Which notwithstanding may without much difficulty or straining be reconciled, by reflecting upon the Examples of the Courts of Elections Royal in <hi>Denmark,</hi> newly alleged. For, though <hi>Ol. Wormius</hi> saith, that those consisted for the most part of twelve huge stones set upright, after the manner of Pyramids, or Columns, in the circumference of a Circle, and one, more eminent, in the Centre: yet so far is he from confining all of the same sort to that, or any other definite number, that he brings several instances of some that came short of, and others that much exceeded it. So that from thence we may safely collect, that in old time the <hi>Danes</hi> made their <hi>Courts</hi> of this Kind, sometimes of fewer, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of more Columns; according to the scarcity, or abundance of fitting stones, in the Country, in which they occasionally raised them; if not also according to the lesser or greater number of <hi>Electors,</hi> who
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48257:39"/>
were to stand and vote upon them. Nor is it to be unregarded, that at <hi>Stone-heng,</hi> the inmost Circle (if, at least, that may be called a Circle, which really is a <hi>Polygon;</hi> such flat and broad Pillars, being, in respect of their want of <hi>Convexity</hi> on their out-sides, incapable to make a perfect Circle) contains onely twelve stones; which agrees exactly with the most ancient patterns.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is this, that <hi>Stone-heng</hi> hath <hi>Three</hi> circular orders of Stones, whereas the <hi>Others</hi> have no more than <hi>one.</hi> Which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless may receive a satisfactory Solution, as the former, either from the greater plenty of convenient stones in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> yea in sundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not very remote from the work it self, of which wee shall shortly have occasion to take particular notice: or from the greater number of <hi>Electors,</hi> who being of the Nobility, and principal Officers of Armies, in process of time were multiplied to a more numerous list, than in former ages, as may be observed in all other nations also: or perhaps from hence also, that <hi>Stone-heng</hi> was designed both for a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchral Monument of one King, or General, there slain in battail; and for a Court of Election for his immediate Successor. For, you may remember, I have already acquainted You, how usual a thing it was amongst the <hi>Danes,</hi> to celebrate the Funeral of one Prince, and solemnize the Inauguration of another, at one and the same time, and in one and the same place; perpetuating the memory of both, by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of vast stones: and that I exemplified this in the massive Tomb of King <hi>Harald Hyldetand,</hi> which was both a Sepulchral Monument for Him, and a Court of Election for succeeding Kings, for many ages after. Nor have I omitted, to supply you with descriptions of two famous <hi>Danique Antiquities,</hi> that consist of a <hi>Threefold</hi> order of Stones, all of magnitude equal to, if not much transcending those of <hi>Stone-heng.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Third,</hi> and last point of Disparity is, that in <hi>Stone-heng,</hi> the outmost and inmost rounds of Columns are furnished with <hi>Epistyles,</hi> or <hi>Architraves,</hi> resting upon their heads; but none such are found upon the upright stones in any of the Courts of Election in <hi>Denmark.</hi> But, this, as the two former, may be referred to the great abundance of such stones in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> more than in any province of <hi>Denmark;</hi> where they were not to be had but rarely, as is intimated in that text of <hi>Petrus Lindebergius</hi> formerly quoted, <q>
                     <hi>Dani cum, propter defectum Saxorum, pyramides &amp; obeliscos extruere minime potuerint, olim in</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:48257:39"/>
                     <hi>memoriam Regum &amp; He o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>um ex terra coacervata ingentem molem montis instar eminentem statuÃªre;</hi>  The <hi>Danes</hi> when they could not, for <hi>want of stones,</hi> erect Pyramids and Obelisces, heretofore they cast up a huge Mount of Earth, in memory of their Kings and Heroes.</q> Nor was it unusual to them, to raise up from the ground stones of wonderful scantlings, and impose them, in manner of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitraves, upon the tops of others; especially in their works of greatest Magnificence, and where they intended to raise admiration in poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, at the prodigious strength, and extraordinary means required to advance such huge weights, to so great a height: as I have formerly proved both by authentique Testimonies, and agreeable Examples. Being, therefore, through the fortunate success of their Arms, in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of <hi>England,</hi> and assembling in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> where they met with store of materials fit for their purpose; and proposing to themselves to erect a stately Monument, after the fashion of their own Country, with some addition of vastness correspondent: it is not improbable, that they made choice of this kind of Superstructure of Architraves, or plain long stones laid overthwart upon the tops of the Columns; as that which might both hold some analogy with other Monuments in their own Nation, and also be of considerable use, in affording more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and firm footing for such persons of honourable condition, who were principally to give their Votes at the Election of the King, standing in round upon the stones; especially when their late Victories had augmented the stock of their Nobility, and who, perhaps, were by this time more than could stand upon the single Columns, and needed the addition of Architraves to support them at the Solemnity.</p>
               <p>And thus you see, how the points of <hi>Dissimilitude</hi> or <hi>Inconformity</hi> betwixt <hi>Stone-heng,</hi> and its more antique Patterns in <hi>Dane-land,</hi> may be reasonably solved. However, it cannot be denied, but they are, both in number, and weight, much inferior to the particulars of the precedent <hi>Parallel</hi> or <hi>Resemblance:</hi> and therefore ought not to be put in the Balance against them, nor to be thought of such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as to detract from the verisimility of my Conjecture, that <hi>Stone-heng</hi> was principally, if not wholly, designed and raised for a <hi>Court-Royal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, this Discovery (at least, if it may deserve that name) is a work of Supererogation, my undertaking from the first, having been onely to make it appear highly probable, that <hi>Stone-heng</hi> originally
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48257:40"/>
was a building of the <hi>Danes.</hi> Which, if I mistake not, I have to a competent degree of satisfaction effected.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, I must not forget to observe one thing more, not unworthy serious consideration: which is this, That among all our antient Historians, who wrote of the state of <hi>Britain</hi> as well before, as under the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> recording not onely all the most memorable actions, passages, and memorials whatever, but also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour occurrents, and that even to superfluity; no one hath so much as mentioned <hi>Stone-heng,</hi> until a long time after the <hi>Danes</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>England,</hi> and were afterwards forced to resign it to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> again, upon the decease of <hi>Hardi Canute.</hi> For, the first Author, in whom any word is found concerning it, was <hi>Geffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who (together with his fellow Historiographers, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntington,</hi> and <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Durham)</hi> lived in the days of King <hi>Stephen.</hi> No contemptible Argument, that in <hi>England</hi> no such Monument, as <hi>Stone-heng,</hi> was extant, until the <hi>Danes</hi> had over-run and conquered this Nation: it being hard to conceive, that those Writers, who committed to record matters of much smaller moment, and (according to the Monkish humour of those darker times) so much delighted themselves in relating wonderful acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and extraordinary adventures; would have condemned to obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion so eminent a thing as <hi>Stone-heng,</hi> and in a deep silence have passed over the most admirable Antiquity of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the vulgar conceit, that the <hi>great decay of the Structure shews it to have been more antique, than the</hi> Danish <hi>Invasion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest here;</hi> it may be easily solved by answering, that the ruines evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence themselves to be the effect, not of <hi>Time,</hi> (the stones them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves being of a temper so compact and hard, that the iron teeth of that consuming Enemy cannot gnaw or corrode them; nor any force of tempests impair them in the least) but of the sacrilegious violence of <hi>Men,</hi> who have thrown down most of the Architraves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved many of the more portable stones, converting them to private uses in Buildings, Land-marks, &amp;c. as appears by some yet to be seen in the neighbouring Villages and Fields.</p>
               <p>And if the greatness of its ruines since cannot, certainly, much less ought the <hi>Vastness</hi> and <hi>Stupendious Dimensions</hi> thereof, when it was entire and complete, to be thought sufficient to dispossess the <hi>Danes</hi>

of the honour of its Extruction. For, of all Nations in the world, they appear to have taken the most both of Delight and Pains, in searching after, and bringing together mighty stones, whereof to make their Monuments: sparing nor time, nor cost, nor labour, yea many times engaging the whole Nation almost, to contribute their hands and purses together, toward the advancing such prodigious Piles. To testifie this, the History of <hi>Norwey</hi> assures us, in the life of <hi>Haraldus Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fagre,</hi> that two petty Kings of that Country, consumed three whole years, and a vast treasure, in casting up a Sepulchral Mount, and fencing it about with stones of Gigantick magnitude. And <hi>Saxo Gnam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticus (lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Hist. Danic.)</hi> writing the glorious actions of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Blaatand,</hi> the son of <hi>Gormond</hi> and <hi>Thyra,</hi> (daughter of K. <hi>Ethelred</hi> of <hi>England)</hi> among other his great exploits, tells us, that <q>He set his whole Army, and another of Oxen, on work, to remove, from the <hi>Jutland</hi> shore, one immense Stone, or little Rock, and bring it to the place, where the body of his Mother lay inhumed, that by erecting it over her grave, he might at once eternize the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of her virtues, and of his own filial piety:</q> being so far ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated with the glory of the attempt; that he boastingly demanded of one of the Officers of his Navy,. who was present,  <q>

                     <hi>viribus ante alios praediti, parum notitiae traditum.</hi>  That <hi>Dane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> antiently was inhabited by Giants, stones of wonderful mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, affixed to the Sepulchres and Caves of our Ancestors, bear witness. Which if any doubt to have been effected by monstrous strength, let him behold the tops of some Mountains, and tell, if he be able, who brought thither Rocks of such immense greatness. For, every competent Judge of this wonder will perceive it to exceed the imagination of man, how the meer labour of Mortals, or usual effort of human strength could advance to a point of such mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous sublimity, a weight not at all, or not without extreme diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, movable even on plain ground. But, whether the Authors of these mighty works were Giants, living after the Deluge was fallen; or Men endowed with extraordinary strength of body: is not to be known from Story.</q> Now, if any unprejudicate man, having heard these testimonies, shall first enquire of our Historians, what mighty Armies, and numerous swarms of people, were brought out of those Northern Countries to infest <hi>Britan,</hi> together with their too prosperous successes in many fights; and then consider with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, what such vast numbers of men employed at once, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiously co-operating in such a work, might be able to perform, in a few years, yea months, and that by meer natural strength, without any great skill in Mechaniques, or the Art of removing great weights by Engines: certainly, he will find no difficulty in admitting it to be as possible, and perhaps more probable, for the <hi>Danes</hi> to have brought the great stones at <hi>Stone-heng</hi> to that ground, and there erected them in the order described; as for the old <hi>Britans, Romans, Saxons,</hi> or any other <hi>Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Especially when it is most probable, that those stones were fetch'd no farther off, than from <hi>Aibury</hi> or <hi>Rockly,</hi> about three or four miles distant from <hi>Marleborow</hi> in the same County. For, in the Fields adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to those two Villages, and principally the later (which as <hi>Camden</hi> observes, borrowed its name from thence) there stand up great stones like Rocks, infinite in number; all which perfectly resemble those at <hi>Stone-heng,</hi> in colour, grain, hardness, and branching of veins; and many of them also in figure and proportions: brought thither, as is vulgarly, and perhaps not untruly, believed, by the violence of the universal Deluge, and there left in Vallies, as the force of the currents abated. These stones I my self have often seen, in journeys to <hi>Bath</hi> from <hi>London;</hi> and comparing them with those at <hi>Stone-heng,</hi> found
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48257:41"/>
so great an Analogy betwixt them; that ever since I have reteined an opinion, the Founders of that Monument furnished themselves with Materials from the fore-named places; among so great a multitude selecting such, as in magnitude and shape might best comport with their designes; and transporting them from thence. But <hi>How?</hi> or <hi>by what means?</hi> That's the greatest wonder of all!</p>
               <p>Concerning this grand Difficulty, therefore, I say; That though the unlearned Vulgar may be dispensed withall, to admire the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sportation of such stones, as an effect of more than Human Art and Strength; and accordingly to have recourse to the ridiculous Fable of <hi>Merlin</hi>'s bringing them out of <hi>Ireland</hi> by Magique Diabolical, and the help of Spirits: Yet to Scholars and Travellers, the matter will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to come so short of the Miracle, as scarce to attain to a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison with sundry other performances, not onely of the Ancients, but of the Moderns also, in the like kind.</p>
               <p>For, among the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Monuments of extraordinary labour and magnificence, we read in <hi>Herodotus (lib. 2. cap. 175.)</hi> of one huge Pyramid, built by King <hi>Cleopes,</hi> in which was not one stone less than 30 foot long, and all of them fetch'd from <hi>Arabia the Rocky:</hi> and how <hi>Amasis,</hi> another <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Monarch, had a house of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure for himself, cut out of one entire stone, 12 cubits long, 14 broad, and 8 high; and also made the Statue of a <hi>Sphinx,</hi> or <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Cat, of another single stone, which was in length 143 feet, in heighth 62, and in compass of the Head 102. And <hi>Diodorus Siculus (Biblioth. lib. 1. sect. 2.)</hi> reports of <hi>Sesostris,</hi> a third King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that in a Temple of <hi>Vulcan</hi> at <hi>Memphis,</hi> he erected two Statues,  one for himself, another for his wife, each of one solid Stone, and 30 cubits high.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Jewish,</hi> we read in <hi>Josephus (de Bello Judaic. lib. 6. cap. 6.)</hi> of three magnificent Towers built by <hi>Herod,</hi> in which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry stone being of white Marble, was 20 cubits long, 10 broad, and 5 high: and which was yet more wonderful, the old wall it self was situated on a steep rising ground: so that 'tis scarce imaginable by what puissant means so many stones of such prodigious weight, should be taken whole out of the Quarrey, and conveyed to a place of such eminent altitude.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Graecian,</hi> we read in <hi>Pliny (lib. 36. cap. 14.)</hi> that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48257:42"/>
in that so famous Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> were 127 Columns, each consisting of one stone, 60 foot high; all taken out of the Quat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in <hi>Asia:</hi> not to insist upon the mighty <hi>Rhodian Colossus,</hi> of which Fame hath spoken with all her tongues.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Roman,</hi> besides the prodigious brazen <hi>Colossus</hi> of <hi>Nero,</hi> described by <hi>Suetonius, (in vit. Neron.)</hi> we read, in <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cirol. (de deperdit. titul. 31.)</hi> of fundry <hi>Obelisks,</hi> made of so many whole stones; whereof some were 40, some 80, others 90 cubits high; most of them brought from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there set up; with this Distich engraven upon one of them.</p>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Si lapis est unus; dic, quafuit arte levatus?</l>

                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>In <hi>Rome</hi> there stands also an Obelisk of one solid stone, a kind of Ophite, or spotted Marble, anciently consecrated to the honour of the great <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> and erected on the left side of the <hi>Vatican Temple,</hi> in the Cirque of <hi>Nero;</hi> but, in the year 1586, removed into a more eminent place, at the vast charge of Pope <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> and by the admirable skill of <hi>Dominicus Fontanus,</hi> an excellent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect. Which is in height 170 foot, above the base; in breadth, at the bottom, 12 foot, and at the top 8; in weight 956148 pounds, besides the heaviness of the Instruments or Engines used in raising it, that amounted to 1042824 pounds, according to the computation of <hi>Georgius Draudius, (in adnotationib. ad Solini memorabilia, part. 1. fol. 131.)</hi> The removing of this Obelisk was so rarea piece of Art, that besides the vast treasure he received in reward, the Engineer got immortal renown thereby; no less than 56 learned men expresly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating his praises; as <hi>Monantholius (in Comment. in Arist. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic. cap. 19.)</hi> remarketh. If so; what did those deserve, who first digged the same out of the Marble Quarries of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and brought it entire to <hi>Rome?</hi> Doubtless this was much the more glorious enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise of the two.</p>
               <p>Now, after these superlative Examples, what think you of our <hi>Stone-heng,</hi> betwixt which and those, as to dimensions, is no more proportion, than betwixt a Pygmie and a Giant? Can you allow it
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48257:42"/>
to have been so wonderful a task, for a whole Army of Men, and multitudes of Oxen, to transport the stones thereof, in a plain and champian Country; especially seeing the biggest of its stones ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not 12 Tun weight, and many of them not 2 Tun; and that the distance from <hi>Rockley,</hi> and <hi>Aibury,</hi> from whence, it seems, they were fetched, to the place where they were set up, is not above 20 miles at most? You'l object, perchance; that those mighty works were performed by Nations, among which were many excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians, and great Masters in the Art of Mechaniques, to which all weights are easily moveable, and which containeth Demonstrative Rules how the strongest Oake may be torn up by the roots with a Horse-hair, as the learned Author of <hi>Mathematical Magique</hi> hath well observed, and clearly proved, <hi>(book</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 14.): but this of <hi>Stone-heng</hi> by a rude and barbarous people, utterly ignorant of such Machines and artificial helps. To this, therefore, I <hi>answer;</hi> That it doth not appear the <hi>Danes</hi> were so rude, as to have no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance at all with the use of Engines for the elevation of monstrous weights: but rather the contrary, insomuch as their carrying even Rocks themselves from the Sea-shore to the very heart of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, of which I have formerly spoken, sufficiently intimates their being versed in the use of the <hi>Leaver, Roller, Wheel, Pulley, Wedge,</hi> and <hi>Screw,</hi> which are fundamental <hi>Faculties</hi> of Mechaniques, it being scarce conceivable, how otherwise they should raise such por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentous Monuments, as they did. But allowing them to have been as Unskilful, as You please, in such Instruments; yet consider how <hi>Numerous</hi> they were, and how strenuously great swarms of them used to joyn hands together in such attempts; and you have not forgot the old Verse, <hi>Multorum manibus grande levatur onus,</hi> Many hands make light work. What prodigious matters may be effected by meer strength and hand-force of great Multitudes, without Rules of Art, may be discerned from the savage <hi>Indians;</hi> who being destitute of other Mathematiques, but what Nature dictated to them, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the advantage of Engines, did yet by their simple toyl and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable diligence, remove stones of incredible greatness. For, <hi>Acosta (Histor. Indic. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.) relates, that he measured one stone brought to <hi>Tiaguanaco,</hi> which was 38 foot long, 18 broad, and 6 thick: and that in their stateliest Edifices were many other of much vaster magnitude.</p>
               <p>To conclude, therefore, with a short review of what hath hithert
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48257:43"/>
been delivered at large, and assist your Judgment, by relieving your Memory; considering (1) that of all Nations in the world, none was so much addicted to Monuments of huge and unhewn stones, as the <hi>Danes</hi> appear to have been, for many hundred of years together; (2) that they used to set such up, not onely in their own Country, but in all other places also, where-ever the fortune of war had at any time made their adventures and atchievments memorable; and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> (3) that in <hi>Denmark,</hi> at this day, there stand many stupendious Piles of stones, in most particulars agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that, of which I have now discoursed; (4) that upon a strict and impartial inquest, neither the antient <hi>Britains,</hi> nor <hi>Romans,</hi> nor <hi>Saxons,</hi> are found to have any justifiable title to the honor of founding that of <hi>Stone-heng;</hi> (5) that no one of our old Historians made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any such work, until long after the <hi>Danes</hi> had acquired the Soveraign Power in this Island, and left sundry memorials of their victorious Aimies; (6) that the great impairment of the Fabrick since that time of the Danique conquest, doth not evince it to be of greater antiquity; (7) that neither the Magnificence of the same, at first; (8) nor the vastness of strength, and skill in Engines, required to the transportation and elevation of stones of such prodigious weight; are sufficient Arguments to the contrary: considering these things, I say, why may I not conjecture, that <hi>the Danes,</hi> and onely the <hi>Danes were the Authors of Stone-heng?</hi> Sure I am of thus much, that this Opinion of mine, if it be erroneous, is yet highly plausible: having this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over the others concerning the same obscure subject, that it is not so easily to be refuted. Nor is it arrogancy in me, to affirm, that if I have been deceived in entertaining this conceipt in the place of Truth; it was because I found it in the livery and colours of Truth. However, I expect you should consider; it is no dishonor to even the best Marks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, not to hit the white, when he is forced to shoot in the dark. Which consideration being alone sufficient to secure my wel-intended endeavours, from too severe and disingenious censure, in case it shall hereafter be discovered, that I have been mistaken in the Main thing sought after, namely, the Authors of our Antiquity: I doubt not, but your Candor will extend it also to the favourable construction of my suppositions concerning the Circumstances.</p>
               <p>In the strength of this confidence, therefore, I adventure to acquaint you moreover with my conjecture concerning the TIME, when
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48257:43"/>
                  <hi>Stone-heng</hi> was first set up: which I take to be in the beginning of the reign of that Excellent Prince, <hi>Alfred,</hi> or <hi>Alured;</hi> who as he was the first annointed King of this Island, so was he the first Learned King, and most munificent Patron to Scholars, that ever swaied the Scepter of <hi>Britain.</hi> For, all our Chronicles agreeingly deliver, that He was scarcely seated in his throne, when there came over greater swarms of <hi>Danes,</hi> than ever before, to infest his dominions; and that after many unfortunate battails with them, he was reduced to that extremity, that leaving his large Monarchy to the rage and rapine of those insulting Pagans, he fled for safety of his life into the Marishes of <hi>Sommer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setshire,</hi> where for two years he lay concealed in a poor disguise, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steining himself by fishing and fowling. Among other adventures that befell this glorious person in this dark Eclipse, it is not unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that on a time as he was sitting in the chimney corner in the cottage of a Cow-heard (who had entertained him into his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) and busied in trimming his bow and arrows; a Cake of dough lying to be baked on the hearth before him, chanced to be burned; which the goodwife imputing to his neglect, in great fury cast away his bow and arrows, and sharply checking him, said; <hi>Thoufellow, dost thou see the bread burn before thy face, and wilt not turn it? and yet thou art glad to eat it, be sore it be half baked.</hi> Shortly after this, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning policy from adversity, and deriving courage from necessity; he ventured, in the habit of a common Minstrel, to enter into the <hi>Danes</hi> Camp (in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> and probably not far from the place, where <hi>Stone-heng</hi> stands) and having viewed the manner of their encamping, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served their security, he returned back to several of his Lords retreated into the Island called <hi>Edlingsey,</hi> invironed with two Rivers, <hi>Thane</hi> and <hi>Parret,</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> and acquainting them in how careless and open a posture he found the Enemy; recollected the scatter'd remains of his forces, and with these surprising the <hi>Danes,</hi> and putting them first into a panick terror, and then to flight, gave them so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable a defeat, that they immediately submitted to a Treaty, and deliver'd Hostages for performance of conditions.</p>
               <p>Now, considering the extreme low ebb of Fortune, to which this excellent King was at that time brought; and the high flood of pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity that in the mean while had advanced the <hi>Danes</hi> over all parts of his Dominions, insomuch that nothing seemed wanting to complete their conquest, but only to find out the few Defendants who remained in obscurity; and withall reflecting upon the former mentioned Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48257:44"/>
of that: ambitious and martial Nation, to erect Courts Royal of huge stones, according to the manner described, for the Election of their Kings, in all Countries, where the happy success of their Armes had given them a title to Soveraignty: I am apt to believe, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then over-run the whole Kingdom, except only <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> and encamping their main Army in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> for neer upon two years together; and setting up their rest in a confidence to perpetuate their newly acquired power; they imployed themselves, during that time of leasure and jollity, in erecting <hi>Stone-heng,</hi> as a place wherein to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and inaugurate their supreme Commander, King of <hi>England:</hi> the weakness of the distressed <hi>Alfred</hi> affording them a fit opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and that country yielding them fit materials for so great and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedious a work. Nor is it improbable, that the great supinity and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, in which the Royal Spie found them, when the magique of his Fiddle had charmed them into an imperception of the majesty of his person, and procured him a free welcome into their Camp; might be occasioned by the jubile they celebrated, after they had finished that laborious task, and therein newly crowned their King, after a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal manner, such as at once corresponded with the fashion of their Ancestors, and expressed the profuseness of their publick joy. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Historians relate, that the Danish Army was at that time let loose to luxury and revelling; and that the unknown Musician was brought to play before their King, <hi>Gormund,</hi> in his tent, during a long and magnificent feast. But, perhaps, I may be thought too bold, in da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, from such slender passages and circumstantial hints, thus precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to guess at the Age of this Antiquity; concerning whose Original neither History, nor Tradition hath left any glimpse of light, whereby the inquisitive might be guided through the darksome vale of Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, to the delightfull mansion of Truth. Leaving every man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the liberty of his own thoughts, touching this particular, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so whatever else hath been said of the Monument it self, and its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Designation; I here put a period to this Discourse, wherein though I have adventured to contend with Oblivion; I had no design to usurp upon the Judgment of others.</p>
