            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

endevours to qualifie and allay the heat of ſome unkindneſſe which lately grew betwixt my Lord St. <hi>Iohn</hi> and my Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> and to that end uſed many perſwaſions, &amp; hard intreaties to them both, and found my Lord St. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſo nobly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in it that he told me, for the thing it ſelfe hee thought it not worth a matter of unkindneſſe; but that which troubled him, was that he ſhould bee ſo much miſtaken in his judgement, eſteeming my Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> ſo loving and faithfull a friend unto him. To this effect I did much endevour to remove that conceit of miſtaking, and reduce his Lordſhip to his former good opinion of my Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> and diſired that hee ſhould paſſe by that as an error of a young man, and ſo ground his opinion upon the former and future carriage of my Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> towards him, then upon the fayling in one particular, which hope gave ſome ſatisfaction unto his Lordſhip, therefore I pray doe you ſecond that with your beſt pe<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

When they ſaw that I would not leave them, the Iriſh man asked what religion I was of, I ſaid I did beleeve to have ſalvation onely by the 

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:151749:15"/>
infinite merits of the death and paſſion of my Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo I hoped he did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:
then I demanded what religion he was of, that could warrant him to fight in ſuch a quarrell; he anſwered, happy man be his dole: In the end they were contented that I ſhould have the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the buſineſſe betwixt them: ſo we went to a Taverne in Kings ſtreet, where they fell out at Tables, and drew their ſwords, but the ſervants parted them, and upon the examination of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that did appeare, that the Iriſh man did the wrong to the Engliſh man, and called him boy?
and that was the word of diſgrace that M. <hi>Phillips</hi> would never be ſatisfied till he fought with him; therefore I did order, that M. <hi>Newman</hi> ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he had done M. <hi>Phillips</hi> wrong, and that he was ſorry for it; and then M. <hi>Newman</hi> cryed mercy, and then they embraced one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with ſuch expreſſions of love, that they would live, &amp; die together in defending one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers quarrels, to this effect, and as it pleaſed God I parted this dangerous quarrell without drawing my ſword, the Iriſh man was a proper tallman, but M. <hi>Phillips</hi> was young, but a brave ſpirit.</p>
               <p>ANd now that I am upon the point of peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making, give me leave to give ſome few dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for the better effecting of this charitable worke.</p>

               <p>But in my long trading in theſe charitable buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, I will declare unto you two very rare and unuſuall means which I have made uſe of:</p>
               <p>A gentleman of great worth, and Knight of the Parliament houſe, and his Miniſter of great worth and of great parts alſo, having ſpent much money in ſuites of Law in the high Commiſſion Court.</p>
               <p>I humbly intreated my Lord <hi>Mandevill,</hi> that noble peace-maker to take into his conſideration they, being his neare neighbours, who tooke great paines to order the buſineſſe, and end the ſuites, and gat them into bands, but they were both ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, they brake their bands, and refuſed the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and procured Commiſſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:151749:16"/>
the leaſt. The Commiſſion was ſealed up, and ſent to <hi>Huntington</hi> to be returned into the high Commiſſion Court. I was ſorry to ſee all our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour loſt, &amp; hopes fruſtrate, yet it pleaſed God to put a conceit into my head, and therefore. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with two that were nearly allyed to the Knight of the Parliament houſe, and told them we muſt make an end, ei<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>her with the conſent of the parties, or without their conſent; for the firſt, that the ſuit was impoſſible; the ſecond, how could it be, that I will tell you? ſo we fell to writing, firſt, that all ſuite in law ſhould ceaſe:
ſecondly, that thus much the Knight of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament ſhould give the P<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eacher for rearages for his tythes, and then to prevent ſuites here after, the Knight of the Parliament ſhould give thus much a yeare for compoſition for his tythes.
When we had done, I told them I will engage my ſelfe to be bound in this ſumme, that the Miniſter ſhall ſtand to this, and you ſhall doe the like to me; That the Knight of the Parliament ſhould doe the like, we entred into bands, and then ſent for them, and when they ſaw that we ſtood enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for them, and it was not their Act they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to that end, and entred into five hundred pound bonds apeece to ſtand to that end, thus it pleaſed God to take off this tedious and dangerous buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>The other concerned my ſelfe: in my old age a gentleman had made a ſcandalous report of me, that I ſhould ſend a Cart upon the Sabbath-day to remove certaine goods; which was very falſe, yet he made report of <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

which anſwered very much for the, and would not beleeve it, uſed many meanes to vindicate my reputation; but he would not be ſatisfied, but gave credit to the report of ſome lewd malicious companions; ſo in the end I grew ſo fooliſh, that I ſent him a challenge, &amp; ſent my man with it to meet me the next day by eight of the clocke in the morning, upon ſuch a Common, betwixt two Woods, to meet ſingle and with ſingle ſwords.
I came to the place at the time appointed, and beat the ayre, but he came not; I rode to his gates to call him, but he returned his anſwer in a kinde letter to me, did acknowledge that he had done me wrong, to give credit to the report of ſuch ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and malicious knaves, and that he would ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my noble friend how much I was wronged, to this effect, and afterwards we continued very lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving friends during his life: this I doe relate, but would have no man follow this example, except they will doe (and ſo I hope we ſhould have done)
As two knights in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths time, as I take it, that the one was Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the other Sir <hi>Henry Cromwell,</hi> two valiant Knights, and brave ſouldiers, and contended for a peece of ground, and ſpent more money in Law then they were willing; and ſeeing it was unfit for ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to follow ſuites in Law, they reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it with their ſwords, and appointed a day to meet upon that ground, and there met, but conſidering better of it, that their valour was well knowne and what a vaine thing it was for them to adventure their lives upon ſuch a quarrell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they grew to <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>ake heed they be not put to that adventure, for men to meet in the field, the devill will put theſe conceits into their mind that it is not for your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to appoint the field and not to fight, and if they fight, then it will be their diſhonour to give over with this diſadva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, thy enemy hath given thee more wounds then thou haſt done him, and ſo will urge them to fight ſtill untill either one or both are ſlaine: as was ſeene in the ever to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented example of Sir <hi>George Wharton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iames Steward</hi> that ſtood upon tearmes of honour, and were both ſlain in the field.</p>

And thus good Couſin you ſee how bold I am to trouble you with ſo many quaeries in a forraign land, when it is more need to make enquiry into my owne ſinfull and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart, to ſee what is done there in matter of reformation, repentance, and amendment of life.</p>

               <p>MAdam, my great care of your everlaſting happineſſe, and my reſpective love to my reverend Couſin Mr. <hi>Lee,</hi> who now is dead in the Lord, and therefore muſt ceaſe from his labour: and from thoſe holy endevours where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he did labour to plant grace in your heart in your tender yeares, and whereof you then gave ſuch excellent hopes that in the <hi>Autumne</hi> of your age, he ſhould have ſeen a plentifull increaſe of that bleſſed fruit, and many goodly ſheaves of pietie and happineſſe, to his great comfort in the Harveſt: but it pleaſed God, the great Lord of the Harveſt to take him away as from other evils to come, ſo likewiſe from thoſe griefs that would have wounded his heart to ſee thoſe flouriſhing hopes ſo nipt and withered in your ſpring-time:
it pleaſed God to make me partaker of his laſt prayer, and to cloſe his eyes: Oh that it might be his bleſſed pleaſure to make his Spirit to be redoubled on me, that I might be the better able to admoniſh and exhort you to reform that which is amiſſe in you, and diſgracefull to your holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, 
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151749:21"/>
I meane in reſpect of your outward carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and appearance, with ſo many fond faſhions and gariſh attires, as to deale plainly with you, were more meet for one of painted <hi>Iezabels</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, than for a Lady of your worth: and more fit to furniſh a pedlers pack, than to make open ſhew of them in the Church of God, and in the Aſſembly of the Saints: whereas things ſhould be done with comelineſſe and decencie; and therefore he commandeth that no woman ſhould be covered becauſe of the Angels, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. 10.
and that women ſhould pray with their heads co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
But if this be a comely covering to have a womans head covered with dogs haire, or goats haire, and cats dung, and painted fethers, judge you: for my owne part, the Word of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you ſhall be judged, condemnes it as odious and abominable: but it may be you will ſay it is the Gallants faſhion, and what if the Venetian Curtizans have brought up that faſhion? muſt the religious Ladies of England follow that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion?
God forbid, the Children of God muſt not faſhion themſelues after the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 2.
But they muſt faſhion themſelvs according to the rule of Gods Word, and then Madame marke what faſhion you muſt be in, 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2. 9, 10.
<hi>Likewiſe alſo the women, that they array themſelves with ſhamefaſtneſſe and modeſtie, not with broidered haire, or gold, or pearls, or coſtly apparell, but as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the feare of God with good works.</hi> I beſeech you in the feare of God deck your ſelfe with theſe rich jewels, of faith and repentance, humilitie, patience, faſting and prayer, and good works, 
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151749:21"/>
that ſo you may be like the Kings Daughter glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous within, and this will make you amiable in the ſight of God, and glorious in the eies of his Saints, and remember you are the Daughter of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ladie, and the Wife of an ancient Knight, and the Mother of two Sons: and therefore you muſt give them good example of wiſdome and ſobrietie, for <hi>godlineſſe is great gaine,</hi> if we can be contented with that we have: and God hath bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed you with a rich portion of outward beauty and comelineſſe, and therefore do not deface that incomparable worke of God, with ſuch baſe traſh and trumperie, for you ſhall never enter into the Kingdome of Heaven, into the companie of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Saints, with that trumperie on your back, and gaudes on your head: Conſider what I ſay, and the Lord give you grace to repent of your ſins before you <hi>go hence, and be no more ſeen,</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>

               <p>MY very loving and kind Keeper, although you have been long out of ſight, yet you have been oftentime in minde, and often in my thoughts and prayers unto God for you, as I had good cauſe when I remember the great care and love that you and M. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> did ſhew unto me when I was priſoner in your houſe. Oh that it would pleaſe the Lord to make me as happy a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner unto you, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was unto his Keeper at Philippi, whereof you may read in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, who at Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> firſt comming into the priſon, was in ſuch a woefull eſtate of a perſecuting Infidell, yet that night being terrified with the earthquake

and feare of the loſſe of his priſoners, would deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately have murthered himſelfe, but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> having pitty and compaſſion upon him, cryed out with a loud voice, <hi>Doe thy ſelfe no harme, for we are all here:</hi> and then with feare and trembling he fell downe before them, and brought them out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſaid, <hi>Sirs, what muſt I doe to be ſaved?</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preached unto them, <hi>to beleeve in the Lord Ieſus, and he and his houſhold ſhould be ſaved:</hi> and ſo through the Lords great mercy they were converted and baptized, and greatly reioyced that he and all his houſe beleeved in God. Now though I have not ſeen you ſo deſperately minded to kill your ſelfe with your ſword for feare of my eſcape, yet I muſt needs ſay, I have ſeen you ready to wound your ſoule with fearefull ſwearing, and exceſſive drinking, and how greatly this may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger your ſoule and body alſo you may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it: You remember well that the Lord will not hold him guiltleſſe that taketh his name in vaine; and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth teſtifie, that <hi>drunkards ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God, Galat.</hi> 5. 22. but of theſe ſinnes I have admoniſhed you of when I was with you, and through the Lords great mercy found ſome reformation thereof, in that I did ſee you refraine from ſuch exceſſive drinking, and ſometimes abſtaine an oath, and reprove others for ſwearing. I know that is a hard matter ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to caſt off ſuch growne ſinnes, and thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto you have been ſo long accuſtomed; but on the other ſide alſo, I know it is an eaſie thing unto our omnipotent God to ſet your feet into the way of peace. Oh therefore unto that mercifull God 
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:151749:25"/>
to convert your ſoule, and to ſet your feet into the way of peace. Oh therefore pray unto that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord, and importune him with earneſt and zealous prayer day and night, untill he hath wrought in you that bleſſed worke, to give you grace not onely to ſee your ſinnes, but give you alſo true repentance and godly ſorrow for them, that you may now loath them more then ever you loved them, and utterly deteſt and abhorre them, though they be as deare unto you as your right eye, and as profitable unto you as your right hand, yet caſt them off, and caſt them from you; for it is better for us to enter into the kingdome of heaven ſo maimed and ſpoiled of our ſinnes, then to enjoy them here for a ſhort time, and then both ſoule and body to be caſt into hell fire, where there is weeping and wailing in everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting darkneſſe. And now that you may eſcape thoſe everlaſting torments, and attaine to the kingdome of heaven and the righteouſneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, you muſt ſettle your ſelfe to the conſtant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of thoſe holy duties of prayer and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word of God; and you muſt take unto you that Chriſtian reſolution, that no feare of mans diſpleaſure, nor the mockes and ſcoffes of wicked men ſhould make you never to neglect the ſame; I meane, you muſt not be aſhamed to goe to Sermons, nor to keep holy the Sabbath-day, nor to pray with your wife and ſervants, though all the drunken companions in Kent ſhould rayle or ieere at you for the ſame; but remember that thoſe that are aſhamed of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and of his holy ſervice on earth, he will be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med 
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:151749:25"/>
to owne them in the day of judgement, and leave them to their devilliſh maſters, and to thoſe helliſh torments which he hath prepared for ſuch baſe ſlaves that doe preferre the ſervice of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill before the ſervice of God: And then will they cry unto the mountaines to cover them, and to hils to fall upon them, rather then they would heare the dreadfull ſentence of, <hi>Goe ye curſed into hell fire, prepared for the devill and his angels;</hi> and the wofull execution that followes thereupon, to be cloſed up for ever in utter darkeneſſe, and there to be tormented with thoſe damned ſpirits, where in ſtead of their carouſing and filthy ſpeaking, they ſhall have weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth for evermore, and never ſhall behold the face of any man, nor heare the voice of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to yeeld them comfort; but as they deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves in ſwearing and ſtaring, in curſing and raging, ſo they ſhall have their fill thereof among thoſe raging and furious damned ſpirits, and yet ſhall not procure one drop of water to coole their tongues, although they be tormented in thoſe helliſh flames, as you may read in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Dives,</hi> Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 29. and then my lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Keeper, is it not much better with <hi>Moſes,</hi> to chuſe rather to ſuffer afflictions with the children of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon, and then to goe to everlaſting torments.
And what if you be mocked and pointed at for a Puritane, and be counted a mad man becauſe you ſeparate your ſelfe from the company of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous wretches and abhominable drunkards, and 
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:151749:26"/>
doe now reſolve to ſerve the living God with an honeſt heart; nay, what if you ſhould be perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and impriſoned for his name-ſake? Rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven; for ſo perſecuted they the Prophets and holy men of God in former times; and ſo likewiſe did the Iews perſecute our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and ſaid, he was mad, and had a devill: And if they dealt thus with him our Lord and Maſter, ſhall we looke for a greater priviledge? nay, let us with a holy reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion arme our ſelves to encounter with all their temptations; and with the bleſſed Apoſtle rejoice that we are accounted worthy in ſuch an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cauſe, and to be made like unto our Saviour Chriſt in any ſort; for he entred into his kingdome of glory through many tribulations. I am a little the more earneſt upon this point, becauſe even while I was with you, I feare there were ſome that did with ſcoffing and geering ſeeke to diſcourage you in thoſe good courſes whereunto you were ſo tractable: But I beſeech the Lord of mercy ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then your faith, that you may not onely come ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly unto Chriſt, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did, but boldly ſpeake to his glory, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did afterwards:
And then I truſt you ſhall finde great comfort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your owne ſoule, and cauſe the Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to rejoice; for as our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. I ſay unto you likewiſe, ioy ſhall be in heaven for one ſinner that converteth, more then for ninety and nine iuſt men which need no amendment of life: and ſo humbly praying to that bleſſed Lord, that you and yours, and I and

Aſſure your ſelfe, if there be any Law in the land will hang you up for it, at Bedford gallowes, I will as eagerly purſue you to that place of execution, as if you had cut the throat of my father, and hewed my eldeſt ſou in pieces: And if you and your Officials will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine your Decrees to be the Lawes of the Medes and Perſians, that may not be broken, though the King and his ſubjects ſuffer never ſo much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice by the ſame; and therefore if upon theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occaſions we make our prayers and ſupplications unto our God in this manner: We ſhall be caſt into the Commiſſaries denne.

               <p>THis letter I ſent to Maſter Commiſſary by an underſtanding man, and wiſhed him if the Commiſſary gave him a ſhilling for his paines he ſhould not refuſe it, and appointed him to run to Bedford, that I might know the Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries anſwer. The Commiſſary was a very ſtout and cholericke man, and when he had read the letter he ſtampt and fumed as if he had been wilde, and returned me this anſwer: That he would iuſtifie that he did, and if I had any thing to ſay to him, I muſt meet him to morrow at his Court at Amp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thill, and ſo I did; and when he was going to his Court in his pompe, I met him in the ſtreet, and asked him if he was the Commiſſary, and he ſaid, yes: then I told him, I doe charge you with ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of treaſon againſt the Kings Royall perſon, and ſo then commanded the Conſtables to doe their office, and then there was a great hurrye to fro, as if we had been driving an Oxe to the butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſtall. He made great offers to put in bayle, and that he might goe to the Church to take order for the diſmiſſing the Court; but I would give no conſent, but told him, I knew not whether hee might ſit there, being thus attached upon treaſon; yet he prevailed with the Conſtables, and they went with him to the Church, and I rode to the Church gate, and ſent in the Conſtable to bring him away, he intreated to have a little longer time to diſſolve the Court, and there was ſuch a Jubile and going away without paying Fees, as I thinke was never ſeen in all his time before. I haſtened him away to goe to Sir <hi>Edmund Conqueſts</hi> to take 
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:151749:28"/>
order for the ſending of him up to the Councell; and told him that I had charged him with ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of treaſon againſt the Kings Royall perſon; and deſired his care to ſend him up ſafely by the Sheriffe, or elſe to ſend him to Bedford Goale that he might be forth-comming.

they called unto me, and would have me ſtayed to ſee if they could have taken up the buſineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Maſter Commiſſary and I, but I would not come at them, but haſtened to my Lord Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and related unto him the buſineſſe betwixt Maſter Commiſſary and I: So his Lordſhip ſaid, that was ſomewhat irregular, yet he ſhould not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe me in my devotion. Maſter Commiſſary came up, and ſome friends laboured to take up the matter betwixt us. Sir <hi>Beaucham St. Iohn,</hi> and other gentlemen we met in Weſtminſter hall; and after ſome conference about the buſineſſe, M. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary did ſolemnly proteſt that he did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute us becauſe we kept afaſt, and prayed for the King; but heard that it was ſo well performed, that if it had been with authority, he would have been at it himſelfe, and then I did acknowledge that I was ſorry that I did not apprehend it ſo: To this effect then we did conſult what might be done 
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:151749:29"/>
for the repayring of Maſter Commiſſaries repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
ſo we reſolved that Maſter Commiſſary ſhould put in a bill againſt me, and I ſhould not plead againſt it, and ſo a writ of enquiry ſhould go out to enquire what damage this was to Maſter Commiſſary; and he promiſed me, if they gave him two hundred pound, he would not take a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of it: ſo he put in two bils of complaint what great damage he was put unto; and whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was well eſteemed of noblemen and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen now they eſchew his company, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I made this ſhort anſwer:</p>

               <p>Whereupon I beſeech you give me leave to make this profitable application to you in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, whom it hath pleaſed God to call now unto an office of great dignity in the common wealth.
And humbly I beſeech him likewiſe to give you a wiſe heart to mannage it to his glory, and the good of his Church, and the comfort of your owne ſoule: and that you may ſo doe, take heed you doe not faſhion your ſelf like unto this world, not like to a worldly Sheriffe, eſpecially in theſe two thinges, neither in your Officers nor in your Attendancy, for it is oft the cuſtome of carnall minded Sheriffes to receave there under officers by tradition whatſoever their condition be; but I pray be not you in that faſhion, but follow that grave and holy direction that <hi>Iethro</hi> gave to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> the 18. the 21. <hi>Moreover, provide thou amongſt all thy people men of courage, fearing God, men dealing truely, hating covetouſneſſe,</hi> and therefore I pray make

a diligent inquiſition amongſt your officers, and if you finde one lewd Bayliffe in all your pack let him be diſcarded, and an honeſt man put in his place; againe, it is the faſhion of many vain glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sheriffs to exceed ſo in the number of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, and in their exceſſive entertainments, that they are forc't either to end their houſe keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their office, or elſe to lay ſuch heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and wracking rents upon their tennant, as gives them juſt cauſe to lament the prodigallity of their landlords Sherivalty ſeaven yeares after; but I beſeech you take heed you be not in any ſort drawne to like of this faſhion, neither by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of others, nor by the volentary offers of your honourable friends which at this time it may be will be too forward to adde fewell to the flame of your one ambition; but I pray conſider your own revenue is very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petent both for your own ranck, and for the ſupport of that office which is impoſed upon you, and thanks be unto God for it, Maſter <hi>Oliver Luke</hi> is well known and well eſteemed of in the country without the liveries of great mens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voures, and therefore I pray ſtand firme upon your owne bottome, and let your own vertues make you ſtill to be honoured, and not your exceſſe lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in my poor conceit it is more for your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to ſhew your ſelfe in the habite of true judgement and moderation, and attended with your own ſervants, then to encreaſe your number with borrowed companies and decke your troopes with the gay feathers of other birds. Again conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you are to entertaine Judges of the land, men of wiſdome and gravity, and ſuch as ſhould puniſh

exceſſe and prodigallity as well as theft and uſury; beſides theſe times are ſo peaceable that they need not ſuch troopes of horſe or Squandrons of foote to guard their perſons nor ſuch pompe nor bravery to divert their minde from the better conſideration of theſe great and ſerious imployments that they are to goe about.</p>
               <p>Laſtly in the feare of God lay this conſideration well to your heart, how unſeaſonable &amp; unſeemly a thing it is to make that a time of feaſting, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward jollity, which ſhould be a time rather of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mourning, wherein both Magiſtrate, and people ſhould bewaile their own ſins and the ſins of the land, which at ſuch times are ſo apparant, and for the which many of their Chriſtian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren do ſuffer ſuch heavy Iudgements; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we were in the right faſhion, we ſhould weep with thoſe that weep, and remember thoſe that are in bonds as though we were bound with them, and thoſe that are in affliction as if you were alſo afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 3. Thus did that noble Magiſtrate <hi>Ezra</hi> faſt and mourne for the ſins of the people and thus did <hi>David Samuel</hi> the 1. the 3. the 35. and therefore what great cauſe is there for our Magiſtrates to faſt and mourn when they hear of ſo many thefts and murthers and abhominable ſins committed in our ſtreets, and for the which the Lord might iuſtly bring his fearfull Iudgements upon the whole land. And thus good <hi>Sir Oliver</hi> through the Lords mercy, you may ſee that they are very propoſterous in their houſe, &amp; ſhew great want of true iudgement and Chriſtianlike affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that thinke theſe fit times for feaſtings, pompe 
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:151749:31"/>
and outward bravery. And therefore I beſeech you take heed unto your own heart, and let neither the vaine examples nor the violent perſwaſions of vain glorious men, drawe you into their vaine errours, but evermore remember that moſt holy ſaying, and righteous cenſure of our Saviour Chriſt, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 15. That which is highly eſteemed amongſt men, is abomination in the ſight of God, and therefore hold faſt that word of truth and follow the holy directions thereof which is able to make you wiſe unto ſalvation, and both in theſe and all other your affaires firſt prove what that good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and perfect will of God is, and doe that with all diligence, and then aſſure your ſelfe if you ſhould fail of this fading honour that they ſo eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hunt after, yet you ſhall have everlaſting honour in the ſight of God, and of his glorious angells in the Kingdome of heaven.

               <p>IT is ſaid of the churliſh Inne-keeper of <hi>Bethlehem Luke</hi> 2. 7. who entertained ſo many gueſts in the Inne, that the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, were thruſt out into the ſtable, becauſe there was no roome for them in the Inne: but let us in in the fear of God take heed of ſuch Jewiſh tricks, leſt in the end we force our Saviour Chriſt to leave us in the fight of our ſins, and ingratitute, and then it will coſt us many a grievous ſigh, many mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full teares before we finde him againe, read <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 6. Nay, ſo wofull ſhall our eſtate be that it ſhall be never out of our minde: and now out of my brotherly love unto you I muſt admoniſh you of that bewitching and vain pleaſure of Cockfight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein you are ſo ſtrangely tranſported that both my ſelfe and many of your faithfull friends wi<hi rend="sup">th</hi> grief of heart diſcern a great alteration in your affections to thoſe courſes of religion wherein heretofore you have ſhewed your ſelfe more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and zealous. I beſeech ye in the fear of God conſider to be a ſtunling in religion is a fearfull thing, but to go ten degrees backward with <hi>Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> diall is moſt intollerable; alas ſhall we begin in the Spirit and end in the fleſh, ſhall we be ſnch greedy Elues in our pleaſure, ſell thoſe heavenly ioyes and bleſſed hope of our heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:151749:32"/>
for a meſſe of vaine delights: Oh conſider how farre we are from the holy zeale of thoſe bleſſed Saints in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook both their goods, wives, and children for the glory of God and the ſafety of their ſoules: What vaine wretches ſhall we approve our ſelves to be, if we will not forſake our vaine pleaſures? It is not your faire houſe, nor your children, nor loving wife I perſwade you to forſake, it is the vaine and unprofitable ſport of Cock-fighting, which brings ruine to your ſtate, and the endangering of your everlaſting happineſſe: and therefore if either a deſire to preſerve your eſtate, or to preſerve your everlaſting inheritance might prevaile, my ſuit were ſoone granted. But it may be you will ſay, if I can prove this you will give over Cock-fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Well, upon that condition I will take ſome paines to make it manifeſt: Firſt, to the matter of the ruine of your ſtate, I referre you to the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of your particular exſpences of thoſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and I pray let Sir <hi>William Dyers</hi> ruinate eſtate be a meanes to make you take heed by other mens harms; for the matter of diſcontentment I appeal to no other judge then your loving wife, which can tell you what diſcomforts ſhe often times findes in your long abſence, &amp; the dangers that doth fright her when ſhe conſiders that you are in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſuch ſwaggering companions, for the latter which is the maine point I purpoſe to inſiſt upon being a matter of ſuch high concernment, firſt becauſe you make that a cauſe of your jollity and merriment, which ſhould be a cauſe of your griefe and godly ſorrow, for you take delight in the 
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:151749:32"/>
enmitie and cruelty of the creatures, which was laid upon them for the ſinne of man, for the earth was accurſed with thorns and briers for our ſins, and therefore the blood-ſhedding of the creatures ſhould rather teach us to ſhed teares for our ſins:
thus did Saint <hi>Peter</hi> when he heard the Cock crow he went out and wept bitterly: I would to God you Cock-maſters would make that uſe of theſe Cocks.
Secondly it is dangerous unto your ſoul in regard of the time that you miſpend, for if ye muſt give an account of every idle word that we ſpeak <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 36. How much more of idle houres and dayes, and if you did keep as ſtrickt an account as you do of your houſhold expences you ſhould at the weekes end ſee what a heavy reckoning you ſhould make when you ſhall ſee before your eyes thus many houres of ſuch a day and ſo many daies of ſuch a week, I have ſpent in my vain delights, and thus few houres in the ſervice of my God; well, howſoever we are loath to come to this account now, yet we ſhall be one day, brought to it whether we will or no. Thirdly it is dangerous to your ſoul in regard of the company with whom you do converſe who for the moſt part are either ſwearers drunkards, or licencious people, now if it be moſt true that the prophet ſaith <hi>Pſal. 18. 25. With the holy, thou ſhalt be holy, and with a perfect man thou ſhalt be perfect.</hi> Then on the contrary it muſt needs be, that with the wicked we ſhall learn wickedneſſe, and with the prophane we ſhall learn prophanes, for it is a hard matter to handle pitch and not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field with it, or to lie among thornes and not be pricked with them, as the Prophet ſaith 
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:151749:33"/>
2. <hi>Sam. 23. 6, 7. But the wicked ſhall be every one as thornes thruſt away becauſe they cannot be taken with hands, but the man that ſhall touch them muſt be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with iron, or with the ſhaft of a ſpeare, and they ſhall be burnt with fire in the ſame place.</hi> Therefor dear bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if you did rightly conſider of the hatefull and infectious qualitie of the wicked, it will make you ſtand upon thorns while you are in their company and to bewaile the hardneſſe of your heart which hath not felt them ſuch pricking thornes all this while.</p>
               <p>Laſtly it is dangerous to your ſoule in making your ſoul guilty of many other mens ſinnes, by drawing away many a poore man from his honeſt labour whereby he ſhould maintaine his wife and children, to ſpend his time and money in ſuch an idle manner, but alſo you are guilty of many great mens ſins whileſt you ſee and hear the glorious Name of God diſhonoured, and dare not, or will not reprove for the ſame, conſider what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith. 50. 16. <hi>But unto the wicked ſaid God, what hast thou to do to declare mine ordinances, that thou ſhouldeſt take my covenant in thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt to be reformed, and haſt caſt my words behinde thee? For when thou ſeeſt a thiefe, thou runneſt with him, and thou art partakers with the adulterers. verſ. 22. O conſider ye that forget God, least I teare you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you.</hi> Now therefore I beſeech you obſerve that thoſe that run with the wicked and are partakers with the ungodly in their wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are thoſe whom the Lord ſhall tear in pieces:
thus you ſee that not onely the wicked themſelves, but alſo their aſſociates and partakers ſhall be torne 
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:151749:33"/>
in pieces in the day of Gods fearfull wrath: O con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, ſweet meat muſt have ſower ſawce, and then I truſt through the Lords great mercy you will utterly refuſe it upon thoſe tearmes: for what were it to gaine the whole world and to looſe our ſoules.</p>
               <p>But to conclude if neither perſwaſions nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations may prevaile with you to break the neck of your Cock-fighting pleaſures, conſider wel with your ſelf that the Lord hath put you as it were into the Cock-pit of the round world to fight his battel againſt the fleſh, the world and the divel, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtriking, the ſoreſt hitting, and the cunningeſt fighting Cock in the world, who is onely to be wounded with the ſpurres of faith and piety, and that all thoſe that wil overcome in this battell muſt be thorowly fed with the word of God, and dayly breath with prayer and, meditation, whereby they ſtrengthen their faith, and ſharpen the ſpurres of their holy zeale: and thoſe that neglect this meanes let them brag never ſo much upon their own dunghill, yet when it comes to a ſound tryall they will prove themſelves to be brand fallen Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and likewiſe conſider that every houre idely ſpent, and every vaine word that proceeds out of your mouth is as it were vain to your ſoule: and all unlawfull pleaſures like hovells upon the ſpurres of your devotion: and then with wiſdom conſider what an unlikely, or rather impoſſible a thing it is for a poor famiſht Cock pitifully vained and thus hung and hovelled to overcome a Cock of that wonderfull ſtrength and deviliſh ſpirit that you are matched withall. Again ſuppoſe that thoſe that ſit 
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:151749:34"/>
in the lower ring of the Cock-pit are the Divells and wicked Spirits, and thoſe that ſit in the upper ring of the Cock-pit are the glorious Angels and bleſſed Saints, both behoulding this doubtfull bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, though with contrary affections, the angels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing when they ſee you fight this ſpirituall bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell like a good ſouldier of Jeſus Chriſt, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirits wohping and hallowing when they ſee you ſtrike faint, fight like a Craven, and fall beaſtly, and hear dear brother that we make our ſelves a laughing ſtock to this wicked ſpirits: let us pray unto our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to ſtrengthen our faith and to aſſiſt us with his grace that we may reſiſt the devill and make him flie from us and in the end tread Sathan underfoot and give us a crown of immortall glorie.

               <p>Firſt therefore let that bleſſed Lord be humbly fought unto by faſting and prayer.</p>
               <p>Secondly let the diſtreſſed gentleman be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from his own houſe unto ſome other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place well ſituate for aire, and ſpacious fields: to walk in and to do other exerciſes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſettle with him a religious diſcreet Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine that may conſtantly pray with him and read unto him evening and morning, and upon all good occaſions to keep him company.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, place about him ſix honeſt ſervants men of good diſcretion and reſolution that may be ready upon all occaſions to aid and aſſiſt in the well ordering of him according to the dirrections of him that ſhall undertake the government of him, to watch with him, to ride with him, and to exerciſe with him in ſhooting or bowling or any other exerciſe that ſhall be thought fit for him.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, let them be very carefull and take heed that there be no knives, nor ſwords, nor any woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding inſtruments left in the roomes wherein he comes, nor worn by others, that he may ſuddenly ſnatch at them for their temptations are many times very violent and their reſolution ſudden and diſperate.</p>
               <p>Sixtly let his apparell be decent and comely of cloth or plaine ſtuffe without lace or any ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

               <p>Eightly, let him be held conſtantly to prayer, and reading an houre in the morning and an hour in the evening, and if the weather be fitting and his ſtrength anſwerable let him walke a mile out right in the morning and evening and if you finde him inclining to a ſottiſh humer put an armour upon him and beat a drum before him and let one attyre himſelfe like a Captaine and put on his gorget and a plume of feathers in his hat &amp; a trunchion in his hand and make to march and exerciſe his armes, or elſe ſet him upon a bounding horſe and trot the ring and run a career: and in theſe martiall exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes let the Captaine command him as his ſouldier, and if he finds him peeviſh and froward give him a good knock upon his helmet, and if he finde him willing and tractable then to commend and praiſe him.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, becauſe theſe maladies and diſtempers are accompanied with a great deale of peeviſh croſſeneſſe, and wilfull obſtinacie, and a great part of the cure ſtands in the right croſſing of them from thoſe froward and furious humours, which will require great patience, and good ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; for the generall, uſe all faire meanes you can deviſe to gain them to the good, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them from the ill: but if that will not prevail, you muſt have patience and paſſe it over as though you took no notice of it; but if it comes once to this, that they do perceive that you go about to croſſe them, and that you are in oppoſition and conteſting with them, then you muſt follow it with all importunity, and reſolvtion to ſubdue them, and compell them to do it; but be ſure you take them with ſuch advantages that you prevail, otherwiſe the attempting of it will prove dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to your ſelfe, and make them more outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and inſolent.</p>

               <head>A Copie of a Letter to a vertuous Gentlewoman greatly afflicted in minde, which it pleaſed God to give unto her great comfort.</head>
               <p>BLeſſed be God even the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, which comforteth us in all our tribulations, that we might be able to comfort them that are in any affliction by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort where with wee our ſelves are are comforted of God: and humbly I beſeech that gratious Lord that he will vouchſafe for his deare ſonne Ieſus Chriſt his ſake to open your eyes that you may behold thoſe unſpeakeable mercies and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that he will in his appointed time give unto all thoſe that do fear his holy name and call upon him faithfully. Coſen I have lately receaved, your letter wherein you doe acknowledge that when I was with you it pleaſed God you found ſome comfort, praiſed be his holy name for it, but ſince you have been very ill and ſo remaine, ſome cauſes you ſhew for the ſame, becauſe you cannot be aſſured of the favour of God towards you, the reaſons that you alledge, becauſe you finde ſo ſmall comfort in prayer and in hearing of the word. Secondly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:151749:37"/>
of your fearful temptations both paſt and ſtill continuing: theſe as I take it are your chief reaſons, &amp; being rightly underſtood they wil prove ſo many ſound arguments, to prove that you never had ſo good cauſe to reſt aſſured of Gods favour towards you, nor ever had ſo many teſtimonies of his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting mercyes towards you as you have now, that afflictions, chaſtiſements and temptations are the ſignes of Gods favour, and the markes of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I pray conſider what the holy Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Hebrews</hi> the 12. the 5. the 6. my ſon deſpiſe not the chaſtening of the Lord neither faint when thou art rebuked of him, for whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and he ſcourgeth every ſon that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth:
and mark how he concludes in the eight verſe, if therefore ye be without correction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all are partakers, then are ye baſtards and not ſonnes, is it not ſtrange that you ſhould vex and torment your ſelf, becauſe the divell cannot prove you a baſtard, but it may be you may ſay it is not thus in your iudgement, but then know that it is not fit for you to be a Judge in you own cauſe, but ſubmit your ſelfe unto the Judgement of Gods word, which is the word of truth. And beleeve his holy Apoſtles that knew how to iudge in thoſe caſes better then you, and they will teſtifie that we have cauſe rather to reioyce then any wiſe to be diſcouraged with afflictions and temptations: Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 2 My brethren count it exceeding ioy when ye fall into temptations, and the bleſſed Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he was tempted and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly buffeted by Sathan, for the which thing he beſought the Lord thrice that it might depart from 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:151749:37"/>
him, but what was he preſently releaſed? no but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved this anſwere from the Lord, and he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me my grace is ſufficient for thee, for my power is made perfect through weakneſſe, and what was the bleſſed man diſmayed with this anſwer or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded as you would do that he was out of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God becauſe his prayer was not granted?
no ſuch matter but rather doth conclude greater comfort and aſſurance, very gladly therefore ſaith he, will I rejoyce in my infirmities that the power of Chriſt may dwell in me therefore I take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in anguiſh for Chriſt ſake, for when I am weake then am I ſtrong, thus you may ſee how the Apoſtle out of <hi>Daniel</hi> gathereth matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and out of his own weaknes encreaſeth great ſtrength of faith, and thus muſt you do in theſe fearfull temptations not ſo much as caſt your eyes upon your own weakneſſe, nor upon the ſtrength and power of your malitious enemy, but you muſt looke up with the eye of faith unto our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Ieſus Chriſt who is in the higheſt heavens, and whoſe grace is ſufficient for us, and he it is who hath triumphed over ſin, death and damnation, and hath tramped underfoot all the enemyes of our ſalvation: and therfore with the holy Prophet ſay, The Lord is my light and my ſalvation, whom then ſhall I fear? the Lord is the ſtrength of my life, of whom then ſhall I be afraid?</p>
               <p>Now concerning your diſcomfort in hearing the word, becauſe you take ſo ſmall comfort in the promiſes, and are ſo much terrified with the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, This I take it proceeds partly from the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour 
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:151749:38"/>
of your judgment in miſſe-aplying the ſame, and partly from the malice of Sathan who ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more labours to drive us into extremities either with <hi>Eve</hi> not to fear the iudgements of God at all, or elſe with <hi>Cain</hi> to thinke our puniſhment greater then we can beare, but even from your weakneſſe, and from Sathans malice doth the Lord draw out that which may tend to his glory, and to your great comfort, and hereby I truſt he hath broken up the fallow grounds of your heart and brought you to godly ſorrow for your ſins ſo that I do aſſure my ſelfe, within this ſhort time of your afflictions; more repentant teares have been put up into the Lords bottle then in many yeers before, &amp; account not this as a ſmall bleſſing nor paſſe it over with a ſlight thankfulneſſe, but take ſpeciall notice of it, aſſure your ſelfe, this faire will not laſt all the yeer, and the time will come when you will deſire to ſee theſe teares of contrition and ſhall not ſee them, no though you ſeek them with faſting and prayer, and that you may the better conceave how bleſſed their eſtate is that have a contrite heart and ſorrowfull ſpirit, I pray conſider of that wonderfull comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able promiſe of the Lord, <hi>Iſaiah. 57. 15. For thus ſaith he that is high and excellent, that inhabiteth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whoſe name is the holy one, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit to revive the ſpirit of the humble and to give life unto them that are of a contrite heart,</hi> who would think themſelves moſt happy that had a heart fit to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that glorious gueſt, thus likewiſe doth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prophet teſtifie <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 13. The Lord is near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that are of a contrite heart and will ſave 
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:151749:38"/>
ſuch as are afflicted in ſpirit and our bleſſed Saviour in whoſe mouth was no guile, he ſaith bleſſed are they that mourn for they ſhall be comforted, and in the 16 of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> verſe the 20 <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you ye ſhall weepe and lament, and the world ſhall reioyce, and ye ſhall ſorrow, but your ſorrow ſhall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ioy, a woman when ſhe travelleth hath ſorrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her hower is come, but aſſoone as ſhe is delivered of the childe ſhe remembreth no more the anguiſh for ioy a man is borne into the world, and you now therefore are in ſorrow, but I will ſee you again and your heart ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and your ioy, ſhall no man take from you.</hi> Thus you may ſee this godly ſorrow, is but as the throes of our ſpirituall birth in Chriſt, which although it may be ſomewhat grievous for a time yet when we ſee our ſelves thereby borne againe of water, and the ſpirit, and ſo made able to enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, oh how ioyfull and comfortable ſhould this make us to be, many would with <hi>Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> ſons ſit one at the right hand, the other at the left hand of our Saviour Chriſt in his kingdome, but they are loth to taſt of this cup, but let us know aſſuredly that as he is entred into his Kingdome of glory, through many tribulations, ſo muſt we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him thorow many tribulations if ever we will come there; you are now in the way be not weary of well doing, nor turn not backe till you come to that holy reſting place, and that you may finiſh your courſe with ioy and comfort, be diligent in prayer, and obſerve a conſtant courſe therein even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and morning and at noone dayes, and as often as you finde your affliction to preſſe and oppreſſe your ſoule, then make your mone unto your merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full 
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:151749:39"/>
God and powre out your ſoules before him, and eſpecially bewaile wicked thoughts and vaine luſts where withall you heretofore ſo mnch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted your ſelfe, and labour to mourn in ſecret for them, and likewiſe all other ſecret ſins, and that your prayers may be more fervent, adde thereunto the holy uſe of moderate faſting, and this I truſt through the Lords mercy, you ſhall finde an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meanes to recover your ſelfe unto your ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall chearfulneſſe again, and be not diſcouraged from theſe holy exerciſes though Sathan ſtrive ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſomuch to vex and terrifie you: nay though you feare the Lord is angry with you, nay though you knew that aſſuredly, yet pray with the <hi>Pſaſmiſt.
Pſal. 80. 5. O Lord God of hoſts how long wilt thou be angry againſt the prayer of thy people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly having in this holy manner recomend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your ſoule and body unto God in prayer waite upon him with a quiet minde, aſſuring your ſelfe that now the Lord is to take care of you and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore caſt your care upon him, and ſo with a ſetled reſolution diſpoſe of your ſelfe unto ſome profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table imployments fitting for your calling, and this courſe the Prophet <hi>David</hi> tooke <hi>Pſal.</hi> the 5. 3.
<hi>Heare my voyce in the morning, O Lord, for in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wil I direct me unto thee, and I will wait:</hi> and what good ſucceſſe thoſe have that do thus attend, we may read in the <hi>Pſalm. 147. 11. But the Lord delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in them that fear him and attend upon his mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly labour for meekneſſe of heart and an humble ſpirit, for where this grace is in ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable manner attayned there the heart of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth breake away apace, and the danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of 
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:151749:39"/>
of is little to be feared, for our bleſſed Saviour hath pronounced a double bleſſedneſſe unto ſuch <hi>Matthew</hi> the 5. <hi>Bleſſed are the poore in ſpirit for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven, bleſſed are the meeke for they ſhall inherit the earth.</hi> And the want thereof hath dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven many in their deſperate fury, to looſe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance both in heaven and earth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly take heed of moderate greife, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſions, which at this time is very unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, though eaſily fallen into; and therefore watch over your own heart diligently and doe not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſo much as a ſorrowfull ſigh into your heart except it be for your ſin, nor an impatient word into your lippes except it be when you ſee God diſhonoured, and then ſpeake zealouſly and ſpare not: and furthermore you muſt be contented to be admoniſhed of theſe infirmities by your Chriſtian friends with whom you do converſe, for it may be they may diſcerne theſe things amiſſe in you when you doe not diſcerne it in your ſelfe being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with the pleaſing humour of Sottiſh melancholy.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that you may well remember it, you muſt by all meanes poſſible ſtrive to ſerve the Lord with a cheerfull heart and a willing minde, for the Lord loveth a chearfull giver, and eſpecially in matters of his holy worſhip: therefore when you come to hear his holy word, to faſt, to pray, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious conference or any other holy duty, ſtrive to doe it chearefully, and to reioyce even in your very teares, for I can tell you that is a good cauſe to make both you and others reioyce it; may be you thinke it ſtrange, but read what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to 
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:151749:40"/>
his intirely beloved <hi>Timothcus</hi> and then I hope you will ſay I am in the right, deſiring to ſee thee mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of thy teares that I might be filled with ioy.
2. of <hi>Timothy</hi> the 1. 6. And for neglect of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the Lord doth threaten many heavy Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the children of Iſrael, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 47.
<hi>Becauſe thou ſerveſt not thy Lord thy God with ioyfulneſſe and a good heart for the abundance of all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſhalt ſerve thine enemies which the Lord ſhall ſend uppon thee, in hunger, and in thirſt, and in nakednes, and in need of all things.</hi> And thus according to my ſimple underſtanding I have ſatisfied your requeſt in ſetting down ſome directions humbly beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that mighty and glorious God who giveth wiſdome to the ſimple, and worketh great effects by weak meanes to give ſuch a bleſſing unto my poor endeavours that his great power may be ſeen in my weakneſſe, that you may finde ſuch comfort to your ſoule, and ſuch peace to your conſcience, that hereafter you may tell unto others the great mercies that the Lord hath ſhewed unto you in the dayes of your afliction; and therefore ſay with the Prophet, loe this is our God we have waited for him and he will ſave us, this is the Lord we have waited for him we will rejoyce and be joyfull in his ſalvation.

of her love: after ſhe was able to doe ſome buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe I ſent to her father to fetch her home, he was glad when he heard ſhe was living, for they did thinke ſhe had been drowned in the great floods; when her father came we had been at prayers, and I was reading a chapter: when her father came in the young woman looked upon him very earneſtly, but would neither ſpeak nor do any reverence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, I uſed many perſwaſions to her, but could not prevaile, I ſent out her father into another roome, but it would not be: then I called for pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers and opened her mouth, and dealt very roughly with her, as though I would have plucked out her teeth, but it would not be: then I took a Bible and bad her read the firſt commandment, and then ſhe fell a reading and into a paſſion of weeping, and afterward ſpake to her father, her father intreated me that ſhe might ſtay with me a while longer, and ſo ſhe did, and returned to her father, and ſo went up to London where ſhe had two Vncles rich men.</p>

ſhe was almoſt at her wits end, and her hands and her face ſo ſwelled that they gliſterd, it pleaſed God within few dayes to ſend her comfort and ſhe returned to her maſter, and I never heard that ſhe was terrified with the cat ſince.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Charitie</hi> of the ſame Towne fell into great terror of minde, her huſband brought her over to my houſe and made great moan for her, I enquired if ſhe was not fierce and dangerous, he tould me no; but only trouble of minde: I lodged her that night with one of me ſervauts, in the night ſhe fell into a fit, and ſet upon the maide, and almoſt bit of one of her fingers; the next day I ſent her to <hi>Saint Needes</hi> with a ſervant of mine called godly <hi>Iohn,</hi> a ſtrong man, who went with her to <hi>Saint Needes</hi> to have her let blood; but as they returned ſhe leapt into a pond, and godly <hi>Iohn</hi> had much a a do to get her out; but it pleaſed God ſhe grew well and came to Lady <hi>Luke</hi> to give her thankes: my Lady <hi>Luke</hi> had entreated my care of mad <hi>Bell</hi> that came from London, but I tould my Lady, that we had been with <hi>Charitie.</hi>

               <p>A great Lady falling into great melancholie, and diſtracted, and having attempted divers waies to make her ſelfe away, the devill did put one ſtrange temptation upon her, as they related to me: ſhe had cauſed her maid that did attend upon her to bring up good ſtore of wood, and laid it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her bed, and watched a time when her maid was gone down, and locked the doore, and made a great fire, and then unclothed her to her naked

body, and kneeled down neere the flame, and was very earneſt in her devotions; the fire being great, made a great ſmoke, which ſome perceiving, came to the doore, and brake it open, and demanded what ſhe meant to do with her ſelfe; ſhe anſwered ſhe made triall of her ſelfe how ſhe could indure the flames of fire if perſecution ſhould come for the profeſſion of the Goſpel: her husband left her with me ſome moneth, and then it pleaſed God ſhe went away much amended, and comforted.
A temptation accompanied with a zeale for the Goſpel is hardly to be reſiſted. The Virgins in the Primitive Church, rather then they would be diſhonoured and deflowred by the heathen, would murder themſelves; it was their ſin, though a zeal, but not according to knowledge.</p>

my brother that if his ſickneſſe grew upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion he would be mad, I would have made him a bath of milke and plunged him in it over head and eares and let it run in at his mouth at his noſe and his eares, and in this deſperate caſe put it to that adventure, for otherwiſe there was no hope:
but they had ſent that morning to a skilfull man, to adviſe with, and was loath to make triall of it till they heard from him, and I was loath to preſſe it in ſuch a deſperat caſe; ſo in the afternoone I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home: but my brother told me that night he fell into a great rage and madneſſe, and in his fits barked like a mad dog: but ſome houre or two before he dyed, it pleaſd God to reſtore him to his ſences againe, and he ſpake very religiouſly, and prayed earneſtly unto God to pardon his ſins, ſo departed. Now to give ſome directionsin ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous caſes: firſt, pray unto the God of heaven to bleſſe the meanes, and if the party ſo bitten with a mad dog be near the Sea let them with all ſpeed throw him into the Sea water and plung him over head and eares and waſh the wounds thorowly with the Sea water, if that cannot be had, then take the liver of the mad dog and make poridg of it and let them eat the liver and the broath as long as it laſteth, and take the hair of the mad dog and make tents of it and put it into the holes that the mad dogs teeth made, and this I ſaw in experience by one <hi>Richard Haines,</hi> a tall young man, purſued a mad dog a maſtie neer the place where I dwell, and ſtanding at the gap the mad dog would come thorow, claſped him in his armes, intending to hold him tell his fellows came, but the dog bit him

very grievouſly in his ſide and about his belly: they gat the mad dogs liver, and made poridge and ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed the wounds with the hair and ſo through Gods bleſſing the mad man did very well: Crabs clawes, and lobſters claws beaten to pouder and put into butter-milk or drinke is very good.</p>

To omit the parts containing, thoſe which be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained are, humours, and ſpirits.

               <p>Blood is a humour hot, yet temperate, ſweet and red, prepared in the meſeraick veines, made in the liver of the temperate fat, and aieriall parts of the Chylus and flowes from hence to all parts of the body. Phyloſophers affirme that we are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with his humour only, Phiſicians ſay with all four. The ſeeming contrariety may be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the diſtinguiſhing: thus blood is often taken for the whole maſſe conteined in the veines ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to nouriſh the body now this maſſe is not <hi>homogenerall,</hi> but of a diverſe nature. For the beſt and moſt temperate part of the blood is properly and in ſpecie called blood, the hot and dry part of it is called colerick blood, the cold and moiſt part phlegmatick blood, the cold and dry, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick blood, &amp; this diverſity is anſwerable to the qualities of the Chylus whereof it is made, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Phyloſophers ſay we are nouriſhed with blood alone they underſtand the whole maſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the veines, which neither <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> nor any other Phyloſopher will deny to have parts of the foreſaid qualities: theſe parts of the blood thus qualified, muſt not be taken for excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, but for alimentary humours, ſince they all nouriſh the body: here two things are queſtioned, firſt whether there be any pure blood in the veins without the 3. humors 2. Whether the blood be only a mixrure of the third ſincere humors, ſo that 
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:151749:51"/>

It may be called imperfect blood: for by further concoction it becometh reall blood therefore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath appointed no veſſell to receive it: intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it for alteration not evacuation, this is the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary phlegm, that is the Phlegmatick blood That which is preternatnrall (as are all the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindes) is avacuated with other excrements ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no peculiar receptacle, here note, that the filth of the noſe is not phlegm properly, but the private excrement of the braine, yet I deny not but that if the body be full of phlegmatick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours part of them may paſſe this way, of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturall phlegm be four kindes: the firſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Niſipid, not abſolutely as the Alimentary, but 
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:151749:51"/>
in reſpect of the other three kindes which follow.
This onely is properly termed a crude humour: tis true, every concoction may have its crudity, but this concoction which attaines not its full perfection in the ſtomack, by way of eminence is called crude, and that body which aboundeth herewith is of the colour of lead, ſuch an humour alſo appears 1 in the ſediment of ſome urines, 2. Acid, (taſting like vineger) which remaine thus for want of naturall heat and is cauſed by cold and moiſt diet eſpecially if liberall, large and out of due time: as alſo by the conſtitutions which is colder in old men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men then others, by a cold liver, cold aire, to much ſleep and the want of the ordinary evacuation thereof, thirdly Salt, <hi>Avian</hi> thinks phegm becomes ſalt by aduſtion of bitter humours, as we finde after combuſtion the fixed ſalt of any plant as worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood &amp;c. <hi>Galen</hi> ſayes tis either from putrefaction or from the mixture of a ſalt whaylike humour, neither do oppoſe other if rightly underſtood, for doubtleſſe the true cauſe is a ſalt whaylike moyſture which is nothing but the ſuperfluous ſalt of thoſe things which we eat and drink; do we not finde tartar in wine casks? and is not ſuch a ſubſtance found in the earth wherewith plants are nouriſhed?
do we not uſe ſalt with many meates? that then hereof, which nature cannot convert to nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the matter of this preternaturall humour, which is therefore hot becauſe ſalt. Fourthly glaſſe this bifference is not taken from the taſte as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but from the colour and conſiſtence, it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents melted or liquid glaſſe: this is the coldeſt of theſe kindes yet not exactly cold, for then it ſhould

               <p>Choler, Alimentary is the hot and dry part of the blood and fit to nouriſh, called colerik blood, becauſe blood thus qualified will eaſily degenerate unto choler. Secondly, Naturall this an excrement of the ſecond concoction, hot dry bitter and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſeparated from the blood in the liver, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed to the gall, hence it diſtills upon the firſt gut adhearing to the ſtomack, and by its acrimony excits the ſlow expulſive faculty of the guts to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, this is that which we meane when we ſay choler, <hi>viz.</hi> Yellow not black choler, this in cold bodyes is ſomewhat pale: in hot bodies ſomewhat red. Thirdly preternaturall which is not made after the law of nature: of this be foure kinds, firſt is in conſiſtence and colour like the yolk of a raw egge, this is hotter and thicker made of choler aduſt, ſo <hi>Galen.</hi> Second reſembles the juce of leeks, ſuch are infants ſtools: for milk in them is ſoon corrupted, garlick and onions cauſe it in others, third is of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour like verdigreaſe; here the heate is more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fourth reſembles the colour which the herb Woad maketh, and is made by a further aduſtion.
The materiall cauſe is hot and dry diet, ſweet, and fat meats. The efficient cauſe hot and dry conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the body, aire, and age which is youth watching, hunger, anger, vehement exerciſe, and laſtly the ſuppreſſiou of naturall evacuation.</p>

and valour, who for the good ſervice that he hath done to his Prince and countrey with the loſſe of his blood and the danger of his life, in ſo many brave adventures in the warres, both in <hi>Spaine</hi> and in the Low-countrys, and againſt the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> may juſtly challenge a great deale of love and reſpect, not onely from us his native country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but alſo from this Nation, and the whole Kingdome; and therefore to receive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſe, and diſregard from you in this place, whither he is retired in his old age, to doe good and to end his dayes in peace like a good Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Ieſus Chriſt; I ſay to receive unkindneſſe and diſregard from you, muſt needs be a great diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and no ſmall provocation to a well reſtrained mind, and therefore to qualifie diſcontentments of this quality, it is no eaſie matter; For the word of God doth teach us, that the diſcord of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are like the barrs of the gate of a City, ſtrong and hard, for fleſh and blood to beate through, and ſo I finde in ſearching into theſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes, that there are to many barrs that will keep out theſe happy gueſts of vnity, and amity, which I ſo much deſire to bring in amongſt you; and therefore doe beſeech the great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that is the God of peace and lover of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that he would vouchſafe to breake in ſunder theſe Iron barrs of revenge, and hard conceit, and frame your hearts to meekeneſſe, and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the word of exhortation with patience, for Sir <hi>Iarret Harvie</hi> as a Souldier, and ſtanding upon the point of honour, cannot paſſe by ſuch wrongs &amp; oppoſitions as it may be (as he conceives) hath

            <p>But if it pleaſe Sir <hi>Iarret Harvie</hi> to lay aſide the reſolution of a man of warre, and to take unto him the diſpoſition of a Chriſtian Souldier, and to follow the direction of that bleſſed Lord, and great commander under whoſe banner we have vowed manfully to fight, that is to learne of our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>to be meeke and lowly, love our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to pray for them that perſecute us.</hi>
