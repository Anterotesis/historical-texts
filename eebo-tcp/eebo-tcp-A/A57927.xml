            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Aturday <hi>Febr.</hi> 14. the army marched from <hi>Crediton</hi> and the Quarters thereabout to <hi>Chimleigh,</hi> being ten miles, the day very rainy, and the way very deep; Sunday they marched very early to a Rendezvouz some two miles in the way to <hi>Torrington,</hi> with intention to have gone on; but our parties of our Horse bringing in some Prisoners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by whose Examinations we could not certainly learn which way the Enemy bent, the certain knowledge whereof would mightily advantage us, by taking the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of that side of the River on which they marched; whereupon another party was sent out of Col: <hi>Butlers</hi> Troop, the Forlorn of which party being twelve, took twelve of the Lord <hi>Gorings</hi> Life-guard, and twenty four Horse, and brought them to the General; upon their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination it appears, the Enemy was ignorant of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; That they were drawn to no Rendezvouz; That the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> was in <hi>Torrington.</hi> Presently after there came a Spye from <hi>Torrington,</hi> who informed that that morning he left the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> there, That they heard a kinde of an Alarm, but no certain Intelligence of our Motion. And being informed that a party of the Enemies Horse was at <hi>Burrington,</hi> the General sent a party of Horse to meet with them, who accordingly charged the Enemy, put them to a Rout, shot Lieut. Colonel <hi>Dundash</hi> through the body, and took several prisoners, and brought <hi>Dundash</hi> three miles on the way, but being mortally wounded, as himself
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41763:3"/>
conceived, was inforced to leave him at <hi>Ringash,</hi> a Foot quarter of ours. This is the same <hi>Dundash</hi> that ran to the Enemy when the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s army lay about <hi>Tame</hi>: This Lieut. Colonel commanded the Lord of <hi>Clevelands</hi> Brigade; the party of Horse that charged <hi>Dundash,</hi> was commanded by Captain <hi>Barry</hi> of Rutlandshire, who lost never a man; but only his Brother run through the arm, and one Mr. <hi>Needler</hi> of Captain <hi>Knights</hi> troop shot in the arm; we sent another party of horse towards the East, who likewise met with their horse, and took three prisoners and some horse, and shot Major <hi>Bret,</hi> who being well mounted escaped, those Forces confesse that <hi>Hopton</hi> was ignorant of our motion; by this time the Bridge was made up some two miles off Chimleigh, the which the Enemy had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, so that our army might with convenience march over: But the day being so far spent, it was not held fit to march the whole army, so three Regiments of horse, and three of foot marched some four milss towards the enemy; that night the rest returned ro <hi>Chimleigh</hi> with orders to march; by break of day we did think the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral alarms given them this day had so affrighted them, that their Resolutions would have been taken before morning, whether to go East or West, the certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof, was the thing we much desired, and would guide us the better to pursue our designes. Munday <hi>Febr.</hi> 16. the General with that party of the Army that was at <hi>Chimleigh,</hi> marched up to the rest of the Army to <hi>Ringash,</hi> and had there a Rendezvouz; and afterwards, upon the Moor within five miles of <hi>Torrington</hi> bad a general Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz both of horse and foot, drew them up in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia, and so marched up towards the enemy. When we came within two miles of <hi>Torrington,</hi> our Forlorn hope of horse charged theirs, and put them to a retreat; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they came on again with a very strong party, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41763:3"/>
put ours to a stand; the reserves of our Forlorn being come up, and some foot, forced them to their Body again. When we came neer <hi>Squire Rolls</hi> his house, we had Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence that there was a party of 200 Firelocks and Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers left to defend that place; therefore the Army made an halt half a mile in the Eastside thereof, till the Foot came up; which the enemy perceiving, as they might easily do, by reason of the Hills and clearnesse of the day, quit the house, and drew their Forces to <hi>Torrington</hi>: Our Forlorn of horse and foot advanced to <hi>Squire Rolls</hi> his house, half a mile further towards <hi>Torrington,</hi> there being several skirmishes in the narrow Lane, between the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn hope on both sides, and several prisoners taken on each; but most by our party. The enemy drew their foot out of the Town into the Closes about a quarter of a mile: our Forlorn hope of foot lined the hedges, and so faced each other for about two hours, within half a mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket shot, exchanging course Language and Bullets, now and then; after all, the Foot and Horse were come up, and drawn up in Mr. <hi>Rolls</hi> his Park: a party of 800 foot was sent to second the Forlorn. In case the enemy should endeavour to put any affront upon them also, a Regiment was immediately sent to assist them, who were no sooner come up to the rest, but it began to be dark, a Councel of War was called, what was fit to be done; whether to engage before day or not, for that it being dark, the enemy might lay Ambuscadoes, they knowing the ground better then we; whereupon the General, Lieutenant General, with the rest of the Colonels, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred a Resolution, and rid from Mr. <hi>Rolls</hi> his house up to the Forlorn hope, to see in what posture our forces were set, and by prisoners to know what the Enemy intended while they were there. The Tattoo was heard to beat in the town, which assured us the Enemy still continued in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41763:4"/>
the town, not flying away as several Reports would have made us believe; but to be certain of the same, six Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooners were commanded to creep under a hedge near the Barracadoes, and to give fire, to see if they would answer; by which we might know whither they stood to defend the town. The Enemy received the charge, and answered it with a very sharp volley of shot. Our Forlorn hope seeing the Dragooners engaged, they gave fire; whereupon the Enemy gave fire all along the hedges and works, thereupon the Reserve to the Forlorn came on to Relieve them, and so being engaged, the whole army ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; and about eight at night the Battel begun some six fields from the town, and so we fought from hedge to hedge, until we beat them into their Barracadoes, which they maintained for an hour after very manfully, our men being often repulsed, yet at last got over the Barracadoes, and forced the Enemy into the town; whereupon the the Horse were let in, who scowring the streets, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Enemy, and a hot charge given by both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yet it pleased God at last we drave them out of the Barracadoes at the furthest end of the town, and by this time many prisoners were taken, and put into the Church: but far more escaped, being dark, over the hedges and by-wayes, which was not possible for us to prevent, throwing down their Arms, and every man flying several wayes for life: our forces were no sooner possest of the town, but the enemies Magazine which they left in the Church was fired; whether on purpose by the enemy, or by accident, we cannot yet learn: but it proved a terrible blow, not onely blowing up the Church with all the Wood and Lead that was upon it, deforming many houses in the Town, but killed some of the prisoners in the Church, and some of our men that were in the Church yard; two great Webbs of Lead fell within twice a horse length
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41763:4"/>
of the General; but it pleased God he escaped, though in imminent danger; many others being hurt, both with the Timber, Stones and Lead, most of the Town was shaken by this blow, being the terriblest that hath been seen in the memory of man, there being neer eighty Barrels, of Powder blown up together, and one whole Barrel which were blown out of the Church into the street, which took not fire: The Enemy perceiving their Magazine to be thus fired, gave one Charge more with their horse up to our Barracadoes, commanded by Sir <hi>Iohn Digby,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> but our Muskettiers gave fire; whereupon they took their farewel. Our horse instantly advanced through the Town after them, and begun the pursuite about eleven at night; and I hope will give a good accompt of the businesse. Thus it hath pleased God in an instant to scatter those Forces of the Lord <hi>Hoptons,</hi> his Infantry being taken, slain, and totally routed, his Horse, many taken and dispersed, and the rest gone in great disorder toward Cornwal, as we hear, where shortly I hope we shall meet with the remnant left of that Crew, and put an end to the field Enemy in the West of <hi>England,</hi> they confest they had eight Regiments of Horse, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of two thousand five hundred men; some other of that their Officers that are prisoners say Three thousand; be they more or lesse, they are very resolute men, fought va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly; and after they were chased from hedge to hedge, defended their Barracadoes and works at push of Pike, and with the But-end of their Muskets, till our foot got over a hedge, flanckt them, that they were forced to quit it: They were old Cornish foot, and all <hi>Greenviles</hi> and <hi>Gorings</hi> old Souldiers, English and Irish, were engaged in this Service, but now are scattered, threw down their Arms, and fled for their lives. We have abundance of men wounded, Officers and Souldiers more then hath
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41763:5"/>
been at any storm since the Army came forth: For indeed every hedge was it were a Bulwark to the Enemy; so strong are the hedges in these parts; but few slain, we kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many of the enemy, both horse and foot. The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of this businesse you will have more fully hereafter; let the glory be given unto God, I am Sir</p>
